40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the incidence of patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction on ice water testing as well as the presence of correlations with <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> test results and their diagnosis.

40|$|The head-shaking {{nystagmus}} (HSN) {{test has}} been reported to be a sensitive screening test for the presence of peripheral and central vestibular system disease. Previous investigations have utilized few subjects who were drawn from well-defined patient populations. The purpose of the present investigation was twofold: first, to determine the prevalence of HSN in a large unselected population of dizzy pa-tients seen in an otology and neurotology practice, and second, to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this evaluation in the detection of vestibular system abnormalities as reflected by results of electronystagmography and <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> testing. The results of the investigation have suggested that the HSN test has a 27 % sensitivity and an 85 % specificity. The HSN test yields an acceptable number of false positives (15 %) and an unacceptably large number of false negatives (73 %).

40|$|Sopite syndrome, {{characterized}} by loss of initiative, sensitivity to normally innocuous sensory stimuli, and impaired concentration amounting to a sensory gating deficit, is {{commonly associated with}} Space Motion Sickness (SMS). The amplitude of the P 50 potential {{is a measure of}} level of arousal, and a paired-stimulus paradigm can be used to measure sensory gating. We used the <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> to elicit the sensory mismatch that occurs with SMS by overstimulating the vestibular apparatus. The effects of rotation on the manifestation of the P 50 midlatency auditory evoked response were then assessed as a measure of arousal and distractibility. Results showed that rotation-induced motion sickness produced no change in the level of arousal but did produce a significant deficit in sensory gating, indicating that some of the attentional and cognitive deficits observed with SMS may be due to distractibility induced by decreased habituation to repetitive stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Background. Unilateral {{centrifugation}} {{testing is}} {{an assessment of}} unilateral utricular function in which the <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> is laterally translated so the axis of rotation is through one utricle. Outcome parameters are the Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) and ocular torsion. ^ Purpose. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine: (a) how two different methods of lateral translation affect SVV, ocular torsion, and symptoms of nausea in a normal population; (b) the physiologic output of the utricle by comparing magnitude differences in SVV and ocular torsion as the degree of centrifugal stimulation changes in a normal population; (c) the effects of age on SVV and ocular torsion in a normal population and; (d) utricular function in individuals with a significant caloric weakness. ^ Study sample. Thirty one normal controls and five individuals with unilateral vestibular hypofunction participated in the study. Normal participants were characterized by having normal hearing sensitivity, no history of neurologic or balance/dizziness involvement and negative results on a direct office vestibular examination. Unilateral vestibular hypofunction was defined as an asymmetry 3 ̆e 30...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vestibular {{function}} (specifically, horizontal {{semicircular canal}} function) {{can be assessed}} across a broad frequency range using several different techniques. The head impulse test is a qualitative test of horizontal semicircular canal function that can be completed at bedside. Recently, a new instrument (video head impulse test [vHIT]) has been developed to provide an objective assessment to the clinical test. Questions persist regarding how this test {{may be used in}} the overall vestibular test battery. Purpose: The purpose of this case report is to describe vestibular test results (vHIT, rotational testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and balance and gait performance) in an individual with a 100 % unilateral caloric weakness who was asymptomatic for dizziness, vertigo or imbalance. Data Collection and/or Analysis: Comprehensive assessment was completed to evaluate vestibular function. Caloric irrigations, <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> testing, vHIT, and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials were completed. Results: A 100 % left-sided unilateral caloric weakness was observed in an asymptomatic individual. vHIT produced normal gain with covert saccades. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the clinical usefulness of vHIT as a diagnostic tool and indicator of vestibular compensation and functional status...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} keep tabs on the {{position}} and motion of our body in space, nature has given us a fascinating and very ingenious organ, the inner ear. Each inner ear includes five biological sensors - three angular and two linear accelerometers - which provide the body with the ability to sense angular and linear motion of the head with respect to inertial space. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a mechanical model of the semicircular canals - which behave as angular accelerometers – in a specific kinematic environment. This model, implemented in Matlab/Simulink, simulates the <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> testing, which is one of the usual tests carried out during a diagnosis of the vestibular system. This model also allows to simulate several head rotations, and at the same time to show the state – excited or inhibited – of each angular sensors. Therefore, the developed model can be used as a learning and demonstrating tool either in the medicine field to understand the behavior of the sensors during any kind of motion or in the aeronautical field to relate the inner ear functioning to some sensory illusions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine whether {{there was a significant difference}} in the static, dynamic, and rotary balance of hearing and hearing impaired children. The subjects used were forty children from the Emerson Elementary School in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The forty children were composed of twenty hearing impaired children and twenty normal hearing children matched according to age and sex. After selecting the subjects, their level of balance ability was evaluated by testing each child individually in three balance areas to include: static balance-right, static balance-left; dynamic balance; and rotary balance right, rotary balance-left. The measuring devices used were the Linco 1 n-Oseretsky Motor Development Scale, balanciometer, and a <b>rotary</b> <b>chair.</b> To measure the differences, the mean for each of the five balance tests was computed. Through a correlated t-test, comparisons between groups on all test items were determined at. 05 level of significance. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient was applied to measure the difference with each group of the same balance test with age included. Results of the correlated t-test showed that there was a significant difference in the static, dynamic, and rotary balance test. The Pearson Product Moment Correlation showed significant correlation between dynamic balance and age, static balance-right and static balance-left, static balance-right and age, rotary balance-right and rotary balance-left...|$|E
40|$|Enlarged {{vestibular}} aqueduct (EVA) {{is one of}} {{the commonly}} identified congenital temporal bone abnormalities associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, and typically presents at birth or in early childhood. Vestibular symptoms have been reported in up to 50 % of affected individuals, and may be delayed in onset until adulthood. The details of nystagmus in patients with EVA have not been previously reported. The objectives were to describe the clinical history, vestibular test findings and nystagmus seen in a case series of patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct anomaly. Chart review, included computed tomography temporal bones, infrared nystagmography with positional and positioning testing, caloric testing, <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> and vibration testing. Clinical history and nystagmus varied among the five patients in this series. All patients were initially presumed to have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, but repositioning treatments were not effective, prompting referral, further testing and evaluation. In three patients with longstanding vestibular complaints, positional nystagmus was consistently present. One patient had distinct recurrent severe episodes of positional nystagmus. Nystagmus was unidirectional and horizontal. In one case horizontal nystagmus was consistently reproducible with seated head turn to the affected side, and reached 48 d/s. Nystagmus associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct is often positional, and can be confused with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Unexplained vestibular symptoms in patients with unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss should prompt diagnostic consideration of EVA...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Movement in the {{magnetic}} fields around MRI systems showed acute {{negative effects on}} concentration, memory, visuo-spatial orientation and postural body sway. A crucial role of the vestibular system has been hypothesised. We aimed to gain more insight whether subjects with a relatively (un) sensitive vestibular system performed differently on cognitive tasks when (moving) in a the static magnetic field of an MRI scanner. : In a double blind randomised cross over experiment 36 healthy volunteers underwent several cognitive tasks in 4 experimental sessions. Two were exposure conditions near a 7 Tesla (T) MRI system with personal exposure of 1. 0 T. In one of these conditions additional time-varying magnetic fields of 2. 4 T/s were induced by making standardised head movements. Of the two sham conditions (0 T) one was with and the other without such head movements. Vestibular sensitivity of each subject was assessed by the <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> test, the caloric reflex test and self-reported sensitivity to motion sickness. : Linear mixed models are currently in progress to test cognitive performance in a magnetic field for subjects with a low, normal and high sensitive vestibular organ. Preliminary results seem to suggest some differential cognitive effects of magnetic field exposure according to relative vestibular sensitivity. Further results will be presented at the conference. : These findings are important to better understand a possible working mechanism evoking these cognitive effects. Moreover, these finding can form {{a basis for the}} design of relevant protective and precautionary control measures for employees working close to an MRI system...|$|E
40|$|Lesions of the {{vestibular}} organ lead {{to complaints}} of unstable vision, dizziness and imbalance. Such lesions are also accompanied by abnormalities on vestibular function testing: specifically the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is altered, usually resulting in abnormal ENG caloric responses and abnormal results with <b>rotary</b> <b>chair</b> testing. Posturography measurements and measurements of static and dynamic balance functionally are often altered. The VOR is a vision-stabilizing reflex. In it, {{signals from the}} vestibular apparatus drive movements of the eyes to keep the visual world stable as the head moves. We know that small lesions of the vestibular apparatus lead {{to changes in the}} VOR. Specifically, the gain of the VOR (defined as the magnitude of the eye velocity output divided by the head velocity stimulus) may be altered. There is a neural mechanism that adapts to changes in VOR gain. Small defects in VOR gain, such as when a new spectacle prescription is worn are rapidly corrected. However, with large changes in VOR gain, such as when the vestibular apparatus input from one ear is surgically removed, the adaptive mechanism appears to fail. Such patients usually have chronically low VOR gains and persistent sensations of vertigo and imbalance. There are two theoretic possibilities: the lesion could have ablated the adaptive mechanism as the VOR was disrupted, or the adaptive mechanism may have been overwhelmed by the magnitude of the lesion. The latter appears to be the case. We have tested patients with persistently altered VOR gains and have found {{that it is possible to}} slightly alter these gai...|$|E

40|$|Sixty {{children}} (twenty normal {{readers and}} forty with reading impairments) were evaluated {{on a test}} battery designed to investigate vestibular and ocular motor function. The children ranged from ten to fourteen years of age with {{an equal number of}} males and females. All subjects had normal intelligence as measured on either the Slosson Intelligence Test (SIT) or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Each subject was free of auditory and vestibular disease. All had normal visual acuity and no ocular muscle pathology. ^ The experimental group consisted of children previously identified as being reading-impaired by their school system. These children were tested on the word attack, word identification, and passage comprehension subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests. The experimental group was required to score below the 16 th percentile on {{at least two of the}} three above mentioned subtests. The control group had no known reading problems and was required to score above the 40 th percentile on all three of the Woodcock subtests. All subjects were evaluated for their performance on ocular pursuit tracking and ocular saccadic eye movements. Performane on a test of vestibular function was measured by examining the slow phase eye movement velocity created by a sinusoidal harmonic accelerator (Computerized <b>Rotary</b> <b>Chair).</b> ^ The results of the study found no group differences for the vestibular and ocular pursuit subtests. The eye movement control exercised by the vestibular system does not appear to be a significant factor related to eye movement control needed for reading. However, differences in saccadic eye velocity were noted between groups. The saccadic eye speed of the normal group was significantly higher (faster) than that of the experimental group (F = 5. 80, P = 3 ̆c. 05). It is postulated that although the saccadic eye movement system is not the only factor responsible for abnormal reading ability, it may be an important contributing factor and needs to be investigated further. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>chair</b> {{testing is}} used to {{quantify}} progress of central vestibulo compensation after peripheral-vestibulo defects. This is important when studying the progress of vestibular compensation and when giving an expert opinion on the employability of a patient if vestibular compensation has been achieved. Servo motor controlled rotational chairs are too expensive {{for this type of}} diagnostic testing. A very cost eficient alternative is to manually rotate a standard otolaryngology examination chair. 30 subjects were rotated at 0, 1 and 0, 2 Hz (max. chairspeed 50 °/s, max. Amplitud 79 ° / 39 °) on a servo-motor controlled rotational chair made by Toennies. The resulting nystagmus was measured with a video-oculographic system (SMI®). The chair velocity was measured using a perrotational angel velocity sensor (Watson Industries) that was attached to the goggles of the video-oculographic system. For manual rotational testing a standard otolaryngology examination chair was used. The operator could apply the 0, 1 and 0, 2 Hz rotational frequencies via a visual metronome. Through manual rotation, differences in acceleration and chair velocity occur. Therefore mathematical algorithems are applied to measure and compensate these differences. The data (SPV and chair velocity) of both rotational tests were analyzed and compared using five different mathematical algorithems (MathCad®). The actual manual rotational frequency was measured using fouriertransformation. Data analysis of all five algorithems in the student&# 900;s t-test showed no significant differences between manual and servo-motor controlled rotational testing. When determining the correlation between the manual and the servo-motor controlled rotational test data of all five algorithems, {{it turned out that the}} algorithem analyzing the speed-curve-area had the highest correlation. The algorithems analysing phaseshift and curve-regression had the lowest correlation. Manual rotational testing using these five algorithems to analyse and compensate occuring side differences, shows no significant differences to servo-motor controlled rotational testing. This method can be considered a cost effective alternative to expensive servo-motor controlled rotational test batteries, as long as the described algorithems are employed to compensate occuring side differences during manual rotational testing...|$|E
