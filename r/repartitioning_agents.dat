40|$|The {{adrenergic}} system, {{characterized by}} the catecholamine hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, integrates and modulates many aspects of vertebrate, including fish, metabolism. β 2 -Adrenergic agonists (β 2 -AA; synthetic catecholamine analogues signaling through the β 2 -adrenergic receptor) increase muscle growth in mammals (Maltin et al., 1992) and act as <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agents</b> by re-directing nutrients from adipose tissue to muscle (Roberts and McGeachie, 1992). β 2 -Agonists also increase weight gain, feed utilization, lean body mass and protein accretion in mammals. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} ractopamine (RACT) and clenbuterol (CLEN), two β 2 -adrenergic agonists of the phenethanolamine group, on both rainbow trout muscle growth and myosatellite cell proliferation and differentiation. Currently, ractopamine is commercially used in swine farming, and has previously been tested in rainbow trout (Vandenberg and Moccia, 1998) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) (Mustin and Lovell, 1993) where it has demonstrated lower effects than reported in other vertebrates.

40|$|Recently, beta-adrenergic agents, which {{repartition}} {{muscle and}} fat, {{have been used}} to develop more muscular carcasses in broilers, steers, lambs, and pigs. Cimaterol, one such repartitioning agent, effectively improves carcass quality in pigs. Since the mode of action of <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agents</b> is uncertain, and because they may indirectly affect skeletal development or the integrity of feet, {{the purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of cimaterol on selected growth cartilages and feet. Pigs were randomly placed in four groups and fed a ration that included Cimaterol at 0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50, or 1. 00 mg/kg. At 100 kg live-weight, pigs were slaughtered and selected growth cartilages, bones, and feet were examined macroscopically, radiologically, and microscopically. Although the majority of pigs had lesions in feet, or had dyschondroplastic changes typical of osteochondrosis in many growth cartilages, particularly physes, there were no significant differences in frequency of pigs with lesions between groups. Cimaterol enhanced carcass quality with no detrimental effect on bones or feet...|$|E
40|$|Mature {{cows are}} culled from herds for reasons such as poor {{performance}} {{and failure to}} rebreed. When these cows are removed from the herd, they are typically in thin condition and potentially can be fed to gain weight and increase income. Previous {{research has shown that}} feeding cull cows high-energy diets can increase carcass weight, fatness, and meat yield. Management practices of implanting and feeding β-adrenergic agonists, <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agents</b> that favor protein deposition at the expense of fat deposition, have been shown to further improve performance and carcass yields. As reported elsewhere in this publication, carcasses from concentrate-fed cows implanted with Revalor- 200 (Intervet Inc., Millsboro, DE) and fed Zilmax (zilpaterol hydrochloride; Intervet Inc.) had more muscling as indicated by larger ribeye areas than carcasses from grass-fed cows and both implanted and non-implanted concentrate-fed cows. These carcasses potentially would have increased subprimal meat yields.

40|$|A growth {{trial was}} carried out to test the effect of organic, {{trivalent}} chromium and L-carnitine on the body composition of growing rats. At the same time, an evaluation of different measurement methods (weight of epididymal fat pad, adipocyte morphometry, total body electrical conductivity) was performed. Outbred Wistar rats of 30 days of age were fed diets of different (0, 10 and 20 %) protein level. The diets were supplemented with 4 mg/kg Cr as chromium nicotinate, and 100 mg/kg L-carnitine. The experimental feeding lasted 15 days, after a 5 -day-long adjustment period. It was found that Cr addition increased feed intake. Both treatments caused changes in body composition, increasing fat and protein deposition. Organic chromium had no effect at either protein level, while L-carnitine improved the protein retention only at an optimum (20 %) protein supply. No statistically significant correlation was found between total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) and body composition, which {{could be attributed to}} the great individual differences. A close correlation was found among total body fat percentage, weight of epididymal fat pad and the adipocyte surface.

40|$|Despite a ban by the European Union, {{the use of}} {{anabolic}} steroids and <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agents</b> in cattle is still occasionally observed. Due to continuing improvements in analytical techniques, very low detection limits for individual compounds have been achieved. In response to these developments, cocktails composed of several steroids have been applied, thus hampering detection due to lower levels of the individual compounds. Bioassays capable of measuring the integrated effect of cocktails might therefore provide valuable additional tools in controlling the use of illegal anabolics. We investigated the feasibility of using the AR-LUX assay to detect the presence in cattle urine of growth promoters that exert their effects via androgen response elements (AREs). The AR-LUX assay {{is based on a}} human cell line featuring a luciferase reporter gene under transcriptional control of an authenticated ARE. Several column purification and liquid/liquid extraction methods were investigated to optimize the efficiency of anabolic compounds extraction and minimize cytotoxic effects of the urine matrix. The AR-LUX assay was found to be applicable to the detection of {{anabolic steroids}} excreted in urine samples with a discriminatory power similar to that of GC-MS analysis. Finally, some liquid products probably destined for growth-promoting purposes confiscated outside the Netherlands were analyzed.

40|$|Ractopamine is a <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agent</b> {{that can}} {{increase}} muscle growth and {{has led to}} our interest in determining the mechanisms involved in enhancing muscle growth. Therefore, three studies were conducted to determine the impact of ractopamine on growth in cattle. The first experiment evaluated the impact of increasing metabolizable protein supply to finishing heifers fed ractopamine. Three different diets were fed {{to increase the amount}} of metabolizable protein reaching the small intestine, and the diets contained urea, solvent soybean meal, or expeller soybean meal as the primary supplemental protein source. From this study it was determined that increasing metabolizable protein supply above that present in typical feedlot diets containing urea and steam-flaked corn is not necessary to improve responsiveness to ractopamine. The second experiment evaluated the effect of feeding ractopamine to growing Holstein steers implanted with trenbolone acetate/estradiol. Half of the steers were implanted 28 days prior to all steers receiving ractopamine for the final 28 days; this model represents an intense implant program.

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{responses}} to GH administration is sup-pression of voluntary feed intake (FI) in some species, attributed to {{improvement in the}} efficiency of nutrient utilization and, therefore, reduced need for ingested sub-strates. Commercial broiler chickens have been genetically selected for generations for rapid growth, realized largely via the major correlated response of increased voluntary feed consumption. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and monoamines play very important roles in the central regulation of feeding. Preliminary studies from our laboratory suggest that the appetite-suppressive effect of GH may be independent of its actions as a <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agent,</b> and may involve alterations in NPY expression at the pre-translational level. The pur-pose {{of this investigation was}} to explore the dose–response nature of the appetite-suppressive effect of GH in juvenile broilers, and the possible involvement of NPY and monoamines in this process. A GH dose–response study was conducted using 8 -week-old female broilers infused i. v. with GH in a pulsatile pattern for 7 days at 0, 10, 50, 100 or 200 µg/kg body weight per day. Hypothalamic NPY and epine-phrine (EP) concentrations decreased in a dose-related manner with GH. At the highest dosage, voluntary FI decreased 19 % (P< 0 · 05) and hypothalamic NPY mRNA decreased approximately 50 % in the infundibular nuclei and midline region (P< 0 · 0001). In contrast, birds pair-fed to the high-GH dosage group did not differ from controls, verifying that changes in NPY and monoamines were not secondary to reduced FI. We conclude that hypothalamic NPY and EP are likely candidates to explore further as mediators of the appetite-suppressive effect o...|$|R
40|$|Segmental {{arterial}} mediolysis (SAM) is {{an uncommon}} non-inflammatory iatrogenic arteriopathy caused by alpha- 1 adrenergic agonists or Beta- 2 agonists able to release norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system. Causative agents include adrenergic agonists {{used to control}} blood pressure, B- 2 tocolytic agonists, and ractopamine used as a <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agent</b> in animal husbandry. The liberated norepinephrine both injures and stimulates a robust reparative response in the muscular arteries in the abdomen, brain base, and coronary arteries. This response may be augmented by endothelin- 1 formed in the arterial adventitia. Three types of arterial lesions develop in the injurious stage: 1) apoptotic induced mediolysis, 2) separation of the outer media from the adventitia and 3) the formation of arterial gaps. The latter enlarge, particularly in elderly patients, to form gap-aneurysms complicated by dissections and dissecting an- eurysms that when ruptured cause the calamitous hemorrhages that clinically announce SAM. The other types of injury remain clinically silent but with repair develop sequelae and can metamorphose into fibromuscular dysplasia. The sequelae are mainly asymptomatic but may cause arterial stenosis and ischemic lesions. The definitive diagnosis of SAM re- quires histological conformation but misinterpreta- tion of smooth muscle vacuolar change has caused di- agnostic errors. Muscular artery cystic necrosis a newly named non-inflammatory muscular artery ar- teriopathy may be confused with SAM both clinically and pathologically. This arteriopathy represents the muscular artery equivalent of cystic media necrosis of the elastic arteries since it exhibits similar morphol- ogic features and can occur concomitantly with this entity. Adrenergic agents to counter hemorrhagic shock in SAM are contraindicated since they may  intensify injury and create new lesions. The use of norepinehrine antagonists introduces a new, but as yet untested, treatment option for SAM. </p...|$|R

This study attempted to address some questions generated from the previous study, which were how serum and local tissue production of IGF-I are affected by ractopamine. Ractopamine had different effects on serum IGF-I between steers and heifers and numerically increased IGF-I mRNA abundance in longissimus and biceps femoris muscles. Additionally, ractopamine impacted protein turnover differently in different muscles and changed myosin heavy chain IIA expression. The effect of ractopamine on IGF-I warrants more research.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) in combination with a non-steroidal growth implant on growth and carcass characteristics of feedlot lambs. The use of ZH is common in commercial beef production, however is not yet registered for use in lamb production without a veterinary prescription on an extra label basis. Lamb producers are looking to a more intensive production system for sheep, which requires a finishing phase and therefore warrants the research of growth promotants {{that can be used in}} this phase to increase efficiency. In this study 180 South African Mutton Merino male-type lambs were selected at a commercial feedlot. After the growing phase 20 lambs were excluded from the group and 160 lambs were used for the finishing phase. Half of the lambs were implanted with zeranol marketed under the name Ralgro® (MSD), a non-steroidal, oestrogen like compound. The lambs were randomly put into 8 groups with different treatments, to test the different combinations of ZH, zeranol and duration of treatment. ZH was either fed for 18 days with a 3 day withdrawal period or for 25 days with a 3 day withdrawal period. The lambs were slaughtered and carcasses were chilled for 3 days before samples were taken and analysed. ZH had an effect on average daily gain (ADG), cold carcass mass and tenderness (P < 0. 05). ZH tended to have an effect on hide weight and cooking loss (P < 0. 10). The lambs treated with ZH grew 16. 7 g/day more than the control group and had 0. 51 kg heavier carcasses than the control group. Zeranol significantly affected ADG and cold carcass mass (P < 0. 05). Zeranol tended to influence subcutaneous fat thickness (SCF) of the 10 th rib (P < 0. 10). Lambs implanted with zeranol grew 18. 8 g/day more than the control and had 0. 35 kg heavier cold carcasses. Duration of treatment significantly affected cold carcass mass, hide weight, pH at 45 minutes post mortem, pH after chilling, fat thickness, tenderness and SCF of the 8 th rib (P < 0. 05). Duration of treatment had a tendency to influence cooking loss, with a longer time on treatment causing more loss (P < 0. 10). There were a number of interactions. ZH and zeranol (Z*R) caused significant interactions in ADG, cold carcass mass and hide weight (P < 0. 05). Z*R also tended to cause interactions in pH after chilling (P < 0. 10). Zeranol and duration of treatment (R*D) significantly caused an interaction in pH after chilling (P < 0. 05) and ZH and duration of treatment tended to cause an interaction in pH after chilling (P < 0. 10). ZH, zeranol and duration of treatment caused a significant interaction in cold carcass mass (P < 0. 05) and tended to cause an interaction in cooking loss (P < 0. 10). ZH improves ADG, as well as cold carcass mass and did not influence carcass characteristics, probably due to a low dosage. ZH increases the sheer force values of lamb post slaughter and has no practical influence on cooking loss. Feeding ZH for a longer duration also causes tougher meat. Carcass composition did not differ significantly due to ZH treatment as expected, because ZH is known to be a <b>repartitioning</b> <b>agent.</b> ZH has better results in increasing ADG and cold carcass mass, when lambs were implanted with zeranol during the growing phase. The combination of ZH and zeranol seems to have an additive affect on ADG and cold carcass mass. Using Zeranol in combination with ZH for 25 days proved to yield the best results for both ADG and cold carcass mass. ZH tended to decrease the hide weight and therefore shows the repartitioning effect of ZH. A follow up study on different dosage levels of ZH can be helpful to determine if ZH has an effect on carcass composition in lamb.
