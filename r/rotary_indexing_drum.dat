50|$|With {{the help}} of the flyer winding technology, an {{electric}} coil or winding is produced by feeding the wire via a roll or through a nozzle that is attached to a so-called flyer that is rotating at a certain distance from the coil. The wire is fed by the flyer shaft. For winding the component to be wound, it needs to be fixed inside the winding area of the flyer. It is necessary that the wire is fixed outside of the flyer at any time of the winding procedure. The fixation of the wire is made possible normally by the so-called successive winding method (often used at <b>rotary</b> <b>indexing</b> tables): At the circumference of the table are wire clips or wire deflections that enable a pulling along and with it a fixation of the wire. This will allow a very quick component change, given that no separate depositing of the wire in a wire clip on the machine is required.|$|R

40|$|Flows {{of mixed}} fluids in pipes are {{frequently}} encountered {{in several areas}} of engineering, such as chemical, petroleum and nuclear. Two key parameters characterising such flows are the local volume fraction distribution and the axial velocity distribution of the dispersed phase. In order to achieve a further understanding of the flow properties, vector velocities are important too. A common intrusive method that is used for acquiring these parameters is the local conductivity probe. The reason is that conductivity probes are more accurate than other measuring techniques, such as ERT (Electrical Resistance Tomography) systems, and are therefore used for the calibration and validation of ERT systems. Also the measurements from conductivity probes show a more representative distribution of volume fraction and velocity of the dispersed phase than other non intrusive methods. They are also useful for validating data produced by CFD (Computed Fluid Dynamics) simulations. In this thesis, {{research has been done}} on designing probes, and improving the related signal processing algorithms, and several experiments have been run in multiphase loops for measuring the local volume fraction and velocity of the dispersed phase in vertical and inclined pipes and in swirling flows. All these attempts have recognised an extra problem that is not negligible when using local conductance probes. This problem is the interaction between the probe and the bubble. It is known that local probes alter the true value of the bubble’s vector velocity {{due to the fact that}} bubbles are slowed down by the probe. A number of experiments were performed and a comparison between ERT and local conductivity probes was made. Both techniques gave velocity distributions of the dispersed phase which do not agree, showing that ERT is unable to accurately measure the gas velocity and volume fraction profiles. Furthermore the current thesis presents results from dual sensor and four sensor local conductivity probes in steady vertical and inclined air-water and oil-water flows and in steady swirling flows, and a proposed new design for fabricating a <b>rotary</b> <b>index</b> dual sensor probe with a new algorithm for the signal processing scheme is given. This new type of conductivity probe has a relatively small frontal area that reduces the bubble-probe interaction hence the probe’s effect on the dispersed phase is less that of other types of probe.

40|$|Abstract—We report three {{experiments}} on manual detection of torque variations experienced through a rotary switch. The experiments {{were designed to}} investigate whether torque perception {{was determined by the}} spatial or by the temporal characteristics of the rotary switch. In Experiment I, manual detection thresholds of torque variation were measured with raised sinusoidal torque profiles that varied in spatial period from 2. 8 degree to 180 degree per cycle. In Experiment II, the same was measured for torque profiles that varied in temporal frequency from 2 to 300 Hz. Experiment III was similar to Experiment 1 except that the participants were required to turn the rotary switch at two different speeds for each of seven spatially specified torque profiles (spatial period: 2. 8 degree to 90 degree per cycle). A comparison of the thresholds obtained in Experiment III and those in Experiments I and II suggests that the detection of torque variations depends on the spatial, not temporal, specification of the torque profiles. Our results can potentially shed new light on the design and engineering specification of <b>rotary</b> switches. <b>Index</b> Terms—Haptic interface, <b>rotary</b> switch, spatial and temporal torque variation, torque perception.

40|$|Because {{of a lack}} of fishery-dependent data, {{assessment}} of the recovery of fish stocks that undergo the most aggressive form of management, namely harvest moratoriums, remains a challenge. Large schools of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) were common along the northern Gulf of Mexico until the late 1980 s when increased fishing effort quickly depleted the stock. After 24 years of harvest moratorium on red drum in federal waters, the stock is in need of reassessment; however, fisherydependent data are not available in federal waters and fishery-independent data are limited. We document the distribution, age composition, growth, and condition of red drum in coastal waters of the north central Gulf of Mexico, using data collected from a nearshore, randomized, bottom longline survey. Age composition of the fishery-independent catch indicates low mortality of fish age 6 and above and confirms the effectiveness of the federal fishing moratorium. Bottom longline surveys may be a cost-effective method for developing fishery-independent <b>indices</b> for red <b>drum</b> provided additional effort can be added to nearshore waters (< 20 m depth). As with most stocks under harvest bans, effective monitoring of the recovery of red drum will require the development of fishery-independent indices. With limited economic incentive to evaluate non-exploited stocks, the most cost-effective approach to developing such monitoring is expansion of existing fishery independent surveys. We examine this possibility for red drum in the Gulf of Mexico and recommend the bottom longline survey conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service expand effort in nearshore areas to allow for the development of long-term abundance <b>indices</b> for red <b>drum...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Limit cycles {{occurring}} in oil well drillstrings {{result from the}} interaction between the drill bit and the rock during drilling operations. In this paper, we propose to use the weight on the bit (WoB) force as an additional control variable to extinguish limit cycles when they occur. An approximate analysis based on the bias describing function and completed with some simulations, provides good evidence that the rotational dynamics of the oil well drillstring displays such a behavior. In particular, we propose an adaptation law for the WoB named D-OSKIL mechanisms, which results from a variant of the oscillation killer (OSKIL) mechanism studied in detail in [6]. In opposition to the heuristic control structure proposed in [7], we show that the new WoB control law results in a globally asymptotically stable closed-loop system. Simulations applying the D-OSKIL mechanism show that the stick-slip oscillations can be eliminated without requiring a redesign of the velocity <b>rotary</b> table control. <b>Index</b> Terms—Oil well drillstring, oscillation control, passivity control, stick-slip elimination.

In contrast, {{we are interested in}} reconstructing the room geometry from a single RIR — a 1 –D function of time. We discuss the uniqueness of the mapping between the geometry of a planar polygonal room and a single RIR. In addition to this theoretical analysis, we also propose an algorithm that performs the “blindfolded ” room estimation. Furthermore, the derived results are used to construct an algorithm for localization in a known room using only a single RIR.

40|$|We {{address a}} problem of {{separating}} drums from polyphonic music containing various pitched instruments as well as drums. Nonneg-ative matrix factorization (NMF) was successfully applied to spec-trograms of music to learn basis vectors, followed by support vector machine (SVM) to classify basis vectors into ones associated with drums (rhythmic source) only and pitched instruments (harmonic sources). Basis vectors associated with pitched instruments are used to reconstruct drum-eliminated music. However, it is cumbersome to construct a training set for pitched instruments since various instru-ments are involved. In this paper, we propose a method which only incorporates prior knowledge on drums, not requiring such training sets of pitched instruments. To this end, we present nonnegative ma-trix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) where the target matrix (spec-trograms of music) and drum-only-matrix (collected from various drums a priori) are simultaneously decomposed, sharing some factor matrix partially, to force some portion of basis vectors to be associ-ated with drums only.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{of a number}} of coals with varying rank was characterized by a number of means with emphasis on petrographic examination. The petrographic data of coals was processed with special emphasis on quantifying vitrinite sub macerals and their association with coal carbonisation parameters as well as coke strength. The association between coal petrography data with coke strength of binary blends as well as industrial blends was also examined. Coke strength parameters including <b>drum</b> <b>index</b> and CSR were found to be predominantly influenced by coal rank with few exceptions of high rank and low fluidity coals. The study showed the association between coke strength and coke micro-texture such that coke strength after reactions was related to increased anisotropic texture. On the basis of vitrinite sub-components a new coal parameter was devised. The new parameter, the ratio of difference of collinite and telinite to the mean vitrinite reflectance, is found to predict coke strength of single coals with high confidence. However, the same parameter could not predict coke strength of binary coke as well as coke made in industrial processes. The study suggested that interaction of sub-vitrinite during carbonisation could be responsible for the limitation of application of the new parameter to predict coke strength of blends. Further investigations relating to the interaction of sub-macerals during carbonisation as well as the role of minerals may improve the confidence of coke strength prediction using the proposed new index...|$|R
