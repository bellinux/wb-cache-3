Four {{different types of}} hydrocarbon namely heptane, octane, dodecane and tetradecane were considered. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical polarizing microscopy were used for phase identification and structure characterization. The SAXS data was further analyzed in terms of lattice parameters and area per surfactant head group. The area head group of the hexagonal phases seemed not {{to depend on the}} alkane chain length. On the other hand, the area head group for the lamellar phases was found to increase as the alkane chain is lengthened. The frequency-dependent storage and loss modulus were found to exhibit characteristics of the hexagonal and lamellar phases in the linear viscoelastic regions. The elastic properties of hexagonal phases were also found to be unaffected when higher homologue of the alkane series was considered, while for lamellar phases the elastic properties were found to decrease. The effects of temperature on the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> of hexagonal and lamellar phases were also investigated and their melting transition temperatures were found to be almost similar. Moreover, the melting transition temperatures determined by rheology differ only slight from that determined by microscopy. The rheological quantities were found to decrease when the temperature was increased. In general, the effects of different types of hydrocarbon in the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> were found to be more profound in the lamellar than in the hexagonal phases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

It {{has been known}} that slurry rheology significantly influences the grindability of industrial minerals in wet ultrafine grinding. This review represents some previous work with respect to slurry rheology in ultrafine grinding. In this review, some methods for the characterization of the slurry rheology and some empirical equations modelling <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> of slurries were presented. The semiempirical model incorporating slurry rheology, solids concentration, particle size and slurry temperature was described. In addition, on-line measurement for the slurry rheology control was also discussed. In the case of ultrafine grinding, various parameters (such as solid concentration, particle size and distribution, particle shape, temperature, rotation and pH, use of dispersants), which affect the slurry rheology, have been described. It was revealed that the optimization of the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> of slurry in ultrafine grinding could increase throughput, energy efficiency and product fineness as well.

40|$|Complex fluids cover a large {{range of}} materials. This thesis focuses on {{two types of}} such systems: {{granular}} suspensions that show shear thickening and polymer glasses, viscoelastic solid materials. Suspensions of granular particles have sparked great interest in recent years, not only due to interest from fundamental research {{but also because of}} their potential in industrial applications in areas like food production, pesticides, cosmetics, construction and oil well engineering. Depending on the suspending-liquid properties, particle sizes and volume fractions, granular suspensions show very rich <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as shear thickening, elevated normal stresses and an intriguing elongational rheology. Precisely these three <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> are systematically studied in three chapters (Chapters 3 - 5) of this thesis. The final chapter (Chapter 6) deals with the issue of the polymer glass transition. Traditionally, for thermoplastics, the so-called glass transition temperature (Tg) determines the transition between solid-like and liquid-like material. Accordingly, when the temperature is decreased below Tg, the initially liquid polymer melt becomes hard and brittle, and behaves like a glass. Our experiments show that besides increasing the temperature, a glass to liquid transition can also be achieved by imposing shear; thus, a critical glass-transition strain amplitude is defined. Knowledge of the polymer glass rheology is important for understanding and optimizing their performance in industrial as well as in everyday applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{simulation}} {{study conducted}} {{in this thesis}} was carried out at the Centre for Integrated Petroleum Research (Uni CIPR) at the University of Bergen (UiB). The main objective in this thesis was to study polymer rheology and injectivity in a radial Bentheimer disk by history matching experimental polymer flooding data. As radial models emulate the flow field encountered in field applications characterised by a successive flow velocity reduction, studying polymers <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> in radial disks is an important field of study for planning of future field scale polymer flooding operations. The <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> of two polymers were studied; the synthetic polymer HPAM and the biopolymer xanthan. The polymers displayed <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> earlier {{reported in the literature}} characteristic to the molecular conformation of the polymers. Results from the history matches of HPAM pressure data revealed a dominating shear thickening behaviour at high velocities in the near-well vicinity. Newtonian and slight shear thinning was also observed for lower injection rates at low velocities. HPAMs <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> was found to be dependent on deformational history experienced during the flooding sequence, showing different <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the radial model at different injection rates. History matching pressure data collected during xanthan flooding sequences showed a <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> dominated by shear thinning behaviour at high and intermediate velocities. Further, at lower injection rates a lower Newtonian plateau was attained at low velocities away from the injection well. This lower Newtonian plateau commonly encountered in bulk rheological measurements has been reported to be difficult to attain in linear core experiments. The results observed in this thesis therefore indicate that radial disk experiments may be an improved geometry for studying xanthan rheology which may aid in planning future xanthan flooding applications. Comparison of the polymers injectivity further revealed improved injectivity characteristics of the shear thinning xanthan polymer owing to a reduced pressure drop occurring in the near-well vicinity. As expected, injectivity characteristics heavily depended on the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the polymers. In this simulation study two reservoir simulation tools were utilized; STARS by CMG and MRST with an Ensemble Kalman Filter module extension. By using these simulation tools Bentheimer disks were modelled and polymer flooding sequences simulated. By history matching pressure data both manually using STARS and automatically using the MRST simulator, increased confidence was reached from the simulation results as agreement was obtained between the simulated results. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> of lead free solder pastes used for {{flip-chip}} assembly applications and to correlate <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> with the printing performance. Design/methodology/approach: A range of rheological characterization techniques including viscosity, yield-stress, oscillatory and creep-recovery tests {{were carried out}} to investigate the <b>rheological</b> properties and <b>behaviours</b> of four different solder paste formulations based on no-clean flux composition, with different alloy composition, metal content and particle size. A series of printing tests were also conducted to correlate printing performance. Findings: The results show that in the viscosity test, all solder pastes exhibited a shear thinning behaviour in nature with different highest maximum viscosity. The yield stress test {{has been used to}} study the effect of temperature on the flow behaviour of solder pastes. A decrease in yield stress value with temperature was observed. The results from the oscillatory test were used to study the solid and liquid like behaviours of solder pastes. Creep-recovery test showed that the solder paste with smaller particle size exhibits less recovery. Research limitations/implications: More extensive research in needed to simulate the paste-roll, aperture filling and aperture emptying stages of the stencil printing process using rheological test methods. Practical implications: Implementation of these rheological characterization procedures in product development, process optimization and quality control can contribute significantly to reducing defects in the assembly of flip-chip devices and subsequently increasing the production yield. Originality/value: The study shows how the viscosity, yield-stress, oscillatory and creep-recovery test methods can be successfully used to characterize the flow behaviours of solder paste and also to predict it’s performance during the stencil printing process...|$|R

Up to date, although extensive studies on the rheological properties of rocks are available in the literature, most of existing studies reported the strain-time data for the axial deformation through compression rheological method and did not mention the lateral deformation, and mainly focused on the soft rocks at shallow depth. Thus, very limited {{attention has been paid to}} the rheological properties of deep and hard rock, neglecting the effects of structural anisotropy on the rheological properties. This paper presents a comprehensive in-depth study on the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours</b> of super-deep hard rock considering the effects of structural anisotropy by using the uniaxial and biaxial creep tests. The results revealed that significant creep behaviour can be observed in the hard rock specimens under high stress in the in-situ conditions, and the strain-time behaviour of hard rock exhibited brittle failure. The strain-time curves of hard rock exhibited two obvious phases of instantaneous creep and steady state creep without the phase of accelerated creep. Moreover, it was observed that the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviours,</b> including the instantaneous modulus, transient creep duration, axial and lateral creep deformations, steady state creep rate, volumetric strain and contraction ratio are strongly affected by the structural anisotropy.
