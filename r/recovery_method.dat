500|$|Another {{interesting}} <b>recovery</b> <b>method</b> conservationists and biologists {{are using}} is called Fish Transportation. Since many juvenile salmon perish at each dam while swimming {{out to the}} ocean, massive ships filter and collect these baby salmon by size and take {{them out to the}} ocean for a ride, where they can be guaranteed to make it alive to saltwater. This method raises controversy to the effectiveness and costs, since this method is extremely expensive, almost costing $15million. Another similar method to transport fish across the dams is the [...] "Fish Gun" [...] method. Engineers at Whooshh Innovations have developed a [...] "Whooshh Fish Transport System" [...] that literally collects salmon and shoots them above the dam at high speed {{in an effort to get}} them across the dams.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Sports Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that athletes, striving {{to compete and}} perform at the highest level, should optimally balance training and competition stress with adequate regeneration. Although a well-planned training programme is of utmost importance, the time between training sessions and competitions is critical for the modern-day athlete. It is suggested that athletes should apply a variety of <b>recovery</b> <b>methods</b> to enhance the regeneration process. Although team sport is a popular entity throughout the world, there is limited published research on the regeneration process in team athletes and <b>recovery</b> <b>methods</b> to enhance the regeneration process. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a model that could serve as a guideline for the regeneration of team athletes within the South African context. Two phases were involved in the process of developing a model. Phase one involved a research of literature in order to assess which strategies can be implemented for athletic regeneration, and what information team athletes are given for regeneration. The second phase involved an investigation into the recovery strategies that are currently used for regeneration by elite South African team players during the competitive phase of the year. Research questions focused on the <b>recovery</b> <b>methods</b> used by players, the perceived importance of various <b>recovery</b> <b>methods</b> to the players, and the relationship between sport and level of participation in the use of recovery strategies. This study did not attempt to assess the knowledge of the players on <b>recovery</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R
