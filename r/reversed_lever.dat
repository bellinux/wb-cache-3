[...] The best accreditation of the invention is documented under the Walschaerts valve gear.|$|R

50|$|In the UK, a screw {{reverser}} {{is sometimes}} called a “bacon slicer”, particularly the type fitted to BR Standard locomotives. In the US, a <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> is called a “Johnson bar”.|$|R
5000|$|The reverse turbine had 4 rows of blades. It {{was engaged}} by a dog clutch, {{activated}} when the <b>reverser</b> <b>lever</b> {{was set to}} [...] "0". This was originally steam-operated by a small piston and cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> in {{locomotive}} {{history is}} documented from about 1842. The American Railway Master Mechanic's Association had members that published illustrations. Parts for the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> are drawn in the [...] "Locomotive Dictionary", 1st edition (1906), by George Little Fowler. The lever {{is linked to}} the valve gear piston inside the high pressure steam port. The steam pressure faucet is closed to cut off power, and after coming to a halt, the valve gear piston could safely be moved a short distance using the lever as a fulcrum linked to the piston inside. Although the linkage was designed to give leverage, the Johnson Bar would take a firm throw to move and lock in position. Some locomotives had a screw reversing gear instead.|$|R
25|$|Consider {{that the}} driver has {{adjusted}} the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
50|$|A Johnson Bar is {{a control}} lever on a steam locomotive, {{used to control}} {{the timing of the}} {{admission}} of steam into the locomotive's pistons. By controlling this timing, the amount of power delivered to the wheels is regulated, as is the direction that the wheels rotate, giving the lever the alternate name of the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When the {{reverser}} is in {{the forward}} or reverse position, the locomotive will move in the indicated direction when the throttle is opened. Removing the reverser handle from the control stand in the neutral position locks the throttle controller, effectively disabling the locomotive. [...] The <b>reverser</b> <b>lever</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "railroad key." ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the money}} train now had no braking {{power and the}} {{throttle}} lever is jammed at full power, the brothers decide to throw it into reverse, derailing it and killing both of them but allowing the passengers to live. Charlie comes {{up with an idea}} and positions an iron bar {{in such a way that}} when the money train rams the other train once more, the bar trips the <b>reverse</b> <b>lever.</b> Both of them climb on top of the train and proceed to the front. When the trains collide one more time, the <b>reverse</b> <b>lever</b> is activated and both brothers jump across to the other train as the money train derails tumbles around several times knocking over several support beams (much to the horror of Patterson who witnesses the whole crash) before finally screeching to a stop on its side just before the station.|$|R

50|$|A {{reversing}} mechanism of some type has been present on locomotives almost since inception. The <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> on a steam locomotive {{is sometimes called}} a Johnson Bar. The style of reverser used on internal combustion locomotives has been in use {{since at least the}} early 1900s but as late as 1996 patented improvements have been made to the design and operation.|$|R
50|$|Another mechanism, used on Stephenson's {{locomotives}} in the 1830s, was the 'coupled gab'. Two open gabs were used, as for {{the manual}} open gab, although in this case they were both operated automatically by a single <b>reversing</b> <b>lever.</b> One was actuated by a bellcrank, the other through a reversing linkage from this, so that as one engaged the other was already lifted clear.|$|R
50|$|The 7th Class {{represented}} a considerable advance {{in design and}} power. They were the first South African locomotives to be equipped with sight feed lubricators which allowed a sight glass to be positioned in the cab, where the rate of oil feed to the cylinders could be observed. The reversing gear was of the quick-threaded screw type instead of the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> which had earlier been used.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{suffered}} major {{injury to}} his arms, {{as a result}} of the screw <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> whipping around when he released it. The accident brought to light the importance of train crews being trained on the specific locomotives they were driving, rather than simply a common general instruction on steam locomotives. Neither the driver or fireman had ever worked 60532 before, and were unaware of the locomotive's sensitivity to priming, which led to the accident.|$|R
5000|$|The SP4D version {{sported a}} dynamo and an {{additional}} extra large pulley (on the same shaft) using a standard flywheel. It had no <b>reverse</b> control <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{operation}} combines two motions; {{one is the}} primary lead motion which is imparted {{at the bottom of}} the combination lever (12). The secondary is the directional/amplitude motion which is imparted at the top. Consider that the driver has adjusted the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} burns. On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust <b>lever</b> and thrust <b>reverse</b> <b>levers</b> were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.|$|R
50|$|In January 1931 {{the service}} along Alphington Road {{ended and the}} final trams ran on 19 August 1931. The last every tram was driven by Mr E.C. Perry who as mayor, had driven the first tram. The last tram, car 14, was {{followed}} by a double decker bus to usher in the new age. Mr E.C. Perry was presented with a silver-plated control handle and Mr Bradley, Chairman of the Transport Committee was presented the <b>reverse</b> <b>lever</b> which was also silver-plated and inscribed. One of the tramcars (No. 19) survived and was restored on the Seaton Tramway but as a single deck tram.|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{normally have}} the throttle (North American English) or regulator (British English) in a characteristic steam dome {{at the top}} of the boiler (although not all boilers feature these). The additional height afforded by the dome helps to avoid any liquid (e.g. from bubbles on the surface of the boiler water) being drawn into the throttle valve, which could damage it, or lead to priming. The throttle is basically a poppet valve, or series of poppet valves which open in sequence to regulate the amount of stream admitted to the steam chests over the pistons. It is used in conjunction with the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> to start, stop and to control the locomotive's power although, during steady-state running of most locomotives, it is preferable to leave the throttle wide open and to control the power by varying the steam cut-off point (which is done with the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever),</b> as this is more efficient. A steam locomotive throttle valve poses a difficult design challenge as it must be opened and closed using hand effort against the considerable pressure (typically 250psi) of boiler steam (one of the primary reasons for later multiple-sequential valves...it is far easier to open a small poppet valve against the pressure differential, and open the others once pressure begins to equalize than to open a single large valve, especially as steam pressures eventually exceeded 200 or even 300 psi. Examples include the balanced [...] "double beat" [...] type used on Gresley A3 Pacifics.|$|R
50|$|It had no gear <b>lever,</b> <b>reverse</b> {{was entered}} {{with the use}} of switch.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of 1901-1903, five more Bs were built in Addington Workshops, with the last {{entering}} service in May 1903. The locomotives were advanced for their time, featuring a new piston valve design and a modified form of Walschaerts valve gear, and {{they were designed to}} haul 600 LT freight trains on flat lines and 220 LT on the hilly section of the Main South Line between Oamaru and Dunedin. For the time, these were quite significant figures. The Addington engines were unusual in the fact that they employed a screw reverse configuration, instead of the standard <b>reversing</b> <b>lever.</b> They also had fold down seats for both driver and fireman.|$|R
5000|$|Its most {{distinguishing}} feature {{was that the}} cab and firebox were {{at the front of}} the locomotive instead of the traditional rear. This was done essentially by running a 2-8-8-4 machine backwards with myriad modifications. The engineer and fireman swapped sides and faced away from the firebox. The tender was moved to behind the [...] "new" [...] locomotive back to improve forward vision. The smoke box end coupling was strengthened. The power <b>reverse</b> <b>lever</b> (Johnson Bar) and the steam throttle motion direction was reversed. The drive wheel axles are reversed, end for end without rekeying the return [...] "fly" [...] cranks, to reverse the expansion link timing on both sides.|$|R
50|$|A better {{solution}} was to use a single double-sided gab. These were initially X-shaped and sat between the two connecting pins. X-gabs were also usually reversed, so that the gab {{was placed on the}} valve spindle and the pins were instead connected to the eccentric rods. The gab now stayed still vertically and the pins were moved up and down to engage them. This was done by joining both pins with a short vertical bar. The driver's <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> moved the centre of this bar, thus the pins, up and down to engage one at a time with opposite faces of the X-gab. This valve gear was used on Stephenson's locomotives of the early 1830s, such as Rocket.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{locomotive}} was to carry out heavy shunting duties at Barry Docks. They were, in effect, a saddle tank version of the “A” class, a locomotive which had carried out shunting duties at the docks up to this point. 28 engines of the “F” class were manufactured, making it the second largest class of locomotive used on the Barry Railway, outnumbered only by the “B1” class. They were fitted with a <b>reversing</b> <b>lever,</b> far quicker for changing direction during shunting duties than the customary screw type reverser. They were all shedded at Barry and occasionally, {{in addition to their}} main shunting duties, they worked goods and coal traffic on the main line.|$|R
50|$|To get the {{locomotive}} moving, a hand-controlled high-pressure steam valve was provided, {{by means of}} which the driver could admit a proportion of high-pressure steam into the low-pressure cylinders. Although it was intended by its designers as a starting device only, the direct steam valve was consistently misused by drivers to help them over heavy grades, {{at the expense of}} operating efficiency and of their fireman. According to the Vauclian notes, {{the locomotive}}s were to be driven on the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> in such conditions, but that was clearly not a practice used by VR staff at the time. Due to the consequent high cost of maintenance, the entire class was rebuilt as simple expansion locomotives between 1912 and 1913.|$|R
50|$|Like the W class 2-8-0 Consolidation, {{there was}} no cab deck behind the backhead, the fireman shoveled coal from the tender deck and, along with the engineer, sat beside the firebox because the firebox came right {{to the back of}} the cab. The {{throttle}} lever hung down over the shoulder of the firebox, the <b>reverser</b> <b>lever</b> was in front of the engineer against the side of the firebox, with the water glass just above. The injector controls (A water valve, the overflow valve, and the operating lever.) were in front of him against the outer wall of the cab. Although slightly cramped, visibility to the front was superb. On the fireman's side, there was a water glass, injector controls, and a drop seat arranged like the engineer's.|$|R
50|$|The speed {{regulation}} {{was done by}} a steel bell crank, forked and carrying a U-shaped shoe to engage the grooved hub on the driving wheel at one end, and having the other end linked to the speed change and <b>reversing</b> <b>lever.</b> The wheel slid freely on the sleeve when {{moved away from the}} disk. All the speeds, from the highest to the lowest, could be done in either direction. The Lambert transmission always used side chains to the rear wheels and a balance gear connected to the splined sleeve on which the wheel slide and a steel shaft which supported the sleeve. The key feature of the Lambert automobile was the friction disk drive carried over from the Union automobile.|$|R
5000|$|The Ragonnet {{power reverse}}, {{patented}} in 1909, {{was a true}} feedback controlled servomechanism. The power reverse amplified small motions of <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> in the locomotive cab made with modest force into much larger and more forceful motions of the reach rod that controlled the engine cutoff and direction. [...] It was usually air powered, but could also be steam powered. [...] The term servomotor was explicitly used by the developers of some later power reverse mechanisms. [...] The use of feedback control in these later power reverse mechanisms eliminated {{the need for a}} second cylinder for a hydraulic locking mechanism, and it restored the simplicity of a single operating lever that both controlled the reversing linkage and indicated its position.|$|R
5000|$|This device {{inspired}} the Marquess of Stafford {{to order a}} steam carriage - probably in 1859. This vehicle had three wheels, the single wheel at the front, and a rear-mounted coal-fired boiler and two-cylinder engine. The boiler pressure was 110 psi, and the cylinders had a bore of 76 mm and stroke of 178 mm. Transmission was by chain to the right-hand rear wheel. A maximum speed of 19 mph was claimed. A boilerman was seated at the rear, and three passengers could sit side by side at the front with {{the one on the}} right operating a tiller steering and the regulator, <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> and brake. The wheels had iron [...] "tyres", with the brakes operating on the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Pearl and Mighty Mouse watch {{a special}} news bulletin, {{learning}} that Harry is doing this, when the Device sucks up the anchor giving the report. It {{gets all the}} planets and even the sun. It eventually gets Mighty Mouse, causing the mouse crew to freak out. Harry gives Pearl one last chance to surrender, and proceeds to suck up the mouse ship. However, Mighty Mouse finds {{the edge of the}} device, puts a hole in it with his super strength, and pulls the <b>reverse</b> <b>lever</b> (after Swifty fails to stop him). The machine spits out everything, leading it all to go back into its proper places. It also spits out rocks at the mouse ship, which prompts Mighty Mouse to relocate the ship into a safe spot; only {{the problem is that the}} spot is a no parking zone.|$|R
60|$|Winnifred {{was lifted}} tenderly by the menservants into the aristocratic equipage. The brake was unset, the <b>lever</b> <b>reversed,</b> and the {{carriage}} thrown again into motion.|$|R
50|$|Only paper railroads {{never have}} {{accident}}s, and the Rochester and State Line Railroad was no paper tiger. Some {{of the accident}} accounts surviving to this day leave much unsaid, such as the 13 June 1878 report that Locomotive No 7 ran over two cows between Salamanca and Gainesville on its very first trip. Others are frighteningly graphic (by today's tame standards) and could have been taken from cheap Hollywood scripts. Case in point: on or about 29 January 1879, Train No 2 departed Salamanca headed for Ellicottville when its encounter with a washout tossed the locomotive into the water. The fireman managed to escape the wreckage, but the engineer was caught by one foot trapped between the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> and the firebox. He desperately struggled to keep his head above water and to avoid a stream of very hot water coming from a burst pipe in the cab. By {{the time he was}} rescued hours later, the water had risen to his chin.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, {{four more}} {{of this type of}} boiler were ordered when No.87 was {{constructed}} out of Class A No.63 and Nos.72 and 73 were rebuilt from Class U to U2. The remaining boiler was presumably to have a been a spare one to enable speed shopping of engines but in the event it was immediately fitted to No.78. This engine was the last of the NBL engines to be built in 1924 but she had run a considerably greater mileage (442681 mi) than other members of the class by the time she received the new boiler in October 1936. No.70 did not have its footplate altered when it was rebuilt from Class U to U2; the short footplate made it unpopular with locomotive crews as the cab became very warm in summer and the position of some of the controls, especially the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever,</b> was cramped. It had the same nominal weight, 51 long tons 10 cwt (115400 lb), {{as the rest of the}} class, ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Gooch {{valve gear}} (invented by Daniel Gooch in 1843) the {{reversing}} and cut-off functions were achieved by raising or lowering a radius rod which connected the valve-rod to a [...] "stationary" [...] link pivoting around a fixed point. The advantages sought were reduced height for the gear and lighter action as the <b>reversing</b> <b>lever</b> was only required {{to lift the}} weight of the radius rod. This meant that the link was convex (in relation to the eccentrics) instead of concave. Gooch valve gear had the disadvantage of angularity between the valve spindle and the eccentric rod in full gear, whereas the best forms of the Stephenson gear, the thrust was in a straight line. The Gooch gear gave constant lead at whatever cutoff. This was observed to be a disadvantage when similar locomotives fitted with either Gooch or Stephenson gear were compared in service Gooch gear was never popular in Britain except with one or two engineers down to the 1860s, but it was quite common in France.|$|R
2500|$|A {{preliminary}} NTSB advisory says: [...] "The flying pilot (Captain) {{stated that}} he could not get the <b>reverse</b> thrust <b>levers</b> out of the stowed position. The first officer, after several seconds, noticed that the thrust reversers were not deployed, and activated the reversers without a problem. [...] Flight data recorder information reveals that the thrust reversers were not deployed until 18 seconds after touchdown, at which point there was only about 1,000 feet of usable runway remaining." ...|$|R
50|$|The USP {{was adopted}} in Germany by the Bundeswehr (German armed forces) as the P8 in 1994. The P8 has only minor {{differences}} {{from the standard}} USP model, these being translucent magazines, a <b>reversed</b> safety/decocker <b>lever</b> (on the P8, down indicates 'safe', and up indicates 'fire' — this {{is the opposite of}} the standard USP), and the 'S' and 'F' letters being printed onto the frame instead of onto the lever itself. The P8 has a traditional lands-and-grooves barrel instead of a polygonal barrel.|$|R
