40|$|Understanding the {{performance}} of banks is of the utmost relevance, because {{of the impact of}} this sector on economic growth and financial stability. Of all the different assets that make up a bank portfolio, the <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans constitute one of its main. Using the dynamic panel data method, we analyse the influence of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans on bank profitability and risk, using a sample of 555 banks in the European Union (EU- 15), over the period from 1995 to 2008. We find that banks with larger weights of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans show lower credit risk in good times. This result explains why banks rush to lend on property during booms due to the positive effects it has on credit risk. The results show further that credit risk and profitability are lower during the upturn in the residential property price cycle. The results also reveal the existence of a non-linear relationship (U-shaped marginal effect), as a function of bank’s risk, between profitability and the <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans exposure. For those banks that have high credit risk, a large exposure of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans is associated with higher risk-adjusted profitability, through lower risk. For banks with a moderate/low credit risk, the effects of higher <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> loan exposure on its risk-adjusted profitability are also positive or marginally positive...|$|R

25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as <b>residential</b> <b>mortgages,</b> commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).|$|E

25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits will typically have much shorter terms than <b>residential</b> <b>mortgages.</b> If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} interest income from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that {{the savings and loan crisis}} was in part caused by this problem, that the savings and loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|E
40|$|The <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> market {{becomes a}} {{financial}} engine for the booming residential housing development and {{sustained economic growth}} in China. Our study provides the first rigorous empirical analysis on the earlier performance of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> market in China based on a unique micro dataset of mortgage loan history collected from a major <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> lender in China. We found that while the option theory fails to explain prepayment and default behavior in the <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> market in China, other non-option theory related financial economic factors play major roles in determining the prepayment and default risks in China. We also found that borrower’s characteristics are significant in determining prepayment behavior, hence {{may be used as}} an effective tool for screening potential high risk borrowers in the loan origination process. Adopting a risk-based pricing in <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending in China can improve the efficiency of the market, and enhance the credit availability to the most needed households, i. e., the younger households, blue-collar workers, lower income households, and help them become homeowners.

25|$|Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, {{the chief}} {{underwriter}} of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning {{the board of}} directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgages</b> annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing {{as one of the first}} witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.|$|E

2500|$|In effect, {{this section}} of the Act {{establishes}} national underwriting standards for residential loans. It is not the intent of this section to establish rules or regulations that would require a loan to be made that would not be regarded as acceptable or prudential by the appropriate regulator of the financial institution. However, the loan originator shall make a reasonable and good faith effort based on verified and documented information that [...] "at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to the terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and other assessments". Also included in these calculations should be any payments for a second mortgage or other subordinate loans.

2500|$|The {{relatively}} greater {{concentration of}} S lending in mortgages, {{coupled with a}} reliance on deposits with short maturities for their funding, made savings institutions especially vulnerable to increases in interest rates. As inflation accelerated and interest rates began to rise rapidly in the late 1970s, many S began to suffer extensive losses. The rates they had to pay to attract deposits rose sharply, but the amount they earned on long-term, fixed-rate mortgages did not change. Losses began to mount. This led to a regulatory response of forbearance, which is arguably the cause to the symptoms and causes found below. To be clear, it was the practice and enabling of policy that is the cause to the turmoil that the S market experienced. Many insolvent thrifts were allowed to remain open, and their financial problems only worsened over time. [...] Moreover, capital standards were reduced both by legislation and by decisions taken by regulators. Federally chartered S were granted the authority to make new (and ultimately riskier) loans other than <b>residential</b> <b>mortgages.</b>|$|E
2500|$|According to American Enterprise Institute fellow Edward Pinto, Bank of America {{reported}} in 2008 that its CRA portfolio, which constituted 7% of its owned <b>residential</b> <b>mortgages,</b> {{was responsible for}} 29 percent of its losses.

Krugman argues that Pinto's category of [...] "other high-risk mortgages" [...] incorrectly includes loans that were not high-risk, that instead were like traditional conforming mortgages. Gene Epstein of Barron's disputed Krugman's claims {{and those of the}} article he cited as erroneous and misleading. Another CRA critic, Joseph Fried, concedes that [...] "some of this CRA subprime lending might have taken place, {{even in the absence of}} CRA. For that reason, the direct impact of CRA on the volume of subprime lending is not certain." [...] A study by the economists, Agarwal, Benmelich, and Bergman, found that banks undergoing CRA-related regulatory exams took additional mortgage lending risk.|$|E
