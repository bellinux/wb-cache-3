25|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, he worked briefly in Berkeley, California, before {{acquiring}} {{a job as}} a <b>railway</b> <b>mail</b> clerk with the U.S. Postal Service in Little Rock, Arkansas. While in Little Rock, he met and married Anna Conrad, the daughter of the city's police chief. A year later, their only child, Oscar Franklin Miller, Jr., was born. Miller came into conflict with the U.S. Postal Service's bureaucracy following a dispute over a misplaced mail sack, in which he refused to follow the chain of command and insisted on corresponding directly with the St. Louis postal inspector. As a result, he was transferred out of Little Rock to the Memphis, Tennessee–McAlister, Indian Territory, route.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{the rail}} {{transportation}} system drove developments in Chittagong {{and the surrounding}} areas, including Sitakunda. The rail tracks were established {{as part of the}} Bengal Assam Railway in 1898, originally running from Chittagong to Badarpur, with branches to Silchar and Laksam. In September 1878, Sitakunda was included in the East Bengal Circle of <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service (RMS) along with rest of the district. By 1904, the track system was extended to Chandpur to connect river boat traffic between Goalanda and Kolkata. Approximately [...] of railroads stop at six rail stations. Currently, there is no express train service between Sitakunda and Chittagong, though intercity expresses (Sylhet–Chittagong, Chandpur–Chittagong, and Dhaka–Chittagong) stop at Sitakunda station and carry a small share of the commuter traffic load. By 2003, there were a total of [...] of paved roads in the upazila, along with [...] of mud roads, as well as five ferry-gauts or river docks for the use of barge-type ferryboats. The traditional bullock carts are now rarely seen in the upazila.|$|E

50|$|From 1909 {{until the}} <b>railway</b> came, <b>mail</b> was {{delivered}} to Lafleche by horse and buggy or sleigh from different points on the main line. However, once the <b>railway</b> was built, <b>mail</b> came regularly. Mail was sorted on the train as it went along. Mail was taken aboard and dropped off at each stop all across Canada. Tom Murphy was the first postman in Lafleche, and held the position until July 26, 1912. Mr. Edmond Bilodeau became postmaster in 1927, a held the position for twenty seven years. He retired on April 25, 1955. On July 31, 1958 the train service was discontinued and mail trucks took over the business of mail service to Lafleche and surrounding towns.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the railway}} began {{operating}} {{again after the}} winter of 1910, the KMRy had reduced its weekly passenger service from six to three. [...] The same season would also see {{the dissolution of the}} <b>railway’s</b> <b>mail</b> contract, an agreement which had been enforced since July 1, 1909. On July 14, 1911, the railway announced a further reduction in passenger service. Trains would now leave only twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays, and a motor car would leave on Wednesdays [...] "carrying a limited number of passengers, mail, and express." [...] Freight trains still operated more than twice a week. Tellingly, the summer of 1911 {{would turn out to be}} the railway`s shortest season: ending their service on September 29, the railway would only have operated for a mere five months. This season would also be the last to see coach No. 200 & No. 202 in action, later left to rot on Klondike Island.|$|R
2500|$|By the 1880s, {{railway post}} office routes were {{operating}} on {{the vast majority of}} passenger trains in the United States. A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time. <b>Railway</b> <b>mail</b> clerks were subjected to stringent training and ongoing testing of details regarding their handling of the mail. [...] On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring only 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service division superintendent. Interurban and Streetcar systems were also known to operate RPOs. The Boston Elevated Railway car being noted as making circuits of the city to pick up mail.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service {{organization}} {{within the}} Post Office Department existed between 1864 and September 30, 1948.

[...] After 1960, {{the management of}} railway post office routes as well as Highway Post Office routes, Air Mail Facility, Terminal Railway Post Office, and Transfer Office, were shifted to the Bureau of Transportation.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century, many American railroads earned {{substantial}} revenues through contracts with the [...] U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD) to carry mail aboard high-speed passenger trains; and the <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service enforced various standardized designs on RPOs.

2500|$|In the United States, {{a railway}} post office, {{commonly}} abbreviated as RPO, was a railroad {{car that was}} normally operated in passenger service {{as a means to}} sort mail en route, in order to speed delivery. [...] The RPO was staffed by highly trained <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service postal clerks, and was off-limits to the passengers on the train. [...] In the UK and Ireland, the equivalent term was Travelling Post Office (TPO).|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Building was {{constructed}} over a steel frame with exterior walls of brick sheathed with [...] of gray granite from Mount Waldo, Maine. [...] The roofs were covered vitrified tile over book tile while the dome {{was covered with}} gilt glass tiles. [...] The plan called for the post office to occupy the basement and two lower floors. [...] The sixth, seventh and eighth floors of one wing held the courts, judges, clerks and US Marshal. [...] The floors in the dome were reserved for the Civil Service Commission, <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service and weather bureau with other agencies occupying the remaining space.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{physical}} and mental demands placed on RPO clerks, the <b>Railway</b> <b>Mail</b> Service pushed the adoption of standardized floor plans and fixtures for all RPO cars, with the first plans published in 1885. [...] The RMS also pressed for improved lighting fixtures to help the clerks see the addresses on the mail they sorted, first by improving the reflectors in the 1880s, then calling for discontinuance of oil lamps in the 1890s and the first experiments with electric lighting in 1912. [...] Clerks' safety was also of great concern to the RMS, with the first comprehensive statistics on work-related injuries published in 1877.|$|E
