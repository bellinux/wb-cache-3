Four selfregulating environmental management systems are considered: Total Quality Environmental Management (TQEM); ISO 14001 certification; the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) Principles; and the American Chemistry Council’s <b>Responsible</b> <b>Care</b> ® <b>initiative.</b> The results of a survey of academic experts in self-regulating environmental management systems are provided...|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} industry {{has always had}} to manage uncertainties and risks due to {{the very nature of}} its business: First, compared to materials and ingredients provided by nature and used by mankind for thousands of years, we have limited knowledge about the impact of chemical products on humans and the environment since they have only been used for a few centuries [8]. Second, handling and treating chemicals in raw material procurement, production, distribution and (re-)use require expertise and awareness of risks involved. Therefore, managing and assessing risks and uncertainties are key topics for chemical companies and governmental institutions to prevent human beings, public health and the natural environment from being harmed by toxic emissions and product spills. Environmental, health and safety precautions are on the agenda of corporate senior management and heeded in daily operations in every chemical plant and supply chain partner. Risk assessment in the {{chemical industry}} is highly regulated in Europe, as in many other regions and countries of the world, in order to protect public health [9]. European regulations are based on national regulations and registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH). New laws have been initiated in the European chemical industry for REACH [10]. In addition, the industry is committed to own safety measures with product stewardship programmes and <b>responsible</b> <b>care</b> <b>initiatives</b> [11].|$|R

40|$|The {{political}} power of non-state actors (NSAs) remains a contested issue, as the continuing debates between neo-realists and transnationalists within the Study of International Relations (SIR) show. This paper builds on as well as tries to transcend this debate. Its objective is to bring more 'unity' in the diverse and fragmented NSA literature: (1) by deducing general, case-transcending trends on the political role and impact of NSAs; and (2) by analysing these trends from one specific theoretical framework. The first aspect is achieved by analysing cases from different issue-areas in global governance (environment and human rights), and {{from the perspective of}} different types of NSAs (Non-Governmental Organisations, NGOs, and Transnational Corporations, TNCs). The second aspect is achieved by applying 'the three faces of power framework'. Inspired by and derived from the academic debates on the concept of power, these faces consists of: (1) decisional power, related to policy making and political influence; (2) discursive power, related to the (re) framing of discourses; and(3) regulatory power, related to rule-making and standard-setting. In the paper, these three faces are applied to three cases: to the IUCN and the UN Framework Convention on Biological Diversity, to NGOs and the human rights regime as well as to industry and environmental standards (<b>Responsible</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Initiative</b> and ISO 14001 respectively). These cases substantiate the view that NSAs are capable of reshaping patterns and outcomes of global governance, through the three faces of power...|$|E
40|$|In June, 2007 the {{province}} of Ontario, Canada, released environmental penalties (EPs) regulations. EPs (or administrative penalties, {{as they are called}} in the US) are the environmental equivalent of speeding tickets for facilities that violate pollution laws. They are found in numerous jurisdictions and are widely understood as part of a move toward smart regulation. The Ontario regulations offer reduced EPs to facilities with an environmental management system (EMS) that meets the requirements of ISO 14001 or the chemical industry 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Responsible</b> <b>Care</b> <b>initiative.</b> We argue that non-governmental, consensus-based standards such as ISO 14001 can and should play a constructive role in smart regulation and the pursuit of sustainability, but that the Ontario government 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to incorporate them into its EPs regulations was anything but smart. We present six tips for how to incorporate voluntary standards into official regulation. First, don 2 ̆ 7 t reinvent the wheel. If a standard exists that fulfills the objectives of a proposed regulation, and the standard was developed by a recognized standards body through a multi-stakeholder consensus process, regulators should incorporate the standard into the regulatory scheme as far as possible and appropriate, rather than drafting a new standard from scratch. Second, avoid unexplained discrepancies between the regulation and the standard. Third, if an existing widely accepted standard does not, on its own, meet all the public policy goals of the proposed regulation, indicate clearly how the standard is deficient and what more is required to meet public policy objectives. Fourth, should consult relevant standards development committees when developing regulations. Fifth, take advantage of ongoing opportunities to participate in the work of relevant standards development committees, to keep abreast of developments and influence the content of standards. Finally, and this is the biggest challenge, both regulators and standards development bodies should address the special characteristics and challenges of small businesses...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the implementation of a transforming <b>care</b> <b>initiative</b> and two patient outcomes, inpatient falls and hospital acquired pressure ulcers. BACKGROUND: Patients continue to experience harm in hospitals from adverse events such as inpatient falls and hospital acquired pressure ulcers. These and other patient safety concerns led to transforming <b>care</b> <b>initiatives.</b> DESIGN: This cohort study used historical controls and a time series design. The setting was two surgical units of an acute care hospital; 7125 patients discharged from these units between July 2008 -December 2010 were included. Those patients discharged during the initial 3 months of implementation were excluded. Several interventions were adopted as part of the transforming <b>care</b> <b>initiative</b> such as bedside handover and bedside whiteboards. Coded administrative data were accessed to identify patients who had experienced a fall or acquired a pressure ulcer during their hospital stay. Statistical process control was used to identify changes in outcomes over time. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated variation in the proportion of patients experiencing a fall in both units and for the proportion of patients acquiring a pressure ulcer in one unit, following implementation. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that implementing a transforming <b>care</b> <b>initiative</b> may have some influence on the quality and safety of patient care as measured by patient falls and pressure ulcers but findings varied. Further research is required to gain an understanding of the inconsistency of the impact of these initiatives across all clinical contexts.
