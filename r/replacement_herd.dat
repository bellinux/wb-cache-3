40|$|A {{network model}} was {{developed}} to optimize dairy cattle <b>replacement</b> decisions under <b>herd</b> constraints. Herd constraints are limited resources, such as a limited supply of labor or heifers, which cause optimal replacement decisions for individual cows to be dependent of decisions for other cows in the <b>herd.</b> Consequently, optimal <b>replacement</b> decisions for individual cows under herd constraints may differ from optimal decisions when no herd constraints are present. Optimal replacement decisions need to be determined simultaneously for all cows in the herd. Previous approaches provided complex and approximate solutions, while exact solutions for realistic problems have not been developed. The approach presented here is to formulate the dairy cattle replacement problem as a network and solve it with a state-of-the-art network optimizer. The network model was developed in SAS 9. 0 with the data step and was solved with SAS procedure Netflow.

40|$|There {{are many}} inputs into the dairy <b>replacement</b> <b>herd</b> which impact {{not only on}} the cost of rearing heifers from birth to first calving, but also on their future {{longevity}} and production potential. This study determined the current cost of rearing dairy heifers in the UK through the calculation and analysis of individual costs on a subset of 102 UK dairy farms. Each farm was visited and an extensive heifer rearing questionnaire was completed. Current heifer rearing practices were recorded to provide insight into critical management decisions. A cost analysis workbook was developed to calculate the costs of inputs in the pre-weaning period for labour, calving, feed, housing, health treatments and vaccinations, waste storage, machinery and equipment, and utilities. The average age at weaning was 62 d. The mean cost of rearing from birth to weaning was £ 195. 19 per heifer with a mean daily cost of £ 3. 14 (excluding the opportunity cost of the calf). This ranged from £ 1. 68 to £ 6. 11 among farms, reflecting major differences in management strategies and efficiency. The highest contribution to total costs came from feed (colostrum, milk, starter and forage) at 48. 5 % with milk feeding making up the greatest proportion of this at 37. 3 %. The next major expenses were bedding and labour, contributing 12. 3 % and 11. 2 % respectively. Unsurprisingly, delaying age at weaning increased total cost by £ 3. 53 per day. Total costs were on average 45 % higher on organic farms than conventional due to higher feed costs and later weaning. Calving pattern also had a strong association with the total cost being lowest with spring calving, intermediate with autumn calving and highest in multi block and all year round calving herds. fals...|$|E

Prerequisite for successful breeding is the economical effective milk production which only be achieved with good health of animals, good fertility, adequate <b>replacement</b> <b>herd,</b> longevity of cows and appropriate management. Breeders must always think about the way of the keeping and about the breed of the animals. This thesis aims to evaluate selected indicators of milk and meat production, fertility, longevity and economy of the milk production in the dairy herd of Holstein and Czech Pied cattle in the same stalling and at the same nutrition in the company VOD Kámen. It was chosen sixty Holstein and sixty Czech Pied breeding dams from the herd for monitoring. Monitored groups of cows were sorted out according to the genotype, origin of father and the order of lactation. The reproductive performance were used to evaluate (insemination interval, service period, meantime, insemination index), indicators of milk yield (amount of milk in kilograms, fat content, protein content), longevity and the reasons for decommissioning of cows. To evaluate meat yield twenty-five Holstein and twenty-five Czech Pied bulls were chosen. Differences of milk yield and fertility among both breeds were evaluated as very important (P < 0, 001). Reproductive performance of Holstein cows was evaluated as inconvenient (insemination interval 82, 06 days, service period 135, 87 days, meantime 412 days and insemination index 2, 4), and of Czech Pied cows as convenient (insemination interval 64, 8 days, service period 98, 84 days and insemination index 2, 0). The milk yield was higher the Czech average in both breeds. Holstein cows producted 9 123 kilograms of milk for lactation with 3, 87 % of fat and 3, 42 % of proteins; the Czech Pied cows producted 8100 kilograms of milk with 4, 08 % of fat and 3, 59 % of proteins. The most common reason for removal of cows was fertility disturbance. Indicators of meat yield were better for the Czech Pied bulls.

40|$|Problem statement: Economic losses {{due to high}} {{mortality}} in young calves born in hot arid zone including Kuwait and a high cost of rearing are the main constraints to this region. Therefore, dairy producers {{have to depend on}} importation of pregnant heifers for <b>herd</b> <b>replacement.</b> Research data on cost of heifer rearing from their weaning to first lactation were lacking. The objectives of the present investigation were to compare the costs/benefits of raising heifers born in Kuwait without and with intervention measures and project the future financial benefits. Approach: Present study methods involved using cost-benefit model where without and with intervention scenarios were compared using a total of 58 herd parameters. These variables included in the spreadsheets in the model could be varied during each year of projection period. Production turnoff of 3 herds each of 245 cows in three scenarios namely baseline, improved and future were evaluated. Input costs of imported heifers (baseline), locally raised heifers with interventions (improved) and projected 10 year (future) and the income generated from these scenarios were analyzed. Results: Total income generated from baseline, improved and the future projection were KD 268, 715 /-, 281, 246 /-and 342, 251 /-respectively (1 KD Kuwaiti Dinar = US $ 3. 45); total operating costs of these scenarios were KD 249, 372 /-, 242, 276 /-and 205, 929 /-respectively.

40|$|Information was {{collected}} on cow and sire breeds in both dairy and suckler herds in the National Farm Survey (NFS) in autumn 1998. The {{number of farms}} {{included in the analysis}} was 1030 with farms containing less than 2 economic size units (equivalent to 3 to 4 dairy cows) excluded from the sample. The main findings of the survey were as follows: • Ninety-eight percent of dairy cows and 96 % of dairy <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> were Friesian/Holstein • The suckler cow herd contained 46 % early-maturing breed crosses (Hereford 31 %, Aberdeen Angus 12 % and Shorthorn 3 %) 2 % Friesians, 48 % of the three main continental breed crosses (Charolais 17 %, Simmental 16 %, Limousin 15 %) and 4 % other (mainly continental crosses). Compared to the adult cows <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> had less early-maturing breed crosses and Friesians (total 42 %) and more (55 %) of the three main continental breed crosses (Charolais 20 %, Simmental 15 %, Limousin 20 %). • Overall, in 1998, it was estimated that the national cow herd consisted of 52 % Friesian/Holstein, 23 % early maturing breed crosses and 26 % late maturing breed crosses. • Forty-seven percent of dairy cows were bred to Friesian/Holstein sires, 26 % were bred to early maturing sire breeds and 27 % were bred to continental sire breeds. The corresponding figure for dairy <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> were 40 %, 46 % and 13 %. • Seventeen percent of suckler cows were bred to early maturing sire breeds, 46 % were bred to Charolais, 16 % were bred to Simmental, 17 % were bred to Limousin and the remaining 6 % were bred to mainly other continental breed sires. The sires used on suckler <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> were 43 % early maturing breeds, 16 % Charolais, 10 % Simmental, 25 % Limousin and 5 % other. • Based on the sire breeds used in 1998, the breed composition of the 1999 calf crop was estimated to be 24 % Friesian/Holstein, 24 % early maturing breeds, 24 % Charolais cross, 10 % Simmental cross, 12 % Limousin cross and 6 % other (mainly other continental crosses). • Although the proportion of continental breed crosses in the calf crop continues to increase (48 % in 1993 to 52 % in 1999), the use of continental sire breeds is declining in the dairy herd (from 33 % in 1992 to 27 % in 1998), particularly where AI is the method of breeding. However, this trend may be at an end as the 1999 AI figures to date (September 30) show substantial decreases in Hereford and Aberdeen Angus inseminations with increases in Belgian Blue, Limousin and Friesian/Holstein. • The dairy herd is a relatively unimportant source of the better quality animals accounting for only 25 % of total continental breed crosses which have a lower proportion of continental breed genes than those from the suckler herd. • It was estimated that the 1999 calf crop from the suckler herd consisted of 18 % early maturing breeds, 29 % of half to threequarters continental breed genes and 53 % containing at least three-quarters continental breed genes. • A total of 48, 200 herds used bulls. The proportion of bulls of each breed used were 9 % Frieisan/Holstein, 17 % Hereford, 11 % Aberdeen Angus, 1 % Shorthorn, 29 % Charolais, 12 % Simmental, 16 % Limousin and 5 % other. Continental breeds accounted for 38 % and 84 % of bulls on dairy and suckler farm, respectively. • In the present study the number of animals (cows plus replacements) bred to continental sire breeds was 1. 22 million of which 40 % were by AI. • National AI figures show that the total number of inseminations (excluding DIY) have declined from 1. 03 million in 1992 to 0. 79 million in 1998. • Assuming that the suckler cow should be at least half continental breeding and that Belgian Blue crosses are unsuitable if increases in calving problems are to be avoided then the dair y herd may provide as little as 25 % of suitable suckler <b>herd</b> <b>replacements.</b> Thus, the main source of replacements would be from within the suckler herd. Factors to be considered include hybrid vigour which involves crossbreeding, milk production potential of the cow {{and the fact that the}} most widely used terminal sire is Charolais. In these circumstances one suitable crossbred cow would be obtained from alternate crossing with Limousin and Simmental sires. • Heat synchronisation was used on 3 % of herds. The figures for dairy and suckler herds was 6. 8 % and 0. 5 %, respectively. • Vaccination for leptospirosis was used on 29 % of dairy farms and 4 % of suckler farms.

40|$|Background: The {{degree and}} time frame of {{indirect}} effects of vaccination (serotype <b>replacement</b> and <b>herd</b> immunity) are key determinants {{in assessing the}} net effectiveness of vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in control of pneumococcal disease. Using modelling, we aimed to quantify these effects and their dependence on coverage of vaccination and the vaccine’s efficacy against susceptibility to pneumococcal carriage. Methods and Findings: We constructed an individual-based simulation model that explores the effects of large-scale PCV programmes and applied it in a developed country setting (Finland). A population structure with transmission of carriage taking place within relevant mixing groups (families, day care groups, schools and neighbourhoods) was considered in order to properly assess the dependency of herd immunity on coverage of vaccination and vaccine efficacy against carriage. Issues regarding potential serotype replacement were addressed by employing a novel competition structure between multiple pneumococcal serotypes. Model parameters were calibrated from pre-vaccination data about the age-specific carriage prevalence and serotype distribution. The model predicts that elimination of vaccine-type carriage and disease among those vaccinated and, due to a substantial herd effect, also among the general population takes place within 5 – 10 years since the onset of a PCV programme with high (90 %) coverage of vaccination and moderate (50 %) vaccine efficacy against acquisition of carriage.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the characteristic of 40 cow-calf producers randomly selected from a county population of 300 cattlemen, to find out which recommended management practices they were using, and to learn which factors had influenced them to adopt these practices. _ Farmers were interviewed and data were classified in terms of high, medium, and low production groups based on average number of pounds of beef sold per cow in 1970 [...] Regarding management practices, it was found that high producers kept <b>replacement</b> heifers, increased <b>herd</b> size, averaged a higher management level, and were using other recommended practices in comparison to low producers. Characteristics of cattlemen (high and low producers), management practices, and reasons for adoption of such practices provided a basis for development of a useful educational plan for use with cow-calf producers in Marshall County, Tennessee. (A sixteen-item list of references is provided, as is a table which presents average and total beef management practice diffusion ratings by high, medium, and low producers for cattlemen interviewed.)

40|$|The {{objectives}} of an excellent dairy <b>herd</b> <b>replacement</b> program are well defined. A long-standing age of first calving recommendation has been 23 to 24 months to maximize profitability. Numerous {{studies and evaluations}} (5, 6, 9) have demonstrated the advantages of 24 month calving ages. Critical {{to the success of}} 24 month calving age is proper calving weight, height, and body condition score. Hoffman and Funk (8) defined these criteria in an evaluation of high producing dairy herds (RHA> 22, 000 lb). Holstein replacement heifers in high producing herds had an average weight, height, and condition score at calving of 1375 lb, 54. 1 in, and 3. 5, respectively (Table 1). Replacement heifers on commercial farms surveyed by Hoffman and Funk had prepuberty (3 to 10 months) growth rates of 1. 8 lbs/d and postpuberty growth rates of 1. 7 lbs/d. Holtz (9) reported identical growth rates of Holstein replacement heifers from high producing (22, 500 lbs/lactation) New York dairy herds. II.

40|$|Pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccination {{has proved}} highly effective in eliminating vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage and disease. However, the potential {{adverse effects of}} serotype replacement remain a major concern when implementing routine childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programmes. Applying a concise predictive model, we present a ready-to-use quantitative tool to investigate the implications of serotype replacement on the net effectiveness of vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and to guide {{in the selection of}} optimal vaccine serotype compositions. We utilise pre-vaccination data on pneumococcal carriage and IPD and assume partial or complete elimination of vaccine-type carriage, its replacement by non-vaccine-type carriage, and stable case-to-carrier ratios (probability of IPD per carriage episode). The model predicts that the post-vaccination IPD incidences in Finland for currently available vaccine serotype compositions can eventually decrease among the target age group of children < 5 years of age by 75 %. However, due to <b>replacement</b> through <b>herd</b> effects, the decrease among the older population is predicted to be much less (20 - 40 %). We introduce a sequential algorithm for the search of optimal serotype compositions and assess the robustness of inferences to uncertainties in data and assumptions about carriage and IPD. The optimal serotype composition depends on the age group of interest and some serotypes may be highly beneficial vaccine types in one age category (e. g. 6 B in children), while being disadvantageous in another. The net effectiveness will be improved only if the added serotype has a higher case-to-carrier ratio than the average case-to-carrier ratio of the current non-vaccine types and the degree of improvement in effectiveness depends on the carriage incidence of the serotype. The serotype compositions of currently available pneumococcal vaccines are not optimal and the effectiveness of vaccination in the population at large could be improved by including new serotypes in the vaccine (e. g. 22 and 9 N) ...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -year study (1997 - 2000) was {{performed}} on 294 swine herds from Italy, where a National Programme of Control of Aujeszky's Disease (AD) based on compulsory vaccination has been operative since 1997. Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the progress of this control programme using a survival approach applied to gE-seropositive herds at the beginning of the programme. The cumulative proportion of herds still gE-seropositive at the end of the study was 0. 57. No significant difference in the probability of becoming gE-seronegative during the study period was found between herds of different type (breeding versus farrow-to-finish) whereas significant differences were seen between herds from different areas. The Cox's proportional hazards regression, performed on data from 79 herds, showed that the only risk factor significantly associated with a higher probability of becoming gE-seronegative is again the geographical location. Other risk factors considered in the analysis were: type of enterprise, type of <b>replacement</b> of animals, <b>herd</b> size, pig and pig herds densities around the farm, distance from the nearest pig herd and year of beginning of the vaccination with a gE-deleted vaccine...|$|R
