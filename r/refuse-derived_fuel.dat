The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the syngas compositions of used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs in the downdraft type fixed bed gasification system. It is found that used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs can be successfully converted to generate the syngas consisting of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, hydrogen sulfide oxygen and water vapor. The performance of the downdraft type fixed bed gasification system is evaluated in terms of the composition of syngas and the rate of carbon monoxide production. The result can be concluded that syngas produced from the used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs is the same. The HHV (Higher Heating Value) of the syngas from the unused-plastic-waste RDF (781 kJ/Nm 3) is slightly higher than that of the used one (500 kJ/Nm 3). It is also suggested that the gasification of used- and unused-plastic-waste RDFs is a clean alternative to fossil fuels.

50|$|Biodrying is {{the process}} by which {{biodegradable}} waste is rapidly heated through initial stages of composting to remove moisture from a waste stream and hence reduce its overall weight. In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption. It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner. This enables reduced costs of disposal if landfill is charged on a cost per tonne basis. Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for <b>refuse-derived</b> <b>fuels.</b> Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce landfill gas and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils LATS allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.|$|R

40|$|Problems {{and options}} for those organisations contemplating {{changes in their}} refuse-disposal {{policies}} and processes are reviewed. Controlled incineration is potentially the safest method of destroying the more toxic industrial wastes such as PCBs, which are especially persistent. The use of the resulting hot gases to produce superheated steam to drive a turbine and thereby generate electricity can be a bonus. Factors influencing the incineration of either raw municipal waste or <b>refuse-derived</b> <b>fuels</b> are discussed and two quite different types of incinerator design are described and their characteristics compared. The first type, which employs a reciprocating grate, is simple, effective and capable of burning untreated refuse, albeit with rather low combustion efficiencies. The second type, which uses a fluidised-bed incinerator, is also thought capable of burning untreated refuse, although the pelletised combustible components would be preferred. In addition, the fluidised bed requires more complicated control of the combustion reactions, {{with the result that}} higher combustion temperatures and efficiencies can thus be achieved. In essence, effective incineration of refuse requires highly sophisticated machinery, expensive pollution-control equipment and high standards of management. The incomplete incineration of wastes at temperatures below 1100 Â°C can lead to the formation of dangerous end-products, for example, partially-burned PCBs can give rise to dioxins and di-benzofurans, which are also highly toxic substances. ...|$|R

Further research could enhance the confidence in the ability of MBT plants to produce a quality-assured SRF suitable for specific end-users, without contradicting the wider requirement for an overall sustainable management of resources...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} and practical method for characterizing <b>refuse-derived</b> <b>fuels</b> (RDF) {{with respect to}} greenhouse gas-relevance (or biomass content) is required by industries and waste management companies. As RDF usually consist {{of a variety of}} materials with different physical properties, sampling and sample preparation may represent crucial steps with regard to reliable analysis results. This is particularly valid for analytical methods, which rely on only small test specimens (centigrams), such as the adapted Balance Method (aBM). The aBM was recently developed by the authors and is based on elemental analyses (CHNSO). The investigations focus on elaborating an appropriate sample preparation for the aBM. To this end, two RDF model mixtures are generated out of paper, cardboard and different plastics, and comminuted down to a grain of size of < 0. 2 mm using two differing mills as finishing step. The results of the aBM (applied for 52 samples) show that the performance of the method in terms of trueness and variation is competitive relative to standardized methods. Deviations between the determined value and the theoretical biogenic mass fraction are below 4. 5 %rel (at a probability of 95 %). Furthermore, the standard deviation for both mixtures is below ± 3. 0 %rel. A nested variance component analysis indicates that the last milling step and the step of drawing the test specimens for analysis contribute most to the observed variability. A consecutive application of two types of mills as a finishing step prior to analysis is proposed in order to facilitate a sufficient grinding of plastics as well as of cellulose fibers...|$|R

40|$|In firing {{systems of}} cement {{production}} plants and coal-fired power plants, regular fossil fuels are increasingly substituted by alternative fuels. Rising energy prices and ambitious CO 2 -reduction goals promote {{the use of}} alternative fuels as {{a significant contribution to}} efficient energy recovery. One possibility to protect energy resources are <b>refuse-derived</b> <b>fuels</b> (RDF), which are produced during the treatment of municipal solid, commercial and industrial waste. The waste fractions suitable for RDF have a high calorific value and are often not suitable for material recycling. With current treatment processes, RDF still contains components which impede the utilization in firing systems or limit the degree of substitution. The content of these undesired components may amount to 4 wt%. These, in most cases incombustible particles which consist of mineral, ceramic and metallic materials can cause damages in the conveying systems (e. g. rotary feeder) or result in contaminations of the products (e. g. cement, chalk). Up-to-date separation processes (sieve machine, magnet separator or air classifier) have individual weaknesses that could hamper a secure separation of these particles. This article describes a new technology for the separation of impurities from refuse derived fuels based on a rotating fluidized bed. In this concept a rotating motion of the particle bed is obtained by the tangential injection of the fluidization gas in a static geometry. The RDF-particles experience a centrifugal force which fluidized the bed radially. The technical principle allows tearing up of particle clusters to single particles. Radially inwards the vertical velocity is much lower thus particles of every description can fall down there. For the subsequent separation of the particles by form and density an additionally cone shaped plate was installed in the centre. Impurities have a higher density and a compact form compared to combustible particles and can be separated with a high efficiency. The new technology was experimentally investigated and proven using model-RDF, actual-RDF and impurities of different densities. In addition, numerical simulations were also done. The fluidization chamber was operated in batch mode. The article describes experiences and difficulties in using rotating fluidized bed systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{fundamental}} fire properties of surrogate <b>refuse-derived</b> <b>fuels</b> (RDF), {{a class of}} multicomponent materials characterized by high void fraction, with particles of polydisperse sizes and significant internal porosity. A surrogate RDF was developed to improve the reproducibility of experimental measurements. This surrogate RDF reflects typical municipal solid waste collected {{in the city of}} Newcastle, in the state of New South Wales in Australia. The material consists of shredded newspaper, wood, grass and plastic bags, with small amounts of sugar and bread. About 95 % of the material passes through 50 mm square screens, as required by ASTM E 828 standard for RDF- 3 specification. The experiments presented in this paper were performed with the components of the RDF dried in a forced-air oven at 103 ° C, except for grass which was dried under nitrogen. The material was found to be very hygroscopic, requiring special care in handling. The experiments performed in the cone calorimeter were designed to measure the heat release rate, total heat release, time to ignition, time to extinction, effective heat of combustion and formation of CO during the combustion process, as a function of sample thickness, sample density and the magnitude of the imposed radiative heat flux. The thermophysical properties of the surrogate material were either measured (solid density, void space, particle density, particle porosity) or extracted from the published data (heat capacity). The present surrogate RDF material was found to ignite easily, within a few seconds of the imposition of the incident heat flux of 40 kW m - 2, and then to reach rapidly the peak heat release rate of 110 - 165 kW m - 2. The deduced values of the critical heat flux, pyrolysis temperature and effective thermal conductivity are 9 - 10 (± 2) kW m - 2, 280 - 310 (± 30) ° C, and 0. 4 - 0. 7 (± 0. 3) Wm - 1 K - 1, respectively, depending on the material density. The effective heat of combustion of the RDF was estimated as 15. 3 MJ kg - 1. The material produced 1 kg of CO per 18 kg of dried RDF, mostly during smouldering phase after the extinguishment of the flaming combustion. These results indicate that dried RDF pose significant fire risks, requiring that fire safety systems be implemented in facilities handling RDF...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work aims {{to provide}} information on solid biomass conversion into gaseous fuel (syngas) {{as a result of}} an air and steam gasification process. Contrary to conventional low temperature gasification, in this work highly preheated air and steam are used as gasifying agent. Preheating of air and steam is realized by means of the modern High Cycle Regenerative Heat Exchanger. Maximum temperature of preheated air or steam is 1350 C. In this work the laboratory gasification plant with a flow rate of preheated air or steam equal to 110 Nm 3 /h is used. Use of highly preheated gasifying media provides additional energy in the pre-destruction stage, which enhances the thermal decomposition characteristics of the biomass, thus higher calorific value syngas is produced. The scientific objective of this work was {{to provide information}} on conversion rate and stoichiometry of the biomass to fuel gas at different operating conditions. This information is needed to derive guidelines on the design and development of the next generation fuel gas generators in which high quality syngas is produced. The experimental programme addresses the key questions that are urgently required in the development of high temperature gasification systems for clean and efficient production of syngas from biomass and wastes. High Temperature Air/Steam Gasification has very clear economical and environmental benefits. It will increase consumption of biomass (like wood pellets) thus decreasing CO 2 emissions from energy-intensive industries and creating more jobs in forest industry. Apart from the obvious increase in CO 2 reduction possibility the new process, High Temperature Gasification of wastes, fulfils all new regulations proposed by the European Commission on wastes incineration since: - no landfilling of ash residues is required, - no need to treat ashes from gasification since there is no ash produced but only slag which is non-leachable and can be used as building material, - clean gas for combustion and production of heat or electricity. In this project only gasification of wood pellets and biomass wastes in a fixed bed gasifier is tested. However, the conclusions will be very helpful in further development of the high temperature air/steam gasification for another type of wastes as for example: automotive shredder residues, municipal solid wastes, <b>refuse-derived</b> <b>fuels</b> or sewage sludge. Methodology of experiments is based on the work already performed at KTH/Energy and Furnace Technology. Low Temperature Air Gasification (LTAG) facilities have already been in operation since 1999. The original methodology of experiments allows one to obtain accurate on-line data on conversion rate of gasified material into gas phase as well as stoichiometry.
