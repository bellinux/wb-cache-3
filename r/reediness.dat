50|$|With {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} in Croatia at the end of 1995 Croatia inherited large stockpile of Yugoslav era weapons systems. Decision was made to modify two battalions of D-30 HR M94 Soviet-made artillery systems to be compatible with NATO firing tables as an interim and cheap solution, with rest of the artillery stockpile kept in prepared state of <b>reediness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Los Albertos are a Brighton-based Ska punk band. While their guitar sound {{ranges from}} chicken scratch to Carlos Santana, and the horns veer from wall of brass to kelzma <b>reediness</b> in their riotous, joyous sound, lyrics cast the net far and wide.The band has {{produced}} 3 albums and have toured Europe and the UK, and played at numerous festivals including Glastonbury Festival. Some professional producers such as Al Scott who {{also worked with}} English rock band, The Levellers have worked with the band.In January 2009, Nic Tribe, the band's bassist {{decided to leave the}} band to pursue his own direction. The band later replaced Nic with Jim Gallagher briefly, before full-time member Adam Futcher joined up.|$|E
40|$|E-training style {{requires}} a strong readiness level among industrial workers {{in order to}} ensure that gain its optimum advantages. The purpose of the study is to explore analytically how the demographic factors affect the computer usage attitude, computer literacy, computer facility and access technology. The study also explores analytically the e-training readiness level in terms of computer usage attitude, computer literacy, computer facility and access technology among industrial workers. Four hundreds industrial workers from electronic industries, food industries, poultry industries, and textile industries in Batu Pahat, Johore were involved in this study. The data were collected using questionnaires and were analyzed quantitatively. Through multiple regression analysis, the finding showed that some demographic factors (worker characteristics and work place) were significant at predicting the computer usage attitude, computer facility and technology access. the finding also showed that there was a high level of e-training readiness among industrial workers in the aspect of computer usage attitude. But the aspect of computer literacy, computer facility, and technology access showed only a moderate level of <b>reediness.</b> In general, the e-training readiness level of among industrial workers is still moderate. This situation should be overcome {{in order to ensure}} that the e-training approach has been emphasized in Malaysia Occupational Skills Development and Training Master Plan 2008 - 2020 would be implement successfully. Therefore, some suggestion for improvement have been presented toward enhance the e-training readiness among industrial workers...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of death in the western world. Cancer is an {{umbrella}} term for over 100 different diseases all caused by mutations in cells leading to uncontrolled cell division and metastasis. The control of the cell division is extremely important in order to maintain homeostasis and avoid development of cancer. The cells in the body have to communicate with each other to keep homeostasis. This can subsequently regulate the cell cycle that controls cell division. Many proteins are involved in the control mechanisms to pass the cell through the cycle where phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are important mechanism for regulation. The cell division is also controlled by tumor suppressors that sense, for example, DNA damage or cell stress, to ascertain <b>reediness</b> for cell division and to minimize the amount of mutations. Two important proteins in the cell signaling are Protein Phosphatase 2 A that act as switch for the pocket proteins that control the cell cycle, and p 53 which is labeled “the guardian of the genome”, both are tumor suppressor. Protein Phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A), is together with PP 1 responsible for 90 % of all dephosphorylation events in the cell. Apart from controlling the cell cycle PP 2 A is involved in many other pathways making it a very important protein in cell signaling. Understanding its structure and function is crucial for understanding how it works at the molecular level and how difference cancer mutations are affecting its mechanism of action. PP 2 A consists of three subunits, a scaffolding (A), a catalytic (C) and a regulatory (B) for substrate recognition. In this thesis the structure and biochemical function of one of the regulatory subunits, B’’/PR 70, is presented, a subunit who’s structure was unknown before the start of the doctoral project. A high-resolution structure of the core revealed 8 EF-hands where two were binding calcium. A mapping of the A-B’’ interaction is also presented. p 53 is a common tumor suppressor that is mutated in 50 % of all cancer tumors. It is involved in key decisions for cell cycle progression and apoptosis and more detailed understanding of this protein could shed light on the role of different p 53 mutations in cancer. P 53 is acting as a transcription factor and has a DNA binding core domain that binds to a response element on the target gene. In this thesis, a novel method to study biochemical events in cells and cell extract is applied for the first time on p 53, the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA). It is shown that p 53 -DNA can indeed be studied using this strategy and that binding profiles to four different oligonucleotides representing target genes with response elements, give distinct profiles for each mutation. This suggest that the CETSA strategy allows for more detailed functional studies of p 53 in cells and that oligonucleotide profiling might constitute a novel mean to profile cancer patient cells for differential p 53 activity...|$|E
