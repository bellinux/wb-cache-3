40|$|Risk {{stratification}} {{in primary}} myelofibrosis is currently {{based on two}} international prognostic scoring systems, neither of which takes into consideration <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion-dependency. In 288 consecutive patients with primary myelofibrosis, <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion-dependency at diagnosis affects survival independently of the International Prognostic Scoring System (P < 0. 001). To evaluate the dynamic impact on survival of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion-dependency, we performed a Cox's regression analysis with transfusion status as time-dependent covariate in 220 regularly followed patients with primary myelofibrosis.

DATA SOURCES: Review of the literature, including PubMed, citations from relevant articles, and some articles that have been particularly relevant in adult critical care practice regarding packed <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The use of packed <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusions is common in the pediatric intensive care unit setting. However, until recently there have been little data to guide providers in this practice. Studies in adult intensive care units have shown less favorable outcomes in patients who received packed <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusions.

40|$|Association {{of reduced}} <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> {{deformability}} and diabetic nephropathy. BackgroundImpaired <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability {{may play a}} key role in the pathogenesis of chronic vascular complications of diabetes mellitus and progression of renal failure. The present study was conducted to test whether impaired <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability is indeed associated with development of diabetic nephropathy. MethodsWe studied 57 adult type 2 diabetic patients divided into three groups according to serum creatinine concentration. Group I comprised 28 diabetic patients with normal renal function (serum creatinine concentration < 1. 5 mg/dL, mean 1. 0 ± 0. 3 mg/dL). Group II comprised 10 diabetic patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration ranging from 2 to 6 mg/dL, mean 3. 9 ± 1. 54 mg/dL). Group III consisted of 19 diabetic subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (serum creatinine concentration ranging from 7. 7 to 14. 6 mg/dL, mean 10. 1 ± 2. 4 mg/dL). In addition, 11 (mean serum creatinine concentration 4. 2 ± 1. 5 mg/dL) and 10 (mean serum creatinine concentration 11. 5 ± 3. 6 mg/dL) nondiabetic individuals, matched renal function for the diabetic groups (group II and III, respectively) served as control. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability, measured by filtration technique, is defined as the filtration rate of erythrocyte suspension through a micropore filter divided by the filtration rate of a physiologic buffer solution. ResultsIn the diabetic cohort, we found substantially impaired <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability in those with normal renal function (group I). With further renal function loss, an increased impairment in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability was observed. Diabetic patients with renal insufficiency (group II) when compared to non-diabetic controls (renal insufficiency) had a significantly greater impairment in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability (P = 0. 01). The nondiabetic cohort (renal insufficiency), on the other hand, manifested significant impairment in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability. Their degree of impairment was statistically higher than that in diabetic patients with normal renal function (P = 0. 0005). Interestingly, there was a progressive increase in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability impairment, along with progression of renal insufficiency, and thus no significant difference in the degree of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability impairment was observed between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with ESRD (P = 0. 52). There is significant correlation between serum creatinine and impairment in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability in both diabetic (group II plus III) (r = 0. 43, P = 0. 02) and nondiabetic (r = 0. 62, P = 0. 003) cohorts. ConclusionIn diabetic patients, early impairment in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability appears in patients with normal renal function, and progressive impairment in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deformability is associated with renal function loss in all patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes...|$|R
