5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an {{opposition}} surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E

5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this.

An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E

40|$|To date {{there has}} been little {{exploratory}} research about the experience of trainee clinical psychologists. What is not known from the literature is how trainee clinical psychologists perceive reflective practice within clinical training and how the process of being a ‘novice’ alongside the increased introspection <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> practice feels in terms of self-concept. The first chapter of the thesis reviews the relevant literature investigating the use <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> practice within mental health settings. The review indicates that although reflective practice might offer some valuable contributions to working in these settings there are often difficulties with ongoing implementation. A number of methodological limitations of the studies are discussed and the implications <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> practice for professional practice are considered. Chapter two presents an empirical study that explores trainee clinical psychologists’ experiences <b>of</b> <b>reflective</b> practice within the setting of clinical training, using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.

Although the divisional structure evolved {{over the course of}} the war, each formation also included a range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and administrative units. By 1918 each brigade also included a light trench mortar battery, while each division included a pioneer battalion, a machine-gun battalion, two field artillery brigades, a divisional trench mortar brigade, four companies of engineers, a divisional signals company, a divisional train consisting of four service corps companies, a salvage company, three field ambulances, a sanitary section and a mobile veterinary section.
