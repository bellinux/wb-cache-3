50|$|The project {{critically}} analyses (re)emergent and contested regionalisms {{in an area}} {{of global}} geo-strategic political concern and one of great and increasing significance: the Indian Ocean Region. It documents current attempts at building pan and sub-regional identities and institutions - with particular reference to the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), currently the most ambitious <b>region-building</b> venture. Non-traditional security approaches will be particularly investigated as means of building bridges and creating regional dialogues. Finally, the project analyses how various notions of regionalism can be used to facilitate the process of ‘building’ an Indian Ocean region.|$|E

One {{of the most important}} associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the Caribbean Basin has been the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Proposed by CARICOM in 1992, the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region. It was founded in July 1994. The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues unique to the Caribbean Basin. Through coalition building, like the ACS and CARICOM, regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean. The successes of <b>region-building</b> initiatives are still debated by scholars, yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the early}} 1990s, Tunander wrote on {{military}} strategy, confidence-building measures, <b>region-building</b> and US remaking of world order. He headed a Nordic study group, [...] "A new Europe", from mid-1980s with Ole Wæver, Iver B. Neumann, Sverre Jervell, and Espen Barth Eide. Robert Bathurst (PRIO and U.S. Naval Postgraduate School) and Tunander initiated Norwegian-Russian dialogue seminars {{in the early}} 1990s. In 1994, he co-edited a volume on the post-Cold War regional cooperation in Arctic Europe, The Barents Region. Tunander wrote contributions about Northern Europe, Nordic Cooperation, and Scandinavism published by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swedish Olof Palme International Center. He contributed to the Russian journal International Affairs. Tunander wrote and edited two Swedish books on power, identity, and territory and co-edited Geopolitics in Post-Wall Europe (1997). Some of these books were on the reading lists for universities and military colleges in Europe and the United States, {{and a number of}} these projects were carried out for the Norwegian ministries of defence and foreign affairs. After 2000, he organized Nordic-Chinese dialogue conferences with the Chinese Institute of International Studies and the Nordic peace research and international affairs institutes. He also participated in a Washington dialogue. His new focus on China might be explained by his marriage with Yao Xiaoling, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Chinese reform policy.|$|E
40|$|The {{promotion}} of regionalisation {{is part of}} the foreign policy of the European Union (EU). However, a closer understanding of the mechanisms by which its policies work towards this goal is lacking. Taking the South Caucasus as a case, this paper asks how the Eastern Partnership contributes to <b>region-building.</b> Based on policy analysis, discourse analysis and interviews, the study adopts a four-layered understanding of <b>region-building</b> as the {{promotion of}} closer cross-border contacts: Regarding economic linkages, the analysis underlines Georgia’s gateway function. On political linkages, the analysis assigns importance to regulatory harmonisation as a bottom-up tool against divisive regional discourses. Cross-border management fulfils a similar technical role for the promotion of security linkages. Concerning cultural linkages, Georgia is analysed as a hub for common socialisation and people-to-people contacts. Derived from these findings, the paper induces three general hypotheses about the mechanisms of EU contributions to region-building: while combining bilateral with multilateral approaches and functional spill-over effects contribute to <b>region-building,</b> the inclusion of non-state actors does not advance <b>region-building...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{starting}} point of this introductory chapter is that <b>region-building</b> debates necessarily take place within a global context and are informed by wider patterns and trends, so {{it is important to}} examine this wider context and how it develops over time.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{regional integration}} in Central Asia {{in the context}} of two types of knowledge, that is, knowing-that and knowing-how. While knowing-that prioritizes representational (i. e. “talking”) practices of actors to explain <b>region-building</b> processes, knowing-how focuses on non-representational (i. e. “doing”) practices. The article demonstrates that the orthodox scholars, who deal with the region of Central Asia, mostly employ knowing-that to explain <b>region-building</b> processes. The article criticizes knowing-that, assuming that this type of knowledge limits our understanding with regard to how regions get their boundaries and symbolism in the era of globalization and standardization of sectoral activities. Thus the article develops and introduces an alternative knowing-how framework to better understand the <b>region-building</b> processes in Central Asia and beyond it...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} {{focuses on}} the making and unmaking of cross-border micro-regions in Africa. Its main emphasis is that micro-regions are not givens, but are constructed and reconstructed through social practice, political economy and, in discourse, {{by a variety of}} states, corporations and non-state actors. The region-builders are the focus [...] that is, those actors that build and make micro-regions and their associated <b>region-building</b> strategies. Key research questions are: for whom, for what purpose and with what consequences are micro-regions being made and unmade? There is also special emphasis on how people on the ground and local communities create their own <b>region-building</b> strategies and how they respond to the <b>region-building</b> strategies of others. The case studies [...] by leading scholars of African studies and the result of extensive fieldwork [...] include a wide selection of micro-regions all over Africa, such as the Maputo Development Corridor, the Zambezi Valley region, the Zambia-Malawi-Mozambique Growth Triangle, Walvis Bay, the Sierra Leone-Liberia border zone, cross-border micro-regions on the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes region, North Africa, and so forth.

40|$|This article {{describes}} how <b>region-building</b> is performed by four strategic planning initiatives in north-eastern Slovakia, highlighting {{a tension between}} balanced and concentrated development perspectives in Slovak regional policy. The plans are read as records of an institutionalizing process, the product {{of which is the}} creation of a lasting collaborative relationship between actors. If strategic planning could fulfil a mobilizing and integrating function in eastern Slovakia, it would constitute a significant contribution to the successful negotiation of social and economic transformations associated with post-communist structural change and European Union (EU) accession. <b>Region-building</b> is complicated by an over-emphasis on endogenous perspectives among local actors, hindering vertical integration, and an indeterminacy about the scale at which such an integration is best performed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{starts out}} with the {{hypothesis}} that the integration process in Europe is connected to cross-border régionalisation, a process which supports the institutionalization of subnational cross-border cooperation - <b>region-building.</b> Cross-border régionalisation is characterized by the decentralisation of vertical links and enhanced opportunities for horizontal links across state borders. In addition, political integration is expected to have some impact on the cross-border institutional forms that emerge at the subnational level. Three different approaches are utilized in order to establish the empirical connection between political integration and <b>region-building.</b> These are: an analysis of the factors which determine the general pattern of cross-border cooperation in Europe, an analysis of the policy network related to the regional and structural policies of the European Union (EU), and case studies of cooperation in the heartland of Europe, the Regio Basiliensis along the external border of the EU, and the EUREGIO along one of the internal borders. Two institutional factors are found to {{have a significant impact on}} the number of subnational cross-border cooperations, EU-membership and centrality. Federal constitution was shown not to be significant. It is suggested that the interaction between actors at different politico- administrative levels creates network relations, which typically bring both private and public actors together. More precisely, <b>region-building</b> is described as the outcome of the interaction which takes place between actors. A closer examination of the emerging policy network shows that community initiatives, the Interreg-programme in particular, improve the prospects for multi­level interaction. The EU plays a crucial role in providing the incentives for cooperation by increasing resource dependency and by establishing direct ties between the European Commission and a large number of subnational actors through partnerships. It appears as if the Commission wishes to demonstrate its capacity to deal with problems relevant to individual citizens. By, in part, bypassing central governments, it seems to increase its own importance vis- à-vis member states. The modus vivendi of cross-border <b>region-building</b> and régionalisation is the degree to which institutional actors at different levels share the same objectives. As shown by the case studies, there is a common interest in cross-border cooperation up to the point were public statues are introduced. Interests seem to coincide as long as the structures and contents of cross-border cooperation do not ultimately challenge the authority of state institutions. Therefore, it is not surprising that it seems impossible to give cross-border regions any rights under international law. Functional cooperation, rather than regionalist manifestations of cultural or political unity across borders, constitutes the backbone of <b>region-building.</b> Activities transcending borders are less controversial than those that may contribute to the establishment of new borders. It is concluded that <b>region-building</b> is a process which is embedded in the institutionalization of a multi-level interaction pattern. More favourable multilevel relations have been achieved through the transfer of some authority to the supranational level. This is the main reason why traditional integration theory fails to explain why there is a connection between political integration and cross-border cooperation. digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|Brazil’s recent inroads towards Africa reflect one façade of the country’s greater aspirations. Ranging from {{technical}} cooperation projects and a push for dynamic commercial relations to {{the promotion of}} inter-regional dialogues, Brazil’s presence in Africa also comprises initiatives in the security realm. Not receiving matching attention, endeavors in the security domain reveal Brazil’s aspiration of building the South Atlantic as a region in which South America and Africa can foster common ground, preclude extra-regional powers, secure maritime resources and develop naval defense industry. Amidst this background, I argue Brazil engaged in securitization practices {{in order to promote}} shared understandings and cooperation in both sides of the South Atlantic. In this work, I confront bilateral cooperation projects with African partners with the recent multilateral revitalization of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic (ZOPACAS) in order to attest to which extent Brazil was able to succeed in <b>region-building</b> practices and could conform a coherent grand strategy. The conclusion confirms the existence of a disconnection between the bilateral and multilateral dimensions of Brazil’s engagements, which undermines the <b>region-building</b> process and minimizes the ability of this country to act in the South Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, {{publications}} within the ‘‘new regional geography’’ have given little emphasis to cartography. This paper examines the specific role of mapping, its political stakes and modalities, in the <b>region-building</b> process. It illustrates this with an analysis of mapping and database production in the institutionalization process of two ‘‘project regions’’— the Alps and Carpathian mountains — and in two related, on-going efforts to promote macro-regional strategies. This paper argues that the production of maps and databases deserves to be seen {{not only as a}} technical moment, or simply as one output among others in the <b>region-building</b> process, but rather as a component of the process itself, a component that is especially decisive and complex in that it makes explicit the connection between the territorial and the relational dimensions of region-making. The two cases illustrate that mapping is a significant component of the region-making process for three main reasons: (1) it gives shape to the region, provides arguments for its construction, and therefore is a decisive cognitive and rhetorical tool for territorialization; (2) it contributes to the shaping of relational arrangements for the corresponding region; (3) its contribution is important at all different stages in the region-making process – conceptualization, creation, and consolidation – through various modalitie...|$|E
40|$|The {{article has}} as a {{starting}} point the fact that regions are one of the central political topics of today. Though regions have certain roots in history, they were not politicized until the nineteenth century, when they were “invented” as a tool for identity-shaping and development in the fringe areas of the state. The article operates with North Norway as a case in analyzing modern <b>region-building</b> processes and state regionalization strategies. This region is well suited as a case because of its particular position as a border area and its unique position in Norway’s political and economic history. The <b>region-building</b> process developed through distinct stages. In the 1970 s North Norway came close to being understood as an identity region. Since the early 1990 s, however, there have been fissures in this identity and the old regional visions have been under pressure from within as well as from without. In addition old tensions within the region have been disclosed. The most striking example is Finnmark, the northernmost county of the region, and of the nation as well, which through history has {{played a role in the}} margin. It is a kind of historical irony that the current development of the Norwegian “northern policy” programme together with the promising prospect of ocean-based oil and gas industry has put Finnmark in the forefront of future expectations...|$|E

Issues at stake involve integral approaches to regional competitiveness, social equity, housing, redevelopment, transport, the environment, public services, etc. As will be demonstrated, however, this more global set of goals is translated locally into action, resulting in highly variegated regional governance landscapes that reflect both specific socio-political and economic contexts and the historical continuity of urban governance reform processes. 1...|$|E

It then considers two meta-strategies with differing implications for global creation and forms of regulation: the WTO/GATS modelling of higher education as a world trading system, and global university rankings.

40|$|This report briefly {{examines}} EU-Russia {{relations in}} the context of the eastern neighbourhood. It contends that both the EU and Russia’s ambitions for the eastern region have evolved into two competing <b>region-building</b> projects underpinned by differing strategies, norms, instruments, and actors. Although projecting competing rationalities, the two projects, until recently, had peacefully co-existed, working around conflicting issues of political norms and economic convergence, which were not necessarily seen as insurmountable for furthering regional cooperation. Their subsequent politicisation and securitisation, as a consequence of events in Ukraine, have rendered regional partnership currently incompatible, revealing a profound lack of understanding the region by both the EU and Russia; and the EU under-exploited capacity to work co-jointly with the Eurasian Union (and Russia) vis-a-vis the region.

However outstanding at its debut, this experiment of „building” a Mediterranean region, where security and peaceful change would be brought about by the states' willingness to cooperate through multilateral mechanisms has failed.

40|$|In {{the past}} year the 2 ̆ 7 war against terror 2 ̆ 7 and {{perceptions}} of state failure within the post-colonial Pacific have sparked an Australian-led initiative to deepen and widen regional integration in Oceania.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ways in which the economy has been {{incorporated}} into the political reasoning and practice of <b>region-building</b> in the Barents Region among experts. While economic regionalism has been a key strand of studies on historic regionalism, this is not the case for the Barents Region. Yet, the natural resources of the region continue to raise high expectations about cross-border economic cooperation and development. Full appreciation of any regional development is underpinned by research and knowledge combining both political and economic considerations, but this basis is somewhat less solid in the Barents area. The knowledge base about the region and its development is therefore fragmented, limited and partial. This is an obvious problem, as many of the recent developments in the Barents Region, and also in the larger Arctic context, relate to economic opportunities, cooperation and development with implications also for political cooperation and governance. The paper analyses the development of political Barents studies from early 1990 s until today, in particular its relation with economic developments in the region. publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{persistent}} characteristics of the geography of Britain is the wide inequality that exists between its constituent regions. It is an inequality which {{has come to be}} known as the North-South divide, but this is a gestural term that refers to a geography which has in fact varied in detail and in form over at least the last two centuries. In the present period, in spite of many stated intentions and much government rhetoric to the contrary, it has on many measures grown considerably worse. This pamphlet argues that it will continue to do so unless there is a more serious engagement with the power dynamics that underlie this fundamentally unequal and undemocratic geography: dynamics that continue to return London and the South East as the centre of the nation. In the absence of both a systematic attack on the spatial concentration of power, and a radical re-imagination of the nature of regions in an age of geographical connectivity and flow, the concessions on offer in the current debate on devolution and <b>region-building</b> will amount to little more than a pin-prick in tackling the alarming regional inequality and political centrism that currently exists in Britain...|$|E
40|$|Brazil’s home {{region has}} two peculiarities: first, it is {{essentially}} fuzzy as its extension and membership have changed overtime; second, regardless of its limits, its inner core has been characterized by {{a long period of}} interstate peace. These factors have led to two outcomes: first, high politics has been conducted through diplomatic rather than military means; second, <b>region-building</b> has remained under the strictest control of the governments rather than becoming self-sustaining.

Yet, structural limitations and instrumental constraints have limited Brazilian efforts and turned South America into a still peaceful but increasingly divergent sub-region. Through an analysis of institutional overlap and policy networks, especially regarding nuclear energy and the environment, this paper shows that Brazil’s low, late and soft investment in regional security governance is explained by a combination of low regional risks, scarce domestic resources, a legalistic culture of dispute settlement, and transgovernmental networks that substitute for intense interstate cooperation and deep regional institutions...|$|E
