The MRD recommends the role of Paine Field to be as a general aviation and aerospace manufacturing airport, while discouraging other types of activities including supplemental/charter air passenger service. In 2005, Snohomish County commissioned a panel to review the MRD. That panel recommended that the MRD [...] "should not be ratified or revised, but should be retired as a policy document". In June 2008, the Snohomish County Council rejected the findings of its panel, and as in 1989, 1992, and 2001, restated its opposition to commercial air passenger services operating from Paine Field with this resolution:Reaffirm our county's commitment to preserving the existing general aviation role of Paine Field, and to pursue any and all lawful and appropriate means to discourage any action that would facilitate, directly or indirectly, use of Paine Field for scheduled air passenger service or air cargo service, which may include an interlocal agreement.|$|E

In our approach different roles are assigned to citizens. To be able to designate the different roles automatically our system needs to generate appropriate questions.

Semantic roles are hard to have clear-cut definitions. It is not always easy to determine thematic relations between two concepts. This paper aims to introduce an integrated nominal modifier system. Basically we adopt other scholars ' incisive idea in analyzing semantic roles that modify general nouns. We use the approach of building a fine-grain taxonomy of role system. The taxonomy of fine-grain thematic roles makes the <b>role</b> <b>determination</b> easier for human annotators, since the meaning of a fine-grain semantic role is self explanatory and a higher-level semantic role is described by its hyponyms. The proposed taxonomy has been attested during construction of Sinica TreeBank and HowNet definitions of nominal concepts and proven to be more applicable than conventional flat structures. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the idea}} of social network analysis, we propose a novel way to analyze movie videos from the {{perspective}} of social relationships rather than audiovisual features. To appropriately describe role’s relationships in movies, we devise a method to quantify relations and construct role’s social networks, called RoleNet. Based on RoleNet, we are able to perform semantic analysis that goes beyond conventional feature-based approaches. In this work, social relations between roles are used to be the context information of video scenes, and leading roles and the corresponding communities can be automatically determined. The results of community identification provide new alternatives in media management and browsing. Moreover, by describing video scenes with role’s context, social-relation-based story segmentation method is developed to pave a new way for this widely-studied topic. Experimental results show the effectiveness of leading <b>role</b> <b>determination</b> and community identification. We also demonstrate that the social-based story segmentation approach works much better than the conventional tempo-based method. Finally, we give extensive discussions and state that the proposed ideas provide insights into context-based video analysis.

The Gaussian kernel is widely employed in radial basis function (RBF) network, support vector machine (SVM), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), Kriging models, and so on. It is widely known that {{the width of the}} Gaussian kernel in these machine learning techniques plays an important <b>role.</b> <b>Determination</b> of the optimal width is a time-consuming task. Therefore, it is preferable to determine the width with a simple manner. In this paper, we first examine a simple estimate of the width proposed by Nakayama et al. Through the examination, four sufficient conditions for the simple estimate of the width are described. Then, a new simple estimate for the width is proposed. In order to obtain the proposed estimate of the width, all dimensions are equally scaled. A simple technique called the adaptive scaling technique is also developed. It is expected that the proposed simple method to estimate the width is applicable to wide range of machine learning techniques employing the Gaussian kernel. Through examples, the validity of the proposed simple method to estimate the width is examined. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|France {{played a}} leading role in the European Enlightenment, {{influencing}} other European countries in their thinking and development of philosophical ideas based on the emerging ideals of liberté, égalité and fraternité. Among the many topics alive in intellectual circles at the time, a debate about the education of females peaked in the 18 th century, and it is not surprising that it was a Frenchman, François Fénelon, who drew attention first through his Traité de l'éducation des filles (1687) to the lack of education for females. His countrywoman Madame de Lambert extended his argument in her Avis d’une mère à sa fille (1688 - 1692, published 1728), a lengthy essay addressed to her daughter justifying the importance and describing the nature of female education. A half century later in Germany, Sophie von La Roche published her Briefe an Lina: Ein Buch für junge Frauenzimmer[,] die ihr Herz und ihren Verstand bilden wollen in her weekly paper Pomona für Teutschlands Töchter (1783 / 84). In these letters, collected and published in book form in 1807, she described the principles of a program of education for women which would lead to a happy life. Both of these female writers were exceptions in their time and fought to establish the position of women as educated and valued members of society. This thesis contextualizes and examines their writings to answer the question to what degree they contributed to a progressive step in the education of women at the time and the cultivation of educated and critical thinking in the next female generation. Hippolyte Taine’s sociological method assumes that literature can be analyzed through its author’s life on the basis of the three key concepts, race, milieu, and moment. After applying these concepts to the life of Madame de Lambert and Sophie von La Roche through historical background and sociological analysis, a close textual examination of the two central texts proceeds with these points of emphasis in each woman’s case: biographical background and social <b>role</b> <b>determination</b> (Frauenbild und Bestimmung der Frau); accommodation to the notion of ‘pleasing’ society, the males especially, and instilling happiness in others and themselves (Gefallen und Glück); and the education and erudition of women (Bildung und Gelehrsamkeit). Their contributions to these areas of active life and intellectual debate illustrate to some extent a personal adaptation to the conventions and standards of the era, but more importantly, beyond that, a breakout from traditional ideas and practices. In sum, Madame de Lambert is seen as a pioneer in the philosophical evaluation of the intellectual strength of women, and Sophie von La Roche, as a German counterpart with an emphasis on their practical enlightened education. The comparative analysis also reveals important sociological differences between Germany and France in the 18 th century with regard to the subject of female education...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{discovery}} of the bacterium Helicobacter (H) pylori in biopsy specimens from the gastric mucosa and the confirmation of its {{key role in the}} pathogenesis of duodenal and gastric ulcer disease, and gastritis, its significant role in mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and in the occurrence of gastric cancer also offered the possibility of causal treatment of these diseases with antimicrobial agents. The aim of antimicrobial treatment is the eradication of H. pylori, the decrease of recurrences and lessening the risk of gastric cancer diseases. H. pylori infection is treated with a combination of several antimicrobials. The human stomach is a natural reservoir of H. pylori. In the prevalence of H. pylori infection, patient age, socio-economic status, living and sanitary conditions can play an important <b>role.</b> <b>Determination</b> of serum IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori and detection of the antigen in the feces of asymptomatic patients is important for epidemiologic studies. Patients and methods: The study included patients with chronic gastritis and with recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer disease referred routinely to Maribor Teaching Hospital (MTH) while the study on the identification of serum antibodies against H. pylori and of antigen in feces included asymptomatic patients. For confirmation of H. pylori in biopsy specimens of the gastric mucosa we used the histologic method, culture, the urease test and the nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) method. The latter was also used for dental plaque smears. Antimicrobial treatment with the aim of eradicating H. pylori was carried out in three studies comparing two groups of patients: The first group always received ranitidine – 2 × 150  mg over 3 weeks in the first study and over 8 weeks in the two further studies, with an addition of antacids if needed. The second group received ranitidine 2 × 150  mg + erythromycin 4 × 500  mg for one week in the first study, ranitidine 2 × 150  mg + colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) 2 × 240  mg over 4 weeks in the second study, and CBS 4 × 120  mg + amoxycillin 4 × 500  mg + metronidazole 4 × 500  mg over two weeks in the third study. With the latex agglutination and with the enzyme immune system (Virion-Serion) we identified IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori in serum, and antigen in feces (HpSA – Meridian). In protocols of epidemiologic characteristics of H. pylori infection we collected and analyzed the data regarding patient age and gender, living and sanitary conditions, socio-economic status and the education level. Results: The studies showed that H. pylori was most frequently present in ulcer disease of duodenum and stomach. The success of antimicrobial treatment and eradication of H. pylori with ranitidine and erythromycin over one week was 11. 1 %, with the combination of ranitidine and CBS over four weeks 19. 04 %, with the triple combination therapy with CBS + amoxycillin + metronidazole over two weeks 92 %. In dental plaque, H. pylori was confirmed in 16. 6 %. Middle age, poor or medium living conditions and economic status, and primary to secondary education were all identified as possible risk factors for H. pylori infection. In asymptomatic patients we confirmed IgG antibodies against H. pylori in serum in 26 / 34, in 1 / 34 they were borderline positive, and negative in 7 / 34 patients. IgA antibodies were present in 17 / 34, in 6 / 34 they were borderline positive, and negative in 11 / 34.  Antigen in feces was positive in 10 / 33 patients, negative in 23 / 33.  Serum IgG and IgA antibodies and antigen in feces were confirmed in 8 / 23 patients. Conclusions: Our studies resulted in the beginning of H. pylori detection in MTH patients with gastritis and ulcer disease, and in the ascertainment that H. pylori was most frequently present in ulcer disease of stomach and duodenum. For the confirmation of H. pylori, the histologic method, culture and the urease test were introduced into routine clinical practice of MTH. Causal treatment of gastritis and ulcer disease with antimicrobials was introduced, and the success of H. pylori eradication and the decrease of recurrences was followed. We found that antimicrobial sensitivity in vitro did not warrant clinical success – a statement proved by the results of treatment with erythromycin. The effect of monotherapy was also insufficient. The hypothesis that dental plaque could be a significant reservoir of H. pylori infection was not confirmed. The nested PCR method for proof of H. pylori in gastric mucosa biopsy specimens and dental plaque smears is a rapid and reliable diagnostic method. The analysis of epidemiologic characteristics showed that risk factors for the occurrence of H. pylori infection are middle age, poor or medium living conditions and socio-economic status, and primary to secondary education. In asymptomatic patients we proved the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies, and of antigen in feces. </p...|$|E
