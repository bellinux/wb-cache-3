40|$|History and Objectives: Due to the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> phenomenon and considering the role of various factors in its onset and progression {{and in order to}} define the average age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in female students of Kashan, this study was performed in the curriculum year 1377 - 1378. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 2300 students at preliminary, intermediary and high school levels by random sampling. The stages of telarch, pubarche and menarche were recognized by physical examination by a resident of gynecology and obstetrics. Characteristics such as weight, height, education, parent's job and the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> <b>of</b> the mother were evaluated. All the data were recorded. The age of the first menstruation was regarded as the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> onset and its progressive stages were defined according to standards. Results: Of the 2300 evaluated students in the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in girls was 12. 36 Â± 1. 24 years and the mode of their age group was 12 - 17 years. Weight and height were higher in the girls with puberty than those without onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b> The maternal age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in the girls with puberty was 12. 5 years. In 74 of the girls, the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> was the same as their mothers. There was no correlation between their age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> and the educational level of their father but the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> was related to the educational level of the mother and the parent's job. Conclusion: Age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in Kashanian girls is low and shows a decrease relative to the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in their mothers.

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to provide normative data for the onset and tempo <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in Turkish girls and analyze the growth parameters in puberty. Methods: The analyses are based on data that were collected and evaluated biannually on 1020 Turkish school children aged 8 - 18 years and a subsample of 101 girls who had reached final height (FH). The data were analyzed cross-sectionally in the total group and longitudinally in the subsample. Results: Mean age and height (Ht) at onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> were 10. 1 ± 1. 0 years and 141. 7 ± 7. 6 cm, respectively. Peak height velocity (HtV) was 8. 5 ± 1. 0 cm/year. Total pubertal height gain was 16. 0 ± 3. 9 cm. The duration <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> was 4. 9 ± 1. 2 years. Age at menarche was 12. 2 ± 0. 9 years. Height at onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> was positively correlated with FH (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Genetic and {{environmental}} factors have important roles in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. Given a potential role for sex hormones in MS, we have investigated {{whether or not the}} age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> influences the risk of developing MS in a population-based cohort. METHODS: We identified 5493 MS index cases and 1759 spousal controls with age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> information from the Canadian Collaborative Project on Genetic Susceptibility to MS. Age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> was compared between index cases and controls, and any effect <b>of</b> age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> on the age of onset of MS was also investigated. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences between}} male index cases and controls with respect to age <b>of</b> <b>puberty,</b> P = 0. 70. However, a significant difference was observed between female index cases and female controls, with average age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> being 12. 4 and 12. 6 years respectively, P = 0. 00017, providing a relative risk decrease of 0. 9 per year increase <b>of</b> age <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b> There was no effect of the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> on the age of MS onset in either sex.

40|$|The onset and {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> {{is determined by}} func-tional development of the brain-pituitary-gonad (BPG) axis. Sex steroids produced in the gonads {{play an important role}} in the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b> Stress interferes with reproduction and the functioning of the BPG axis, and cortisol has frequently been indicated as a major factor mediating the suppressive effect of stress on reproduction. Prolonged elevated cortisol levels, im-plicated in stress adaptation, inhibited pubertal development in male common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Cortisol treatment caused a <b>retardation</b> <b>of</b> pubertal testis development and reduced the LH pituitary content and the salmon GnRHa-stimulated LH secre-tion in vitro. A reduced synthesis of androgens also was ob-served. These findings suggest that the cortisol-induced inhibi-tion of testicular development and the maturation of pituitary gonadotrophs are mediated by an effect on testicular androgen secretion. In this study, we combined cortisol treatment with a replacement of the testicular steroid hormones (testosterone and 11 -oxygenated androgens) to investigate the role of these steroids in the cortisol-induced suppression of pubertal devel-opment. The effect of cortisol on spermatogenesis was indepen-dent of 11 -ketotestosterone, whereas the effect on the pituitary was an indirect one, involving the testicular secretion of testos-terone. cortisol, glucocorticoid receptor, pituitary, spermatogenesis, tes-tosteron...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate of sexual maturation among boys of special schools of Tehran. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study was performed on children and adolescents male students in special school in Tehran at 2013.

Results: The mean age <b>of</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in boys (Genitalia stage 2) was 13. 12 ± 1. 84 years and sexual maturation was completed at 16. 57 ± 1. 34 years.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 In a swine {{production}} and breeding experiment, Yorkshire gilts were evaluated for {{the influences of}} heredity-and some environmental components on occurrence <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> in gilts in confinement. In the first experiment, 186 Yorkshire gilts reared and maintained in total confinement were used in a study to assess effects of several environmental variables on occurrence <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> and subsequent estrus periods. The four social combination groups were: reared-together and exposed-together (RT-ET), reared-together and exposed-separately (RT-ES), reared-separately and exposed-together (RS-ET), and reared-separately and exposed-separately (RS-ES). The percentage expressing puberty and days to puberty {{were not significantly different}} among the four social groups nor was regularity of estrus cycles. Based on these findings {{there appears to be no}} added benefit of allotting gilts in the various social groups used beyond the effects resulting from mixing to provide unfamiliar penmates and providing boar exposure. Secondly, it appears that gilts which achieved pubertal estrus promptly continued to have high cyclic adequacy. In the second experiment 438 Yorkshire gilts reared and housed in total confinement were used to determine hereditary in fluence on occurrence <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> and days from commencing <b>of</b> experiment to <b>puberty.</b> Line-of-sire effect was significant (P =. 10) for percentage occurrence <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b> Difference among line-of-sire for days to puberty were not significant (P >. 05).
