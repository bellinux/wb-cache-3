40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} nurses risk {{of exposure to}} blood resulting from injuries with needles and sharps, the methods of estimating those risks, and the factors affecting risks. METHODS: Nurses on 40 medical units in 20 hospitals in cities with {{a high incidence of}} AIDS were studied. Percutaneous injuries were documented for every shift during a 30 -day period. These prospective reports were compared with retrospective and institutional reports. Factors affecting the likelihood of injuries were explored. RESULTS: Based on the prospective reports, the rate of injuries to staff nurses was 0. 8 per nurse-year. Prospective and <b>retrospective</b> <b>rates</b> were similar, while institutional rates were significantly lower. Factors associated with increased injuries included recapping needles and temporary work assignments. Working in hospitals characterized by professional nurse practice models and taking precautions to avoid blood contact were associated with fewer injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Injuries from needlesticks are more common than institutional reports suggest and do not occur at random. Diminishing the frequency with which nurses recap needles, increasing precautions they take, reducing use of temporary nursing personnel, and implementing organizational changes may lower the odds of nurses being injured...|$|R

For Vincent Canby of the New York Times, Satyricon was [...] "the quintessential Fellini film, a travelogue through an unknown galaxy, a magnificently realized movie of his and our wildest dreams". Roger Ebert, while recanting his original statement that the film was a masterpiece, nonetheless gave it a high <b>retrospective</b> <b>rating</b> and wrote, [...] "It {{is so much more}} ambitious and audacious than most of what we see today that simply as a reckless gesture, it shames these timid times." [...] For Archer Winston of the New York Post, the film's classical background in Petronius was fused into [...] "a powerful contemporary parallel.

In {{a special edition of}} Q and Mojo magazines titled Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album ranked at No. 14 in its 40 Cosmic Rock Albums list. The album came third in a list of the ten best concept albums by Uncut magazine, where it was described as an [...] "impressionistic, intense album" [...] and [...] "pure theatre (in a good way) and still Gabriel's best work". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a <b>retrospective</b> <b>rating</b> of five stars out of five. He notes that despite Gabriel's [...] "lengthy libretto" [...] on the sleeve [...] "the story never makes sense", though its music is [...] "forceful, imaginative piece of work that showcases the original Genesis lineup at a peak ... it's a considerable, lasting achievement and it's little wonder that Peter Gabriel had to leave ... they had gone as far as they could go together".|$|E

The Second Disk explained that the singer's [...] "clarion voice and dramatic interpretive skills" [...] ensured the album's timelessness. The New York Times said that the album was a [...] "rare instance of Streisand being too deferential to the originals". The Baltimore Sun deemed it her [...] "most daring album". The Tuscaloosa News compared Streisand's underwhelming performance of classical music to that of Florence Foster Jenkins. The Daily Gazette described it as an [...] "ill-fated...proto-crossover album". Philippine Daily Inquirer said it was an [...] "escoteric but laudable project", and one of the moments Streisand challenged herself with musical risks in her youth.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} fracture rates and fracture prevalence from fracture histories in normal postmenopausal women. DESIGN [...] Apparently healthy postmenopausal women were recruited by advertising in the media. Fracture histories were obtained by personal interview in 1983 and again by interview or questionnaire in 1988. Fracture rates were calculated prospectively and retrospectively. PARTICIPANTS [...] 492 women (mean age 58. 6 years) were selected from over 1000 applicants {{on the basis that}} they were suffering from no disease nor taking any therapy which might affect their bones. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Retrospective premenopausal and postmenopausal fracture rates were calculated in 1983, prospective rates calculated from 1983 to 1988, and <b>retrospective</b> <b>rates</b> checked again on the second occasion. The retrospective and prospective fracture rates were very similar. The five year fracture rates were low and steady until the menopause, when they rose by a factor of 10 and reached a new plateau after about 15 years. The results were comparable to those obtained from hospital statistics. CONCLUSIONS [...] The menopausal rise in fracture rates not only involves wrist fractures but most peripheral fractures, and probably reflects postmenopausal loss of trabecular bone. Meaningful fracture rates can be calculated from individual fracture histories in a well defined population. This technique may be particularly useful in developing countries where public health data may be incomplete...|$|R

All of the plans for the making of such agreements which have ever been explicitly approved by any of the insurance commissioners in the United States, are plans under which u becomes a continuous function of the sum of the losses so valued, which is linear within some interval and constant outside that in-terval. The range of practicable possibilities under the condition that u shall be such a linear or sectionally linear function of the sum of the actual values of the losses, has been very well explored by T.

40|$|Clinical {{features}} at {{the initial}} examination of 42 patients with probable Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease were tested for prognostic value at subsequent follow-up of 54 +/- 25 months. These potential prognostic features were of three types: degree of severity features (eg, IQ scores); variable clinical features (eg, extrapyramidal signs); and individual distinguishing features (eg, gender, education, and age). The power of these potential prognostic features to predict prognosis was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier life-tables method and the Cox proportional hazards model. Three clinical end points were considered: total dependence in activities of daily living; incontinence; and institutionalization at follow-up. Degree of severity features (subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Clinical Severity Score) predicted subsequent dependence in activities of daily living, incontinence, and institutionalization. Historical disease duration, age, gender, family history of dementia, <b>retrospective</b> <b>rate</b> of progression, anxiety, psychosis, depression, and extrapyramidal signs did not influence prognosis. These results suggest that initial degree of severity (2 ̆ 2 how far 2 ̆ 2) rather than variation {{in the rate of}} progression (2 ̆ 2 how fast 2 ̆ 2) best predicts prognosis in the early to intermediate stages of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease.

Objectives: To characterize lung function abnormalities among children with SCA and to determine whether these steady-state lung function results were associated with morbidity before or after testing among children with SCA. Methods: This study {{was part of the}} prospective National Institutes of Health–funded Sleep and Asthma Cohort Study. Children with HbSS or Hb S?o (SCA) were enrolled without regard for sickle cell–related comorbidities or diagnosis of asthma. Lung function was measured by spirometry and plethysmography on the same day, when free of acute disease. Standardized asthma symptom questionnaires and review of the medical records were also performed. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 149 children aged 6 to 19 years completed lung function testing, of whom 139 participants had retrospective morbidity data from birth to the test date, and 136 participants were followed prospectively for a median of 4. 3 years from the test date. At baseline, percentages with normal, obstructive, restrictive, nonspecific, and mixed lung function patterns were 70, 16, 7, 6, and 1, respectively. Neither <b>retrospective</b> <b>rates</b> of pain nor acute chest syndrome was associated with lung function patterns. Furthermore, baseline lung function pattern was not predictive of future pain or acute chest syndrome episodes.
