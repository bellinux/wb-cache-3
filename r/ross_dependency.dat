5|$|New Zealand {{is one of}} 16 realms {{within the}} Commonwealth. The Realm of New Zealand is the entire area over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign, and {{comprises}} New Zealand, Tokelau, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> the Cook Islands and Niue. The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand. The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll). The <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility. New Zealand nationality law treats {{all parts of the}} realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> are New Zealand citizens.|$|E
5|$|Several {{geographical}} {{features are}} named for Worsley, including Mount Worsley on South Georgia, Cape Worsley in the British Antarctic Territory, the Worsley Icefalls in the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> and Worsley Harbour at Spitzbergen. Worsleys Road in the Christchurch suburb of Cracroft {{is named for}} his grandfather; it was built by him as an access road for his farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{permanent}} population would seem to prevent the British overseas territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and British Antarctic Territory, the New Zealand territory of <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> and the Australian external territories of Australian Antarctic Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Coral Sea Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands from competing.|$|E
5000|$|Eastface Nunatak (...) {{is a small}} nunatak about 11 nmi km {{south of}} Mount Morning on the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency's</b> Hillary Coast. It is ice covered with a {{conspicuous}} rock face on the east side. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from ground surveys and Navy air photos, and was given this descriptive name by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1963.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, Chapman led {{a three-week}} {{scientific}} expedition to Antarctica, {{which made her}} {{one of the first}} women on the continent and the first woman to lead an Antarctic expedition. Lake Chapman, near Granite Harbour in Antarctica's <b>Ross</b> Sea <b>Dependency,</b> is named after Chapman.|$|R
5|$|New Zealand is a {{developed}} country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to a market economy. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand {{is a member of}} the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the Citizenship Act 1977 defines 'New Zealand' as New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> and Tokelau, the Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act 1982 defines 'New Zealand' to mean New Zealand only. Therefore, {{to apply}} for a special grant of New Zealand {{citizenship}} for Samoans, presence or indefinite immigration status in the Cook Islands, Niue, <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> and Tokelau does not count as presence or indefinite immigration status in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{acquiring}} citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> and Tokelau are treated as part of New Zealand – hence, for example, a child born in Tokelau to a Tokelauan permanent resident would qualify for New Zealand citizenship. However, for Samoan citizens applying for a special grant of New Zealand citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> and Tokelau are not treated as part of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{marriage}} law only applies to New Zealand proper and the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> in Antarctica. Other New Zealand territories, including Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, {{have their own}} {{marriage law}} and do not perform nor recognise same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|The Antarctic {{territory}} of the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> previously under {{the sovereignty of the}} United Kingdom, is today regarded by New Zealand as having become part of the Dominion of New Zealand on 16 August 1923. The legality of that contemporary assertion has been questioned but is nonetheless the position of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's EEZ covers 4,083,744km2, {{which is}} {{approximately}} fifteen times the land {{area of the}} country. Sources vary significantly {{on the size of}} New Zealand's EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000km2. These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the EEZs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand (Tokelau, Niue, the Cook Islands and the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Te Kaha pursued Patagonian Toothfish poachers in the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> {{participated in}} the INTERFET {{multinational}} deployment to East Timor, and operated {{as part of the}} Multinational Interception Force in the Persian Gulf. The New Zealand frigates served periods as guardship at the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara during 2000 and 2001. In 2002, Te Kaha returned to the Persian Gulf, this time as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, after a four-month flag-showing deployment in Asian waters. The frigate was replaced in the Gulf by Te Mana in early 2003.|$|E
25|$|Port Chalmers was a port of {{call for}} several notable {{expedition}}s during the heroic era of Antarctic exploration. It was the last port visited by Robert Falcon Scott before heading south on his final expedition to Antarctica. A large stone monument now stands above the town dedicated to Scott's final expedition. Following the 1923 transfer of the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> (Antarctica) to New Zealand, and the New Zealand Government's lease of rights, the giant Norwegian whaler, C.A. Larsen, became the largest vessel serviced in the Otago Dock, Port Chalmers, in April 1928.|$|E
500|$|While the demonym for a New Zealand {{citizen is}} New Zealander, the {{informal}} [...] "Kiwi" [...] {{is commonly used}} both internationally and by locals. The name derives from the kiwi, a native flightless bird, which is the national symbol of New Zealand. The Māori loanword [...] "Pākehā" [...] usually refers to New Zealanders of European descent, although some reject this appellation, and some Māori use it to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders. Most people born in New Zealand {{or one of the}} realm's external territories (Tokelau, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> the Cook Islands and Niue) before 2006 are New Zealand citizens. Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards.|$|E
500|$|The {{demographics}} of New Zealand encompass the gender, ethnic, religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the [...] million {{people living in}} New Zealand. New Zealanders, informally known as [...] "Kiwis", predominantly live in urban areas on the North Island. The five largest cities are Auckland (with one-third of the country's population), Christchurch (in the South Island, the largest island of the New Zealand archipelago), Wellington, Hamilton and Tauranga. Few New Zealanders live on New Zealand's smaller islands. Waiheke Island (near Auckland) is easily the most populated smaller island with [...] residents, while Great Barrier Island, the Chatham and Pitt Islands and Stewart Island each have populations below 1,000. New Zealand {{is part of a}} realm and most people born in the realm's external territories of Tokelau, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> the Cook Islands and Niue are entitled to New Zealand passports. In 2006, more people who identified themselves with these islands lived in New Zealand than on the Islands themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} was taken on 30 July 1923, when the British {{government}} passed an Order in Council under the British Settlements Act 1887, defining the new borders for the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency</b> - [...] "that part of His Majesty's Dominions in the Antarctic Seas, which comprises all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 150th degree of West Longitude which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude shall be named the Ross Dependency." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand dollar (sign: $; code: NZD) (...) is the {{currency}} and legal tender of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency,</b> Tokelau, and a British territory, the Pitcairn Islands. Within New Zealand, {{it is almost}} always abbreviated with the dollar sign ($), with [...] "NZ$" [...] sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. In the context of currency trading, it is often informally called the [...] "Kiwi", since New Zealand is commonly associated with the indigenous bird and the one-dollar coin depicts a kiwi.|$|E
2500|$|... "Orinoco Flow" [...] was {{the final}} track written for the album, {{but it was one}} that Enya {{recalled}} was difficult to work on, which involved several breaks from recording before coming back to it several weeks after. She later pointed out the absence of deadlines to complete the album, as granted in her contract with Warner, which allowed the song to be developed {{over a period of time}} until [...] "we were able at the end to listen to it and say 'this is good'". It originated from a riff she had developed after Nicky suggested to play a melody in five different octaves; they left the arrangement as it was, until they realised the album needed one more track. The song developed around the initial riff, itself becoming part of the chorus hook. An earlier version of the song contained no middle eight and had the line [...] "Sail away..." [...] after every line which Dickens later said, [...] "drove me crazy", but recognised its potential if it was worked on. Its pizzicato introduction, which has been compared to Andy Williams' 1963 single [...] "Can't Get Used to Losing You", was the genesis of Roma's inspiration for the song's lyrics after she had heard the introduction as she looked out of the studio window and saw her children skipping. Dickins and Cullum are referenced in the lyrics in the lines: [...] "We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel. We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies", the latter being a reference to the region of Antarctica known as <b>Ross</b> <b>Dependency.</b> Dickins only found out about it after the album had been pressed which embarrassed him at first and initially wanted it changed, but soon warmed to it after the single went to number one. [...] "All these years later", he said, [...] "if I hear that line ... I can't help smiling." ...|$|E
