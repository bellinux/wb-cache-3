40|$|ABSTRACT The {{behaviour}} of {{high temperature}} sodium when spread into air {{is not well}} known, although of capital interest in preparing safety systems in plants that use large amounts of it. A new set-up was built to produce high temperature liquid sodium sprays and jets, that were observed when produced in nitrogen inert atmosphere and in air. Sodium sprays were produced by sub-millimetric nozzles simulating a small leakage, while a <b>rupture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of 30 millimetres diameter simulated a more severe failure. Sodium was pressurised up to 9 bar, and heated up to 550 °C, while the surrounding gas, nitrogen or air, was kept at atmospheric conditions. High speed cinematography was used to observe the liquid macroscopic behaviours, while Phase Doppler Interpherometry {{was used to measure}} the sodium droplets velocity and size, when possible. Particular care was put in preparing this new experimental set-up, because of the partially unknown and potentially dangerous phenomena involved, requiring double confinement of the spray set-up and remote controlled operations. Spray macroscopic shape and some granulometric characteristics could be measured, and are reported together with occurrence of ignition...|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{contraception}} (EC) is a {{safe and}} effective method {{which is used to}} prevent unwanted pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. Many of the unwanted pregnancies end in unsafe abortions. The search for an ideal contraceptive, which does not interfere with spontaneity or pleasure of the sexual act, yet effectively controls the fertility, is still continuing. Numerous contraceptive techniques are available, yet contraceptive coverage continues to be poor in India. Thus, even when not planning for a pregnancy, exposure to unprotected sex takes place often, necessitating the use of emergency contraception. This need may also arise due to failure of contraceptive method being used (condom <b>rupture,</b> <b>diaphragm</b> slippage, forgotten oral pills) or following sexual assault. Emergency contraception is an intervention that can prevent a large number of unwanted pregnancies resulting from failure of regular contraception or unplanned sexual activity, which in turn helps in reducing the maternal mortality and morbidity due to unsafe abortions. However, a concern has been expressed regarding repeated and indiscriminate usage of e-pill, currently the rational use of emergency contraception is being promoted as it is expected to make a significant dent in reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. In fact, since the introduction of emergency contraception, the contribution of unsafe abortion towards maternal mortality has declined from 13 to 8 per cent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} the design and {{performance}} of a large diameter diaphragmless shock tube that has been recently developed in order to experimentally study various basic characteristics of the gas-dynamic laser (GDL). The main engineering element of the shock tube is a diaphragm-like sliding piston (in place of a <b>rupturing</b> <b>diaphragm)</b> by which normal shock waves are formed. The role of such a structure in generating repeatable shock waves is discussed. The shock tube performs in good accordance with the simple shock tube theory, as has been verified so far by experiments with some conventional lasing gases (gaseous mixtures of CO 2 and N 2 and those diluted with an excess of He) at shock wave Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 5. Recent results of the stagnation conditions achieved in the shock tube with application to GDL experiments are included as well...|$|R

40|$|Background: Diaphragmatic {{injuries}} are relatively rare and present with non specific symptoms and signs. Late discoveries are almost a rule {{in all but}} the most evident cases. Many patients are observed or even treated for suspected other conditions, most often musculosceletal disorders. Patients and methods: We report a case of a 14 -year-old boy who presented with left lumbar pain and developed peritonitis six days after strenuous training. A chest X-ray revealed abdominal viscera in the left hemithorax. A large posterolateral rupture of the left diaphragm was found at laparotomy together with herniation of the stomach, spleen and colon. The stomach was perforated and partialy necrotic. Afer partial gastrectomy, repositioning and diaphragmal repair the patient recovered well. Conclusions: If pain in toracoabdominal region is a predominant sign after trauma or endogenous strain, one should consider the posibility of <b>ruptured</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and make a chest X-ray. Operation of diaphragmal hernia is necessary and garanties good results when treated on time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gastrothorax is {{characterized}} by herniation of the stomach and other abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity either through the oesophageal hiatus or <b>ruptured</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> When gastrothorax causes pulmonary and hemodynamic compromise, due to compression of lungs and mediastinal structures, it is named as tension gastrothorax. Diagnosis of tension gastrothorax is often complicated during late pregnancy, because of unusual presentation, altered physiology, absence of trauma, hesitation about radiation exposure, and rarity of the condition. We report {{a case of a}} patient, in her 32 nd week of pregnancy, who presented with left tension gastrothorax. Lower segment caesarean section was planned after steroid therapy, with all the preparations for thoracotomy. Intra-operatively, stomach, spleen, and colon were found herniated in the left hemithorax, through a ruptured left hemidiaphragm.

Parametric studies have been conducted for instantaneous <b>rupture</b> of conical <b>diaphragms</b> and addition of bleed slots, which induce highly unsteady flow phenomena.

40|$|Rupture {{of a light}} {{cellophane}} diaphragm in {{an expansion}} tube has been studied by an optical method. The influence of the light diaphragm on test flow generation has long been recognised, however the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>rupture</b> mechanism is less well known. It has been previously postulated that the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>ruptures</b> around its periphery due to the dynamic pressure loading of the shock wave, with the diaphragm material at some stage being removed from the flow to allow the shock to accelerate to the measured speeds downstream. The images obtained in this series of experiments {{are the first to}} show the mechanism of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>rupture</b> and mass removal in an expansion tube. A light diaphragm was impulsively loaded via a shock wave and a series of images was recorded holographically throughout the rupture process, showing gradual destruction of the diaphragm.

Both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the rupture dynamics were derived from the images and compared with existing one-dimensional theory...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the strategy of}} a combined diagnostic and therapeutic approach in children with intra-abdominal organ injury following blunt abdominal trauma. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of an university hospital. PATIENTS: 38 children with documented intra-abdominal injury. INTERVENTION: Initial non-surgical treatment {{by a team of}} pediatric intensivists, radiologists and surgeons. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Physical examination, oriented blood and urine tests, plain abdominal film, abdominal ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) with contrast.

40|$|Background: Diagnosis of blunt {{abdominal}} {{trauma is}} a real challenge even for experienced trauma surgeons. Diagnostic tools that help the treating doctor in optimum management of blunt abdominal trauma include; Focussed Assessment Sonography for Trauma (FAST), Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) and CT scan. Objectives: {{the aim of this}} communication is to define the recent role of FAST and CT scan of the abdomen in the diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma. Findings and conclusions: FAST is useful as the initial diagnostic tool for abdominal trauma to detect intraabdominal fluid. With proper training and understanding the limitations of ultrasound, the results of FAST can be optimized. DPL is indicated to diagnose suspected internal abdominal injury when ultrasound machine is not available, there is no trained person to perform FAST, or the results of FAST are equivocal or difficult to interpret in a haemodynamically unstable patient. In contrast, in haemodynamically stable patients the diagnostic modality of choice is CT with intravenous contrast. It is useful to detect free air and intraperitoneal fluid, delineate the extent of solid organ injury, detect retroperitoneal injuries, and help in the decision for conservative treatment. Helical CT is done rapidly which reduces the time the patient stays in the CT scan room. Furthermore, this improves sagittal and coronal reconstruction images which are useful for detecting <b>ruptured</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> Running title: FAST and CT scan in traum...|$|R
