40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} focused on trading stocks and {{improvement}} of long and short positions in case of negative stock's price development. For this purpose, we use Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Spread</b> and Vertical Ratio Put Spread option strategies. We also show in theory and in practice as well the ways of creating these option strategies and their usage for spreading the profit interval for long and short positions open, and without any additional costs...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the formation of Short Call Ladder (SCL) strategy based on the functions of profit. An optimal algorithm for the use of this strategy in trading is introduced as well. Furthermore, this paper is focused on the application of Short Call Ladder strategy in hedging against a price rise of the underlying asset. In the end, the results are compared with the results of hedging obtained by Short Combo and Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Call</b> Back <b>Spread</b> option strategy...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} {{were introduced}} in 1981 when the European Option Exchange in Amster- dam was introduced. Despite some opinions that say that financial derivatives cause deformations in prices at financial markets, volume of sales of financial derivatives are annually rising. Financial derivatives brought with themselves large opportunities for position creating. They can be used not only for trading, but for hedging and arbitrage as well. Nowadays, financial derivatives, namely options, are used to provide new banking products of treasury management. Yields of treasury in- struments are in certain way derived from the yields gained from other regular financial instruments on financial market. Banks use option strategies to create financial positions that are divided into smaller parts and, consecutively, sold to clients of banks as new products. Especially, option strategies are used to emit investments certificates. Situation on financial markets forces banks to create new products that bring higher potential profits at lower level of risk. The investments certificates are one of favourite instruments used. The paper deals with option strategy and its usage in creating the treasury products in banks. We focus on Inverse Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Call</b> Back <b>Spread</b> strategy as the one, {{which can be used}} for specific investment certificates creation. The aim of the paper is to find the way of creation of Spe- ed certificates, so called Sprint certificates, Double Chance certificates or Double-up certificates. We analyze this type of certificates, derive the profit function in analytical form and we propose the way of its creation through Inverse Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Call</b> Back <b>Spread</b> option strategy...|$|R
50|$|The call {{backspread}} (reverse <b>call</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>spread)</b> is a bullish {{strategy in}} options trading whereby the options trader writes {{a number of}} call options and buys more call options of the same underlying stock and expiration date but at a higher strike price. It is an unlimited profit, limited risk strategy that is used when the trader thinks {{that the price of}} the underlying stock will rise sharply in the near future.|$|R
40|$|Callable bonds offer higher yields {{compared}} to non-callable bonds. In this paper, {{we examine the}} <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> in a global framework, while controlling for firm-level, bond-level, and country-level variables. Using an international sample of 13, 936 bonds issued between 1991 and 2007, we find that callable bonds have a positive <b>call</b> <b>spread,</b> which is statistically and economically significant. Our empirical results hold after a battery of robustness checks. We also find that junk callable bonds have a higher <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> than investment-grade callable bonds, {{which is consistent with}} the signaling theory. The empirical results also show that highly leveraged firms have a higher <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> than firms with low leverage, a finding that is consistent with the risk-shifting arguments...|$|R
50|$|The {{calendar}} <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> (see calendar spread) is a bullish {{strategy and}} consists of selling a put option with a shorter expiration against a purchased call option with an expiration further out in time. The calendar <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> is basically a leveraged version of the covered call (see above), but purchasing long call options instead of purchasing stock.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the call}} {{with the lower}} {{exercise}} price will be at-the-money while the call with the higher exercise price is out-of-the-money. Both calls must have the same underlying security and expiration month. If the bull <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> is done so that both the sold and bought calls expire on the same day, it is a vertical debit <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R

50|$|If the trader is bearish (expects {{prices to}} fall), {{you use a}} bearish <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b> It's named this way because you're buying and selling a call and taking a bearish position.|$|R

5000|$|The iron condor is {{a neutral}} {{strategy}} {{and consists of}} a combination of a bull put credit spread and a bear <b>call</b> credit <b>spread</b> (see above). Ideally, the margin for the Iron Condor is the maximum of the bull put and bear <b>call</b> <b>spreads,</b> but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call.

5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put spread with a bear <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b> The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> with a bear <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> or a bull put spread with a bear put spread. Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R
5000|$|The iron {{butterfly}} is {{a neutral}} strategy {{and consists of}} a combination of a bull put credit spread and a bear <b>call</b> credit <b>spread</b> (see above). The iron butterfly is a special case of an iron condor (see above) where the strike price for the bull put credit spread and the bear <b>call</b> credit <b>spread</b> are the same. Ideally, the margin for the iron butterfly is the maximum of the bull put and bear <b>call</b> <b>spreads,</b> but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call. The maximum return generated for the iron butterfly is when the stock price is the same as when the position was entered. The return calculation for the iron butterfly position using the maximum margin of the bull put credit spread and the bear <b>call</b> credit <b>spread</b> and assuming price of the stock or index at expiration is the same as when the position was entered is shown below: ...|$|R
50|$|Many options {{strategies}} are built around spreads and combinations of spreads. For example, a bull put spread {{is basically a}} bull spread that is also a credit spread while the iron butterfly {{can be broken down}} into a combination of a bull put spread and a bear <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
