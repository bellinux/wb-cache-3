5|$|Twenty-eight {{artificial}} isotopes of zirconium {{have been}} synthesized, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> atomic mass from 78 to 110. 93Zr is the longest-lived artificial isotope, with a half-life of 1.53×106years. 110Zr, the heaviest isotope of zirconium, {{is the most}} radioactive, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by electron emission, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission. The only exception is 88Zr, which decays by electron capture.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> atomic mass from 138 to 173.

As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, <b>ranging</b> <b>in</b> atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E
