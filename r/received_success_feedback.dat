Among both parents and educators, promoting optimal motivation and performance in children within achievement situations is a common concern. The present study was designed to assess the influence of various types of feedback on subsequent reactions within different goal conditions. 81 sixth- and seventh-grade students (M = 12. 53 years) participated. There were nine experimental conditions: task instructions highlighting the value of a performance goal, the value of a learning goal, or no goal instructions, crossed with one of three types of feedback (process failure, outcome failure, success). The four dependent variables included task persistence/performance, task choice, affect, and expectancies for future performance. The task consisted of four-dimension, two-choice discrimination problems. Children who <b>received</b> <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> chose harder tasks than children who received either outcome failure or process failure feedback (F(2, 72) = 16. 15, p <. 01). Children who <b>received</b> <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> reported more positive affect than children who received either outcome failure or process failure feedback (F(2, 72) = 27. 36, p <. 01). Children who received process failure feedback reported more positive affect than children who received outcome failure feedback. Children who <b>received</b> <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> believed they would perform better the next time they performed a similar task than children who received either outcome failure or process failure feedback (F(2, 72) = 16. 27, p <. 01). The present study demonstrates that not all types of failure events exert a negative influence on children's subsequent reactions. These results document the importance of distinguishing between types of failure events, and support the contention that not all types of failure events have the potential to negatively impact children's achievement motivation...|$|E

Study 2 demonstrated the ecological validity of this finding by replicating it with people watching television in their own homes. Study 3 investigated whether manipulations of self-feelings affected television watching.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{evaluated the}} self-handicapping hypothesis that alcohol consumption varies directly with individuals ' uncertainty {{of their ability}} to perform successfully. In a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial design, Experiment 1 manipulated (a) difficulty of an initial intellectual test (insolvable or solvable), (b) feedback regarding test performance (success or none), and (c) instructions regarding the difficulty of a retest (identical to or harder than the initial test). Ninety-six male normal drinkers then received access to an alcoholic beverage (self-handicapping option) and to study materials (performance-enchancing option). The experiment terminated before the retest. Results indicated that when a performance-enhancing option is available, subjects generally do not use alcohol to self-handicap. Experiment 2 omitted the study option and manipulated the test difficulty and retest instruction variables in a 2 X 2 factorial design. All 32 subjects <b>received</b> <b>success</b> <b>feedback.</b> Results showed that subjects use alcohol to self-handicap when denied access to a performance-enhancing option. With important qualifications, these data support the self-handicapping hypothesis of human drinking behavior. Inconsistent support for tension-reduction models of drinking behavior (cf. Cappell, 1975), which propose that persons consume alcohol to alleviate negative affect, has fostered alternative hypotheses that emphasize cognitive and contextual factors as determinants of human alcohol consumptio...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Psychology, Washington State UniversityThe {{present study}} is {{proposed}} to investigate {{the conditions under which}} people want to change group norms in small groups. Literature suggests that people may want to change norms when they do not work well, either because the norms are problematic or because the environment has changed, but there is very little research on norm change in small groups. The current study examines how type of group norm development and the experiences of success or failure at group task performance affect group members' willingness to change their group norms. In Study 1, a group norm directed toward how to perform a group task was determined by group member opinions, an experimenter, or an inherited custom. After working on a first trial of the task, participants received success or failure feedback, and were asked whether they personally wanted to change the group norm or retain it. As expected, participants wanted to change the group norm when they failed compared when they succeeded. However, expected effect of type of norm was not found. In Study 2, minimal group paradigm was employed to produce feeling of groupness which may be lack in Study 1. Type of group norm development and group task performance were manipulated in the same way of Study 1. After receiving success or failure feedback, participants were asked whether they personally wanted to change the group norm or retain it, as well as whether they wanted to accept a new member to the group. Likewise Study 1, participants who received failure feedback were more willing to change the group norm than were those who <b>received</b> <b>success</b> <b>feedback.</b> More importantly, results indicated that participants wanted to change the group norm when it was determined by the experimenter rather than either group member opinions or an inherited custom. In addition, participants who believed the group norm was determined by group member opinions were more reluctant to accept a newcomer to the group compared to participants in other conditions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 52 - 58). Research on the generational {{transmission of}} group norms has {{focused primarily on}} perceptual norms. Few studies have considered the generational perpetuation of behavioral norms. This study examined the transmission of norms regarding group decision rules, which are formal ways for group members to combine their individual preferences into a group decision. This experiment compared the generational transmission of seniority rule, in which the senior group member makes the group decision, and majority rule. Confederates established either a majority or seniority group decision rule norm. After completing three group decisions, the "senior" group member—the person {{who had been in}} the group for the longest time—was excused, and was replaced by a new subject. This constituted one "generation. " This procedure continued until the decision rule changed, or until the completion of the tenth generation. In addition, groups using each decision rule <b>received</b> either <b>success</b> or failure <b>feedback</b> regarding their performance on the group decision. Majority rule was perpetuated a greater number of generations on the average than was seniority rule. In only one instance did majority rule change, whereas seniority rule changed in every instance and always changed to majority rule. Feedback did not influence the perpetuation of the norm. Factor analysis of questionnaire responses indicated that perceptions of the decision process were characterized by three factors: the Climate of the group, Confidence in decisions, and Difficulty of decision making. The group climate was more desirable under majority- than under seniority-rule, and <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> yielded a more favorable climate than did failure feedback. Confidence in the decision process was influenced by performance feedback; subjects in <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> conditions expressed greater confidence than did subjects in failure feedback conditions. Feedback also influenced the perceived difficulty of the decision making, with decisions made under conditions of success being considered less difficult than those made under conditions of failure. Finally, newcomers saw the senior member as the most important member of the group, especially when seniority rule was used. Specifically, the senior member of the group was blamed for failure but not given credit for success. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine whether failure experiences {{have an effect on}} pain report, pain tolerance and pain avoidance. Furthermore, it was investigated if negative affectivity (NA) affected the impact of failure feedback on pain report, either as a mediator, in the case of negative state affect, or as a moderator when NA as a personality trait was considered. Fifty-four healthy female volunteers were included and {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions: (1) failure feedback; (2) success feedback; (3) neutral control task. After the manipulation, subjects were given a cold pressor task in order to obtain pain measures. Regarding the effects of failure feedback on pain report, it was found that, in comparison with <b>success</b> <b>feedback,</b> failure feedback led to increased pain report. With regard to pain tolerance, pain was tolerated for longer when preceded by <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> than when preceded by failure feedback. Differences between failure and control conditions did not reach significance. With regard to pain avoidance, no differences between the conditions were found. The hypothesized mediating role of negative state affect was not found. Though in the hypothesized direction, no significant effect was found for NA-trait moderating the influence of failure on pain. The discussion focuses on a number of research questions that remain to be answered, and the clinical relevance of the effects of failure and success experiences on pain report and pain tolerance. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of non-pain-related failure experiences and pain-related fear on pain report, pain tolerance and pain avoidance in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. Moreover, the mediating and moderating role of negative affectivity (trait-NA) in the relationship between failure experiences and pain was examined. Seventy-six patients were divided into high and low pain-related fear groups and within each group they were randomly assigned to the failure or <b>success</b> <b>feedback</b> condition. In the first part of the study patients completed a 'social empathy test' and experimenter 1 subsequently delivered false failure or <b>success</b> <b>feedback.</b> A second experimenter, who was blind for the condition, subsequently administered two lifting tasks in order to obtain measures of pain report, tolerance and avoidance. Failure feedback did have an effect on pain avoidance but unexpectedly, and not as hypothesized, pain avoidance was reduced instead of enhanced. With regard to pain report and pain tolerance similar patterns were found, but these were not statistically significant. The effect of failure feedback on pain avoidance was moderated by trait-NA. Only in the subgroup of patients who scored low on trait-NA did failure feedback decrease pain avoidance. State-NA did not mediate the effects of feedback. In line with previous findings, pain-related fear resulted in lower pain tolerance. Moreover, this study was the first to show that pain-related fear predicted higher pain report in CLBP patients. Pain-related fear did not predict pain avoidance when pre-lifting pain and gender were controlled for. Finally, pre-lifting pain turned out to be the strongest predictor with regard to all pain measures. The role of pain-related fear and unexpected findings with regard to feedback are discussed as well as some clinical implications. status: publishe...|$|R
