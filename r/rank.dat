5|$|Although {{not officially}} {{considered}} a Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, when Archibald Sommers {{was appointed to}} the grade of Sergeant Major January 1, 1801, it was a solitary post, similar to the modern billet of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps.

5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the <b>rank</b> of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high <b>rank</b> of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high <b>rank</b> or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote <b>rank.</b> All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no <b>rank</b> wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high <b>rank,</b> and the latter by characters of low <b>rank</b> or acrobatic characters.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal {{has been}} the highest <b>rank</b> in the British Army since 1736. A five-star <b>rank</b> with NATO code OF-10, it is {{equivalent}} to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF). A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown. Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment. The <b>rank</b> has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the <b>rank</b> were deceased). After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the <b>rank</b> on his last day in the post. Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the <b>rank</b> upon their appointment.|$|E
5|$|Field marshal is the five-star <b>rank</b> {{and highest}} {{attainable}} <b>rank</b> in the Indian Army.

In addition to this, they also run {{an office in the}} Army Headquarters with a secretariat.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} <b>rank</b> of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the <b>rank</b> to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a <b>rank</b> is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason <b>rank</b> may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same <b>rank</b> will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 <b>rank</b> does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full <b>rank</b> of pipes (now an extended <b>rank)</b> is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
