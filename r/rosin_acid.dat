40|$|AbstractThe {{kinetics}} of the disproportionation of pine oleoresin (a renewable bioresource) over a carbon-supported palladium catalyst was studied. Kinetic experiments, {{constructed to}} eliminate {{internal and external}} mass transfer limitations, were performed in the temperature range of 210 – 250 °C. The samples, withdrawn from reaction mixtures at different intervals, were determined by GC–MS and GC. A new reaction scheme together with a lumped kinetic model was proposed to describe the complex reaction system. The kinetic parameters for each involved reaction were estimated using the Levenberg–Marquart method by MATLAB software. The various activation energies of <b>rosin</b> <b>acids</b> in pine oleoresin, for the isomerization, dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions, were 83. 05 – 172. 75 kJmol− 1.

30|$|Anionic {{emulsion}} sizes {{consisting of}} rosin triglyceride esters and partly fortified <b>rosin</b> <b>acids</b> (i.e., rosin-ester sizes), {{have recently been}} used as internal sizes for alkaline papermaking. In this study, handsheets were prepared from pulp suspensions with alum and a rosin-ester size under various conditions, and sizing degree and size and aluminum contents of the handsheets were determined. Aluminum compounds originating from alum added to the pulp suspensions behave as retention aids of the rosin-ester size even in alkaline papermaking under limited conditions. Carboxyl groups in pulp are the primary retention sites of aluminum compounds in pulp suspensions. They form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and thus the anionic size emulsion particles are adsorbed on pulp fibers by electrostatic interactions. However, the cationic charges of aluminum compounds on pulp fibers decrease and finally disappear completely with the lapse of time after the alum addition by forming ionic bonds between the cationic sites and OH− ions. Thus, pH values of the pulp suspensions and timing of the size addition strongly influence the retention values of the rosin-ester size and the resultant sizing features.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of rosin size retention in rosin soap size-alum systems was studied {{on the basis}} of sizing behavior and the rosin size and aluminum contents of handsheets prepared under normal and particular conditions. Rosin size, aluminum, and calcium contents of handsheets prepared with various stirring times of pulp suspensions after pH adjustment suggested that rosin size components adsorbed on pulp fibers predominantly have the structure of free <b>rosin</b> <b>acid</b> rather than rosin aluminum or calcium salt. When a carboxyl group-blocked pulp was used, the rosin size content clearly decreased. This result shows that pulp carboxyl groups {{play a significant role in}} rosin size retention. Electrostatic interactions between dissociated carboxyl groups of pulps and anionic rosin size components through cationic aluminum compounds must be present in pulp suspensions. On the other hand, nonionic interactions in pulp suspensions, which occur particularly around pH 6.2 – 6.5, may also contribute to rosin size retention and appearance of sizing features. When the carboxyl group blocked pulp was used, some rosin size components were retained in the handsheets in largely coagulated form, resulting in no or quite low sizing levels, when the handsheets were dried at 20 °C.|$|E
30|$|Handsheets were {{prepared}} with rosin soap size and aluminum sulfate under various conditions, and the retention {{behavior of the}} rosin size and aluminum components in the handsheets was studied. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography and X-ray fluorescence analysis {{were used to determine}} the size and aluminum contents in the handsheets, respectively. When the addition level of rosin soap size varied from 0 % to 4 % and that of aluminum sulfate was fixed at 2 %, the rosin size content increased with the increase in the size addition level, whereas aluminum and calcium contents were roughly constant. Under these conditions, handsheets prepared from fines-free pulp had aluminum contents less than those for the original beaten pulp, probably because the former pulp had a carboxyl content less than that of the latter pulp. Not only the conventional rosin retention mechanism but also mechanism proposed below must exist in the rosin soap size-alum systems. That is, some aluminum compounds originating from aluminum sulfate are adsorbed on pulp fibers immediately after the aluminum sulfate addition. These adsorbed aluminum compounds form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and free <b>rosin</b> <b>acid</b> components with anionic charges are then adsorbed onto the cationic sites of pulp fibers at the wet-end.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel method for the rapid identification of complex organic materials, including macromolecules, that involves a high temperature simultaneous hydrolysis and derivatisation reaction. In this procedure, aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxides are made to react {{with a wide range of}} complex molecular species, including synthetic and natural polymers, under high temperature flash heating conditions. The hydrolysis products are converted to derivatives, such as alkyl esters or alkyl ethers. The reaction forms the basis for a modified pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) identification technique. Although the process is primarily intended for the rapid identification of polymers which are susceptible to hydrolysis, it is also valuable for characterisation of a variety of hydrolysable lower molecular weight species, such as polymer additives, triglycerides and natural waxes. The reaction takes place when an intimate mixture of an aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxide solution is flash heated with the analyte in a conventional pyrolysis unit, and "on-line" GC-MS is used to separate and identify the reaction products. Analytes included synthetic polyester resins and phenolic polymers, natural products such as lipids and wood extractives, and natural polymers including lignocellulose, proteins and kerogen. Reaction variables, such as temperature, pH analyte particle size, substrate, and the derivatising reagent were studied, in order to find the optimum conditions for the reaction. While the reaction occurs at temperatures as low as 358 degrees celsius, a 770 degrees celsius reaction temperature was adopted to allow direct comparison with Py-GC data. A high pH of the derivatising reagent was found to be necessary to achieve an efficient hydrolysis of the macromolecule. Small particle size gives better conversion to derivatised ++products. The nature of the heating substrate did not appear to influence the reaction. Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides (TAAH) were found to be the most effective derivatising reagents for the reaction. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was the most useful derivatising reagent, since the methyl derivatives of the hydrolysed products were conveniently chromatographed and usually had well known mass spectra. Other TA-AHs were useful for (i) producing higher molecular weight alkyl derivatives of low molecular weight side chains in some polymers, e. g., acetate groups in polyvinyl acetate, (ii) the purpose of determining sites of pre-existing methylation in natural products such as lignocellulose, or (iii) cases where methylation products could be confused with existing pyrolysis products. The reaction mechanism is believed to involve hydrolysis of the organic material, formation of the tetra-alkylammonium salt, and thermal degradation of the quaternary ammonium salt to alkylated derivatives. Some evidence is presented to support this mechanism, which is considered to be ionic in character, rather than a free radical reaction. A detailed study of the reaction of alkyd resins indicated that polyhydric alcohols, polybasic acids, degree of cure, oil length, and <b>rosin</b> <b>acid</b> and epoxy modification could be determined. The reaction of rosin modified phenolic resins (tert-butyl phenol formaldehyde and para-nonyl phenol formaldehyde), gave <b>rosin</b> <b>acid</b> methyl esters and easily identifiable products from the synthetic components. Fatty acid methyl esters could be obtained directly from lipids, such as vegetable oils, without time consuming preparative steps. The problems of base catalysed isomerisation of the double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids were overcome by reducing the amount of base used for the reaction. The reaction facilitated the identification of fatty acids in ++woolwax, the triglycerides in cosmetic products, and lipids in trace quantities of human fingerprint deposits. A more reliable representation of the chemical structure of lignocellulose in softwood and hardwood species was obtained by the reaction, as compared to conventional PyGC which underestimates the aromatic carboxylic acid moieties. Gymnosperm or angiosperm origin was indicated by the presence of solely guaiacyl, or both guaiacyl and syringyl derived groups, respectively. Other extraneous extractable material was identified simultaneously, including aliphatic and aromatic acids, which would not normally be detected by conventional Py-GC. An alternative method involved extracting the wood with TMAH, followed by pyrolysis of the extract, to give less complex but more specific GC profiles. The TMAH extraction procedure also indicated some characteristic biomarker species as well as guaiacyl and syringyl derived compounds. The pyrolysis of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH) extracts revealed the sites of pre-existing methylation in the Eucalyptus marginata species. The thermally assisted hydrolysis and alkylation method which has been developed is usually superior to the conventional Py-GC procedure for those polymers which are prone to hydrolysis, since it results in products which are more readily related to the polymer structure. For example, concerted hydrolysis and alkylation of polyester resins results in alkyl carboxylate esters and the alkyl ethers, whereas in conventional Py-GC the products are alkenes and carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids are more difficult to chromatograph by GC, and aromatic carboxylic acids in particular are susceptible to decarboxylation under the pyrolysis conditions. The reaction procedure has provided an alternative approach to the characterisation of submicrogram quantities of a range of synthetic polymers, natural products and ++natural polymers, which has not previously been possible without lengthy chemical degradation procedures. Although it has not displaced the conventional Py-GC technique, it has given a new dimension to the characterisation of organic materials, providing a powerful tool for forensic science investigations and the analysis of complex materials...|$|E
40|$|Rosin is {{a natural}} product from pine forests and it {{is used as a}} raw {{material}} in resinate syntheses. Resinates are polyvalent metal salts of rosin acids and especially Ca- and Ca/Mg- resinates find wide application in the printing ink industry. In this thesis, analytical methods were applied to increase general knowledge of resinate chemistry and the reaction kinetics was studied in order to model the non linear solution viscosity increase during resinate syntheses by the fusion method. Solution viscosity in toluene is an important quality factor for resinates to be used in printing inks. The concept of critical resinate concentration, c crit, was introduced to define an abrupt change in viscosity dependence on resinate concentration in the solution. The concept was then used to explain the non-inear solution viscosity increase during resinate syntheses. A semi empirical model with two estimated parameters was derived for the viscosity increase on the basis of apparent reaction kinetics. The model was used to control the viscosity and to predict the total reaction time of the resinate process. The kinetic data from the complex reaction media was obtained by acid value titration and by FTIR spectroscopic analyses using a conventional calibration method to measure the resinate concentration and the concentration of free rosin acids. A multivariate calibration method was successfully applied to make partial least square (PLS) models for monitoring acid value and solution viscosity in both mid-infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR) regions during the syntheses. The calibration models can be used for on line resinate process monitoring. In kinetic studies, two main reaction steps were observed during the syntheses. First a fast irreversible resination reaction occurs at 235 °C and then a slow thermal decarboxylation of rosin acids starts to take place at 265 °C. Rosin oil is formed during the decarboxylation reaction step causing significant mass loss as the rosin oil evaporates from the system while the viscosity increases to the target level. The mass balance of the syntheses was determined based on the resinate concentration increase during the decarboxylation reaction step. A mechanistic study of the decarboxylation reaction was based on the observation that resinate molecules are partly solvated by rosin acids during the syntheses. Different decarboxylation mechanisms were proposed for the free and solvating rosin acids. The deduced kinetic model supported the analytical data of the syntheses in a wide resinate concentration region, over a wide range of viscosity values and at different reaction temperatures. In addition, the application of the kinetic model to the modified resinate syntheses gave a good fit. A novel synthesis method with the addition of decarboxylated rosin (i. e. rosin oil) to the reaction mixture was introduced. The conversion of <b>rosin</b> <b>acid</b> to resinate was increased to the level necessary to obtain the target viscosity for the product at 235 °C. Due to a lower reaction temperature than in traditional fusion synthesis at 265 °C, thermal decarboxylation is avoided. As a consequence, the mass yield of the resinate syntheses can be increased from ca. 70 % to almost 100 % by recycling the added rosin oil...|$|E

Scarce prior risk analyses of these multiple stressors in river watersheds existed. Therefore, this thesis developed an integrated risk assessment of endocrine disruptors at {{a section of}} the Lower Uruguay River with industrial (a bleached Kraft pulp mill), domestic (cities) and agricultural (soy crops) sources. A preliminary risk assessment prioritised oestrogens and further compounds of concern in the watershed, notably nonylphenol, glyphosate, endosulfan, chlorophenols, dioxins and furans, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated byphenyls, <b>rosin</b> <b>acids</b> and phytosterols. Models predicted their multimedia distribution, and food web interactions, and then tested. A three-tiered exposure assessment first rated the river status with eutrophication risks using artificial neural networks, while growth effects evidenced in Hyalella curvispina. Then, river sampling sites were determined by hydrodynamic modelling, tracking pollutant transport by clustering and observing reproductive effects in Ceriodapnia dubia. Finally, target compounds were analysed and endocrine disruption studied from gene to population levels. Biomonitoring with Astyanax fasciatus wildfish found no intersex, but smaller testes downstream the pulp mill and lower condition factor near municipal discharges. Spinal malformations were observed exposing Pimephales promelas to sediment elutriates. When exposed to pulp mill effluent, egg production decreased by half. Anti-oestrogenic or androgenic effects were suggested by the toxicogenomic biomarkers ESR 1, ESR 2, IGF-I and GHR.

5000|$|Because the {{turpentine}} {{and pine}} oil from destructive distillation [...] "become somewhat contaminated with other distillation products", solvent processes are commonly used. In this process, stumps and roots are chipped and soaked {{in the light}} end of the heavy naphtha fraction (boiling between 90 °C and 115 °C) from a crude oil refinery. Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in intermediate stages and naphtha laden with rosin from intermediate stages contacts unleached wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the <b>rosin,</b> fatty <b>acids,</b> turpentine, and other constituents later separated through steam distillation. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery. After the solvent has been recovered, [...] "the terpene oils are separated by fractional distillation and recovered mainly as refined turpentine, dipentene, and pine oil. The nonvolatitle residue from the extract is wood rosin of rather dark color. Upgrading of the rosin is carried out by clarification methods that generally may include bed-filtering or furfural-treatment of rosin-solvent solution." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vehicles - {{high-temperature}} tolerant {{chemicals in}} the form of non-volatile liquids or solids with suitable melting point; they are generally liquid at soldering temperatures. Their role is to act as an oxygen barrier to protect the hot metal surface against oxidation, to dissolve the reaction products of activators and oxides and carry them away from the metal surface, and to facilitate heat transfer. Solid vehicles tend to be based on natural or modified <b>rosin</b> (mostly abietic <b>acid,</b> pimaric acid, and other resin acids) or natural or synthetic resins. Water-soluble organic fluxes tend to contain vehicles based on high-boiling polyols - glycols, diethylene glycol and higher polyglycols, polyglycol-based surfactants and glycerol.|$|R

Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, aquatint relies on powdered <b>rosin</b> which is <b>acid</b> resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The tonal variation {{is controlled by the}} level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million. The deal officially {{closed in}} the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest {{producer}} of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping. Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty <b>acids,</b> <b>rosin</b> esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010. Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.|$|R
40|$|Grand fir (Abies grandis) saplings and derived cell {{cultures}} are useful systems {{for studying the}} regulation of defensive oleoresinosis in conifers, a process involving both the constitutive accumulation of resin (pitch) in specialized secretory structures and the induced production of monoterpene olefins (turpentine) and diterpene resin <b>acids</b> (<b>rosin)</b> by nonspecialized cells {{at the site of}} injury. The pathways and enzymes involved in monoterpene and diterpene resin acid biosynthesis are described, as are the coinduction kinetics following stem injury as determined by resin analysis, enzyme activity measurements, and immunoblotting. The effects of seasonal development, light deprivation, and water stress on constitutive and wound-induced oleoresinosis are reported. Future efforts, including a PCR-based cloning strategy, to define signal transduction in the wound response and the resulting gene activation processes are delineated...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify chemical composition of merkus pine resin, rosin and turpentine oil. Initially, pine resin was separated into neutral and acidic fractions with an aqueous 4 % sodium hydroxide solution. After methylation, the fraction containing turpentine oil and rosin were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The neutral fraction of pine resin and turpentine oil mainly consisted of a-pinene, D- 3 -carene and b-pinene. Based on mass spectral comparison, the major constituents of the acidic fraction and rosin were identified as sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, palustric acid, dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid, and merkusic acid. The major component of the acidic fractions was palustric acid, while that of <b>rosin</b> was abietic <b>acid.</b> Using TC (tough column) 1 and TC 5 columns, levopimaric acid could not be separated from rosin or acidic fraction of pine resin of Indonesian Pinus merkusii...|$|R
