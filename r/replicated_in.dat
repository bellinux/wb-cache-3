5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names {{many years ago}} tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid {{established}} {{itself as}} {{a major force in}} both Spanish and European football during the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times. This success was <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> the league, where the club won five times in the space of seven years. This team, which consisted of players such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.|$|E
40|$|Euchromatin, {{which has}} an open {{structure}} and is frequently transcribed, tends to <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> early S phase. Heterochromatin, which is more condensed and rarely transcribed, usually <b>replicates</b> <b>in</b> late S phase. Here, we report significant deviation from this correlation in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We found that heterochromatic centromeres and silent mating-type cassettes <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> early S phase. Only heterochromatic telomeres <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> late S phase. Research in other laboratories has shown that occasionally other organisms also replicate some of their heterochromatin in early S phase. Thus, late replication is not an obligatory feature of heterochromatin...|$|R
25|$|Like {{all other}} virophages, Zamilon <b>replicates</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm, within the virus factory of its helper, which acts as its host. Zamilon was first {{isolated}} {{in association with}} Mont1, a Mimivirus-like Mimiviridae classified in lineage C by its polymerase B gene sequence. The virophage has subsequently {{been shown to be}} capable of <b>replicating</b> <b>in</b> association with Moumouvirus and Monve, two Mimiviridae from lineage B, as well as with Terra1 and Courdo11 from lineage C; however, it cannot <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> association with either Mimivirus or Mamavirus, classified as lineage A.

5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, {{particularly}} providing air dominance from 1937 onwards; 300 air-to-air victories were claimed, {{although this}} was dwarfed by some 900 claimed by Italian forces. Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics, {{as well as}} aircraft tactics, the latter being only moderately successful. The air superiority which allowed {{certain parts of the}} Legion to excel would be <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> the first year of World War II, until ultimately failing to prevail in the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} the {{unconscious}} tendency {{of people to}} prefer the numbers in the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> various countries.

2500|$|The virus invades both {{cancerous}} {{and healthy}} cells, but it cannot <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> healthy cells because it lacks Infected cell protein 34.5 (ICP34.5). [...] When cells {{are infected with}} a virus they shut down and die, but ICP34.5 blocks this stress response, allowing the virus to hijack the cell's translation machinery to replicate itself. A herpesvirus lacking the gene coding for ICP34.5 cannot <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> normal cells. However, in many cancer cells the stress response is already disrupted, so a virus lacking ICP34.5 can still <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> them. [...] After the virus has replicated many times, the cell swells and finally bursts, killing the cell and releasing the copies of the virus, which can then infect nearby cells.|$|R
5|$|Diệm's regime had {{announced}} that 5,335,668 people were eligible to vote, {{but when the}} results were declared, there were 5,784,752 ballots. Diệm's government claimed his candidacy had been endorsed by the mother of Bảo Đại, although Diệm had ordered the military to confiscate her family's property and evict her from the land. The near unanimous voter turnout and support for Diệm was <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> highland and Mekong Delta swamp areas, which were not even {{under the control of}} the government and its Vietnamese National Army. In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of the registered voters were recorded, even though the Hòa Hảo warlord Ba Cụt and his army had prevented voting.|$|E
5|$|He was {{instrumental}} in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise be left with. The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The root cause was eventually attributed to metal fatigue and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or indeed to Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, this would be a temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station. The tiles were carefully <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel roofs of the Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over. Because of {{the arrangement of the}} lighting, cabling and public address loudspeakers, {{it was not possible to}} arrange the new roundels at alternate ‘low’ and ‘high’ positions, all being at the lower level.|$|E
5|$|The supreme {{decision-making}} {{bodies of the}} Hezbollah were divided between the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Assembly) which was headed by 12 senior clerical members with responsibility for tactical decisions and supervision of overall Hizballah activity throughout Lebanon, and the Majlis al-Shura al-Karar (the Deciding Assembly), headed by Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah and composed of eleven other clerics with responsibility for all strategic matters. Within the Majlis al-Shura, there existed seven specialized committees dealing with ideological, financial, military and political, judicial, informational and social affairs. In turn, the Majlis al-Shura and these seven committees were <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> each of Hizballah's three main operational areas (the Beqaa, Beirut, and the South).|$|E

5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> the form of a newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the kiosk is framed by a battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The kiosk has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E

5|$|Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were {{completed}} in the late 1990s, Ibrox has had the smallest capacity {{of the three major}} stadiums in Glasgow. Rangers have since explored options to increase capacity. After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> the Copland Stand. A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is <b>replicated</b> <b>in</b> Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} vaccinia virus to <b>replicate</b> <b>in</b> HeLa cells {{which had been}} {{previously}} infected with adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) was studied {{in order to gain}} insight into the mechanism by which adenovirus inhibits the expression of host cell functions. Vaccinia virus was employed in these studies because it <b>replicates</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm, whereas Ad 2 <b>replicates</b> <b>in</b> the nucleus of the cell. It was found that vaccinia deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis is greatly inhibited in adeno-preinfected HeLa cells provided that vaccinia superinfection does not occur before 18 hr after adeno infection. The inhibition of vaccinia DNA synthesis can be traced to an inhibition of vaccinia protein synthesis and viral uncoating.
