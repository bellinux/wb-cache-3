25|$|Black-body radiation, the {{emission}} of electromagnetic energy {{due to an}} object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The equipartition theorem of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational modes. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light {{was known to be}} waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the black body problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose: if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting the <b>Rayleigh–Jeans</b> <b>law</b> which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Planck's work, it {{had been}} assumed that the energy of a body could take on any value {{whatsoever}} - {{that it was a}} continuous variable. The <b>Rayleigh-Jeans</b> <b>law</b> makes close predictions for a narrow range of values at one limit of temperatures, but the results diverge more and more strongly as temperatures increase. To make Planck's law, which correctly predicts blackbody emissions, it was necessary to multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator. The influence of h in this complex factor would not disappear if it were set to zero or to any other value. Making an equation out of Planck's law that would reproduce the <b>Rayleigh-Jeans</b> <b>law</b> could not be done by changing the values of h, of the Boltzmann constant, or of any other constant or variable in the equation.

50|$|According to {{classical}} electromagnetism, {{the number of}} electromagnetic modes in a 3-dimensional cavity, per unit frequency, {{is proportional to the}} square of the frequency. This therefore implies that the radiated power per unit frequency should follow the <b>Rayleigh-Jeans</b> <b>law,</b> and be proportional to frequency squared. Thus, both the power at a given frequency and the total radiated power is unlimited as higher and higher frequencies are considered: this is clearly unphysical as the total radiated power of a cavity is not observed to be infinite, a point that was made independently by Einstein and by Lord Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans in 1905.|$|E

Such cases are not considered strong enough to fully establish a new theory, however, {{and in the case of}} quantum mechanics, it took the confirmation of the theory through new predictions for the theory to gain full acceptance.|$|E
50|$|Kirchhoff's great insight was to {{recognize}} the universality and uniqueness of the function that describes the black body emissive power. But {{he did not know}} the precise form or character of that universal function. Attempts were made by Lord Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans 1900 - 1905 to describe it in classical terms, resulting in <b>Rayleigh-Jeans</b> <b>law.</b> This law turned out to be inconsistent yielding the ultraviolet catastrophe. The correct form of the law was found by Max Planck in 1900, assuming quantized emission of radiation, and is termed Planck's law. This marks the advent of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5000|$|In 1894 Planck {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the problem of black-body radiation. He had been commissioned by electric companies to create maximum light from lightbulbs with minimum energy. The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: [...] "how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the frequency of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?". The question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values. Wilhelm Wien proposed Wien's law, which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. The <b>Rayleigh-Jeans</b> <b>law,</b> another approach to the problem, created what was later known as the [...] "ultraviolet catastrophe", but contrary to many textbooks this was not a motivation for Planck.|$|E
