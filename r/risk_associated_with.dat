25|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> project {{outcomes}} {{is usually}} handled using probability theory.

25|$|As it is {{now known}} that even low levels of air {{pollution}} can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions.

25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the inherent <b>risk</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner that appears to mimic natural infection. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.|$|E

25|$|Increased climate variability, that is {{associated}} with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in stagnant water which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. People are often stranded inside their homes and are exposed to water-borne diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis. Better early warning systems are needed to manage the <b>risk</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> increased rainfall.|$|E
25|$|In a 2004 {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} on colon cancer <b>risk</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> CRP levels, people with colon cancer had higher average CRP concentrations than people without colon cancer. It can {{be noted that}} the average CRP levels in both groups were well within the range of CRP levels usually found in healthy people. However, these findings may suggest that low inflammation level can be associated with a lower risk of colon cancer, concurring with previous studies that indicate anti-inflammatory drugs could lower colon cancer risk.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods {{of determining the}} appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a risk premium that compensates an investor for the relative level of <b>risk</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a particular investment {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.|$|E
