40|$|The article {{tries to}} {{demonstrate}} important links between social structure and social policies. The post-communist state interferes {{more than other}} governments into social structure and supports strong actors. This hinders expansion of the main actor of a successful transition - the middle class. Its stagnation or adverse development causes that the social structure (disintegrated, polarized and unstable) implicitly becomes the main social problem itself which generates other "minor" problems. The middle-class perspective frames many tensions and there can be exhibited four of them: between pensioners and economically active; between working and non-working poor; between {{the middle class and}} other groups and between the entrepreneurial and white-collar middle class. Social cohesion cannot be reached by redistribution only. Redistribution must remain within <b>restricted</b> <b>limits</b> in <b>order</b> not to hinder social change by distorting individual motivation and personal effort. The delineation of such limits should also involve consideration of the social structure. transition, social structure, social policy, Czech Republic...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the rationale for}} and profitably of <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> trading. Although <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> {{are essential to the}} functioning of order driven markets, their use has received relatively little attention in the literature. Trading via <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> is, in fact, sub-optimal when transaction prices change solely in response to new information. We suggest that in an order driven market a paucity of <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> can result in order imbalances causing the transaction price to move temporarily away and then revert to the true price. Such short term changes in transaction price can offset losses incurred by <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> traders because of permanent changes in transaction price due to information. Further, we suggest that the markets can be in ecological balance with liquidity driven price changes being just sufficient for the flow of market and <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> to equilibrate. We use transaction data for the Dow Jones Industrial stocks for 1988 to compare a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> strategy with a market order strategy, and find that <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> returns conditional on non-execution are lower. We also test the profitability of placing a network of buy and sell <b>limit</b> <b>orders,</b> and document the existence of a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> spread that is appreciably greater than the posted bid-ask spread. Our findings suggest that trading via <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> is desirable for participants who are willing to risk non-execution, and that trading via market orders is desirable for participants who are not willing to take the risk. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal {{analysis of the}} relation between monitoring and <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> submission risk. With heterogeneous information, <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> traders face two types of risk. First, they may be "picked off" when prices change unexpectedly after the <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> is entered (known as free trading option risk). Second, they face the possibility that their <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> will not result in a trade. To mitigate these risks, traders can monitor information and prices and cancel or revise their orders as needed. But such monitoring is costly, resulting in a trade-off between the cost of monitoring and the risks of <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> submission. The model predicts that if the stock is actively traded, <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> submission risks and order cancellations/revisions are positively related. Further, shares with a wide bid-ask spread will tend to have a lower rate of order cancellations and revisions than shares with small bid-ask spreads. Finally, the model suggests that if larger capitalization stocks have lower costs of gathering information (and hence more intense monitoring of <b>limit</b> <b>orders),</b> there will be more cancellations and revisions in <b>limit</b> <b>orders.</b> A sample of 23 liquid stocks provides evidence that is consistent with these three main hypotheses. <b>Limit</b> <b>orders</b> Free trading option Non-execution risk News monitoring...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a road map}} for building a contingent claims theory of <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> markets grounded in a simple observation: <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> are equivalent to a portfolio of cash-or-nothing and asset-or-nothing digital options on market <b>order</b> flow. However, <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> are not conventional derivative securities: order flow is an endogenous, non-price state variable; the underlying asset value is a construct, {{the value of the}} security in different order flow states; and arbitrage trading or hedging of <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> is not feasible. Fortunately, none of these problems is fatal since options on order flow can be conceptualized as bets implicit in <b>limit</b> <b>orders,</b> arbitrage trading can be replaced by <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> substitution, and plausible assumptions can be made about the endogeneity of order flow states and their associated asset values. The analysis yields two main results: Arrow-Debreu prices for order flow %u 2018 %u 2018 states%u 2019 %u 2019 are proportional to the slope of the <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> book and the <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> book at one time proves to be identical to that at an earlier time adjusted for the net order flow since that time when all information arrives via trades. ...|$|R
