5000|$|In 1990, the T800 {{series of}} modular base station and <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was on the}} market. The T700 series also appeared.|$|E
50|$|The mill tower still {{serves the}} {{community}} today - it houses radio <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> which helps to deliver high-speed broadband to Norwell {{and the surrounding}} area.|$|E
50|$|The SEA-ME-WE 4 {{cable system}} was {{developed}} by a consortium of 16 telecommunications companies which agreed to construct the project on 27 March 2004. Construction of the system {{was carried out by}} Alcatel Submarine Networks (now a division of Alcatel-Lucent) and Fujitsu. The eighteen month construction project was completed on 13 December 2005 with a cost estimate of US$500 million. Segment 1 construction, running 8,000 kilometres from Singapore to India, was done by Fujitsu, which also provided the submarine <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> for Segment 4.|$|E
50|$|The 19-inch rack format with rack-units of 1.75 in was {{established}} as a standard by AT&T around 1922 {{in order to reduce}} the space required for <b>repeater</b> and termination <b>equipment</b> for toll cables.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is often}} not enough tower space to {{accommodate}} a separate antenna for each <b>repeater</b> at crowded <b>equipment</b> sites. In same-band repeaters at engineered, shared <b>equipment</b> sites, <b>repeaters</b> can be connected to shared antenna systems. These are common in trunked systems, where up to 29 repeaters for a single trunked system may be located at the same site. (Some architectures such as iDEN sites may have more than 29 repeaters.) ...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{optical fiber}} {{repeaters}} use a solid-state optical amplifier, usually an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier. Each <b>repeater</b> contains separate <b>equipment</b> for each fiber. These comprise signal reforming, error measurement and controls. A solid-state laser dispatches the signal {{into the next}} length of fiber. The solid-state laser excites a short length of doped fiber that itself acts as a laser amplifier. As the light passes through the fiber, it is amplified. This system also permits wavelength-division multiplexing, which dramatically increases {{the capacity of the}} fiber.|$|R
50|$|The Transcontinental Cable System or L-carrier {{system was}} {{developed}} by AT&T to create a high capacity transmission facility using coaxial cable, a fairly new medium for HF to RF signal transmission invented in 1927 by Lloyd Espenschied of Bell Telephone Laboratories for long distance communications. There were six phases of development of the system, designated by the Bell System as L-1 through L-5E. Later versions, starting in the early 1960s, were hardened against {{the dangers of the}} cold war using complete placement of all terminal and <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> in hardened underground vaults.|$|E
50|$|It {{was in the}} Great Coastal Gale of 2007 the Washington County ARES {{group was}} able to test D-STAR during this series of several strong Pacific storms that {{interrupted}} conventional communication systems for up to one week. Primary emergency traffic for the American Red Cross and the Vernonia, Oregon Fire Department was handled by the group using traditional FM voice because the group had no D-STAR <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> available. Once the situation's communication needs became established the D*Chat messaging function was used to send small text transmissions via D-STAR simplex at distances of up to seventeen miles.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the radio-telegraph, the system also provided other services to the general public. From 1938 until 1942, under an agreement with Alberta Government Telephones, a radiotelephone service was provided at the following RC Signals stations: Edmonton, McMurray, Fort Smith, Yellowknife and Goldfields. <b>Repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> was installed in the Edmonton Radio Station with connections to {{the offices of the}} Alberta Government Telephones from where local or long distance connections were made in the normal manner. At the northern stations, telephone booths were installed and tied in with the HF transmitting and receiving equipment. It was greeted and used enthusiastically by mining and transportation companies particularly as well as the general public, for both business and social calls.|$|E
50|$|By the mid '60s, {{the company}} began {{actively}} promoting its products by advertising in technical journals as natural consequence of a growing business, thanks to its first large-scale commercialized radio transceiver: the 3-channel 3-B3 and later the RT450 (1966), capable of aggregating 48 channels into UHF band. The RT450 equipment was also certified by :it:Telettra under the commercial name H450 as fallback link for its high-capacity solutions. Power-line communication systems were also manufactured by the company in those years along with the first fixed and mobile communication terminals in VHF band (1972) for vehicular communications (precurring modern mobile phones) and anti burglar alarm systems.By 1973, a whole new internal division was created {{for the design of}} television broadcasting <b>equipments</b> (<b>repeaters</b> and transmitters) whose main customer was the national television company RAI. The first television products were based on thermo-ionic tubes though the improvement of solid state technologies soon replaced vacuum tubes. Similar improvements in printed board manufacturing made microstrip circuits a viable solution for increasingly-high microwave frequencies and in 1978 the RT12 radio equipment boasted the first direct-conversion 2.3 GHz synthesized modulator and could aggregate 120 telephone channels. In these years, the company manufactured the historical link to connect the Milan and Rome branches of the Corriere della Sera newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 Roderick Breis {{had moved}} onto other {{projects}} and he donated the old equipment and signed over {{the rights to}} use the CityRail site to Newcastle CREST. The rights to the VMB4 licence was sold to Richard Akehust who purchased and installed his own <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> on the Auzcom Communications site south of the CityRail site. Richard Akehurst has found an alternative location {{to reduce the cost}} of operation of the repeater and is awaiting ACMA Approval.Due to the owner of the Auzcom Communications site passing away Richard Akehurst has chosen to re-locate VMB04 to Nelson Bay and is now licensed as ELS02. This site is now active, with very good reports heard from all over the Great Lakes and Port Stephens areas, right out to Raymond Terrace, Maitland and some of Newcastle ...|$|E
50|$|Common paging {{protocols}} include TAP, FLEX, ReFLEX, POCSAG, GOLAY, ERMES and NTT. Past paging protocols include Two-tone and 5/6-tone. In the United States, pagers typically receive signals {{using the}} FLEX protocol in the 900 MHz band. Commercial paging transmitters typically radiate 1000 watts of effective power, {{resulting in a}} much wider coverage area per tower than a mobile phone transmitter, which typically radiates around 0.6 Watts per channel. Although 900 MHz FLEX paging networks tend to have stronger in-building coverage than mobile phone networks, commercial paging service providers will work with large institutions to install <b>repeater</b> <b>equipment</b> {{in the event that}} service is not available in needed areas of the subscribing institution's buildings. This is especially critical in hospital settings where emergency staff must be able to reliably receive pages in order to respond to patient needs.|$|E
