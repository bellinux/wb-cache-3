60|$|Mr. Roberts {{was a man}} of business, or {{agent to}} the property, who lived at Shrewsbury, and whom Mr. Greenwood {{especially}} disliked. Mr. Greenwood being a clergyman was, of course, supposed to be a gentleman, and regarded Mr. Roberts as being much beneath himself. It was not customary for Mr. Roberts to dine at the house, and he was therefore regarded by the chaplain as being hardly more than an upper servant. It was therefore very grievous to him to be told that he must discuss his own private affairs and make his <b>renewed</b> <b>request</b> as to the living through Mr. Roberts. It was evidently intended that he should have no opportunity of discussing his private affairs. Whatever the Marquis might offer him he must take; and that, {{as far as he could}} see, without any power of redress on his side. If Mr. Roberts were to offer him a thousand pounds, he could only accept the cheque and depart with it from Trafford Park, shaking off from his feet the dust which such ingratitude would forbid him to carry with him.|$|E

The Ministry of Justice said that it will repatriate Som-na following a repatriation trial in France. She appeared before a judge on 28 May, who decided against releasing her on bail. Through her French lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, Som-na has said she is innocent of the charges brought against her. An appeal court on 11 June rejected Som-na's request for bail citing flight risk.

A further call for a Commission of Inquiry was made by former National MPs Katherine Rich and Don Brash and author Lynley Hood in November 2008, and the new Minister of Justice Simon Power said that the government would reconsider the issue.

As long as SVHCs are used in articles, exposures and risks are real. ‘Safety improved, but consumers are not yet safe’ [18]. Therefore, the violation of SVHC provisions should not be regarded as trivial offence and must be prosecuted. A general absence of legal consequences in case of non-compliance with the information duty is the wrong signal for companies who take their responsibility seriously, phase out SVHCs in their articles, and respond to all consumer requests. ECHA’s position is that Art. 33 (2) is an important right of consumers and the fact that suppliers do not reply may be a breach of this provision.

40|$|Informatization {{of world}} science {{predetermined}} {{the emergence of}} new tools for measurement and evaluation of the work of a scientist in quantitative aspect and the creation of scientometric databases, respectively. The existence of different approaches to the assessment of knowledge {{with the use of the}} global scientometric databases confirms the relevance of this research. The aim of the research is the systematization of methodological approaches to the assessment of the knowledge accumulated in scientometric databases, and determining prospects for the development of the assessment of knowledge of Ukrainian authors in the world system of scientometric evaluation. We applied general scientific and special research methods: analysis, synthesis, comparative characteristics, theoretical generalization, system approach. In the work a scientometric database is defined as the platform that deposits (accumulates) in electronic format scientific works of scientists of different branches of knowledge and processes lists of cited literature, calculates certain quantitative indicators, based on which it is possible to analyze the influence/credibility of the activity of one or another publication, organization, scientist etc. It is stressed that the main indicator, with the help of which the assessment of knowledge is given, is the knowledge economy index. We carried out a historical review and found that the first and one of the most respected scientometric knowledge databases of the world is Web of Science, part of the platform of the Web of Knowledge. The most widely used quantitative measure that is calculated in this database is the index of efficiency. Another most famous database is Scopus, which Elsevier publishing corporation positions as the largest universal abstract database that allows tracking scientific citation of publications. In accordance with the declared policy of the corporation, this database must become the most complete and exhaustive resource for the search of literature. It was found that the projects concerning the use of the scientometric database Scopus for assessment of the scientific potential of Ukraine in general and individual subjects of scientific activities of the state at the level of the authorities of state governance began to emerge in 2009. It is stressed that only a small proportion of professional publications of Ukraine is integrated into Scopus and the Web of Science, and to analyze objectively the status of science development in the country with their help is impossible. We concluded that despite the inclusion of new publications into these databases, joining them is a complex and lengthy process. Out of several thousand of journals, the Web of Science selects about 10 – 12, Scopus ~ 50 %. The review procedure lasts for almost a year and in case of rejection the <b>renewed</b> <b>request</b> for registration can be submitted only in 2 years. The assumption was adopted about the development of the assessment of knowledge by means of the most famous global scientometric databases in Ukraine: much time is yet to pass until most of the periodicals from the post–Soviet territory will be included into scientific repositories–leaders and a possibility will come to provide objective assessment with their assistance. The scientific novelty of the article is in the systematization of methodological approaches to the analysis and evaluation of knowledge in the world system of scientometric evaluation and in determining the prospects for the development of this sphere in Ukraine. The practical significance of the obtained results is the use by domestic scientists of the materials of the paper to determine scientometric databases and indexes that are the most appropriate for submitting publications and collaboration with the leading periodicals of the world by the fields of knowledge. At present, in the world practice they use 4 indexes of scientific citation as the main tool for the quantitative measurement of the efficiency of the work of a scientist. The use of such indexes is the prospect of further research in the development of the knowledge econom...|$|E

50|$|Initially, the United States {{sought to}} prevent {{prosecution}} of personnel on U.N. missions by any country except {{that of their}} nationality. The Security Council rejected that approach, and the United States made use of a provision of the Rome Statute that allowed the Security Council to direct the ICC not exercise its jurisdiction over a certain matter for up to one year. The United States sought the Security Council to convey such a request to the ICC concerning U.S. personnel on United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations. Further, the U.S. sought to have that <b>request</b> <b>renewed</b> automatically each year. (If renewed automatically each year, then another Security Council resolution {{would be required to}} cease the request, which the United States could then veto, which would effectively make the request permanent.) ICC supporters argued that the Rome Statute requires that, for the request to be valid, it must be voted upon each year in the Security Council. Therefore, an automatically <b>renewing</b> <b>request</b> would violate the Statute. By international law, questions regarding the interpretation of the U.N.
