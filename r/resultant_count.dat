30|$|During {{hybrid yarn}} {{preparation}} in hollow spinning, the core component {{had to be}} kept in high tension for winding the cover properly around the core. To achieve the required tension in case of copper core samples (A 1 and B 1), a draft of 1.3 between the front drafting roller and the take-up roller had to be maintained. Since copper has very less elasticity due to its high modulus, this draft during spinning made it permanently elongated, hence the elongation values in the hybrid yarn sample A 1 and B 1 were reduced. This is also reflected in the <b>resultant</b> <b>count</b> of the sample A 1 and B 1 in Table  2. The <b>resultant</b> <b>count</b> of 75 Tex copper wire and 31.60 Tex polyester turned out to be 89.40 Tex only (sample A 1). Similarly, 320.80 Tex copper with 78.52 Tex AW yarn blend in hybrid yarn B 1 was only 354.56 Tex.|$|E
40|$|The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, now in {{construction}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory, will use phase controlled power converters {{for the main}} dipole and quadrupole magnet strings. The rectifiers in these power supplies will be controlled by a digital regulator based on the TI 320 C 30 Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The DSP implements the current loop, the voltage loop, and a system to actively reduce the sub-harmonic ripple components. Digital firing circuits consisting of a phase locked lop and counters are used to fire the SCRs. Corrections for the sub-harmonic reduction are calculated by the DSP and stored in registers in the firing circuit. These corrections are added in hardware, to the over-all firing count provided by the DSP. the <b>resultant</b> <b>count</b> is compared to a reference counter to fire the SCRs. This combination of a digital control system and the digital firing circuits allows the correction of the sub-harmonics in a real-time sense.

40|$|Conventionally, {{selection}} of traffic counting/survey stations for volume studies is purely subjective, relying {{much on the}} political jurisdictions, natural boundaries or man-made barriers. Two conflict objectives are generally kept in mind when allocating counting stations: obtaining as much representative traffic information as possible and saving subsequent manpower requirement in data collection. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} determine the optimal traffic counting locations. However, very limited attention has been devoted to developing efficient traffic counting location strategies. The thesis aims to fill this gap and create a computer- based mathematical tool for systematically selecting traffic counting locations for Origin-Destination (O-D) matrix estimation. In this thesis, we have developed network traffic counting strategies for O-D matrix estimation according to the existing location rules. We consider two aspects of the counting location problem: how to choose the optimal locations for a given number of counting stations to intercept as many O-D pairs as possible; how to determine the minimum number and locations of counting stations required for interception of all the O-D pairs. The problems of interest are formulated as two different models. Firstly, we formulate them as binary integer programming models and the Genetic Algorithms is employed to solve them. Furthermore, the traffic counting location problem is reformulated as an integer linear programming model and an efficient algorithm based on column generation scheme is developed. Finally, we use the proposed models and algorithms to evaluate the impacts of the <b>resultant</b> <b>counting</b> location patterns on the O-D matrix estimation quality in terms of several measures. All the analyses and developments will be illustrated by numerical examples...|$|R

The experimental work was focused on processing flake graphite and ductile iron under various inoculationconditions {{in order to achieve}} various physicochemical states of the experimental melts. In addition, plates of various wall thicknesses, s were cast and the resultant eutectic cell or nodule counts were established. Moreover, thermal analysis was used to find out the degree of maximum undercooling for the graphite eutectic, Tm. A relationship was found between the eutectic cell or nodule count and the maximum undercooling Tm [...] In addition it was also found that N can be related to the wall thickness of plate shaped castings. Finally, the present work provides a rational for the effect of technological factors such as the melt chemistry, inoculation practice, and holding temperature and time on the <b>resultant</b> cell <b>count</b> or nodule count of cast iron.

The processor instruction set {{is based on}} the stack-based ZPU architecture. In addition, a simple generic plug-in interface is implemented in order to allow integration of application specific coprocessors to the main processor core. In the current version of the processor, a simple direct memory access engine and a serialized Klein cipher coprocessor are implemented and connected to the processor core. Through these engines, it is possible to implement various lightweight security and authentication schemes in a code and area effective way. A simple assembler code is written and tested on the processor in order to verify the functionality of the processor core and coprocessors. The code implements a Davies-Meyer coding scheme and uses the Klein block cipher as a hash function. The GCC toolset originally written for the 32 -bit ZPU is being adapted to work with the 8 -bit processor core. The designed processor is synthesized using VeriSilicon GSMC 0. 13 um lowpower process high-density standard cell library for a target operating frequency of 100 KHz, and the <b>resultant</b> gate <b>count</b> is 4. 5 K GE.

40|$|Objective. The {{purposes}} {{of our present}} study were to evaluate the potential of platelet-rich plasma gel to enhance granulation tissue formation after open abdomen and to examine whether the effect was attributable to stimulating rapid neovascularization. Methods. Twenty-four rats underwent colon ascendens stent peritonitis surgery to induce sepsis, followed by intraperitoneal injection of nitrogen to create intra-abdominal hypertension. Four hours later, laparotomies were performed. The rats were randomized into three groups (n= 8 for each group) : control, platelet-poor plasma (PPP), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) groups. One week after the treatment, granulation tissue formation and angiogenesis were evaluated by histological and laser Doppler analysis. Results. The <b>resultant</b> platelet <b>count</b> in platelet-rich plasma was {{higher than that of}} PPP. The concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor BB, transforming growth factor β- 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor in PRP were significantly higher when compared with that of PPP. Myofibroblast count, granulation tissue thickness, vessel numbers, and blood perfusion were increased in PRP group, followed by PPP group, with control being the least. Conclusion. Rapidly in situ forming platelet-rich plasma gel promoted remarkable neovascularization and early wound healing after open abdomen and may lead to novel and effective treatments for open abdominal wounds...|$|R

Escherichia coli B and the coliphage T 2 were used in these studies. Host cultures less than 12 hr old produced the best results. Approximately 1010 host organisms must be present in the sample taken for filtration. To avoid phage reproduction, all steps prior to filtration must be done in less than 45 min. The method was compared with the soft-agar technique and was shown to be less precise but able to measure phage in lower concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies suggest}} that objectively {{quantifying}} coughing in audio recordings offers a novel means to understand coughing and assess treatments. Currently, manual cough counting is the most accurate method for quantifying coughing. However, the demand of manually counting cough records is substantial, demonstrating a need to reduce record lengths prior to counting whilst preserving the coughs within them. This study tested the performance of an algorithm developed for this purpose. Methods 20 subjects were recruited (5 healthy smokers and non-smokers, 5 chronic cough, 5 {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and 5 asthma), fitted with an ambulatory recording system and recorded for 24 hours. The recordings produced were divided into 15 min segments and counted. Periods of inactive audio in each segment were removed using the median frequency and power of the audio signal and the resulting files re-counted. Results The median resultant segment length was 13. 9 s (IQR 56. 4 s) and median 24 hr recording length 62. 4 min (IQR 100. 4). A median of 0. 0 coughs/h (IQR 0. 0 - 0. 2) were erroneously removed and the variability in the <b>resultant</b> cough <b>counts</b> was comparable to that between manual cough counts. The largest error was seen in asthmatic patients, but still only 1. 0 % coughs/h were missed. Conclusions These data show that a system which measures signal activity using the median audio frequency can substantially reduce record lengths without significantly compromising the coughs contained within them. </p...|$|R

The number counts are derived from NEP-deep and NEP-wide surveys, which cover areas of 0. 5 and 5. 8 deg 2, respectively. To produce {{reliable}} number counts, the sources were extracted from recently updated images. Completeness and difference between observed and intrinsic magnitudes were corrected by Monte Carlo simulation. Stellar counts were subtracted by using the stellar fraction estimated from optical data. The <b>resultant</b> source <b>counts</b> are given down to the 80 % completeness limit; 0. 18, 0. 16, 0. 10, 0. 05, 0. 06, 0. 10, 0. 15, 0. 16, and 0. 44 mJy in the 2. 4, 3. 2, 4. 1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18 and 24 um bands, respectively. On the bright side of all bands, the count distribution is flat, consistent with the Euclidean Universe, while on the faint side, the counts deviate, suggesting that the galaxy population of the distant universe is evolving. These results are generally consistent with previous galaxy counts in similar wavebands. We also compare our counts with evolutionary models and find them in good agreements. By integrating the models down to the 80 % completeness limits, we calculate that the AKARI NEP-survey revolves 20 %- 50 % of the cosmic infrared background, depending on the wavebands.

The model of Baranyi and Roberts (Int. J.

It was modeled by means of a parameter quantifying the biochemical work the surviving cells carry out during this phase, the “work to be done. ” The logarithms of the maximum specific growth rates as a function of the water activity in the three media differed only by additive constants, which gave a theoretical basis for bias factors characterizing the relationships between different media. Models for the lag and the “work to be done” as a function of the water activity showed similar properties, but in rich medium above 5 % salt concentrations, the data showed a maximum for this work. An accurate description of the lag time is important to avoid food wastage, which is an issue of increasing significance in the food industry, while maintaining food safety standards...|$|R

Given the clinical burden from lung cancer and the relatively favorable survival associated with early-stage lung cancer, biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer are of important potential clinical benefit. Methods:We performed a global lung cancer serum biomarker discovery study using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in a set of pooled non-small cell lung cancer case sera and matched controls. Immunoaffinity subtraction was used to deplete the top most abundant serum proteins; the remaining serum proteins were subjected to trypsin digestion and analyzed in triplicate by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The tandem mass spectrum data were searched against the human proteome database, and the <b>resultant</b> spectral <b>counting</b> data were used to estimate the relative abundance of proteins across the case/control serum pools. The spectral counting-derived abundances of some candidate biomarker proteins were confirmed with multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assays. Results:A list of 49 differentially abundant candidate proteins was compiled by applying a negative binomial regression model to the spectral counting data (p < 0. 01). Functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools showed significant enrichment of inflammatory response proteins, key molecules in cell-cell signaling and interaction network, and differential physiological responses for the two common non-small cell lung cancer subtypes. Conclusions:We identified a set of candidate serum biomarkers with statistically significant differential abundance across the lung cancer case/control pools, which, when validated, could improve lung cancer early detection...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that> 10 % of married couples are infertile (1) {{and the cause of}} the infertile state is often obscure (2). There is increasing evidence that autoimmunity to sperm antigens may be an important mechanism of unexplained infertility. A higher prevalence of antibodies to spermatozoa has been detected in the sera of couples with unexplained infertility as compared with fertile couples (3, 4). In many species, including guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, and mice, immunization with sperm or testicular antigens results in autoimmune response to sperm antigens and experimental allergic orchitis, an autoimmune disease of the testis (5 - 7). Orchitis can lead to aspermatogenesis and infertility. Testicular biopsy of some infertile men often reveals aspermatogenesis (8). Female animals immunized with sperm develop antisperm antibodies and may also become infertile (9 - 12). Autoantibodies to spermatoioa can block prefertilization and fertilization steps in vitro (13, 14). Vasectomy results in autoimmune response to sperm antigens (7, 15 - 18) and orehitis that resembles experiment allergic orchitis (19, 20).

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of Solar Cycle # 24 {{will have a}} non-trivial impact on the lifetimes of debris pieces that resulted from the intentional hypervelocity impact of the Fengyun 1 -C satellite in January 2007. Recent solar flux measurements indicate Solar Cycle # 24 has begun {{in the last few}} months, and will continue until approximately 2019. While there have been differing opinions on whether the intensity of this solar cycle will be higher or lower than usual, the Space Weather Prediction Center within the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA/SWPC) has recently forecast unusually low solar activity, which would result in longer orbital lifetimes. Using models for both the breakup of Fengyun 1 -C and the propagation of the resultant debris cloud, the Orbital Debris Program Office at NASA Johnson Space Center conducted a study to better understand the impact of the solar cycle on lifetimes for pieces as small as 1 mm. Using a modified collision breakup model and PROP 3 D propagation software, the orbits of nearly 2 million objects 1 mm and larger were propagated for up to 200 years. By comparing a normal solar cycle with that of the NOAA/SWPC forecast low cycle, the effect of the solar flux on the lifetimes of the debris pieces is evaluated. The modeling of the low solar cycle shows an additional debris count of 12 % for pieces larger than 10 cm by 2019 when compared to the <b>resultant</b> debris <b>count</b> using a normal cycle. The difference becomes more exaggerated (over 15 %) for debris count in the smaller size regimes. However, in 50 years, the models predict the differences in debris count from differing models of Solar Cycle # 24 to be less than 10 % for all size regimes, with less variance in the smaller sizes. Understanding the longevity of the debris cloud will affect collision probabilities for both operational spacecraft and large derelict objects over the next century and beyond...|$|R

Images of mango trees were acquired over a three day period, three weeks before commercial harvest occurred. The fruit load of each of fifteen trees was manually counted, and these trees were imaged on four sides. Correlation between tree counts and manual image counts was strong (R 2 = 0. 91 for two sides). A further 555 trees were imaged on one side only. For these images, pixels were segmented into fruit and background pixels using colour segmentation in the RGB and YCbCr colour ranges and a texture segmentation based on adjacent pixel variability. <b>Resultant</b> blobs were <b>counted</b> to obtain a per image mango count.

40|$|This thesis {{reviews and}} {{develops}} modern advanced statistical methodology for sampling and modelling count data from marine ecological studies, with specific applications to quantifying potential {{direct and indirect}} effects of marine reserves on fishes in north eastern New Zealand. Counts of snapper (Pagrus auratus: Sparidae) from baited underwater video surveys from an unbalanced, multi-year, hierarchical sampling programme were analysed using a Bayesian Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) approach, which allowed the integer counts to be explicitly modelled while incorporating multiple fixed and random effects. Overdispersion was modelled using a zero-inflated negative-binomial error distribution. A parsimonious method for zero inflation was developed, where {{the mean of the}} count distribution is explicitly linked to the probability of an excess zero. Comparisons of variance components identified marine reserve status as the greatest source of variation in counts of snapper above the legal size limit. Relative densities inside reserves were, on average, 13 -times greater than outside reserves. Small benthic reef fishes inside and outside the same three reserves were surveyed to evaluate evidence for potential indirect effects of marine reserves via restored populations of fishery-targeted predators such as snapper. Sites for sampling were obtained randomly from populations of interest using spatial data and geo-referencing tools in R—a rarely used approach that is recommended here more generally to improve field-based ecological surveys. <b>Resultant</b> multispecies <b>count</b> data were analysed with multivariate GLMMs implemented in the R package MCMCglmm, based on a multivariate Poisson lognormal error distribution. Posterior distributions for hypothesised effects of interest were calculated directly for each species. While reserves did not appear to affect densities of small fishes, reserve-habitat interactions indicated that some endemic species of triplefin (Tripterygiidae) had different associations with small-scale habitat gradients inside vs outside reserves. These patterns were consistent with a behavioural risk effect, where small fishes may be more strongly attracted to refuge habitats to avoid predators inside vs outside reserves. The approaches developed and implemented in this thesis respond to some of the major current statistical and logistic challenges inherent in the analysis of counts of organisms. This work provides useful exemplar pathways for rigorous study design, modelling and inference in ecological systems...|$|R

Direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antigen typing, irregular antibody screening and identification were done by polyspecific antihuman globulin cards and standard tube method. At presentation, the newborn twins (T 1, T 2) had HDN with <b>resultant</b> low reticulocyte <b>count</b> and prolonged anemia, which continued for up to 70 days of life.

Recurring reduction of the hematocrit along with low reticulocyte count and normal other cell line indicated a pure red cell aplastic state. Anti-M is capable of causing HDN as well as prolonged anemia (red cell aplasia) due to its ability to destroy the erythroid precursor cells.

40|$|AIM: To {{define the}} role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers in root canal {{disinfection}} along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. METHODOLOGY: The hypothesis was tested ex vivo that Nd:YAG laser irradiation has a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. <b>Resultant</b> colony-forming unit <b>counts</b> were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (CSEM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct Nd:YAG laser irradiation, respectively. RESULTS: The Nd:YAG laser irradiation (1. 5 W, 15 Hz, four times for 5 s) of Enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0. 05, Wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a 99. 7 % kill, but no sterilization. The CSEM procedure verified that the extent of radiation damage was {{in line with the}} total amount of laser energy applied. After 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i. e. through a 1 -mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of Actinomyces naeslundii or Streptococcus anginosus were discernible. However, when micro-colonies of S. anginosus and specially biofilms of E. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using ESEM and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: The Nd:YAG laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine.

METHODOLOGY: Root canals of extracted teeth (n = 38) were prepared (size 30, 0. 10 taper), autoclaved, divided into three groups and two negative controls inoculated (Streptococcus anginosus, Enterococcus faecalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum) and treated (PAD, laser, dye or positive control) according to a cross-sectional design. <b>Resultant</b> colony-forming unit <b>counts</b> were associated with observations of cell structural changes using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentinal surfaces (n = 22, two controls) before (1, 2 and 6 days of incubation) and after treatment with PAD. RESULTS: Treatment of root canals with PAD (15 J) caused a significant reduction of the bacterial load, resulting in a 93. 8 % kill of S. anginosus (P < 0. 0001), a 88. 4 % kill of E. faecalis (P < 0. 05) and a 98. 5 % kill of F. nucleatum (P < 0. 0001), but no sterilization. Laser alone had no {{significant effect on the}} load nor did the dye without laser. The ESEM experiment showed that individual cells or monolayers were easily eliminated with PAD. But when biofilms were present (2 and 6 days for E. faecalis, 6 days for S. anginosus), bacterial eradication was substantially reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: Photo-activated disinfection is not an alternative but a possible supplement to the existing protocols for root canal disinfection as the interaction between light (diode laser) and associated dye (TBO) provides a broad-spectrum effect. Some endodontic pathogens that grow as single-species biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), {{formerly}} known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, is a relatively rare, but potentially life threatening autoimmune disorder that involves the destruction of platelets by autoantibodies. The <b>resultant</b> decreased platelet <b>count</b> leaves the patient at risk for excessive bruising and bleeding (Hunt, 2010). ITP can occur in both adults and children, and also occurs as an acute or chronic disorder. It is thought {{that the cause of}} acute ITP may differ from that of chronic ITP, however, the underlying disease processes that occur are very similar (Johnsen, 2012). Acute ITP, {{the most common form of}} the disease, most often occurs in children (Hunt, 2010). It is estimated that acute ITP occurs in as many as 6. 4 per 100, 000 children per year (Deane, 2014). Most children diagnosed with acute ITP have a history of a recent viral infection, usually occurring three to four weeks prior to diagnosis. The majority of cases are relatively mild and nearly 50 percent of these cases will resolve within two months. The most serious, but very rare, complication of ITP is intracranial hemorrhage (Maher, 2014). Throughout my experience in pediatric hematology/oncology, I have cared for a number of patients diagnosed with acute ITP. Although ITP is generally treated by specialists in hematology, most patients present to their primary care practitioner with the onset of signs and symptoms. Thrombocytopenia can also be seen in other hematological and oncological diseases and often, ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is important that primary care practitioners that treat both adults and children recognize the presenting symptoms of this disease to begin the proper work-up. Although this disorder is rare, it is essential for practitioners to be aware of this condition to consider it as a potential diagnosis and identify patients at risk for severe complications of the disease...|$|R
40|$|I. The Effect of Chlorpromazine on the Eosinophil Cell Count. By {{determining}} the eosinophil cell {{count in the}} blood by the direct counting method, studies were made on how the eosinophil cell count is influenced by chlorpromazine administered subcutaneously. Experiments were carried out in rats under varying conditions. (1) Three groups of normal rats were injected subcutaneously with chlorpromazine in doses of 1, 5 and 20 mg. per kg. of body weight, respectively, and the eosinophil cell count was estimated after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours. There {{was no significant difference}} between the cell counts made before and after injection of chlorpromazine in a group to which chlorpromazine in a dose of 1 mg. pet kg. of body weight was injected. However, in groups to which chlorpromazine was given in doses over 5 mg, per kg. of body weight, the cell count showed a decrease in the initial stage following administration of chlorpromazine. It tended to show a larger decrease for a longer duration in groups to which a greater amount of chlorprmazine was injected. (2) Similar experiments were carried out in rats from which either the adrenal glands on both sides of the hypophysis had been removed experimentally. Administration of chlorpromazine in doses over 5 mg per kg of body weight hardly caused any decrease in the cell count. (3) Premedication of chlorpromazine in a dose of 5 mg. per kg. of body accelerated the decrease of the eosinophil cell <b>count</b> <b>resultant</b> from the stress to which rats had been exposed-the stress of the administration of adrenaline in a dose of 0. 5 mg. per kg. of body weight and of histamine in a dose of 5 mg per kg of body weight, and of surgical operation. (4) In rabbits in which deep anesthesia had been produced by either ether or phenobarbital, the decrease of the eosinophil cell count arising from subcutaneous injection of chlorpromazine. in a dose of 5 mg. per kg. body weight was inhibited moderately in rats under the influence of ether and completely in those under the influence of phenobarbital. (5) Results of the present experiments would suggest that chlorpromazine, when given in a larger dose (over 5 mg. per kg. of body weight), may have an action of stimulating the diencephalon-hypophysis-adrenal cortex system. II. The Influence of Chlorpromazine on Thyroid Uptake of I^ in Rats. Experiments were performed to determine whether chlorpromazine had any influences on thyroid uptake of I^ and I^ content of the plasma in rats under varying conditions. A tracer dose of I^ was injected into the abdominal cavity and I^ was estimated by the direct method 4, 16, 24 and 48 hours after injection. The values in rats to which chlorpromazine had been injected were compared with the corresponding values in rats not injected with chlorpromazine, which served as the control. (1) Thyroid uptake of I^ fell as the result of injection of chlorpromazine in normal rats. The greater the amount injected, the lower was thyroid uptake of I^ and the longer was the duration of its effect to inhibit the uptake. (2) Thyroid uptake of I^ was generally higher in rats from which the adrenals had beed removed surgically than in normal ones. Yet, chlorpromazine was almost as effective in the former as in the latter in reducing thyroid uptake of I^. (3) Thyroid uptake of I^ was markedly lower in rats from which the hypophysis had been removed surgically than in normal ones. Injection of chlorpromazine did not result in appreciable fall in thyroid uptake of I^ in rats from which the hypophysis had been removed. (4) In normal rats and rats from which the adrenals had been removed sugically, injection of chlorpromazine caused an initial fall in thyroid uptake of I^, which was followed by a transient rise. (5) Chlorpromazine had no marked effect on I^ content of the plasma in rats under varying conditions...|$|R
