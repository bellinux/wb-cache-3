The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. [...] "Cumberbatch", says The Guardian, [...] "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly Aspergerish". Cumberbatch said, [...] "There's a great charge you get from playing him, because {{of the volume of}} words in your head and the speed of thought—you <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make your connections incredibly fast. He is {{one step ahead of the}} audience and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him." [...] Piers Wenger, head of drama at BBC Cymru Wales, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as [...] "a dynamic superhero in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police—everyone in fact". Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the pipe with multiple nicotine patches. The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like [...] "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that [...] "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture". Moffat turned the character [...] "more Victorian" [...] in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's [...] "beautiful voice" [...] to make it sound like [...] "he's giving a lecture".|$|E
