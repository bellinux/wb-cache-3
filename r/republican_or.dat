5|$|After her {{completion}} Petr Veliky {{was assigned}} to the Gunnery Training Detachment through 1917. A number of sources report that she was renamed by the Soviets as Respublikanets (<b>Republican)</b> <b>or</b> Barrikada (Barricade), but this is not confirmed by the post-Cold War sources used by McLaughlin. That year she was assigned as a depot ship for submarines at Kronstadt and later Helsinki. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Petr Veliky reached Kronstadt in April in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'. The ship was hulked on 21 May 1921 and used to store mines. She was renamed Blokshiv Nr. 1 on 4 December 1923 and forced aground in shallow water by autumn floods in September 1923. She was not refloated and repaired until 5 October 1927. On 1 January 1932 she was renamed to Blokshiv Nr. 4, and to BSh-3 on 16 May 1949, by which time she was being used as a barracks ship at Kronstadt. The ship was stricken on 18 April 1959 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

25|$|He was {{a member}} of the {{convention}} of Pennsylvania, which ratified the Constitution of the United States. In the Pennsylvania State Constitutional Convention of 1789/90, he argued for a strong executive and was himself a Federalist.

25|$|It is not {{a closed}} primary, in which votes can be cast in a party primary only by people {{registered}} with that party, in that state. Undeclared voters—those not registered with any party—can vote in either party primary.

25|$|The Democratic Party {{evolved from}} the Jeffersonian <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> Democratic-Republican Party {{organized}} by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison {{in opposition to the}} Federalist Party of Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. The party favored republicanism, a weak federal government, states' rights, agrarian interests (especially Southern planters) and strict adherence to the Constitution; it opposed a national bank, close ties to Great Britain and business and banking interests. That party, the Democratic-Republican Party, came to power in the election of 1800.|$|E

25|$|The French {{imperial}} {{government now}} looked to a diplomatic success to stifle {{demands for a}} return to either a republic or a Bourbon monarchy. A war with Prussia and resulting territorial gains in the Rhineland and later Luxembourg and Belgium seemed the best hope to unite the French nation behind the Bonapartist dynasty. With the resulting prestige from a successful war, Napoleon III could then safely suppress any lingering <b>republican</b> <b>or</b> revolutionary sentiment behind reactionary nationalism and return France to the center of European politics.|$|E
25|$|George or Gheorghe Ranetti, born George Ranete (October 1875 – May 25, 1928), was a Romanian poet, {{journalist}} and playwright, {{known as the}} founder and editor of Furnica magazine. A professional journalist from the late 1890s, he alternated between political dailies and literary reviews, being sympathetic to Romanian nationalism and traditionalism, and working under Ion Luca Caragiale at Moftul Român. By 1904–1906, he was active on the margin of left-wing traditionalism, or Poporanism, showing himself sympathetic to <b>republican</b> <b>or</b> generically anti-elitist ideologies. Such views and influences seeped into his activity at Furnica, which was for decades a prominent institution in Romanian humor.|$|E
25|$|The 1976 {{campaign}} {{proved to}} be the zenith of Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,000 votes for governor and the party. This forced the races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> Democratic candidates for those offices from garnering a majority of votes. The campaign drained the finances and energy of the Liberty Union, however, and in October 1977, {{less than a year after}} the conclusion of the 1976 campaign, Sanders and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party.|$|E

The 2nd has been in the hands of <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> their predecessors since 1855. Until the 1950s, congressmen from the 1st and 2nd Districts were among the few truly senior Republican congressmen from the South. Historically, Democrats were more competitive in the Chattanooga-based 3rd district, but recent trends have made it almost as staunchly Republican as the 1st and 2nd districts.|$|R

25|$|The MRF's {{surveillance}} operations {{included the}} use of front companies (see below) and disguises. Former members claim they posed as road sweepers, dustmen and even homeless meths-drinkers while carrying out surveillance. The MRF {{is known to have}} used double agents referred to as 'Freds'. These were <b>republican</b> <b>or</b> loyalist paramilitaries who were recruited by British Military Intelligence. The Freds would work inside paramilitary groups, feeding back information to the MRF. They were also ferried through Belfast in armoured cars, and through the gunslit would point-out paramilitary individuals of note. Through this method the MRF compiled extensive photographs and dossiers of Belfast militants of both factions.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2001, President Clinton {{commuted}} {{the sentences}} of the men; Berger's sentence became two years, {{and the other}} men each had 30 months. Federal prosecutors investigated the pardons {{to see if they}} were made in exchange for political support. A 2001 ABC News article stated that some people wondered whether the pardons occurred as a kind of favor because the Village of New Square had voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton for her first senate term (1359 out of 1369 votes – in contrast to two other Hasidic communities nearby who voted overwhelmingly <b>republican)</b> <b>or</b> if the pardons occurred as part of a quid pro quo swap for votes. Hillary Clinton said that she was not involved in the pardons and that her husband pardoned the men out of clemency. In 2002 the prosecutors closed the investigation with no action.|$|E
25|$|He {{supported}} the parliamentarians against the <b>republican</b> <b>or</b> army party, {{and appears to}} {{have been one of the}} members excluded in 1648. He sat in Richard Cromwell's parliament for Member of Parliament for Dublin City, and endeavoured to take his seat in the restored Rump Parliament of 1659. He was made President of the Council of State in February 1660, and in the Convention Parliament sat for Carmarthen. The anarchy of the last months of The Protectorate converted him to royalism, and he showed great activity in bringing about the English Restoration. He used his influence in moderating measures of revenge and violence, and while sitting in judgement on the regicides was on the side of leniency. He was sworn of the Privy Council on 1 June and in November he succeeded his father as Viscount Valentia in the Irish peerage. On 20 April 1661, he was created Baron Annesley, of Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire and Earl of Anglesey in the Peerage of England.|$|E

25|$|Permanent wooden {{starting}} stalls {{were built}} in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted, and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots abreast but when team-racing was introduced, they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by herms that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, four-horse or two-horse chariots could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors. Typically, there were seven laps per race. From at least 174BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs; Castor and Pollux, who were born from an egg, were divine patrons of horses, horsemen, and the equestrian order (equites). In 33BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier (euripus) for maximum visibility.|$|E
