5|$|All <b>references</b> to Hamlet, unless {{otherwise}} specified, {{are taken from}} the Arden Shakespeare Q2. Under their referencing system, 3.1.55 means act 3, scene 1, line 55. <b>References</b> to the First Quarto and First Folio are marked Hamlet Q1 and Hamlet F1, respectively, and are taken from the Arden Shakespeare Hamlet: the texts of 1603 and 1623. Their referencing system for Q1 has no act breaks, so 7.115 means scene 7, line 115.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several <b>references</b> to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit <b>references</b> to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E

5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent <b>references</b> to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent <b>references</b> to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These <b>references</b> to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find <b>references</b> in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure <b>references,</b> {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E

40|$|A <b>reference</b> {{frequency}} distribution system is disclosed for transmitting a <b>reference</b> frequency from a <b>reference</b> unit {{to a remote}} unit while keeping the <b>reference</b> frequency at the <b>reference</b> unit and the remote unit in phase. A fiber optic cable connects the <b>reference</b> unit to the remote unit. A frequency source at the <b>reference</b> unit produces a <b>reference</b> frequency having an adjustable phase. A fiber optic transmitter at the <b>reference</b> unit modulates a light beam with the <b>reference</b> frequency and transmits the light beam into the fiber optic cable. A 50 / 50 reflector at the remote unit reflects a first portion of the light beam from the <b>reference</b> unit back into the fiber optic cable to the <b>reference</b> unit. A first fiber optic receiver disposed at the remote unit receives a second portion of the light beam and demodulates the <b>reference</b> frequency to be used at the remote unit. A second fiber optic receiver disposed at the <b>reference</b> unit receives the first portion of the light beam and demodulates a <b>reference</b> frequency component. A phase conjugator {{is connected to the}} frequency source for comparing the phase of the <b>reference</b> frequency component to the phase of the <b>reference</b> frequency modulating the light beam being transmitted from the <b>reference</b> unit to maintain a conjugate (anti-symmetric) relationship between the <b>reference</b> frequency component and the <b>reference</b> frequency modulating the light beam where virtually no phase difference exists between the phase of the <b>reference</b> frequency component and the phase of the <b>reference</b> frequency modulating the light beam...|$|R

5|$|Mangalore's {{historical}} {{importance is}} {{highlighted by the}} many <b>references</b> to the city by foreign travellers.

Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's <b>references</b> were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how {{a change}} in <b>reference</b> point affects {{individual}} preferences. While <b>reference</b> dependence is extensively studied, very little is known regarding the impact of <b>reference</b> points on individual choice behavior when the <b>reference</b> points them-selves are not chosen (<b>Reference</b> Effect). We study when the <b>reference</b> effect exists and how it operates. We find that the <b>reference</b> effect exists for asymmetrically dominated <b>reference</b> points {{but we do not}} see any evidence of <b>reference</b> effect for symmetrically dominated <b>reference</b> points. Our experiment can also distinguish among the models of reference-dependence with exogenously determined <b>reference</b> points, even though these models were initially constructed in order to explain the same choice anomalies. We illustrate that the model of Masatlioglu and Ok [2010] is consistent with our data for asymmetrically dominated <b>reference</b> points and also predicts no <b>reference</b> effect for sym-metrically dominated <b>reference</b> points.
