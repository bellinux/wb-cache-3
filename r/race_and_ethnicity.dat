5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, <b>race</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: During June 1981 to June 1982, 37 % of {{more than}} 400 cases of AIDS {{reported}} to the CDC were in minority <b>races</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicities.</b> In 2003, 72 % of the estimated 43, 171 cases of AIDS diagnosed in the 50 states; District of Columbia; and U. S. dependencies, possessions and free nations were in minority <b>races</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicities.</b> METHODS: We analyzed HIV/AIDS data for 2000 - 2003 reported by the 32 states that have had confidential name-based reporting of HIV infection since 1999. For analysis of AIDS data, we used data for 1999 - 2003 reported by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. HIV/AIDS and AIDS data were statistically adjusted for reporting delays and redistribution of cases initially reported without risk factors. RESULTS: For all years, the numbers of HIV/AIDS and AIDS diagnoses were consistently higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among other <b>races</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicities.</b> In the 32 states with HIV reporting, the HIV/AIDS diagnosis rate in 2003 was 74 per 100, 000 for blacks, 25 per 100, 000 for Hispanics, 11 per 100, 000 for American Indians/Alaska Natives, nine per 100, 000 for whites, and seven per 100, 000 for Asians/Pacific Islanders. The rates for persons living with HIV/AIDS {{at the end of}} 2003 were highest for blacks (765 per 100, 000) and Hispanics (220 per 100, 000). In the 50 states and the District of Columbia, AIDS diagnosis rates in 2003 were 58 per 100, 000 for blacks, 20 per 100, 000 for Hispanics, eight per 100, 000 for American Indians/Alaska Natives, and four per 100, 000 for Asians/Pacific Islanders. CONCLUSION: HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects minority <b>races</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicities</b> in the United States.

40|$|Notions of <b>race,</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> <b>and</b> gender are so {{frequently}} essentialized {{precisely because they}} are such complex, messy, contingent, contradictory, and fragmentary concepts. As a result, representations of <b>race,</b> gender, <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> tend to mistake the wholeness of the representations for the wholeness of the racial, ethnic, or gendered subject. Just as <b>race,</b> gender, <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> are lived <b>and</b> experienced by comic book creators, so too are they imagined and constructed within the constraints of industry practices. This dissertation examines the representation of <b>race,</b> gender, <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> in comic books {{through the eyes of}} comic book producers; a relatively small segment of the U. S. entertainment industry consisting of men, women, and corporate entities that make their living imagining identities and telling tales of adventure and heroism. This dissertation is an intentional and, I will argue, necessary break from more traditional models of media and cultural studies that emphasize consumption, textual analysis, audience reception, and reading practices...|$|R
