40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effects of types of drum, clearances (CR) and drum speeds on performance of job’s tears shelling unit. The types of drum were peg tooth and <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> with an open shelling drum. Clearances of 10, 15 and 20 mm were tested with the drum speeds of 350, 400, 450 and 500 rpm. The results found that the <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> <b>drum</b> with 10 mm of clearance and 400 rpm of drum speed were suitable condition for shelling with capacity of 12. 98 kg/h and efficiency of 99. 76 % which provided 71. 65 % of whole and small damage kernels (% FK + % KQ) ...|$|R
40|$|A spring-mounted <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> sheller for com is {{described}} herein. The sheller comprises {{a plurality of}} spaced apart <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> mounted on a combine or sheller cylinder. Each of the <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> has studs secured thereto which extend therefrom through the cylinder backing plates. Springs are mounted on the studs behind the backing plates for yieldably urging the <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> inwardly towards the backing plate. Centrifugal force causes the <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> to move out radially towards the concave as the cylinder is rotated. During shelling, impact forces on the <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> deflect them radially inwardly. Filler plates are also disclosed for preventing the com from becoming lodged between the backing plate and the <b>rasp</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> with a {{width of}} 1250 mm and a {{diameter}} of 450 mm has six <b>rasp</b> <b>bars,</b> its rotational speed is infinitely adjustable between 650 min&minus;1 and 1400 min&minus;1. The distance between the <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> and concave is finely adjustable. Four straw walkers with an overall width of 1250 mm and a total length of 2400 mm separate the remaining grain from the straw. The grain is cleaned twice with sieves measuring 920 mm × 1070 mm. An elevator transports the cleaned grain to a sorting cylinder on the roof. It sorts three quality grades of grain. For some fruit types, special sorting sieves were offered.|$|R
5000|$|The cut crop {{is carried}} up the feeder throat (commonly called the [...] "feederhouse") by a chain and flight elevator, then {{fed into the}} {{threshing}} mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> (commonly called the [...] "cylinder"), to which grooved steel <b>bars</b> (<b>rasp</b> <b>bars)</b> are bolted. The <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through {{the action of the}} cylinder against the concave, a shaped [...] "half drum", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than [...] "float" [...] across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advance in}} the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor instead of passing between <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Some of the firsts {{introduced}} by the Gleaner were: an auger that replaced canvas drapers, a <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> threshing cylinder instead of a spike-tooth arrangement, and a down-front cylinder that put threshing closer to the crop. In 1972 Gleaner was the first manufacturer to use electro-hydraulic controls, an innovation that other companies didn't offer until nearly two decades later.|$|R

40|$|A corn {{shelling}} mechanism comprising {{an elongated}} concave means having one end thereof positioned below a rotatable cylinder. A continuous belt sheller is positioned above the concave in a spaced relationship with respect thereto. The corn ears are fed to the rotating cylinder by a feeder housing means with the ear receiving {{one or more}} impacts by the <b>rasp</b> <b>bar</b> of the cylinder before it travels {{out of range of}} the cylinder. The partially shelled ear passes between the belt sheller and the concave with the belt sheller urging the ears into engagement with the concave to complete the shelling operation...|$|R
5000|$|First, the header, {{described}} above, {{cuts the}} crop and feeds {{it into the}} threshing cylinder. This consists {{of a series of}} horizontal <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> fixed across the path of the crop and {{in the shape of a}} quarter cylinder. Moving <b>rasp</b> <b>bars</b> or rub bars pull the crop through concaved grates that separate the grain and chaff from the straw. The grain heads fall through the fixed concaves. What happens next is dependent on the type of combine in question. In most modern combines, the grain is transported to the shoe by a set of 2, 3, or 4 (possibly more on the largest machines) augers, set parallel or semi-parallel to the rotor on axial mounted rotors and perpendicular Flow" [...] combines.) In older Gleaner machines, these augers were not present. These combines are unique in that the cylinder and concave is set inside feederhouse instead of in the machine directly behind the feederhouse. Consequently, the material was moved by a [...] "raddle chain" [...] from underneath the concave to the walkers. The clean grain fell between the raddle and the walkers onto the shoe, while the straw, being longer and lighter, floated across onto the walkers to be expelled. On most other older machines, the cylinder was placed higher and farther back in the machine, and the grain moved to the shoe by falling down a [...] "clean grain pan", and the straw [...] "floated" [...] across the concaves to the back of the walkers.|$|R

30|$|The {{oil palm}} empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) {{is part of}} the wastes {{generated}} from the preliminary steps for processing oil palm mill which involves removing the fruits from its bunches by a combined unit of sterilizer and rotary <b>drum</b> <b>thresher</b> (Kwasi 2002; Katamanee 2006). Oil palm cultivation cut across all the nine states of Niger Delta (Akwa Ibom, Abia, Rivers, Edo, Imo, Ondo, Bayelsa, Cross River and Delta) (PIND 2011). Palm oil mills produce a large amount of solid wastes. The remainder of the oil palm consists of huge amount of lignocellulosic materials such as oil palm fronds, trunks, palm kernel and empty fruit bunches. The residues contain 7.0 million tonnes of oil palm trunks, 26.2 million tonnes of oil palm fronds and 23 % of empty fruit bunch (EFB) per tonne of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processed in oil palm mill. These residues may cause environmental pollution problems and spread diseases (Udoetok 2012).|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to develop the design theory of the threshing unit for a largesized and a high-speed head-feeding comhine. It may be applied for various combining capacities with different cutting widths and forward speeds. Design factors in the theoretical development are: (1) dimensions of t. he <b>threshing</b> <b>drum,</b> (2) tooth approaching angle, (3) distance between the adjacent teeth on their spiral setting line, (4) number of spirals, and (5) total number of teeth on the drum. A computer simulation program was developed to predict the proper dimensions for the <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> and tooth arrangement.

The parameters analyzed in the developed design theory were shown {{to be consistent with}} those of existing combines...|$|R
40|$|A treadle {{operated}} cowpea thresher {{was designed}} and developed for threshing cowpea. The threshing surface was created between the perforated <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> and a wood surface mounted on the hopper walls. The adjustment of drum-wood (concave) clearance was done by sliding the wood {{on the inside of}} the hopper closer or away from the <b>threshing</b> <b>drum.</b> The machine was tested for different speeds of the <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> (50, 75, 100 and 125 rpm) and three different levels of moisture content (11 %, 13 % and 15 % wb) for the two varietiesof cowpea used for the testing of the machine. Tests were carried out on two varieties of cowpea IT 86 D- 719 and IT 84 S- 2246 - 4. Results show that the machine has a minimum capacity of 15 kg/hr. The IT 86 D- 719 variety could be threshed at threshing efficiency of 95 %, with percentage of split of 5 % and unthreshed pod of 0. 6 % at the cylinder speed of 100 rpm and at moisture content 12 % wb. The IT 84 S- 2246 - 4 variety, threshing is feasible at threshing efficiency of 97 %, percentage split of 5 % and percentage of unthreshed pod of 2 % at cylinder speed of 100 rpm and moisture content of 11 % wb...|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the row of}} six key wheels is a {{cylindrical}} drum consisting of 27 horizontal <b>bars.</b> Each <b>drum</b> <b>bar</b> is affixed with two movable lugs; the lugs can be aligned {{with any of the}} six key wheels, or may be placed in one of two [...] "neutral" [...] positions. An effective pin causes its guide arm to tilt forward, contacting the drum. The positioning of the lugs comprises {{the second part of the}} internal keying mechanism. Owing to the complexity of setting the internal keying mechanism, it was altered relatively infrequently; changing internal keys once a day was common in practice.|$|R

50|$|While {{ambiguous}} as a term, 4-beat only {{indicated that}} this style - unlike jungle music and its earlier breakbeat hardcore predecessor - used a common if somewhat insignificant four beats to the <b>bar</b> bass <b>drum</b> complementing the obligatory breakbeats. 4-beat does not mean it was void of breakbeats - a common error assumed by most.|$|R
40|$|The {{thorough}} investigation of both grain threshing and grain separating processes {{is a crucial}} consideration for effective structural design and variable optimization of the tangential flow threshing cylinder and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder composite units (TLFC unit) of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal tooth, spike tooth, <b>rasp</b> <b>bar,</b> and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the spike tooth on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit. The results of this research can be used to successfully design the TLFC unit of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. </p...|$|R
