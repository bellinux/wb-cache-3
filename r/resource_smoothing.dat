40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) benefits raise unemployment durations. This result has traditionally been interpreted as a substitution effect caused by a reduction in the price of leisure relative to consumption, generating a deadweight burden. This paper questions the validity of this interpretation by showing that UI benefits can also affect durations through a non-distortionary income effect for agents who face borrowing constraints. UI benefits have a pure substitution effect only for those who have sufficient <b>resources</b> to <b>smooth</b> con-sumption while unemployed. The empirical relevance of borrowing constraints and income effects is evaluated in two ways. First, I classify households into groups that are likely to be constrained and unconstrained based on their asset holdings, mortgage payments, and spouse’s labor force status. Non-parametric and semi-parametric tests reveal that unemployed benefits raise durations much more sharply in the constrained groups. Second, I find that lump-sum severance payments granted at the time of job loss significantly increase durations. These results suggest that transitory benefits affect search behavior primarily through an income effect, challenging the prevailing view that social safety nets create large efficiency costs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{correspondence}} between a household’s current income and its vulnerability to income shocks in two developed countries: the U. S. and Spain. Vulnerability {{is measured by}} the availability of wealth type <b>resources</b> to <b>smooth</b> consumption in a multidimensional approach to measuring poverty, which allows us to identify three groups of households. First, the twice-poor group which includes income-poor households who also lack of an adequate stock of wealth; second, the group of protected-poor households, which are all those income-poor families that have accumulated a bu¤er stock of wealth resources they can rely on; lastly, the vulnerable-non-poor group, which includes those households above the income-poverty line that do not hold any stock of wealth.

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict {{upcoming}} events {{is important to}} compensate for relatively long sensory-motor delays. When stimuli are temporally regular, their prediction depends on a representation of elapsed time. However, {{it is well known}} that the allocation of attention to the timing of an upcoming event alters this representation. The role of attention on the temporal processing component of prediction was investigated in a visual smooth pursuit task that was performed either in isolation or concurrently with a manual response task. Subjects used smooth pursuit eye movements to accurately track a moving target after a constant-duration delay interval. In the manual response task, subjects had to estimate the instant of target motion onset by pressing a button. The onset of anticipatory pursuit eye movements was used to quantify the subject's estimate of elapsed time. We found that onset times were delayed significantly in the presence of the concurrent manual task relative to the pursuit task in isolation. There was also a correlation between the oculomotor and manual response latencies. In the framework of Scalar Timing Theory, the results are consistent with a centralized attentional gating mechanism that allocates clock <b>resources</b> between <b>smooth</b> pursuit preparation and the parallel timing task...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There {{have been}} a number of recent efforts (e. g. BioCatalogue, BioMoby) to {{systematically}} catalogue bioinformatics tools, services and datasets. These efforts rely on manual curation, making it difficult to cope with the huge influx of various electronic resources that have been provided by the bioinformatics community. We present a text mining approach that utilises the literature to automatically extract descriptions and semantically profile bioinformatics resources to make them available for resource discovery and exploration through semantic networks that contain related resources. Results The method identifies the mentions of resources in the literature and assigns a set of co-occurring terminological entities (descriptors) to represent them. We have processed 2, 691 full-text bioinformatics articles and extracted profiles of 12, 452 resources containing associated descriptors with binary and tf*idf weights. Since such representations are typically sparse (on average 13. 77 features per resource), we used lexical kernel metrics to identify semantically related <b>resources</b> via descriptor <b>smoothing.</b> <b>Resources</b> are then clustered or linked into semantic networks, providing the users (bioinformaticians, curators and service/tool crawlers) with a possibility to explore algorithms, tools, services and datasets based on their relatedness. Manual exploration of links between a set of 18 well-known bioinformatics resources suggests that the method was able to identify and group semantically related entities. Conclusions The results have shown that the method can reconstruct interesting functional links between resources (e. g. linking data types and algorithms), in particular when tf*idf-like weights are used for profiling. This demonstrates the potential of combining literature mining and simple lexical kernel methods to model relatedness between resource descriptors in particular when there are few features, thus potentially improving the resource description, discovery and exploration process.

Counterintuitively, the practical issues of having uncertain channel knowledge, high propagation losses, and implementing optimal non-linear precoding are solved more or less automatically by enlarging system dimensions. However, the computational precoding complexity grows with the system dimensions. For example, the close-to-optimal and relatively “antenna-efficient” regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding is very complicated to implement in practice, since it requires fast inversions of large matrices in every coherence period. Motivated by the high performance of RZF, we propose to replace the matrix inversion and multiplication by a truncated polynomial expansion (TPE), thereby obtaining the new TPE precoding scheme which is more suitable for real-time hardware implementation and significantly reduces the delay to the first transmitted symbol. The degree of the matrix polynomial can be adapted to the available hardware <b>resources</b> and enables <b>smooth</b> transition between simple maximum ratio transmission and more advanced RZF.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Matlab, a {{powerful}} and productive language that allows for rapid prototyping, modeling and simulation, is widely used in computational biology. Modeling and simulation of large biological systems often require more computational resources then are available on a single computer. Existing distributed computing environments like the Distributed Computing Toolbox, MatlabMPI, Matlab*G and others allow for the remote (and possibly parallel) execution of Matlab commands with varying support for features like an easy-to-use application programming interface, load-balanced utilization of resources, extensibility over the wide area network, and minimal system administration skill requirements. However, all of these environments require some level of access to participating machines to manually distribute the user-defined libraries that the remote call may invoke. Results mGrid augments the usual process distribution seen in other similar distributed systems by adding facilities for user code distribution. mGrid's client-side interface is an easy-to-use native Matlab toolbox that transparently executes user-defined code on remote machines (i. e. the user is unaware that the code is executing somewhere else). Run-time variables are automatically packed and distributed with the user-defined code and automated load-balancing of remote <b>resources</b> enables <b>smooth</b> concurrent execution. mGrid is an open source environment. Apart from the programming language itself, all other components are also open source, freely available tools: light-weight PHP scripts and the Apache web server. Conclusion Transparent, load-balanced distribution of user-defined Matlab toolboxes and rapid prototyping of many simple parallel applications can now be done with a single easy-to-use Matlab command.

Reliability of construction schedules can be enhanced and improved through satisfying all potential constraints prior to execution on site. Availability of resources, execution space, execution logic, physical dependency of construction products, client instructions and others {{can be regarded as}} potential constraints. Current scheduling tools and techniques are fragmented and designed to deal with a limited set of construction constraints. In this context, a methodology termed 'multi-constraint scheduling' is introduced in which four major groups of construction constraints including physical, contract, resource and information constraints are considered to demonstrate the approach. A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed and used for a multi-constraint optimization problem. Given multiple constraints such as activity dependency, limited working area, and resource and information readiness, the GA alters tasks' priorities and construction methods so as to arrive at an optimum or near optimum set of project duration, cost, and <b>smooth</b> <b>resource</b> profiles.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of a sudden increase in transportation costs when households behaviors and buildings inertia are accounted for. A theoretical framework is proposed, capturing the interactions between behaviors, transportation costs and urban structure. Numerical simulations show that changes in households and landowners' choices reduce significantly the long-term adverse effects of a shock in transportation costs. Indeed, the shock translates, over the long-run, into a more concentrated housing that limits households utility losses and maintains landowners' income. But, because of buildings inertia, the shock leads first to a long transition, during which the adjustment is constrained by a suboptimal housing-supply structure. Then, households support larger losses than in the final stage, though lower than with no behavior adjustment, and landowners experience a large decrease in their aggregate income and an important redistribution of wealth. Thus, behaviors and buildings inertia are key factors in determining the vulnerability to transportation price variability and to the introduction of climate policies. Our policy conclusions are that : (i) if a long-term increase in transportation costs is unavoidable because of climate change or <b>resource</b> scarcity, a <b>smooth</b> change prevents to some extent the negative transition effects; and (ii) fast-growing cities of the developing world can reduce their future vulnerability to shocks in transportation costs through the implementation of policies that limit urban sprawl...|$|R
