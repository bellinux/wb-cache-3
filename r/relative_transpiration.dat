40|$|Phytoremediation is a new, in-situ and {{emerging}} remediation technology for contaminated soils. This technology, {{compared to other}} methods, is a sustainable, natural, relatively cheap and applicable to large scale area. Modeling phytoremediation provides quantitative insight for the governing process {{as well as for}} managers to assess the remediated sites. The objective {{of this study was to}} introduce a macroscopic phytoremediation model for Ni and Cd- polluted soils. The proposed model assumes that <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> reduction function can resemble total soilNi and Cd concentrations. Combining the related functions of soil and plant responses to soil Ni and Cd concentrations, the phytoremediation rate of Ni and Cd was predicted. In order to test the proposed model, large quantities of soil were thoroughly polluted with Ni and Cd. Upland Cress (Lepidum sativum) and Ornamental Kale (Brassica olerace var. Viridis) seeds were then germinated in the contaminated soils. The experimental pots were irrigated with fresh water to reach field capacity. Upland Cress and Ornamental Kale were harvested three and four times, respectively. At each harvest, <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration,</b> Ni and Cd contents of soil samples and plants were measured. Comparison of the maximum error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, modeling efficiency and coefficient of residual mass indicated that the non-threshold non-linear model provide high efficiency to predict <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> for Upland Cress and Ornamental Kale, respectively. The results also indicated that the proposed macroscopic model can well predict the phytoemediation rate of the Ni and Cd by Upland Cress (R 2 &gt; 0. 83) and Ni by Ornamental Kale (R 2 = 0. 78) ...|$|E
40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} from a greenhouse trial with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) plants performed to test model hypotheses regarding the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions and {{the shape of the}} transpiration reduction curve in the falling rate phase are presented. According to these hypotheses based on simulations with an upscaled single-root model, the matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions is as a function of root length density and potential transpiration rate, while the <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> in the falling rate phase equals the relative matric flux potential. Transpiration of bean plants in water stressed pots with four different soils was determined daily by weighing and compared to values obtained from non-stressed pots. This procedure allowed determining the onset of the falling rate phase and corresponding soil hydraulic conditions. At the onset of the falling rate phase, the value of matric flux potential M(I) showed to differ in order of magnitude from the model predicted value for three out of four soils. This difference between model and experiment {{can be explained by the}} heterogeneity of the root distribution which is not considered by the model. An empirical factor to deal with this heterogeneity should be included in the model to improve predictions. Comparing the predictions of <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> in the falling rate phase using a linear shape with water content, pressure head or matric flux potential, the matric flux potential based reduction function, in agreement with the hypothesis, showed the best performance, while the pressure head based equation resulted in the highest deviations between observed and predicted values of <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> rates.

40|$|Using a {{numerical}} implicit model for root water extraction {{by a single}} root in a symmetric radial flow problem, based on the Richards equation and the combined convection-dispersion equation, we investigated {{some aspects of the}} response of root water uptake to combined water and osmotic stress. The model implicitly incorporates the effect of simultaneous pressure head and osmotic head on root water uptake, and does not require additional assumptions (additive or multiplicative) to derive the combined effect of water and salt stress. Simulation results showed that <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> equals relative matric flux potential, which is defined as the matric flux potential calculated with an osmotic pressure head-dependent lower bound of integration, divided by the matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions. In the falling rate phase, the osmotic head near the root surface was shown to increase in time due to decreasing root water extraction rates, causing a more gradual decline of <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> than with water stress alone. Results furthermore show that osmotic stress effects on uptake depend on pressure head or water content, allowing a refinement of the approach in which fixed reduction factors based on the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil solution extract are used. One of the consequences is that osmotic stress is predicted to occur in situations not predicted by the saturation extract analysis approach. It is also shown that this way of combining salinity and water as stressors yields results that are different from a purely multiplicative approach. An analytical steady state solution is presented to calculate the solute content at the root surface, and compared with the outputs of the numerical model. Using the analytical solution, a method has been developed to estimate <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> as a function of system parameters, which are often already used in vadose zone models: potential transpiration rate, root length density, minimum root surface pressure head, and soil -h and K-h function...|$|E

Seven-day-old seedlings {{were subjected to}} water stress by PEG treatment (− 1. 0 MPa) for 2 days. Uniconazol, brassinolide and methyl jasmonate were able to maintain a higher relative water content and diffusive resistance, and decreased the <b>relative</b> conductivity and <b>transpiration</b> rate in the seedlings of the drought-resistant cultivar, PAN 6043, during water stress periods. Increased drought resistance was obtained with 5 mgl− 1 uniconazol, 12. 5 mgl− 1 brassinolide and 25 mgl− 1 methyl jasmonate, respectively. These treatments decreased the relative water content in seedlings of the drought-sensitive cultivar, despite influencing <b>relative</b> conductivity, <b>transpiration</b> rate, and diffusive resistance in a positive way.

In the last two decades, agro-hydrological physically based models {{have been developed to}} simulate mass and energy exchange processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Although very reliable, because of the high number of required variables, simplified models have been proposed to quantify crop water consumes. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an amendment of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations FAO- 56 spreadsheet program to introduce a more realistic shape of the stress function, valid for mature olive orchards (Olea europaea L.). The modified model is successively validated by means of the comparison between measured and simulated soil water contents and actual transpiration fluxes. These outputs are finally compared with those obtained with the original version of the model. Experiments also allowed assessing the ability of simulated crop water stress coefficients to explain the actual water stress conditions evaluated on the basis of measured <b>relative</b> <b>transpirations</b> and midday stem water potentials. The results show that the modified model significantly improves the estimation of actual crop transpiration fluxes and soil water contents under soil water deficit conditions, according to the RMSEs associated with the revised model, resulting in significantly higher than the corresponding values obtained with the original version...|$|R
40|$|When {{stressed}} by low soil water content (SWC) or high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), plants close stomata, reducing transpiration and photosynthesis. However, it {{has historically been}} difficult to disentangle the magnitudes of VPD compared to SWC limitations on ecosystem-scale fluxes. We used a 13 [*]year record of eddy covariance measurements from a forest in south central Indiana, USA, to quantify how transpiration and photosynthesis respond to fluctuations in VPD versus SWC. High VPD and low SWC both explained reductions in photosynthesis relative to its long-term mean, as well as reductions in <b>transpiration</b> <b>relative</b> to potential <b>transpiration</b> estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation. Flux responses to typical fluctuations in SWC and VPD had similar magnitudes. Integrated over the year, VPD fluctuations accounted for significant reductions of GPP in both nondrought and drought years. Our results suggest that increasing VPD under climatic warming could reduce forest CO 2 uptake regardless of changes in SWC...|$|R

The analysis {{was based on the}} differential equation describing radial flow to a single root. Assuming transpiration {{to be reduced}} after a critical pressure head (usually chosen as - 1. 5 MPa or - 150 m) at the root surface has been reached, transpiration rates in this so-called falling-rate phase were analyzed numerically for soils described by the van Genuchten-Mualem equations (numerical soils). The analysis was based on the differential equation describing radial flow to a single root. Numerically, the system was simulated by an implicit scheme. It is shown that, at limiting hydraulic conditions, <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> (ratio between actual and potential transpiration) is equal to relative matric flux potential (ratio between actual matric flux potential and matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions). Given this equality, transpiration reduction functions as a function of soil water content and as a function of time are presented for five types of analytical soils: a constant diffusivity, Green and Ampt, Brooks and Corey, versatile nonlinear, and exponential soil. While in the case of constant diffusivity, <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> decreases as a linear function of water content, for the remaining four cases the decrease is a concave function of soil water content. Numerical simulations also result in a concave shape, unless the difference between water content at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions and at permanent wilting is very small, for example, at high root densities. These discrepancies may be explained by the relative importance of a transition period between the constant- and falling-rate phases...|$|E

The experiments were conducted at Águas de Moura (50 Km east from Lisbon) during June and July 1994. A 4 ha orchard was used and the planting was organised in rows, in a sandy soil. Three treatments were considered: A (well irrigated control, 2. 88 ha), B (drought + normal ambient atmosphere, 0. 5 ha), C (drought + elevated air humidity, 0. 02 ha). The large dimensions of plot A allowed micrometeorological measurements. Drought treatments (B, C) consisted in two successive periods of complete water shortage. Evapotranspiration was measured with eddy correlation method in plot A and the results are compared with the sum of transpiration and soil evaporation measured by means of a sap-flow method and micro-lysimeters, respectively. Since both methods seem to agree reasonably well, their results were took as equivalent. Sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) fluxes represented 33. 4 % and 38. 5 %, respectively, of net radiation, during day-time periods; the remaining 28 % were heat flux to the soil (G). The relative average contributions of transpiration and soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration are respectively 82 and 18 %.

Plant water stress was greatest on the Bench, which had the finest textured soils and was underlaid by an indurated petrocalcic layer.

Intrinsic water-use efficiency (W (I)) was recorded from leaf gas exchange and whole-plant transpiration efficiency (TE) from biomass production and water consumption of potted seedlings.

At leaf level, Delta C- 13 matched closely W (I) across species, while at the whole-plant level, the relationship between TE and either Delta C- 13 or W (I) differed between the Sahelian and the Australian species. Large interspecific differences were found but they were not related to the aridity of the origin nor to the type of foliage.

In this work we investigate the <b>relative</b> contribution of <b>transpiration</b> and soil evaporation to total ET in a semi-wooded, semi-arid forest in the Manitou Research Park northwest of Colorado Springs, CO. We use stable water isotopes measured at different levels within and outside the canopy, over a 30 -day period (June 26 - July 26, 2010), using a field-deployable cavity ring-down spectrometer. The traditional "Keeling plot" analysis is used to partition the ET flux from moisture that comes from outside of the ecosystem, and then a simple model is used to partition the transpiration flux. In addition, we introduce a new alternative "multi-level" method to calculate the fraction of transpiration to total ET. Both the "Keeling plot" method and the "multi-level" method yield very similar fractions of transpiration to total ET, ranging from about 15 % to about 85 %.

40|$|Six {{different}} reduction {{functions for}} combined water and salinity stress {{are used in}} the macroscopic root water extraction term. The reduction functions are classified as linear additive, non-linear multiplicative, and that which is neither additive nor multiplicative. All these reduction functions are incorporated in the numerical simulation model HYSWASOR. The relation between the experimental <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> and the joint soil water osmotic and pressure heads appears to be linear (with an exception for the salinity near the threshold value). As the mean soil solution salinity increases, the trend becomes more linear. The simulations indicated that for most treatments the newly proposed reduction term provides the closest agreement with the experimental transpiration. Soil water content, and particularly soil solution salinity simulated with this equation agree reasonably with the experimental data: in spite of the observed differences, the trend of the simulated data is good. A reason for the disagreement between the simulated and experimental water contents {{can be attributed to the}} influence of roots and the soil solution concentration on the soil hydraulic conductivity. The input soil hydraulic parameters were obtained from soil samples without roots and salinity and assumed constant during the simulations...|$|E

The readings of the results were made once a day. Each found value was converted into the relative value for the unit volume of tissuepowder, the unit dry-weight of plants and the unit leaf-surface, {{and then into the}} value relative to the evaporation -value of the spherical atomometer. Thus the calculated values were treated as the value for consideration under the names of 2 ̆ 2 relative absorptiun 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The values in question for the first 24 hours only are discussed in this paper, because these values seemed to be more fitted for our purpose than the values for the later hours. Thus the following p oints were derived as the principal results. 1. Both values of relative absorption and transpiration, and the sum of these two were largest in the mesophytes, smaller in the halophytes and smallest in the ordinary succulent plant (Sedum) in both media. It was remarkable that the behaviour of the halophytes was very {{different from that of the}} ordinary succulent plant. 2. The ratio of the value for relative absorption to that for <b>relative</b> <b>transpiration</b> is largest in the halophytes and smallest in the ordinary succulent plant (Sedum), when the experiment was made with well-water. 3 But when sea-water was used, this ratio was larger in t h e case of the ordinary succulent, plant (Sedum) than in that of the mesophytes, though the. ratio was again largest in the case of the halophytes. 4. Therefore we may say at least that results h a ving an ecological value can be derived from the study of the interrelation between water absorption and transpiration. 1. 植物の根の吸水作用及び莖葉部の蒸散作用の量的相互關係の研究により種々の植物の有する生應的差異を數量的に明かにせんとして本研究を試みたり。 2. 此の目的のために PFEFFER 氏の potometer に準じたる小なる potometer を使用し, 秤量によりて蒸散量を, 容量によりて吸水量を測定したり。 3. 植物は注意して根を有するまゝ採集し, なるべ速かに potometer に裝置し實驗室内に約 4 時間放置し, 室内の状應に馴れしめたる後實驗に着手したり。 4. 豫備實驗に於ては 5 通りの生育状態を異にせるホソバノハマアカザに就きて實驗開始後 3 日間に亘り 1 日毎に測定したるが, 第 1 日目に於ける數値に於て生態的意義の特に明かなるを認めたるを以て本實驗に於ては生態を異にする異なる種類の植物即ち多肉鹽生植物なるホソバノハマアカザ及びハマシオン, 普通の多肉植物なるアヲベンケイサウ及び中性植物なるセンダングサ及びケイトウに就きて實驗開始後第 1 日間の測定結果によりて計算比較したり。然して實驗毎に同一種類に就き淡水に裝置せるものと海水に裝置せるものとを對照試驗したり。 5. 測定によりて得たる數値は葉の單位面積, 植物組織の單位乾燥重量及び植物組織の單位粉末容積に對する値に換算し, 更にその値を atomometer の蒸發量に對比して之れを相對吸水量及び相對蒸散量と稱し以て兩作用の程度を比較するを得せしめ, 更に其の和, 其の和に對する各々の百分率間の差及び兩者の比を算出したるが, その結果は單位乾量及び單位粉末容積による値に於て理論上良好なる結果を表示することを認めたるを以て, 主としてその數値によりて比較考察したり。 6. 主として淡水に裝置したる植物の實驗結果によれば相對吸水量及び相對蒸散量の各々及び兩者の和に就きては中性植物に大にして, 多肉鹽生植物之れに次ぎ, 普通の多肉植物に甚だ小なる値を示したるが, 兩作用の量の比に於ては多肉鹽生植物に大にして, 普通の多肉植物に最も小にして, 中性植物はその中間に來り, 各異なる生態を甚だ明瞭に表示したり。 7. 海水の場合に於ては多肉鹽生植物及び中性植物が兩作用とも淡水の場合に比して何れも著しく減少したるに反し, 普通の多肉植物なるアヲベンケイサウにては淡水の場合に比し蒸散量が特に甚しき減少を來したる結果兩作用の比に於て著しき變化を示したり。こは又重要なる生態的意義を暗示するものと云ふべし。 8. 之れを要するに著者の探りたる實驗方法によりて植物の蒸散及び吸水の相互關係を考察することによりて植物の生態的關係の差異を數量的に表示する上に可成信頼するに足る結果を得るものゝ如し。然して此方法による時は蒸散又は吸水作用を各單獨に考察する場合に比して外界の影響を顧慮するを要する事割合に少なく, 少くとも著者が用いたる如き温度其他の室内條件の變化少なき場合に於ては atomometer に對する相對値を算出すること無しに實驗考察を行ひ得る便利をも伴ふ...|$|E
40|$|Californian annual {{grassland}} on sandstone (moderately fertile) and serpentine (very infertile) soils at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, Stanford, California, {{were exposed}} to ambient or elevated (ambient + 36 Pa CO 2) atmospheric CO 2 in open-top chambers since December 1991. We measured ecosystem evapotranspiration with open gas-exchange systems, and sell moisture with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) over 0 - 15 cm (serpentine) and 0 - 30 cm (sandstone) depths, at times of peak above ground physiological activity. Evapotranspiration decreased by 12 to 63 percent under elevated CO 2 in three consecutive years in the sandstone ecosystem (p = 0. 053, p = 0. 162, p = 0. 082 in 1992, 1993, and 1994, respectively). In correspondence with decreased evapotranspiration, late-season sell moisture reserves in the sandstone were extended temporally by 10 ± 3 days in 1993 and by 28 ± 11 days in 1994. The effect of elevated CO 2 on soil moisture was greater in the drier spring of 1994 (419 mm annual rainfall) than in 1993 (905 mm annual rainfall). In the serpentine ecosystem, evapotranspiration and soil moisture reserves were not clearly affected by elevated CO 2. Soil water may be conserved in drought-affected ecosystems exposed to elevated CO 2, hut the amount of conservation appears {{to depend on the}} <b>relative</b> importance of <b>transpiration</b> and soil evaporation in controlling water flux...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPolymeric films used in MAP {{have lower}} water vapour {{transmission}} rates <b>relative</b> to the <b>transpiration</b> rates of fresh produce such as oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus). As a consequence, water condensation {{may be found}} inside the package, promoting decay of the product. The use of moisture absorbers to control the relative humidity inside packages is effective in reducing saturation and condensation for fresh produce. However, common moisture absorbers have low absorption capacity or, in opposite, fast rate of absorption which is undesirable for storing high transpiring products. Therefore, this study was undertaken {{in order to develop}} a moisture absorber with high moisture holding capacity. The experiment was designed according to a simplex lattice method with three factors (calcium oxide, sorbitol and calcium chloride) and a range of 0. 2 – 0. 6 g of desiccant mass. These three desiccants were mixed in varying proportions and the change in moisture content of each of the mixed desiccants was measured at regular intervals up to 5 days at 10 °C. Pareto analysis showed that calcium chloride had the most significant effect on final moisture content of mixed absorber. The optimized desiccant mixture contained 0. 5, 0. 26 and 0. 24 of calcium oxide, calcium chloride and sorbitol respectively yielding moisture holding capacity of 0. 813. These results present good perspectives for the application of a moisture absorber for packaging of oyster mushrooms...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its use in photosynthesis, a vine's water supply is also depleted by the processes of evaporation and transpiration. In evaporation, heat (aided by wind and sunlight) causes water in the soil to evaporate and escape as vapor molecules. This process is inversely related to humidity with evaporation taking place at faster rates in areas with low <b>relative</b> humidity. In <b>transpiration,</b> this evaporation of water occurs directly in the vine, as water is released from the plant through the stomata that are located on the undersides of the leaves. This loss {{of water from the}} leaves is one of the driving factors that results in water being drawn up from the roots, and it also helps the vine combat against the effects of heat stress which can severely damage the physiological functions of the vine (somewhat similar to how perspiration works with humans and animals). The presence of adequate water in the vines can help keep the internal temperature of the leaf only a few degrees above the temperature of the surrounding air. However, if water is severely lacking then that internal temperature could jump nearly 18°F (10°C) warmer than the surrounding air which leads the vine to develop heat stress. The dual effects of evaporation and transpiration are called evapotranspiration. A typical vineyard in a hot, dry climate can lose as much as [...] of water per vine through evapotranspiration during the growing season.|$|R
