50|$|Microfilmers come in {{two basic}} configurations: {{planetary}} and rotary. A planetary microfilmer takes a snapshot of a stationary document held on a flat surface. While the picture is being taken, the film and the document do not move. In a <b>rotary</b> <b>microfilmer,</b> both the document and the film are moving in sync with one another while the picture is being taken. This allows for quicker filming of the document. Planetary microfilmers typically offer higher image resolution than rotary filmers, and can more readily film larger documents, as well as odd-shaped documents, such as books.|$|E

This accessible and inexpensive photographic technology allowed scientists, scholars, and others to experiment with ideas for information storage and retrieval that were not ultimately realized until the 1990 s. In 1926, George McCarthy, vice president of a New York bank, invented a <b>rotary</b> <b>microfilm</b> camera for copying bank checks automatically. This camera paved the way for the microfilm industry to record large volumes of documents very rapidly. Microfilm was quickly adopted by banks in the 1930 s and by other businesses, industries, and government agencies. Libraries, eager to expand access to resources required by a burgeoning research community, also adopted microfilm. Although academic enthusiasts predicted that microfilm would revolutionize scholarship, the limitations of reading machinery precluded an unmitigated success. Users in academia, business, technology, and science also sought to improve on {{the ways in}} which data could be retrieved from microfilm. This paper discusses three specific attempts to overcome output limitations: the struggle for good reading machines; the pursuit of more standardized and sortable formats, i. e., microcards and aperture cards; and finally the use of microfilm as an expendable element in new computerized information systems...|$|R
