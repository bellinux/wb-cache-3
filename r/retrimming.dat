5000|$|In a July 2016 review, Flying {{magazine}} writer Pia Bergqvist generally {{praised the}} aircraft, but found fault with the flap mechanism and resulting pitch changes with flap deployment. She wrote, [...] "One thing {{that takes a}} bit of getting used to is the flap mechanism. Flaps are adjusted with a large handle in the upper left corner of the cockpit. The location of the handle {{makes it easy to}} access, and each flap setting is in a notch to prevent slippage. To get the first flap in position, you have to push slightly forward before grabbing the trigger to release the latch. For the second and third notches, however, you need to pull back before the handle will release. It took a few approaches {{to get used to the}} opposite action. The new slotted flap design allows for air from the underside of the wing to flow over the flap surface. With the additional lift, the pitch increases a great deal with each flap setting. president Randy Lervold advised me to fly with some nose-down trim before adding flaps. Without using that technique, <b>retrimming</b> was definitely required after each notch to prevent going too slow." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{difference}} in dynamic {{pressure in the}} propeller slipstreams as measured by sensors is divided by the freestream dynamic pressure generating a quantity proportional to the differential thrust coefficient. This quantity is used to command an electric trim motor to change the position of trim tab thereby <b>retrimming</b> the airplane to the new asymmetric power condition. The change in position of the trim tab produced by the electric trim motor is summed with the pilot's input to produce the actual trim tab position...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{device for}} the {{controlled}} trimming of plastic specimen blocks for light and electron microscopy is described. Many advantages of previously reported instruments together with 1) a {{rack and pinion}} control of knife movement, and 2) a control of rotation of the specimen block at 90 0, 1800, 2700, or 3600 are incorporated. In conjunction with an ocular micrometer, the device allows accurate removal of thin slices during trimming. Several devices and techniques have been described which aid in the trimming of plastic embedded specimen blocks to form "pyramids " (= truncated pyramids) before they are mounted into the microtome (Boyde 1960, Butler 1974, Danon 1961, Guglielmotti 1976, Schneider and Sasaki 1976, Sjostrand 1967). Gorycki (1978) described a "rectangular trimming block " which, {{in conjunction with a}} small mirror mounted on the knife holder of the ultramicrotome, squarely re-trimmed the block face of a preformed truncated pyramid. Similarly, Sjostrand's device (Sjostrand 1967) is a trimming aid intended only for the final trimming and <b>retrimming</b> of tissue blocks. Using such instruments, block faces with parallel edge alignment can be, with an experienced hand, precisely produced...|$|E
25|$|In 2006 twelve further Class 317 EMU trains {{were given}} a more basic refresh of new carpets, <b>retrimmed</b> seats in new {{moquette}} and new dado side panels; by Wabtec Doncaster and the bodysides were painted in a lighter shade of blue than the Class 317/7.

40|$|A flight program, {{utilizing}} a Convair 880 and a Boeing 720 airplane, {{was conducted in}} conjunction with wind-tunnel and simulator programs to study problems related to jet-transport upsets and operation in a turbulent environment. During the handling-qualities portion of the program the basic static stability of the airplanes {{was considered to be}} satisfactory and the lateral-directional damping was considered to be marginal without damper augmentation. An evaluation of the longitudinal control system indicated that this system can become marginal in effectiveness in the high Mach number and high dynamic-pressure range of the flight envelope. From the upset and recovery phase of the program it was apparent that <b>retrimming</b> the stabilizer and spoiler deployment were valuable tools in effecting a positive recovery; however, if these devices are to be used safely, it appears that a suitable g-meter should be provided in the cockpit because the high control forces in recovery tend to reduce the pilot's sensitivity to the actual acceleration loads. During the turbulence penetrations the pilot noted that the measured vibrations of 4 to 6 cps in the cockpit considerably disrupted their normal scan pattern and suggested that an improvement should be made in the seat cushion and restraint system. Also it was observed that the indicator needles on the flight instruments were quite stable in the turbulent environment...|$|E

50|$|In the house's {{original}} configuration, {{the wings}} {{to the northwest}} and southwest stood just one story, and the latter, a kitchen, was all wood. A major remodeling around the year 1900 raised both wings to two stories. They also received brick cladding, rooflines, and window treatments that were closely matched with the central section. During this remodeling the interior was <b>retrimmed</b> with oak and a grand staircase added.|$|R

5000|$|To commemorate Colin McRae's {{success in}} the {{international}} rally scene, Subaru in the UK released 200 limited edition [...] "Series McRae" [...] WRXs in June 1995, prepared by Prodrive. These vehicles were finished in a very limited [...] "Rally Blue" [...] colour scheme, sported gold 16-inch alloy wheels, McRae decals, individual numbered badging from 1-201 (car 13 was never built since the number 13 is considered unlucky), and a factory-fitted electric tilt/slide sunroof. Recaro seats were fitted in the front, and the rear seats and side panels were <b>retrimmed</b> in the same Le Mans/Avus material.|$|R
50|$|The Class 142 {{units are}} also {{primarily}} used on South Wales Valley line routes and routes through the Vale of Glamorgan. The Wales and Borders franchise does not specify {{the introduction of}} new rolling stock, and Class 142s are likely to be in service until at least 2018. On Valley and Vale of Glamorgan services, Class 142s are often coupled together with Class 143 or Class 150 units to cope with demand on the busy Valley Lines network. The Class 142s have received minor refurbishments with <b>retrimmed</b> seats in new moquette, plus the installation of ceiling-mounted CCTV cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a cowling may {{be divided into two}} parts, the nose section, and the exit slot. Each part may be {{considered}} separately because the functions of each part are separate and distinct. The nose section, or leading edge of the cowling, must have an opening in the center to allow cooling air to enter the engine compartment and be of such shape that it will smoothly divide the air entering the cowling from the air going around the outside. The exit slot <b>retrims</b> the cooling air to the main air stream and the area controls the quantity of cooling airflow.|$|R
5000|$|Sally Victor {{was born}} Sally Josephs in Scranton, Pennsylvania. She took an {{interest}} in design at age eight, when her family moved to New York where her aunt had a millinery shop. As she reflected in a 1949 interview, Like most kids, I liked to copy the grown-ups, so it seemed perfectly natural for me to start fashioning scraps of felt and ribbon into hats for my dolls. When I got a little older, my aunt taught me to help her <b>retrim</b> and shape hats for her customers and on the side, I started dreaming up hats for myself and my friends, too.|$|R
40|$|Shore {{platforms}} in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, display morphological {{differences from}} mid-latitude platforms that are explicable {{in terms of}} the morphogenetic environment. These differences include marked horizontality of the platform surface terminated abruptly by low-tide and high-tide gradient changes. Since the processes of ice freezing-on, quarrying by impact and abrasion are responsible for such horizontality the platforms are widest in areas of restricted fetch where ice persists longest. In exposed locations, wave quarrying and abrasion limit the development of horizontality. Stratigraphic evidence suggests that the shore platforms of the South Shetland Islands are inherited features that have been rapidly <b>retrimmed</b> by polar shore processes. Some suggestions for future research are made...|$|R

5000|$|For 1964 and 1965, the Beaumont {{name was}} moved to a <b>retrimmed</b> version of the {{intermediate}} Chevrolet Chevelle, at which time the name Canso {{was applied to the}} top-line compact model, equivalent of the Nova. [...] Invader became the series name for the base model. Data for the 1966 Acadian were: engines available were six-cylinder (194 cid, 8.5 compression ratio, 120 bhp rated), V8 (283 cid, 9.25 compression ratio, 195 bhp) or (327 cid, 11.00 compression ratio, 350 bhp rated), overall length of 15.250 feet (4.648 m); overall width of 5.942 ft (1.811 m); height of 4.483 ft (1.367 m); turning circle of 38.40 ft (11.70 m); front track of 4.733 ft (1.443 m) and rear track of 4.692 ft (1.430 m). Its fuel tank held 13.5 imperial gallons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the Airstream was {{an outgrowth of the}} unpopularity of the streamlined Chrysler Airflow, which consumers failed to embrace. The Airstream was based on the 1933 Chrysler [...] "CO" [...] model, which was carried over into the 1934 model year as the Chrysler [...] "CA". When the Airflow failed to capture the attention of the buying public, Chrysler <b>retrimmed</b> the [...] "CA", gave the car rear fender skirts, and rolled out a model that they hoped would appeal to Depression-era buyers. By marketing the Airstream alongside the Airflow, Chrysler could {{meet the needs of the}} public while hoping to produce enough Airflows to offset their development.During its two years of production, the Airstream outsold the Airflow five to one in its first year, and nearly nine to one in 1936.|$|R
50|$|Following George W. Mason's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} the fall of 1954, George Romney (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would {{have to be able to}} produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to amortize the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in market segment in which the domestic Big Three (General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler body, was almost complete, AMC's designers were also working on a <b>retrimmed</b> Hudson equivalent, called Rebel, to offer Hudson dealers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} promote {{automobile}} manufacturing in Canada, The Auto Pact (APTA) in the 1960s had provisions prohibiting sales of certain United States-made cars. General Motors responded by offering certain makes of cars manufactured in Canada primarily for the Canadian market such as Acadian, and Beaumont which started as an offering in the Acadian line but later became its own brand. [...] Initially, Acadians were <b>retrimmed</b> Chevy IIs, offered as a base model, mid-priced Invader and top-line Beaumont. The car used Pontiac styling cues such as a split grille but was marketed as a separate make, never as a Pontiac[...] [...] As with the concurrent Chevy II, Acadians were offered with 4-cylinder, 6-cylinder and V8 engines. There was a choice of transmission, depending upon the model and engine installed, 3 and 4 speed manual gearboxes or the 2-speed Powerglide automatic.|$|R
60|$|Early that morning, {{hours before}} it was necessary, there {{had been such a}} chatter of {{preparation}} in the house as was seldom heard there. Sunday hats and bonnets had been <b>retrimmed</b> with such cunning that it would have taken a milliner's apprentice at least to discover that any thread in them was not quite new. There was an anxious peep through the blind at the sky at daybreak by Georgina and Myrtle, and the perplexity of these rural children was great at the weather-signs of the town, where atmospheric effects {{had nothing to do with}} clouds, and fair days and foul came apparently quite by chance. Punctually at the hour appointed two friendly human shadows descended across the kitchen window, followed by Sol and Dan, much to the relief of the children's apprehensions that they might forget the day.|$|R
60|$|After a hasty {{survey of}} the apartment, the freedman {{appeared}} {{to be on the}} point of quitting it in despair, when the noise of a falling dish, followed by several partly suppressed and wholly confused exclamations of affright, caught his ear. He once more approached the banqueting-table, <b>retrimmed</b> a lamp that hung near him, and taking it in his hand, passed {{to the side of the}} room whence the disturbance proceeded. A hideous little negro, staring in ludicrous terror at a silver oven, half filled with bread, which had just fallen beside him, was the first object he discovered. A few paces beyond the negro reposed a beautiful boy, crowned with vine leaves and ivy, still sleeping by the side of his lyre; and farther yet, stretched in an uneasy slumber on a silken couch, lay the identical object of the freedman's search--the illustrious author of the Nightingale Sauce.|$|R
5000|$|Due to dealer pressure, however, Ford {{released}} a lower-priced [...] "Mercury 400" [...] in 1963 that {{stood in the}} price bracket formerly occupied by the Meteor. When the intermediate Mercury Meteor was dropped after 1963, Ford of Canada relaunched Meteor as a standalone make in 1964, and dropped Mercury's Monterey series in Canada. The 1964 Meteor looked nearly identical to the 1964 Mercury, save for its Ford dashboard and interior, and was available in a base and Custom series. Sedans, hardtops, and a convertible were offered. For 1965, {{the full range of}} model names that had existed in 1961 returned: Rideau, Rideau 500, and Montcalm. The Montego was added as a top-range model for 1967, but when that name was selected for use by Mercury in the U.S. beginning in 1968, it was renamed LeMoyne, and continued through 1970. A sport-themed Montcalm S-33 model was available from 1966-70. These cars were all basically <b>retrimmed</b> Mercurys.|$|R
