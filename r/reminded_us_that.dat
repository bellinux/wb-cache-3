5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way {{is not a}} matter of imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. It is a matter of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we must cultivate our garden. We all know about large prize-winning marrows, but are not succulent baby courgettes more perfect? Small is beautiful too...|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the press}} the horse {{received}} {{was viewed as}} giving a needed boost to the sport. Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont, [...] "I haven't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time, and it was {{right at the top}} of the hour... He's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way we do about him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse." [...] When the horse won the 2016 Vox Populi award, Perry Martin said, [...] "I'm proud to witness the love and devotion of Chrome's fans. They've always seen what I've seen in him." ...|$|E
500|$|CNN's Henry Hanks {{wrote the}} episode [...] "is {{reason enough to}} bring this series back for another season," [...] and praised Noble's {{performance}} as Emmy-worthy; Hanks also loved the [...] "genius" [...] musical score written by composers Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-, explaining that, like the other reviewers, he loved the opening sequence with Peter on the lake, the newest mythology details, {{as well as how}} Walternate discovered the prime universe. Murray also loved the [...] "mood" [...] of the episode, but had minor problems with the plot, as he thought it was now harder to believe Olivia, Peter, and Walter were strangers {{to each other in the}} first season. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that the episode [...] "was not the revelation that 'Peter' was, though a phase-shifting Olivia’s mistaking of Walternate for Walter was one of the series’ most mindblowing moments (and, again, a Lostian bit of disorienting sleight of hand). But it was again an effective detour in which Fringe <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> time has parallels just as space does, and that the past is emotionally overlaid on the present just as its Over There is overlaid on our world." ...|$|E

500|$|Dana Stevens of Slate {{called it}} [...] "the herald of another blessed event: {{the arrival of}} a great {{director}} by the name of Alfonso Cuarón." [...] Stevens hailed the film's extended car chase and battle scenes as [...] "two of the most virtuoso single-shot chase sequences I've ever seen." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film a [...] "superbly directed political thriller", raining accolades on the long chase scenes. [...] "Easily one of the best films of the year" [...] said Ethan Alter of Film Journal International, with scenes that [...] "dazzle you with their technical complexity and visual virtuosity." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent praised the accuracy of Cuarón's portrait of the United Kingdom, but he criticized some of the film's futuristic scenes as [...] "run-of-the-mill future fantasy." [...] Film Comment's critics' poll of the best films of 2006 ranked the film number 19 while the 2006 readers' poll ranked it number two. On their list of the best movies of 2006, The A.V. Club, the San Francisco Chronicle, Slate, and The Washington Post placed the film at number one. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film seventh on its end-of-the-decade, top ten list, saying, [...] "Alfonso Cuarón's dystopian 2006 film <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> adrenaline-juicing action sequences can work best when the future looks just as grimy as today." ...|$|E
500|$|Hilary Hughes from USA Today {{also noticed}} Gaga's vocal range, {{especially}} during the acoustic interpretation of [...] "Dope" [...] and [...] "Just Dance". Hughes concluded {{by saying that the}} simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", rather than the extravagant choreography during [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] Hardeep Phull from New York Post appreciated the stage setup and the homage to old New York industrial setting and gave positive feedback for Gaga's choice to be an entertainer with the performances of [...] "You and I", [...] "Just Dance", and [...] "Applause". Jordan Runtagh from VH1 applauded Gaga's camaraderie with her fans, also noting that [...] "the abundance of movie cameras <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> this was a special moment, one that will go down in history. And not just because these are the last performances at this storied venue. It's something more." [...] Runtagh believed that the performances solidified Gaga as a respectable entertainer and would generate further interest for the upcoming [...] tour. Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian complimented Gaga's vocals and her outfits, but felt that the show lacked [...] "something outrageous" [...] from the singer. She added that the most surprising incident of the night was when Gaga climbed a ladder to reach the mezzanine floors and sing from there.|$|E
500|$|Heffron became Premier, being {{sworn in}} with his cabinet on 23 October 1959 at Government House, Sydney by Governor Sir Eric Woodward. However, his time as Premier was marked by {{significant}} tensions within the Labor Party in NSW and nationally, where although a split involving the Democratic Labor Party had been avoided during Cahill's term, the sectarian and factional undercurrent in the party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and divided government. Indeed, the 68-year-old Heffron's government consisted mostly of MPs and Ministers who had come in with McKell after the 1941 election. In parliament, Heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of the speaking roles to his deputy Jack Renshaw and local government and highways minister Pat Hills. It was clear to many that the aged Heffron's best days as a politician were behind him, as future Labor political advisor Richard Hall noted in The Bulletin: [...] "In the House he tends to ramble on, recalling past glories as Minister for Education or Minister for Emergency Services in answer to questions. In an age where clichés cloak most politicians, Heffron throws them out {{as though they were}} devastating retorts, although occasionally the old radical has shown his teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few minutes <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> this was the great mob-orator who led many bitter strikes." [...] His old nemesis Jack Lang also took the opportunity to take a last swipe at him, ridiculing Heffron in his newspaper, Century, as [...] "Mr Magoo". On 14 October 1960, Heffron presided over the official opening of Warragamba Dam, the completion of which meant that it became the primary reservoir and the first reliable water supply for the whole Sydney catchment. At the opening, Heffron declared: [...] "We have come along way from the Tank Stream, Sydney's first water supply".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} film a full five stars and praised the film for its acting, screenplay, choreography, stunts, humor, and {{direction}} calling the film a [...] "spiritual sequel" [...] and an [...] "eruption of craziness." [...] Writing for The Guardian and awarding the film four stars out of five, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Miller has <b>reminded</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> blockbusters {{have the potential}} to not only be art, but radically visionary – even the fourth in a series. What a lovely day, indeed." [...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes gave the film 10 out of 10 stars and wrote, [...] "Mad Max: Fury Road is a remarkable and glorious motion picture, not just one of the great action movies of our time but also a great and timely film, period." [...] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote, [...] "In {{the same way that the}} original 1979 Mad Max was the Citizen Kane of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema, Mad Max: Fury Road may well be the Götterdämmerung of drive-in movies. It has its roots in the Western and the post-apocalyptic road-rage action saga , where Miller dares anyone else to follow in his tire treads." [...] IGN reviewer Scott Collura gave the film 9.2 out of 10, saying: [...] "The over-the-top stunts and eccentric characters and designs are all hugely important to Fury Road, ... but it's the overriding sense of the film's uniqueness, its striving to be something more than just another action movie, that is most impressive." ...|$|E
