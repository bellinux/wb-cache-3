50|$|The {{most common}} {{example of the}} general cutter {{location}} problem is cutter <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> (CRC), in which an endmill (whether square end, ball end, or bull end) must be offset to compensate for its radius.|$|E
50|$|Cutter {{location}} is {{the topic of}} where to locate the cutter {{in order to achieve}} the desired contour (geometry) of the workpiece, given that the cutter's size is non-zero. The most common example is cutter <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> (CRC) for endmills, where the centerline of the tool will be offset from the target position by a vector whose distance is equal to the cutter's radius and whose direction is governed by the left/right, climb/conventional, up/down distinction. In most implementations of G-code, it is G40 through G42 that control CRC (G40 cancel, G41 left/climb, G42 right/conventional). The radius values for each tool are entered into the offset register(s) by the CNC operator or machinist, who then tweaks them during production {{in order to keep the}} finished sizes within tolerance. Cutter location for 3D contouring in 3-, 4-, or 5-axis milling with a ball-endmill is handled readily by CAM software rather than manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} a {{physically}} motivated model for large scale profiles of cosmic voids limits our ability to extract valuable cosmological information from their study. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the spherically compensated cosmic regions, named CoSpheres. Such cosmic regions are identified around local extrema in the density field and admit a unique <b>compensation</b> <b>radius</b> R_ 1 where the internal spherical mass is exactly compensated. Their origin is studied by extending the standard peak model and implementing the compensation condition. Since the <b>compensation</b> <b>radius</b> evolves as the Universe itself, R_ 1 (t) ∝ a(t), CoSpheres behave as bubble Universes with fixed comoving volume. Using the spherical collapse model, we reconstruct their profiles with a very high accuracy until z= 0 in N-body simulations. CoSpheres are symmetrically defined and reconstructed for both central maximum (seeding haloes and galaxies) and minimum (identified with cosmic voids). We show that the full non linear dynamics can be solved analytically around this particular <b>compensation</b> <b>radius,</b> providing useful predictions for cosmology. This formalism highlights original correlations between local extremum and their large scale cosmic environment. The statistical properties of these spherically compensated cosmic regions and the possibilities to constrain efficiently both cosmology and gravity will be investigated in companion papers.

5000|$|The {{standard}} Earnshaw {{compensation balance}} dramatically reduced error due to temperature variations, but it didn't eliminate it. As first described by J. G. Ulrich, a compensated balance adjusted to keep correct {{time at a}} given low and high temperature will be a few seconds per day fast at intermediate temperatures. [...] The {{reason is that the}} moment of inertia of the balance varies as the square of the <b>radius</b> of the <b>compensation</b> arms, and thus of the temperature. But the elasticity of the spring varies linearly with temperature.|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of components used in recent optical technologies is ever increasing. In many applications like micro-lens arrays the optically functional surfaces have a smooth and steady geometry, but have an uncontinuous transition between the surrounding surface or other lenses. That type of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces can be machined by ultra precision diamond turning assisted by a Fast Tool Servo System (FTS), which extends the turning kinematics {{by a high}} frequency tool movement. To achieve high form accuracy and optical surface quality, two compensation approaches are discussed in this paper. The form error resulting from the geometry of the diamond tool's radius shaped cutting edge is corrected by the superposition of a compensation value. The form accuracy of the work piece beside the geometrical factors is further influenced by {{the accuracy of the}} FTS and the basis machine, especially regarding the dynamics of the axes. The transfer behaviour of the FTS is improved by applying a pre-control filter with significant order. Its extraction from measurements is shown in the paper. The positioning accuracy is mainly affected by the following error and the transfer behaviour of the axis. Using a pre-control filter, the following error of the axis can be reduced by 90 %. The combination with the <b>radius</b> tool <b>compensation</b> results in a rapid improvement of the form accuracy. Further improvements of the dynamic behaviour of the axis are possible with the application of a model-based control strategy. The dimensioning of such a modelbased system can be facilitated by a modification of the optimisation algorithm which was used to evaluate the pre-control filter. Instead of using ideal parameters for the geometry <b>compensation</b> of the <b>radius</b> tool, the measured geometry could be used to enhance the precision of the compensation, further...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} cosmic structures {{are well known}} to be strong probes for cosmology. In particular, several studies tried to use the cosmic void counting number to obtain tight constrains on Dark Energy. In this paper we address this question by using the CoSphere model as introduced in de Fromont & Alimi (2017 a). We derive their exact statistics in both primordial and non linearly evolved Universe for the standard ΛCDM model. We first compute the full joint Gaussian probability distribution for the various parameters describing these profiles in the Gaussian Random Field. We recover the results of Bardeen et al. (1986) only in the limit where the <b>compensation</b> <b>radius</b> becomes very large, i. e. when the central extremum decouples from its cosmic environment. We derive the probability distribution of the compensation size in this primordial field. We show that this distribution is redshift independent {{and can be used}} to model cosmic void size distribution. Interestingly, it can be used for central maximum such as DM haloes. We compute analytically the statistical distribution of the compensation density in both primordial and evolved Universe. We also derive the statistical distribution of the peak parameters already introduced by Bardeen et al. (1986) and discuss their correlation with the cosmic environment. We thus show that small central extrema with low density are associated with narrow compensation regions with a small R_ 1 and a deep compensation density δ_ 1 while higher central extrema are located in larger but smoother over/under massive regions.

40|$|Unidirectional {{arterio-venous}} (AV) anastomoses often {{result in}} twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Additional oppositely directed anastomoses may {{compensate for the}} circulatory imbalance and either prevent, delay the onset, or moderate the severity of TTTS. Intuitively, higher pressure gradient, oppositely-directed AV anastomoses (indicated as VA) {{would be expected to}} compensate better for TTTS than lower pressure gradient arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses. However, clinical evidence suggests AA anastomoses compensate more efficaciously, because virtually all non-TTTS monochorionic twin placentas have AAs (84 per cent), contrary to TTTS placentas, where only 30 per cent have an AA. We sought to explain this observation by comparing the capabilities of various size VA and AA anastomoses to compensate for the effects of the primary AV. As study design we used a previously developed mathematical computer model of TTTS to determine ranges of anastomotic vascular resistances which cause varying fetal and amniotic fluid discordances. Anastomotic resistances were related with the radii of their feeding vessels, using fractal geometry modelling to mimic the placental vascular tree, and various assumptions regarding arterial blood flow. The results were as follows. An AA anastomosis of equal size as the feeding artery of an AV or VA has a significantly smaller resistance. The primary AV anastomosis may be compensated by both VA as well as AA anastomoses. How,ever, VA transfusion adequately compensates AV flow only for a small range of VA to AV vascular radius ratios. In contrast, AA transfusion compensates the AV flow for a much wider range of AA to AV vascular radius ratios. In conclusion, the wider range of AA than VA <b>radii</b> for adequate <b>compensation</b> of the AV explains the finding that an AA protects more frequently than a VA of similar size against the manifestations of TTTS. These results may possibly allow future risk stratification of monochorionic twins by non-invasive sonographic assessment of the size and type of anastomoses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R

40|$|An {{accurate}} and efficient measurement for unknown rotor profile of screw compressor {{has been a}} nodus {{in the field of}} coordinate measuring machine (CMM) measurement because of its complexity of 3 D helical surface, whose normal vectors vary with different measured points, while conventional 2 D measuring methods have the inevitable <b>radius</b> <b>compensation.</b> If measured points and corresponding normal vectors are known, a 3 D <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> then could be applied without a theoretical error. In this paper, a double-measurement method based on Reverse Engineering (RE) is proposed to solve this problem. The first measurement focused on constructing a 3 D CAD model as accurate as possible.

To reduces the optical non-contact measurement uncertainty, this paper presents an Optical-triangulation-based method for measurement of blade sections. There is a data optimization process in the method, and this feature makes the proposed method can obtain better measurement results.

The numerical control kernel of CNC system is divided into the task layer and the motion layer. A five-axis transformation unit is integrated into the motion layer. After classifying five-axis machines into different types and analyzing their geometry information, the five-axis kinematic library is designed according to the abstract factory pattern. Furthermore, by taking CA spindle-tilting machine as an example, the forward and the inverse kinematic transformations are deduced. Based on the new software architecture and the five-axis kinematic library, algorithms of RTCP (rotation tool center point control) and 3 D <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> for end-milling are designed and realized.

There are many types of gauges used for the calibration and verification of CMMs. The step gauges with parallel faces (KOBA, MITUTOYO) are well known gauges to perform this test. Often with these gauges, only the unidirectional measurements are considered which avoids {{having to deal with}} a residual error that affects the tip <b>radius</b> <b>compensation.</b> However the ISO 10360 - 2 standard imposes the use of a bidirectional measurement. Thus, the bidirectional measures must be corrected by the residual constant offset probe. In this paper, we optimize the step gauge measurement and a method is given to mathematically avoid the problem of the constant offset of the tip radius. This method involves measuring the step gauge once and to measure it a second time with a shift of one slot in order to obtain a new set of equations. Uncertainties are also presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} an algorithm that can generate toolpaths in NURBS form for smooth, high speed and accurate machining. The initial toolpaths are obtained by tool <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> method {{which is based}} on the workpiece boundary offsetting. According to different lengths and the continuous short block (CSB) criterion, these offset linear segments can be regarded as CSBs or long straight segments. Junctions are located where the curvature value is greater than the preset curvature threshold value or where it changes abruptly, or at the two end points of any long straight segment. During machining, the NURBS fitting module first looks ahead several CSBs and converts them into parametric curves in real time. During the conversion, continuities of the position, slope or even curvature at the transition of the parametric curves and unfitted line segments can be guaranteed. Then the acceleration/deceleration feedrate-planning scheme is proposed to determine the transition feedrate at the junction between the fitted curves and unfitted long straight segments, and the corner feedrate within the fitted curve. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve machining accuracy and reduce cutting time to satisfy today’s high-speed and high-accurate machining requirements...|$|E

When describing the bulging value (as related to the physical properties of the bottle material) in dependence of the ration of wall thickness resp. cylinder length vs. cylinder <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> lines will be obtained for each bottle size allowing the determination of bulging pressures for any material and any wall thickness. Based on Kirchhoff's branching principles, measuring of the low pressures in the head space of filled bottles leads to formulas which will represent the increase and final value of the low pressure depending on {{the ratio of the}} filling volume resp. oxygen permeability vs. head space volume. A 10 % ammoniumthioglycolate solution was used as test liquid. The low pressure available in glass bottles which wereexamined together with the plastic bottles allows the determination of the oxygen consumption rate constant. When equating the low pressure developing from the oxygen consumption and the bulging pressure of the plastic bottles, the bulging time may be determined. The significance of the wall thickness controlling low pressure and bulging stability as well as the impact of the temperature on the final value of the low pressure obtained will be covered...|$|E
40|$|Tool {{positioning}} and {{tool wear}} or breakage {{is an integral}} part of the development of a micromachining center. The nature of worn tools, producing deficiencies in good surface finish and dimension control, is a major concern in machining operations. Current techniques in place for tool location depend on the encoder feedback of the CNC system, with the assumption of accurate tool <b>radius</b> <b>compensation.</b> Additionally, in order to maintain machining quality and to prevent damage to the work-piece, accurate monitoring or early prediction of tool condition is important. These techniques however are insufficient for micro-machining where the tool itself is usually invisible to the human eye. Because the diameter is so small, accuracy is inherently compromised. Furthermore, due to the micron scales of micro-machining, detection as well as determination of tool wear or breakage is quite challenging. This paper reports on the results of an ongoing research project to investigate and develop machine vision applications for micro machining tool location and tool wear monitoring. The determination of an optimal optical setup is reported together with some algorithms for image processing and feature classification. The optical setup utilizes a 3 mega pixel CMOS capturing device mounted on 12 X ultra zoom lens. Lighting is achieved by direct, indirect and backlighting. Initial image analysis, utilizing basic Gaussian filters and histogram equalization indicates that lighting is a critical factor in this application. Wear determination is performed by a comparison of the image of an unused tool with that of a used tool using exclusive operators. Although the results seem promising, there is need for finer enhancements on images prior to the application of classification algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Workpiece {{localization}} {{refers to}} the following problem: assuming a rigid workpiece is arbitrarily fixtured to a work table, determine the position and orientation of the workpiece frame relative to some known world reference frame. In this dissertation, {{we focus on the}} development of a computer-aided setup (CAS) system. Several important building blocks of such a system are discussed, including robust algorithms, accurate compensation method and a computer-aided probing strategy. Two computer-aided setup systems, on the basis of both an open architecture CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine and a conventional CNC machine, are built and tested. The contributions of this dissertation are as follows: First, we presented a new problem found in previous symmetric localization algorithms, specifically, the problem of discrete multiple solutions for symmetric localizations. We showed that the problem was caused by some missing components of the symmetry subgroups G 0 in previous research. Modified symmetry subgroup G 0 s of symmetric features were given. Simulation results with the modified symmetric localization algorithm showed that the discrete multiple solutions problem no longer appeared. To make the localization algorithms more applicable to a computer-aided setup system, a unified updating algorithm was presented which can be applied to both 3 D general workpieces and symmetric workpieces. This actually supplies a robust localization to the implementation of a CAS system. Next, to make online measurement practical, we addressed the probe <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> problem. Different kinds of compensation methods were reviewed. We proposed a new compensation method for workpiece localization application. We compared the performance of our proposed method with other existing methods. It was shown that our proposed method had the best performance both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which makes the compensation method applicable to a computer-aided setup system. We presented the optimal planning problem for workpiece measurement. A sequential optimization algorithm was introduced to obtain an optimal-determinant solution. Then, based on reliability analysis of localization solutions and the sequential optimization algorithm, a computer-aided probing strategy was proposed. With this strategy, given the desired translation and orientation error bounds and the desired confidence limit, we could experimentally find the least number of points needed to measure, while both error bounds were satisfitid. Simulation results showed the computer-aided probing strategy supplies it basic method for online probing. Finally, two computer-aided setup systems were built on the basis of both an open architecture CNC machine and a conventional CNC machine. The integrated systems consisted of three main modules: a touch-trigger probe systtlrn for data collection, a user graphic interface for model viewing and data inspecting, and compensated localization algorithms. Experimental results showed that the system is suitable for real-time implementation in manufacturing process...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the large}} variety of {{products}} in small batch sizes, a modern machining shop floor requires an advanced real-time control system able to both monitor all the features and adapt the manufacturing system to the rapid changes of production capability and functionality. This is especially true when the shop floors are combined with the e-Manufacturing concept. e-Manufacturing is a transformation system which enables the manufacturing operations to achieve a predictive near-zero-downtime performance {{as well as to}} synchronize with the management systems through the use of infotronics technologies (i. e., wireless connections, web applications, networking systems, etc.). In recent years, the impact of web-oriented technologies has added “velocity” to the design, manufacturing, and aftermarket service of a product. Today’s competition in manufacturing industry depends not only on lean manufacturing but also on the ability to provide customers with total solution and life-cycle costs for sustainable value. Companies are always under a high pressure to improve their efficiency in terms of product development, operations, and resource utilization with a transparent visibility of production and quality control. However, a highly efficient infrastructure, able to integrate all the parts of an automated equipment together and to link them to the e-Manufacturing, is still not available. The objective of this research is to develop an appropriate methodology with open architecture for real-time monitoring and remote control of some networked CNC machines. A new enabling technology is therefore urgently required in order to bring traditional CNC machine tools on-line with combined monitoring and control capability. Without it, the advanced factory automation will hardly have the possibility to become practical in the next generation distributed manufacturing shop floor environments. Thanks to the availability of low cost and Open Source CNC systems, it is currently possible to use CNC technology even in very simple and small production environment. The milestone of this research is EMC 2, a Linux CNC-executable control program, freely downloadable on the Internet, able to control servo-motors, stepper motors, robots and other automated devices. It allows CNC machine users to manage a numerical control machine from the parallel port of an even low-performing PC. It provides motion planning with cutter <b>radius</b> <b>compensation,</b> tool length offsets, and constant velocity control. It also have support for non-Cartesian motion systems. This includes hexapods (Stewart platforms and similar concepts) and systems with rotary joints to provide motion. In order to remotely manage a EMC 2 based CNC machine, a computer remote control of a milling station has been realised in two different configurations: thanks to a webcam pointed on the working table, the remote computer shows the milling machine movements. The first configuration uses an SSH client and server - indeed it is possible to install them not only on a great number of such UNIX versions as Linux and Mac OS X, but also on Windows. The second one uses a remote text shell (like telnet) and three different methods to broadcast images. The structure is based on a server running Linux (Ubuntu 8. 04) on which EMC 2 is installed. Thanks to a TCP/IP network, the server connects many CNC machines; moreover users are able to connect their computer to the server and to control CNC machines by using a wireless LAN. Some tests have been performed by using different computers (also a brand new netbook) in order to verify the real efficiency of the structure. The remote programs can be seen on separated windows: this way users are able to open multiple windows at the same time, one with EMC 2 and the other with the webcam image visualisation program. In this aim, a suitable software which is able to send images to a server by an ordinary Internet browser has been selected. This {{has proven to be a}} more than satisfactory solution as far as image quality and fluency are concerned. Moreover, it gives the users an opportunity to visualise webcam images on different computers at the same time, if they are in network. EMC 2 remote control could result to be an interesting tool, as an example in all those case when, for safety reasons, the operator cannot closely follow either the operations or the manufacturing; such an idea is made realer when we think about the chance to command robots by EMC 2. It can also be applied to rapid fabrication, offsite NC machining training, and distant trouble-shooting, in addition to remote real-time monitoring and control. This network has demonstrated its efficiency not only in the production, but also in the educational field, where it is very important to train students by practical sessions as long as possible. Due to the high costs of CNC equipment, there’s a need to share it among the students. Since the training sessions of the courses are limited to a few hours per week, it is crucial to share every resource and make them available as long as possible. A very important target of this project is to put engineering students in a position to access and use CNC machines from remote places. As a matter of fact, students can connect their computer (usually a laptop with a wireless broadband connection) to the server, transfer their NC file, simulate it within a virtual test environment and schedule a machining session using the real CNC machine. Thanks to the developed environment, it is possible to remotely control the machine and visualize the machining session via an ordinary webcam...|$|E
