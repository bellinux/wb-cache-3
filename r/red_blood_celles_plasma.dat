40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure of {{phosphatidylserine}} on {{the outside}} of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells contributes to recognition and removal of old and damaged cells. The fraction of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells varies between donors, and increases in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates during storage. The susceptibility of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells to stress-induced phosphatidylserine exposure increases with storage. Phosphatidylserine exposure may, therefore, constitute a link between donor variation and the quality of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order {{to examine the relationship between}} storage parameters and donor characteristics, the percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells was measured in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates during storage and in fresh <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells from blood bank donors. The percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells was compared with <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell susceptibility to osmotic stress-induced phosphatidylserine exposure in vitro, with the regular <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrate quality parameters, and with the donor characteristics age, body mass index, haemoglobin level, gender and blood group. RESULTS: Phosphatidylserine exposure varies between donors, both on <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells freshly isolated from the <b>blood,</b> and on <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates. Phosphatidylserine exposure increases with storage time, and is correlated with stress-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. Increased phosphatidylserine exposure during storage was found to be associated with haemolysis and vesicle concentration in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates. The percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells showed a positive correlation with the plasma haemoglobin concentration of the donor. DISCUSSION: The fraction of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells is a parameter of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell integrity in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates and may be an indicator of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell survival after transfusion.

The main method to freeze the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells is by usage of glycerol. Although the usage of cryopreserved <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells was promising due to the prolonged storage time and the limited cellular deterioration at subzero temperatures, its usage have been hampered due to the more complex and labour intensive procedure and the limited shelf life of thawed products. Since the FDA approval of a closed (de) glycerolization procedure in 2002, allowing a prolonged postthaw storage of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells up to 21 days at 2 - 6 degrees C, cryopreserved <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells have become a more utilized blood product.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cell age on {{metabolism}} in the nucleated <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were examined. Red blood cells were separated according to age using fixed-angle centrifugation. The mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration in old <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells {{was found to}} be 120 % of that in young <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells. In young <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells, the activities of the mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase were 135 – 200 %, respectively, of those measured in old <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells. The activity of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in young <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells was 170 % of that in old <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells, whereas the activity of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase was not significantly affected by cell age. In addition, Summary young <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells consumed over twice as much O 2 and devoted 50 % more O 2 to protein synthesis and the activity of Na + /K +-ATPase than old <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Comparatively to open repair, {{endovascular}} aneurysm repair {{has reduced}} transfusion rates but thereâs no recommendation about number of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units to be crossmatched preoperatively. Our aim is {{contribute to the}} analysis of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units needs in endovascular and hybrid aortic aneurysm repair and developing a protocol for maximum surgical blood orders schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospective database of elective endovascular aneurysm repair from 2001 to 2012. We analyzed patients' age, gender, ASA classification, maximum surgical <b>blood</b> orders schedule, <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units transfused and timings, types of endoprosthesis, <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units consumption/endoprosthesis' type ratio, crossmatch to transfusion ratio, conversion to open repair, hemoglobin concentrations before surgery and discharge. RESULTS: We selected 187 patients, 90 % men, mean age 73. 1, ASA mode III. The endoprosthesis were aorto-bi-iliac in 71 %, aorto-uni-iliac in 23 % and thoracic in 6 %. Of these, 72, 6 % of the patients did not require blood transfusion. We transfused 171 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units. Crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 after. The ratio of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units consumption/endoprosthesis in the first 24 hours was 0. 21 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units/aorto-bi-iliac, 0. 46 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units/aorto-uni-iliac, 0. 8 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units/thoracic, 1. 3 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units/hybrid-thoracic and 2 <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units/hybrid-aorto-bi-iliac. A statistical correlation was observed between <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units transfused postoperatively and type of endoprosthesis (p < 0. 001) and between ASA classification and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units transfused after 24 hours (p < 0. 01). DISCUSSION: Guidelines from the British Society of Haematology are based on a crossmatch to transfusion ratio of 2 : 1. Our crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 from 2011 to 2012. CONCLUSION: These results changed our policy of maximum surgical blood orders schedule for endovascular aneurysm repair. We now type and screen aorto-bi-iliac and aorto-uni-iliac. We crossmatch two <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units for thoracic, three <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units for hybrid thoracic and four <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells units for hybrid abdominal procedures.

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which topical progesterone in cream and water-based gel forms distributes to tissues throughout the body resulting in very high salivary and capillary blood levels in spite of low circulating levels is not well understood. However, at least one hypothesis has been put forward. Steroid hormones including progesterone {{have been found to}} be transported by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells in addition to serum carrier proteins like albumin, , and , and as much as 15 to 35% of total steroid hormone content in whole blood may be confined to <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells. In the hypothesis, very high local concentrations of progesterone occur in skin capillaries after topical application and this progesterone is taken up by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells. The transit time of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells from capillaries and the release of steroid hormones from <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells are both very rapid, so it is suggested that progesterone is delivered through circulation to tissues via <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells without having time to equilibrate with the systemic blood. This could potentially explain the low levels of progesterone in venous blood in spite of very high levels in capillary blood and saliva. However, one study assessed progesterone levels in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells with topical progesterone and found that they were significantly increased but still very low. Nonetheless, according to other authors, [...] "although the investigators of that study concluded that the progesterone levels in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells were too low to be important in the delivery of progesterone to target tissues, it should be realized that even small amounts of progesterone taken up by <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells might be important because the transit time of <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells from capillaries is very rapid. ...

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the storage time of human leukodepleted <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates compromises intestinal microvascular oxygen concentration oxygen (muPo(2)) during isovolemic exchange transfusion at low hematocrit. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: University research institute laboratory. Subjects: Male Wistar rats. Interventions: Intestinal muPo(2) was determined by Pd -porphyrin phosphorescence life-time measurements. Measurements and main results: Rats were brought near {{to a state of}} oxygen supply dependency by hemodilution with a pasteurized plasma protein solution to a hematocrit of 14. 3 +/- 1. 1 % (n = 24). Subsequently, an isovolemic exchange transfusion with human leukodepleted <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells, stored for 2 - 6 days (fresh, n = 8), 2 - 3 wks (intermediate, n = 8), or 5 - 6 wks (old, n = 8), was performed to {{determine whether}} intestinal muPo(2) would be preserved. Immunologic reactions were avoided by washing the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell concentrates three times before use. Isovolemic exchange with fresh and intermediate <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells maintained muPo(2), whereas old cells decreased muPo(2), with 26 %. Subsequent transfusion with <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells (hematocrit- 60 %) until reaching a hematocrit of 32. 4 +/- 2. 1 % (n = 24) increased intestinal muPo(2) in all three groups to the same extent between 28 % and 32 %. No changes in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cell deformability, as determined by a Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer, could be demonstrated during 5 wks of storage. Conclusion: This study shows that at low hematocrit, the oxygen delivering capacity of human <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells stored 5 - 6 wks is reduced compared with fresh cells and <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> cells stored for an intermediate period.
