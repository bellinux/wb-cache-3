Assuming uniformly distributed vote proportions, we derive the seat allocation distributions for stationary divisor methods.

We obtain seat bias formulas for the stationary divisor methods and for the quota method of greatest remainders.

50|$|The {{division}} {{of seats in}} an election is a prominent cultural concern. In 1876, the United States presidential election turned on the method by which the remaining fraction was calculated. Rutherford Hayes received 185 electoral college votes, and Samuel Tilden received 184. Tilden won the popular vote. With a different <b>rounding</b> <b>method</b> the final electoral college tally would have reversed. However, many mathematically analogous situations arise in which quantities are to be divided into discrete equal chunks. The Balinski-Young theorem applies in these situations: it indicates that although very reasonable approximations can be made, there is no mathematically rigorous way in which to reconcile the small remaining fraction while complying with all the competing fairness elements.|$|E

50|$|To {{multiply}} two fixed-point numbers, it suffices {{to multiply}} the two underlying integers, {{and assume that}} the scaling factor of {{the result is the}} product of their scaling factors. This operation involves no rounding. For example, multiplying the numbers 123 scaled by 1/1000 (0.123) and 25 scaled by 1/10 (2.5) yields the integer 123×25 = 3075 scaled by (1/1000)×(1/10) = 1/10000, that is 3075/10000 = 0.3075. If the two operands belong to the same fixed-point type, and the result is also to be represented in that type, then the product of the two integers must be explicitly multiplied by the common scaling factor; in this case the result may have to be rounded, and overflow may occur. For example, if the common scaling factor is 1/100, multiplying 1.23 by 0.25 entails multiplying 123 by 25 to yield 3075 with an intermediate scaling factor of 1/10000. This then must be multiplied by 1/100 to yield either 31 (0.31) or 30 (0.30), depending on the <b>rounding</b> <b>method</b> used, to result in a final scale factor of 1/100.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 34) In {{this project}} a Software Defined Radio receiver post processing module {{has been designed}} and simulated in the Universal Serial Radio Peripheral (USRP) using Mathworks Simulink software; it was then translated into Hardware Description Language (HDL) and synthesized using the HDL Workflow Advisor in Simulink {{in order to be}} written {{as a part of the}} FPGA firmware inside the USRP N 210. The design was created to shift and filter an incoming signal in real time using modules from the HDL Coder Simulink library. HDL synthesis results suffered from timing failures that could be prevented if the Simulink block HDL code was properly registered. A basic complex multiplier block available in Simulink could not pass the design???s timing requirements and had to be constructed from multiplication and addition blocks with every operation explicitly registered by the delay blocks. The majority of the <b>rounding</b> <b>methods</b> failed timing when used to configure the multiplication and filter blocks, and floor/zero <b>rounding</b> <b>methods</b> resulted in a DC component present at the circuit output. In order to correct the DC issue one can output complete results and use the data type conversion Simulink blocks to round off the result to an acceptable data width, while registering every operation with a delay block. The ability to move Simulink signal processing modules inside the FPGAs is important because it allows the performance of traditional post processing computations to be performed in real time inside the FPGAs thus taking advantage of the parallel processing capabilities available in the FPGAs and high-level communication system design methods offered by Simulink...|$|R
