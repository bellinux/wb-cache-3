40|$|Epoxy resins {{represent}} a commonly used basis for insulation materials {{and have been}} used in many different electrical applications. The formation of these systems involves reactions between a hardener, such as an amine-curing system, and an epoxy terminated resin. Recent studies have reported that epoxy resin systems can exhibit enhanced physical properties when the stoichiometry of the resin is varied using reactive diluent. This has been attributed to the increased free volume within the molecular structures within the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>network.</b> The work described here set out to investigate this hypothesis concerning the potential benefits of varying the network structure of epoxy resin through the inclusion of monofunctional reactive diluents within the epoxy formulation. This research is of potential significance because any modification of the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> results in modified thermal, mechanical and electrical properties and, consequently, represents a potential mean of tailoring overall performance to suit particular applications...|$|E
40|$|Ion-exclusion {{chromatography}} (IEC) {{has been}} widely used in the separation of carboxylic acids, finding applications {{in the analysis of}} food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, biological samples, and acid rain samples. ' The retention mechanism of carboxylic acids in ion-exclusion chromatography has also been investigated in many studies, and the factors which affect retention can be divided into three categories: analyte effects, mobile phase effects, and stationary phase effects. In IEC, the chromatographic system can be considered to consist of three phases: the mobile phase which comprises the eluent passing through the interstitial volume of the column, the stationary phase which comprises the occluded liquid trapped within the pores of the resin and the resin phase which is the solid <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> and functionalized groups. ' In this mode of chromatography, the analytes being separated have the same charge as the functional group on the resin; that is, anions are separated on cation-exchange columns and cations are separated on anion-exchangec columns...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{composite}} laminates made of {{epoxy resin}} matrix and long carbon fibers {{is divided into}} several operations. The most critical one is the cross-linking stage of the thermoset resin. During this phase, uncured prepreg plies’ stacking {{is transformed into a}} structural laminate by the achievement of a three dimensional macromolecular <b>resin</b> <b>network.</b> A question of matter is the quality of the polymerization process. If not optimized, it gives birth to defects in the bulk material, such as voids. These defects are considered as possible sources of damage in the composite parts. The aim of this work is to address void growth processes in thermoset composite laminates with dynamic modelling. Diffusion phenomena of gas molecules in resin are neglected for the moment, in order to study more easily viscous effects of the polymer on gas bubbles traped inside the fluid. Once model bases are fixed and validated, an optimization study is proposed to determine the best temperature and pressure cycles which permit to minimize the final void radius...|$|E

This modified system also resulted in an improvement of mechanical properties of the corresponding carbon fiber based composites. The outstanding properties were attributed to a better interaction fiber-matrix, as indicated by SEM micrographs...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} under embargo until April 2016 per {{publisher}} policy. The creep {{behavior of a}} liquid crystalline epoxy resin (LCER) was investigated and {{compared with that of}} a non-LCER prepared from the same epoxy monomer. The experimental data was evaluated using Burgers' model to explain the reinforcing effect of the liquid crystalline (LC) phase. The long-term performance of the material was predicted using the time–temperature superposition principle. The results revealed that the introduction of an LC phase into the <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> can reduce creep strain and creep strain rate of the material, especially at elevated temperatures. Parameters extracted from the simulation indicated that instantaneous elasticity, retardant elasticity, and permanent flow resistance of the resins were enhanced by the presence of the LC phase. A rigid filler effect and a crosslinking effect are proposed to explain the reinforcing mechanisms. Y. Li, M. R.

40|$|Epoxy resins {{are used}} as {{high-performance}} thermosetting linings to protect substrates under corrosive environments. However, in a severe corrosive chemical solution, such protective layers may degrade with long time due to penetrations of solvent and solute molecules into <b>resin</b> <b>network.</b> In this regard, the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a promising tool for non-destructive evaluation of the penetrant amounts due to high transparency of such plastic materials and high sensitivity to the molecular vibrations in terahertz spectral range. In this work, the complex refractive indexes n and κ of epoxy specimens were measured after immersion into sulfuric acid solutions and compared with penetrated mass fractions of water and acid ions. It was found that n and κ depended linearly with water and sulfuric acid mass fraction in specimens, and κ of sulfuric acid immersed specimens was lager at higher frequency. While the calculated Δκ agreed well with THz-TDS measurement by THz-TDS, the calculated Δn was higher than the measurement. The difference {{may be attributed to}} the water and sulfuric states in the specimen...|$|E
40|$|This work {{illustrates}} that macrocycles {{can be used}} as crosslinking agents for curing epoxy resins, provided that they have appropriate organic functionalities. As macrocycles can complex metal ions in their structure, this curing reaction allows for the introduction of that metal ion into the <b>resin</b> <b>network.</b> As a result, some characteristic physical properties of the metallomacrocycle could be transferred to the new material. The bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE, n = 0) and hemin (a protoporphyrin IX containing the Fe(III) ion, and an additional chloride ligand) have been chosen. The new material has been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and magnetic susceptibility measurements). Fe(III) remains in the high-spin state during the curing process and, consequently, the final material exhibits the magnetic characteristics of hemin. The loss of the chlorine atom ligand during the cure of the resin allows that Fe(III) can act as Lewis acid, catalyzing the crosslinking reactions. At high BADGE n = 0 /hemin ratios, the formation of ether and ester bonds occurs simultaneously during the process...|$|E

Recently, new types of epoxy resins with polyester chains, which can be derived from saccharides, lignin and glycerol, have been investigated. In the above studies, the relationship between chemical structure and physical properties was investigated. In the present review, the features of the preparation system and the action of biomass components in epoxy <b>resin</b> polymer <b>networks</b> are described. The glass transition temperatures of the epoxy resins increased with increasing content of biomass components in epoxy <b>resin</b> polymer <b>networks.</b> Thermal decomposition temperatures were almost constant regardless of the content of biomass components contents in epoxy resins.

The samples with mixed diluents, showed higher modulus, and glass transition temperature in comparison {{to that of the}} pure vinyl ester-styrene resin cross-linked in presence of styrene only. The difference in thermal stability between vinyl ester-styrene and vinyl ester-MMA-styrene was checked. Vinyl Ester - 20 wt. % MMA-Styrene samples have the best thermal property among all other prepared samples.

40|$|In this study, lignin-novolac epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>networks</b> were {{fabricated}} in the {{styrene butadiene}} rubber (SBR) matrix by combination of latex compounding and melt mixing. Firstly, SBR/lignin compounds were co-coagulated by SBR latex and lignin aqueous solution. Then the novolac epoxy resin (F 51) was added in the SBR/lignin compounds by melt compounding method. F 51 was directly cured by lignin via the ring-opening reaction of epoxy groups of F 51 and OH groups (or COOH groups) of lignin during the curing process of rubber compounds, as was particularly evident from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies and maximum torque of the curing analysis. The existence of lignin-F 51 networks were also detected by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The structure of the SBR/lignin/F 51 was also characterized by rubber process analyzer (RPA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and determination of crosslinking density. Due to rigid lignin-F 51 networks achieved in SBR/lignin/F 51 composites, {{it was found that}} the hardness, modulus, tear strength, crosslinking density, the temperature of 5 and 10 % weight-loss were significantly enhanced with the loading of F 51...|$|R

The capacity of two reactive thermoplastic additives (polyethylene-co-methacrylic acid (EMAA) and polyethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate (PEGMA)) and two non-reactive thermoplastics (ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and {{acrylonitrile butadiene styrene}} (ABS)) to heal cracks in the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> and heal delaminations in carbon&ndash;epoxy composite is determined. The thermoplastics were able to partially repair the fractured epoxy, although diﬀerent healing mechanisms were operative. The thermoplastics (except ABS) were partially or completely eﬀective in restoring the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and fatigue resistance of delaminated composites. The healing eﬃciency of the thermoplastics, deﬁned by the percentage recovery to the interlaminar fracture toughness of the composites, increased in the order: ABS (lowest), PEGMA, EVA and EMAA (highest). Healing by the reactive EMAA and PEGMA thermoplastics involves a unique pressure delivery mechanism whereas healing by the non-reactive EVA thermoplastic is controlled by its viscosity and adhesion to the fracture surfaces. ABS was ineﬀective as a healing agent in the composite due to its high viscosity which impeded ﬂow into the delamination crack...|$|E
40|$|The sub-glass-transition-temperature (sub-T-g) relaxations of an {{epoxy resin}} {{system based on}} diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) and cured with {{triethylenetetramine}} (TETA) were investigated {{by means of the}} thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) technique in the temperature range 77 K to 300 K. Three relaxation regions were observed: the gamma relaxation at about 150 K, the beta relaxation at 160 K to 200 K and the omega relaxation at 240 K to 270 K. The plasticization effect on the aforementioned relaxations of a plasticizer chemically connected to the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> was investigated. The amount of plasticizer (commercial name THIOCOL LP 3) was varied between 0 % and 60 % by weight of the epoxy. The broad range of the beta relaxation reflects the heterogeneous structure of the material. The activation energies of the gamma and beta relaxations were calculated using the thermal sampling technique. Physical aging strongly influenced the TSDC thermogram of the omega relaxation, indicating phase separation during the aging procedure. Water effects were systematically investigated from dry samples to water-saturated samples (water content, 2. 5 %). In all specimens, water induced plasticization, which is expressed by the shifting of the beta relaxation toward lower temperatures. The mode of water absorption (immersion in water or exposure to humid environment) also influenced the evolution of the omega relaxation...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{modified}} optimal market area model {{to examine how}} links between material recycling {{and other aspects of}} operations strategy can shape plant networks for the processing of recyclable materials. We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling- and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon <b>resin</b> <b>network,</b> considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy...|$|E

The reactivity of catechin toward epichlorohydrin to form glycidyl ether derivatives was studied using two model compounds, resorcinol and 4 -methylcatechol, which represent the A and B rings of catechin, respectively. These model molecules clearly showed differences in reactivity upon glycidylation, explaining the results found with catechin monomer. The reaction products were characterized by both FTIR and NMR spectroscopy and chemical assay. The glycidyl ether of catechin (GEC) was successfully cured in various epoxy resin formulations. The GECs thermal properties showed that these new synthesized epoxy resins displayed interesting properties compared to the commercial diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). For instance, when incorporated up to 50 % into the DGEBA resin, GEC did not modify the glasstransition temperature. Epoxy resins formulated with GEC had slightly lower storage moduli but induced a decrease of the swelling percentage, suggesting that GEC-enhanced crosslinking in the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{the design}} of a new {{graphene}} nano-modified formulation to enhance the mechanical performance of structural adhesives. Well-characterized graphene platelets, produced through an effective approach for bulk production and morphology control, were embedded at different contents inside an epoxy adhesive based on tetraglycidylmethylene dianiline (TGMDA). The adhesive formulations were used to manufacture bonded joints, according to ASTM 2095, to analyze the effect of graphene platelets on the tensile strength of the joints. The effect of incorporating graphene in the adherents was also considered. Epoxy adhesives filled with graphene at a concentration of 1 wt% significantly enhanced the mechanical behavior of the bonded joints. Only in the case of unfilled adherents, the inclusion of 4 wt% graphene did not {{have a significant effect on}} the mechanical performance. This is likely due to the agglomeration of nanofillers causing heterogeneity in large domains at the interface between adherents and adhesives. The effect of graphene incorporation in the adherents, acting on the chemical compatibility between adhesives and adherent surfaces, led to a considerable increase in tensile strength in comparison with the corresponding joints with unfilled adherents. This beneficial effect is most probably due to the cumulative effects of intermolecular interactions between the graphene platelets and <b>resin</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

This work further investigates the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> structure, using the techniques of isotopic labelling and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The synthesis of labelled TGDDM and DDS by known and original protocols has been investigated.

40|$|International audienceOrganosilane {{coupling}} agents {{are widely used}} in the composites industry to improve the wetting of inorganic reinforcements by low surface energy resins. An increased wettability is often a harbinger of better mechanical properties in a structural composite. Silane coatings effectively increase the spreading of liquid matrixes over glass reinforcement by altering the surface energetics of glass, not by extensive coverage, but by eradication of the high-energy sites present in the oxide surface. Commercial sizings often applied to glass fibers contain up to 10 % of the active silane agent, while the remaining 90 % {{is a mixture of}} lubricants, surfactants, anti-stats, and film formers. Recent investigations have demonstrated that non-reactive components tend to remain in high concentrations within the interphase, thus weakening the <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> crosslink density and increasing the potential for water ingress. Further, sizing formulations are proprietary and designed for specific resin system, which make them expensive, consequently limiting their widespread use. In this paper, admicellar polymerization, a versatile technique to prepare elastomeric thin films of styrene-isoprene copolymer and polystyrene on the surface of random glass-fiber mats is presented. This hydrophobic coating of monolayer thickness applied to the glass fibers is not expected to disrupt the matrix cross-linking reaction; and due to its higher elastic modulus, is believed to cause a change in the stress distribution along the fiber length. Admicellar-modified reinforcements were impregnated with an epoxy resin system: EPON 815 C/EPICURE 3232, and molded by Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) into disk shaped parts.

40|$|Rigid {{silicone}} resins, generally {{referred to}} as polyalkylsilsesquioxanes, are an important class of hybrid thermosetting polymers with both inorganic and organic characteristics. They have superior thermal stability, heat resistance, fire resistance, and still can be easily processed. Silicone resins recently have attracted much interest as low dielectric constant materials replacing silicon dioxide as interlevel dielectrics. Unfortunately, poor mechanical properties, such as brittleness and low strength, limit their broader acceptance and applications. Efforts to toughen them {{date back to the}} 1970 's, but little success has been achieved until now. Conventional polymer toughening techniques, such as incorporating second phase particles directly into the resins, typically do not work. Neither does decreasing the crosslink density of the <b>resin</b> <b>network,</b> which can compromise modulus and other properties. High fracture toughness and modulus addition cure rigid silicone resins are obtained in this study by a combination of intrinsic toughening and extrinsic toughening techniques. The addition cure silicone resin comprises two components: polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers containing silicon vinyls and low molecular weight silane crosslinkers containing silicone hydrides. The resin is cured by hydrosilylation between the two. Intrinsic toughening improves the plasticity and rigidity of the resin by choices of crosslinkers and polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers. The characteristics of molecular structure of the crosslinker and polyphenylsilsesquioxane oligomers that contribute to high fracture toughness and modulus are identified. (cont.)

Here, we relate the specificity of plant-consumer interactions to chemical diversity applying a comparative network analysis to both levels. Chemical diversity was explored for interactions between tropical stingless bees and plant resins, which bees collect for nest construction and to deter predators and microbes. Resins also function as an environmental source for terpenes that serve as appeasement allomones and protection against predators when accumulated on the bees' body surfaces. To unravel {{the origin of the}} bees' complex chemical profiles, we investigated resin collection and the processing of resin-derived terpenes. We therefore analyzed chemical <b>networks</b> of tree <b>resins,</b> foraging <b>networks</b> of <b>resin</b> collecting bees, and their acquired chemical networks.

Sesquiterpenes were the most variable class of terpenes. Albeit widely present in tree resins, they were only found on the body surface of some species, but entirely lacking in others. Moreover, whereas the nest profile of Tetragonula melanocephala contained sesquiterpenes, its surface profile did not. Stingless bees showed a generalized collecting behavior among resin sources, and only a hitherto undescribed species-specific "filtering" of resin-derived terpenes can explain the variation in chemical profiles of nests and body surfaces from different species.

40|$|Introduction. Studies of {{experimental}} composites based on amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) intended for dental applications as remineralizing pit and fissure sealants, orthodontic adhesives and, most recently, endodontic sealers were mainly focused on improving their mechanical, esthetic and remineralizing capabilities. Similar {{to the vast}} majority of commercial composites, these experimental formulations might have clinical drawbacks due to incomplete conversion of monomers and leachability of monomers and degradation products, shrinkage and stress associated with polymerization, and microleakage typically occurring at the tooth/composite interfacial region. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and quantify leachable components from the experimental amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) endodontic sealer using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Material and Methods. The light-cure resin [camphorquinone (CQ) + ethyl- 4 -N,N-dimethylamino benzoate (4 EDMAB) ] was formulated from urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), poly(ethylene glycol) - extended urethane dimethacrylate (PEG-U), 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and methacryloyloxyethyl phthalate (MEP). The experimental sealer contained 40 mass % ground ACP and 60 mass % resin. The copolymer (unfiled resin) and ACP/UPHM composite specimens, after being dried to a constant mass, were extracted in butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT; prevents polymerization of eluted components) containing acetone for 7 days at 23 ºC with continuous magnetic stirring. Gravimetric changes were recorded for each specimen. After solvent evaporation, 1 H NMR spectra were collected on the extractable portion of each specimen. Representative peaks for each component were used to calculate their relative portions in the extracts. By combining the gravimetric and NMR data, the overall loss of each monomer and its concentration in the extract was calculated. Results were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and multiple pair-wise comparisons (t-test). Results. No CQ could be detected in the extracts. However, 33. 06 % and 24. 66 % of the initially incorporated 4 EDMleached from the copolymers and composites, respectively. 0. 30 - 14. 29 % and 0. 12 - 10. 39 % of each monomer content leached out from copolymers and composites, respectively. The apparent differences in the concentrations between copolymers and composites became marginal when composite data were normalized with respect to the initial amount of the resin. Conclusion. 1 H NMR conveniently provides qualitative and quantitative information on leachables without the elaborate sample preparation and/or data interpretation. Leachability of the unrectaed monomers from the experimental ACP sealer is apparently controlled by the highly cross-linked <b>resin</b> <b>network</b> and unaffected by the incorporation of bioactive ACP into the resin.

The results indicate that water absorbency of the resin is 311 g/g, the tap water absorbency is 102 g/g, the normal saline absorbency is 55 g/g, and the artificial urine absorbency is 31 g/g under the optimal synthesis conditions, so the resin has great water absorption rate and water retaining capacity. The FT-IR and SEM analysis shows that the <b>resin</b> with honeycomb <b>network</b> structure is prepared. The successfully synthesized of the resin means that the hemicellulose waste liquid can be highly effectively recycled, and it provides a kind of new raw material for the synthesis of super water absorbent resin...|$|R

Traditionally, using vacuum bagging system and autoclave under pressure and heat will minimize or prevent voids from forming. [...] The vacuum bagging system combined with autoclave is a common method used in industrial processes to achieve a low void content for thermoset composites. Vacuum evacuation is the way reducing exciting amount of voids by physically transporting the voids out of the <b>resin</b> and fiber <b>network</b> through vacuum lines, and it {{is influenced by the}} viscosity of resin.

40|$|Oxygen barrier {{coatings}} {{have the potential}} to greatly extend the lifetime of certain food products by incorporating them into existing food packaging. Present technologies face definite challenges of maintaining high performance, while attaining simple and inexpensive preparation methods. The oxygen barrier effect obtained with these coatings is also susceptible to a plasticization effect when exposed to high humidity, since water vapor molecules are readily soluble in typically hydrophilic resins. In this work, we demonstrate a 1 – 2 micron thick oxygen barrier coating, prepared on a 12 micron poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate, that has oxygen transmission rates as low as 1. 44 cc m- 2 day- 1 under standard conditions and can maintain similar oxygen barrier performance at high humidity. This degree of oxygen barrier meets the standard of 1 – 10 cc m- 2 day- 1 established for food packaging applications. The coating is prepared through use of sol-gel chemistry between poly(vinyl alcohol) and vinyltrimethoxsilane molecules, which form a strong <b>network</b> <b>resin</b> through hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The formulation of these oxygen {{barrier coatings}} allows for variability of solids percentage and viscosity without significant change in performance. The ability to scale up the preparation of these coated films was tested successfully on an industrial flexographic printing press...|$|R

In order to facilitate the study, parotid glands were chronically stimulated with isoproterenol to induce secretion. Specimens were embedded in the Lowicryl K 4 M <b>resin.</b> The trans-Golgi <b>network</b> (TGN) derived secretory granules, which we refer to as immature secretory granules, {{were found to be}} intermediate structures in the biogenesis process of the secretory granules in the rat parotid acinar cell. These early structures {{do not seem to be}} the immediate precursor of the mature secretory granules: in fact, a subsequent interaction process between these early immature granule forms and TGN elements seems to occur, leading, finally, to the mature granules. These findings could explain the origin of the polymorphic subpopulations of the secretory granules in the normal acinar cells of the rat parotid gland. The lectin staining patterns were characteristic of each lectin. Immature and mature secretory gran- ules were labelled with WGA, SBA, PNA, and lightly with UEA-I.

Phenolic <b>resin,</b> a three-dimensional <b>network</b> structured polymer, has become a fascinating precursors and widely used to synthesis the CSs due to the low cost, high thermal stability and easy transform to carbon materials [14, 19, 20]. In 2011, Liu et al. [21] firstly extended the Stöber method to synthesis resorcinol-formaldehyde resin polymer spheres and CSs with highly uniform and controllable size. Thereafter, a lot of Stöber-like methods have been developed and used to prepare N-doped CSs [22 – 24]. For examples, Lu and co-workers [25] have utilized the hexamethylenetetramine polymerize with resorcinol to fabricate the N-containing (1.21  at.%) ultramicroporous CSs under the Stöber condition. The obtained N-doped CSs as electrode materials for supercapacitors exhibited a high specific capacitance of 269  F g−[*] 1 at 1.0 A g−[*] 1. Tian et al. [26]. have successfully prepared the N-doped CSs with high nitrogen content from 5.5  wt% to 11.9  wt% by Stöber-like method that shown a good electrochemical capacitance of 127  F g−[*] 1 at 10  mV s−[*] 1. However, most of those Stöber-like synthetic methods generally required complicated procedures and/or a long processing time (usually more than 24  h), and many of these CSs exhibited a limited specific capacitance and unsatisfactory energy density. Therefore, it is a great challenge to developing a facile and rapid strategy to prepare N-doped CSs, which can satisfies the requirement for high performance supercapacitor applications.|$|R
40|$|The acidities of {{a series}} of fully {{hydrated}} sulfonated poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) resins with varying levels of sulfonation from 0. 80 to 5. 25 mequiv g- 1 have been characterized. Enthalpies of neutralization with aqueous NaOH have been measured by titration calorimetry. The degrees of acid dissociation () have been measured using FT-Raman spectroscopy, based on the intensity of the –SO 3 - stretching band at 1033 cm- 1. The same measurements have been made on aqueous solutions of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH), on the basis that these solutions are analogs of the internal solutions in the hydrated resin gels. For resins with low levels of sulfonation, and therefore relatively dilute internal acid solutions, the internal and the equivalent p-TsOH solutions are similar. However, significant differences are seen in highly sulfonated resins where the internal solution concentration is above 4. 0 mol kg- 1. At these concentrations, p-TsOH solutions show essentially complete dissociation and enthalpies of neutralization typical of a strong, fully dissociated acid in aqueous solution. In contrast, the acid groups in hydrated resins are largely undissociated and exhibit numerically higher enthalpies of neutralization, and catalytic activity measurements indicate that these acid groups are stronger than normal. It is proposed that this acidity enhancement is associated with networks of sulfonic acid groups which form in highly sulfonated <b>resins.</b> Although such <b>networks</b> have been previously proposed in dehydrated resins, this paper reports the first evidence for their existence in resins under conditions of full hydratio...|$|R

In another attempt, {{the reaction was}} carried out in a neutral environment and at atmospheric temperature (modified one - stage neutral synthesis). The structural analysis of the various UF resin samples was carried out. The results showed that the UF resins (II) synthesized in acidic media, particularly that of pH 1. 0, showed features in their spectra which are consistent with a tri -, and/or tetra - substituted urea in the reaction to give a 3 - dimensional <b>network</b> UF <b>resin.</b> A 3 - dimensional <b>network</b> <b>resin</b> is characterized by little or no hydroxyl groups with increased cross-link-density and hydrophobicity and hence improved hydrolytic stability. For the resin (III) obtained from the conventional method, the only clear distinction between spectra for the resins (II) synthesized in acid media is the presence of diminished peaks for methylene groups at 2. 2 ppm. The resins (I) synthesized in neutral medium exhibited almost the same structural characteristics as those of the resin samples (III) prepared conventionally. The result also showed that UF resin samples (I and III) possessed 5 - 17 percent of free formaldehyde; the UF resin sample (II) had approximately zero formaldehyde percentage...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{application}} of the temporalis muscle flap and its modifications, understanding of the vascular pattern and territories within the muscle remains poor. This study aimed to evaluate the vascular architecture in the human temporalis muscle for surgical application. The material comprised 15 fresh cadavers (30 muscle specimens), which were divided into three groups for vascular infusion by either Indian ink solution, lead oxide solution, or methylmethacrylate <b>resin.</b> The vascular <b>network</b> in the temporalis muscle was analyzed by stereomicroscopy, radiography, and scanning electron microscopy. The human temporalis muscle {{was found to have}} vascular supply from three primary arteries: the anterior deep temporal artery (ADTA), the posterior deep temporal artery (PDTA), and the middle temporal artery (MTA). Each primary artery branched into the secondary arterioles and then the terminal arterioles. The venous network accompanied the arteries, and double veins pairing one artery was a common finding. The capillaries formed a dense, interlacing network with orientation along the muscle fibres. Arteriovenous anastomosis was absent. In the coronal plane, the vessels were located mainly on the lateral and medial aspects of the muscle with a significantly lower vascular density in the midline. Morphometric analysis of the arterial network showed that the PDTA was larger in size at primary and secondary branching levels than the ADTA and the MTA, whereas no differences were present at the terminal arteriolar levels. The distribution of the arterial territories was as follows: the ADTA occupied 21 % anteriorly, the PDTA occupied 41 % in the middle region, and the MTA occupied 38 % in the posterior region. This improved understanding of the vascular architecture within the temporalis muscle complements the anatomic basis of the flap-splitting technique and increases the safety of its application. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION]Most {{experimental}} studies of electrical ageing have concentrated on semi-crystalline polymers such as those used in cable insulation and capacitors (see for example [1]). Theoretical models [2 - 4] for electrical ageing have been developed {{on the basis of}} these studies. The consensus is that ageing involves the formation of low-density regions, though the mechanisms responsible are disputed. For example, bond scission by high-energy electrons [2, 5], and mechanical deformation have both been suggested. Both of these mechanisms are related to charge injection and the subsequent formation of high local fields. The semi-crystalline polymers studied so far have similar chemistries and almost identical morphologies. They tend, therefore, to show many similarities in, for example, the size of the energy barriers for the ageing reaction, critical ageing levels, and field dependence of ageing [4]. These similarities make it difficult to discriminate between mechanisms. Epoxy <b>resins,</b> however, are <b>network</b> polymers with a different molecular chemistry to that of the semi-crystalline polymers and are thus ideal to evaluate the proposed ageing mechanisms. We have therefore studied an epoxy resin (CY 1301) under both uniform field and high divergent field conditions. Uniform field conditions were used to gain baseline characteristics for the properties of the unaged epoxy resin, and also for the effects of electrical ageing in low fields. Studies in high divergent fields were made using an electrode arrangement adapted from that of [6]. A number of wires set approximately 0. 5 mm apart were embedded, parallel to the flat faces, in thin ( 290 m) flat samples. The radius of the wires ranged from 5 m (gold plated tungsten) to 25 m (tungsten). Relatively small voltages applied to the wires ( 5 kV DC) therefore produced local fields up to 170 kV/mm depending upon the wire radius chosen. These field levels are high enough to inject space-charge [6] without leading to instantaneous failure. This geometry, therefore, may both inject charge and simulate local stress enhancements arising from charge accumulation. The number of wires is large ( 30) so that the volume affected is big enough to allow changes on ageing to be detectable.
