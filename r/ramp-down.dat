Organizations evolve and new systems are implemented. In this context, the workshop needs to increase the control over its flow of material. This lack of control results in inappropriate supplies (generating material excess and/or shortages) or losses and wastes of material, which has financial consequences for the workshop. The analysis identified areas of potential improvement and broke down the project into three subjects: improving technical data reliability, defining the process of production <b>ramp-downs</b> and monitoring the performance of the warehouse. Each project started by a period of analysis, followed by proposals, implementation and follow-up. All of them appealed to “change management” practices. The projects brought concrete gains on material control. Bills of material and stock levels are more reliable, production <b>ramp-downs</b> are in control. The main outcomes of the projects are methods: production <b>ramp-downs</b> procedure, raw material quality monitoring, control process monitoring. The control of material flow is now set as a goal for the team, improvements are followed and shared.

40|$|AutoPyFactory (APF) is a {{next-generation}} pilot submission {{framework that}} has been used as part of the ATLAS workload management system (PANDA) for two years. APF is reliable, scalable, and offers easy and flexible configuration. Using a plugin-based architecture, APF polls for information from configured information and batch systems (including grid sites), decides how many additional pilot jobs are needed, and submits them. With the advent of cloud computing, providing resources goes beyond submitting pilots to grid sites. Now, the resources on which the pilot will run also need to be managed. Handling both pilot submission and controlling the virtual machine life cycle (creation, retirement, and termination) from the same framework allows robust and efficient management of the process. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of these virtual machine management capabilities of APF. Expanding on our plugin-based approach, we allow cascades of virtual resources associated with a job queue. A single workflow can be directed first to a private, facility-based cloud, then a free academic cloud, then spot-priced EC 2 resources, and finally on-demand commercial clouds. Limits, weighting, and priorities are supported, allowing free or less expensive resources to be used first, with costly resources only used when necessary. As demand drops, resources are drained and terminated in reverse order.

There {{is no shortage of}} near real-time data collected by manufacturers in their supply chain and it grows exponentially, once retailer data is included. According to a McKinsey & Company report, “Manufacturers can improve their demand forecasting and supply planning by the improved use of their own data. But as we’ve seen in other domains, far more value can be unlocked when companies are able to integrate data from other sources including data from retailers, such as promotion data (e.g., items, prices, sales), launch data (e.g., specific items to be listed/delisted, <b>ramp-down</b> plans), and inventory data (e.g., stock levels per warehouse, sales per store). By taking into account data from across the value chain (potentially through collaborative supply chain management and planning), manufacturers can smooth spiky order patterns. The benefits of doing so will ripple through the value chain, helping manufacturers to use cash more effectively and to deliver a higher level of service. Best-in-class manufacturers are also accelerating the frequency of planning cycles to synchronize them with production cycles. Indeed, some manufacturers are using near-real-time data to adjust production.” This last sentence refers to demand sensing solutions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobal uptake {{of solar}} PV has risen {{significantly}} {{over the past}} four years, motivated by increased economic feasibility and the desire for electricity self-sufficiency. However, significant uptake of solar PV could cause grid balancing issues. A system comprising Stirling engine combined heat and power, solar PV and battery storage (SECHP–PV–battery) may further improve self-sufficiency, satisfying both heat and electricity demand as well as mitigating potential negative grid effects. This paper presents the results of a simulation of 30 households with different energy demand profiles using this system, in order to determine: the degree of household electricity self-sufficiency achieved; resultant grid demand profiles; and the consumer economic costs and benefits. The results indicate that, even though PV and SECHP collectively produced 30 % more electricity than the average demand of 3300 kWh/yr, households still had to import 28 % of their electricity demand from the grid with a 6 kWh battery. This work shows that SECHP is much more effective in increasing self-sufficiency than PV, with the households consuming on average 49 % of electricity generated (not including battery contribution), compared to 28 % for PV. The addition of a 6 kWh battery to PV and SECHP improves the grid demand profile by 28 % in terms of grid demand ramp-up requirement and 40 % for <b>ramp-downs.</b> However, the variability of the grid demand profile is still greater than for the conventional system comprising a standard gas boiler and electricity from the grid. These moderate improvements must be weighed against the consumer cost: with current incentives, the system is only financially beneficial for households with high electricity demand (> 4300 kWh/yr). A capital grant of 24 % of the installed cost of the whole micro-generation system is required to make the system financially viable for households with an average electricity demand (3300 kWh/yr) ...|$|R

A set of empirical heat transport models for L-mode (namely, the Bohm-gyroBohm model and scaling based models with a specific fixed radial shape and energy confinement time factors of H(96 -L) = 0. 6 or H(IPB 98) = 0. 4) has been validated on a multi-machine experimental dataset for predicting the l(i) dynamics within +/- 0. 15 accuracy during current ramp-up and <b>ramp-down</b> phases.

40|$|The {{response}} of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to an increase of radiative forcing (ramp-up) and a subsequent reversal of radiative forcing (<b>ramp-down)</b> is analyzed for four different global climate models. Due to changes in ocean temperature and hydrological cycle, all models show a weakening of the AMOC during the ramp-up phase. Once the external forcing is reversed, the results become model dependent. For IPSL-CM 5 A-LR, the AMOC continues its weakening trend {{for most of the}} <b>ramp-down</b> experiment. For HadGEM 2 -ES, the AMOC trend reverses once the external forcing also reverses, without recovering its initial value. For EC-EARTH and MPI-ESM-LR the recovery is anomalously strong yielding an AMOC overshoot. A robust linear dependency can be established between AMOC and density difference between North Atlantic (NA) deep water formation region and South Atlantic (SA). In particular, AMOC evolution is primarily controlled by a meridional salinity contrast between these regions. During the warming scenario, the subtropical Atlantic becomes saltier while the NA experiences a net freshening which favours an AMOC weakening. The different behaviour in the models during the <b>ramp-down</b> is dependent on the {{response of}} the ocean at the boundaries of NA and SA. The way in which the positive salinity anomaly stored in the subtropical Atlantic during the ramp-up is subsequently released elsewhere, characterizes the recovery. An out-of-phase {{response of the}} salinity transport at 48 ∘N and 34 ∘S boundaries is able to control the meridional density contrast between NA and SA during the transient experiments.

The objective of this thesis was to simulate transient periods with an one-dimensional (1 D) model and a more detailed two-dimensional (2 D) model from a commercial CFD package, extracting the friction factor and then comparing the resulting friction factors from the two models. The RANS k-ω model was chosen from a set of criteria. To limit the computational demand, periodic boundary conditions were used at the inlet and the outlet of the pipe-segment and the flow was simplified to be isothermal, incompressible, and with constant viscosity.
