5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions {{to be launched}} on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The rescue flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> be needed. For example, the STS-116 <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.|$|E

5|$|After {{evaluating}} the imagery sent {{down from the}} late inspection, the ground team officially cleared the orbiter's thermal protection system for re-entry. Initially, NASA had planned on releasing Endeavour from its stand-by status following the late inspection, but managers on the ground decided to wait until Atlantis had performed the de-orbit burn before standing down the STS-400 <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> officially.|$|E

5|$|In South Korea, {{two people}} were killed with two others {{reported}} missing. A South Korean freighter rode out the storm at the port in Hakata Bay. It breached along the breakwater, causing it to sink, killing all 10crew members. The Japan Coast Guard launched a search and <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> for two days.|$|E
5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate <b>rescue</b> <b>mission.</b> On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E

5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. Lockheed Martin experienced delays during the production changes {{to make new}} external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, {{making it impossible for}} them to produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for Atlantis, and one for Endeavour for an emergency <b>rescue</b> <b>mission,</b> if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scenario}} was {{a hostage}} <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> where a submarine 3 kilometers {{off the coast}} of a third world nation must send in an aerial robot to find a coastal city, identify the embassy where the hostages are being held, locate valid openings in the embassy building, enter (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the hostages back 3km to the submarine prior to mounting an amphibious assault on the embassy to free the hostages.|$|E

Sykes discovers a mortally wounded Kael near his crashed fighter, and it is {{revealed}} that Borvo had shot down Kael after he'd learned of the Hutt's secret plan to sell the escaped prisoners into slavery. Seeking vengeance and the freedom of his people, Sykes hunts down Borvo, assisted by a disgruntled Kotha who disagrees with Borvo's betrayal. Though the Hutt is able to escape to Nal Hutta, the prisoners are saved.|$|E
5|$|In Resident Evil: Revelations (2012), set in 2005, Valentine is sent on a <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> to save Redfield from a bioterrorist group. Redfield is {{believed}} to be held on a luxury cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but once Valentine and her new partner, Parker Luciani, are aboard, the rescue operation is revealed to be a trap. The ship is infested with a new breed of leech-like zombies. Meanwhile, Redfield and his new partner, Jessica Sherawat, {{make their way to the}} ship to find Valentine. Together, they slowly unravel a global conspiracy involving an earlier outbreak of a mutagenic virus and a botched investigation by a rival agency.|$|E
5|$|Ishigami {{played a}} large role in the {{implementation}} of the Wi-Fi rescue quests, and it went smoother than anticipated, something the developers attributed to their experience with developing mobile games. They were initially concerned about how the player loses all their items if they die during a <b>rescue</b> <b>mission,</b> but realized {{that it had to be}} that way to avoid people abusing rescue missions to get new items. Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second <b>rescue</b> <b>mission.</b> The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|On October 4 the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with {{president}} Brigham Young and other Church leaders. The {{next morning the}} Church was meeting in a general conference, where Young and the other speakers called on the Church members to provide wagons, mules, supplies, and teamsters for a <b>rescue</b> <b>mission.</b> On the morning of October 7 the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagon-loads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, {{and by the end}} of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.|$|E
5|$|Provisions {{were now}} running low, {{and with the}} <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b> overdue, Maxwell began formulating a plan to capture {{sufficient}} proas {{to escape from the}} island. While the plan was being proposed a sail was spotted on the horizon, heading toward the island. The appearance of this vessel, coupled with a sudden attack spearheaded by Alceste's marines, caused the pirates to flee. The rescue ship was Ternate, a 16-gun brig belonging to the British East India Company's navy, the Bombay Marine, despatched by Lord Amherst on the day of his arrival in Batavia.|$|E
