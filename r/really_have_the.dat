25|$|The King's full {{baptismal name}} was Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi, {{but he was}} soon better known by the {{traditional}} title reserved for Crown Princes: Tupoutoʻa, (bestowed in 1937) later replaced by the title he inherited from his father: Tungī (or using both: Tupoutoʻa-Tungī, in that time written as Tuboutoʻa-Tugi). He kept the Tungī title until his death. From a traditional point of view {{he was not only}} the Tungī, which is the direct descendent from the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua, but he was also, on becoming king, the 22nd Tuʻi Kanokupolu. The link with the Tuʻi Tonga, was more indirect. He was not a Tuʻi Tonga too (as that office has gone over into the Kalaniuvalu line), but his grandmother Lavinia Veiongo (wife of George Tupou II) was the great-granddaughter of Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, and his wife Halaevalu Mataʻaho (not {{to be confused with the}} King's wife of the same name and same family), who was the daughter of Tupou ʻAhomeʻe, who was the daughter of Lātūfuipeka, the Tamahā (sister of the Tuʻi Tonga). By consequence, the King's daughter, Pilolevu, was the first woman in Tongan culture to <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> blood of the three major Royal dynasties in her veins and become the highest-ranking person ever.|$|E
500|$|The {{initial set}} release date was late 2004, {{and the band}} had to delay the album to January 2005. But as the new target date was approaching, the band again {{discarded}} songs, which they deemed [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "passionless". Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We realized that we didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, so we thought we better go back and record them again." [...] Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves [...] "forward in every direction" [...] in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle {{from the}} San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "there {{may be more}} {{entertaining}} and less problematic movies, but Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has something about it that hangs in there, working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg. The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is a good movie, but I am sure I like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles [...] "Chilly" [...] Patton. 1st & 15th is an {{independent}} record label separate from Atlantic Records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates. [...] Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with them, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos {{were two of the}} most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: [...] "It was just such a 'this isn't right for you right now. This isn't gonna work for you right now. You need to be focused on you. Do you really want that, do you <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to do it?'" [...] In March 2013 Fiasco took to Twitter to announce that he had become the Creative Director at Higi, a scoring system based in the Chicago area that helps you to discover more about yourself so you can look, live and feel better.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2016, the DSI {{entered the}} temple to take Luang Por Dhammajayo in custody. After having {{searched for a}} while, a number of laypeople rose and barred the DSI from {{continuing}} their search. The DSI, avoiding a confrontation, withdrew. A temple official was seen giving a press statement that the abbot would surrender himself [...] "as soon as the state has become a democracy", enabling a fair judicial process. Even though the statement was later downplayed by temple's spokespeople as not representing the temple's official opinion., former senator Paiboon pointed out it reflected the temple's autonomy from the state. In reflection, news analysts concluded that the DSI did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> intention to arrest Luang Por Dhammajayo, but was simply surveying the temple grounds, or [...] "playing political theatre" [...] (Otago Daily Times).|$|E
2500|$|American {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of}} four stars and praised its {{portrayal}} of addicts' experiences with each other. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "in McGregor ... the film has an actor whose magnetism monopolizes our attention no matter what". Entertainment Weekly gave the film an [...] "A" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Like Scorsese and Tarantino, Boyle uses pop songs as rhapsodic mood enhancers, though in his own ravey-hypnotic style. Whether he's staging a fumbly sex montage to Sleeper's version of Atomic or having Renton go cold turkey to the ominous slow build of Underworld's Dark and Long ... Trainspotting keeps us wired to the pulse of its characters' passions". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Trainspotting doesn't have much narrative holding it together. Nor does it <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> dramatic range to cope with such wild extremes. Most of it sticks to the same moderate pitch, with entertainment value enhanced by Mr. Boyle's savvy use of wide angles, bright colours, attractively clean compositions and a dynamic pop score".|$|E
2500|$|Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Video Game {{received}} mixed reviews. The graphics, animations {{and music}} were praised by critics. However, a reviewer from the German Video Games magazine {{noted that the}} graphics and sounds were good for a 16-bit system, but relatively low quality compared to the graphics shown on 32-bit consoles. Several reviewers thought that the gameplay neither was innovative nor varying enough. Also, some reviewers considered the special moves too difficult to perform. On the other hand, the special moves available was seen {{as one of the}} highlights of the game. In addition, critics from GamePro and the French video game magazine Super Power liked that the game was faithful to the comics. Others, however, found the game unsatisfying even in this regard; Andrew Baran of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it [...] "doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> feel of the comic", and all but one of the magazine's four-person review crew judged the game to be mediocre, citing a good variety of special moves but slow character movement and an excessive number of cheap hits, especially when fighting Anti-Spawn. A reviewer for Next Generation was even more condemning: [...] "Suffering from problems with just about everything, a lack of speed, poor play control, and lousy graphics, this completely generic attempt at a videogame is less enjoyable than a skin rash." [...] Still, most reviewers recommended the game for fans of the comic book series.|$|E
