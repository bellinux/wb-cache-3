500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, let me take a <b>rain</b> <b>check.</b> I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s that interesting awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|E
500|$|Author Jonathan Gould {{describes}} [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] as [...] "a rueful <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> {{of a love}} song" [...] and [...] "an {{exercise in}} hypothetical romance". He comments that the melody's phrasing on the off-beat and the [...] "drastically arpeggiated" [...] bass line mirror the lyrical theme of [...] "right person at the wrong time". The lyrics reflect the influence of Bob Dylan, in terms of tone and content. Further to {{the message of the}} song title, Harrison offers his love only if he should happen to need [...] "someone", and on the condition that time allows for such a relationship, and he conveys his feelings in matter-of-fact terms. In Fontenot's description, the lyrics [...] "are representative of the change in the Beatles' outlook and also of its era: tender but ambivalent". Harrison invites the woman he addresses to [...] "Carve your number on my wall", yet offers only the possibility that he will contact her in the future.|$|E
5000|$|In {{nearly all}} cases, the [...] "official game" [...] status {{is used to}} {{determine}} whether a <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> will be honored for fans holding tickets. If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official, fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or (in most cases) any other available game of their choice. If a game is halted after it becomes official, the game is simply shortened and no <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> is given.|$|E

50|$|Another known demarketing {{strategy}} is stock outage demarketing, where a firm actually plans a stock outage. Stock outages frustrate consumers, but stores often offer <b>rain</b> <b>checks</b> that guarantee delivery at a future date. Nevertheless, Hess and Gerstner (1987) showed that stores might profit from planned stock outages with <b>rain</b> <b>checks</b> because customers may visit the stores twice and buy complementary products on each visit. Balachander and Farquhar (1991) showed that deliberate stock outages help stores charge higher prices and earn higher profits. The {{possibility of a}} stock outage in one store makes customers more eager to buy when the other store has the product in stock.|$|R

5000|$|The {{institution}} of issuing tickets for games canceled due to rain dates {{at least to}} 1870, while the term <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> dates to at least 1877; in the National League it was pioneered by the : ...|$|E
50|$|Originally a <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> for a {{canceled}} {{game was}} simply a ticket valid for a future game - {{in lieu of a}} refund - not specifically for a makeup game. Further, at the time clubs would sell reusable hard cardboard tickets, which were turned in at the admissions gate, then resold at the box office {{at the conclusion of the}} game. Originally rain checks were issued to spectators as they exited, but this resulted in severe losses to clubs, due to free-riders and fence-climbers also getting tickets. This was solved by Abner Powell circa 1889 by using a stub on the original ticket as <b>rain</b> <b>check.</b> Powell is thus often incorrectly credited with inventing rain checks, while in fact he instead refined an existing practice.|$|E
5000|$|In baseball, a <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> is {{a ticket}} issued to spectators which admits {{them to the}} {{ballpark}} {{at a later date}} at no additional cost to the ticket holder. It is issued if a game is cancelled due to rain or other inclement weather, or if a game has been started but suspended due to inclement weather prior to the point of becoming an official game (five innings in Major League Baseball). Depending on the home team/league policy and the rescheduling of the game, the <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> may admit the ticket holder to watch the rained out game or the continuation of a suspended game only on the rescheduled date, or it may allow the ticket holder to exchange the tickets for tickets of equal value to another game within a specified time frame.|$|E
5000|$|Yanni later {{remarked that}} [...] "the weather {{became part of}} the show," [...] but that {{it was the first time}} in his thirty-year career that a concert had been stopped. To {{individuals}} affected by the Friday evening concert that was cut short, the concert's production, José Dueño Entertainment, offered <b>rain</b> <b>checks</b> on tickets towards the next Yanni concert in Puerto Rico or any other José Dueño Entertainment production, and a certificate valid towards receiving the concert DVD.|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, the American-led {{invasion}} of Iraq affected the telecast {{and its surrounding}} events. Hours after news that the war had commenced several actors such as Cate Blanchett, Jim Carrey, and Will Smith resigned from their roles as presenters citing safety concerns and respect for military families. Despite pleas from broadcaster ABC to postpone the proceedings up to a week, AMPAS president Pierson and ceremony producer Cates refused to delay the gala to a different date citing unavailability of the Kodak Theatre during that time. Pierson also stated that moving the festivities to a different venue would be too expensive for the Academy. However, they also announced that the red carpet festivities would be severely curtailed. The bleacher seats situated along Hollywood Boulevard would also be dismantled, and ticket holders for those seats would receive <b>rain</b> <b>checks</b> that were good toward next year's event. Periodically during commercial breaks, ABC News anchor and journalist Peter Jennings gave news brief updates regarding the events happening overseas.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{advertising}} a sale while {{intending to}} stock {{a limited amount}} of, and thereby sell out, a loss-leading item advertised is legal in the United States. The purveyor can escape liability if they make clear in their advertisements that quantities of items for which a sale is offered are limited, or by offering a <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> on sold-out items.|$|E

5000|$|Rain checks were {{originally}} separate tickets {{issued by the}} home team to spectators {{as they left the}} ballpark following a rainout. In modern times, the ticket to the rained out game serves as the <b>rain</b> <b>check.</b> The practice has been recorded since the 1870s - though it did not become generally established until the 20th century - and today the term [...] "rain check" [...] is used idiomatically to refer to any deferred promise.|$|E

60|$|Money was wonderfully plenty. The trouble was, not {{how to get}} it,--but how {{to spend}} it, how to lavish it, get rid of it, squander it. And {{so it was a}} happy thing that just at this {{juncture}} the news came over the wires that a great United States Sanitary Commission had been formed and money was wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of the Union languishing in the Eastern hospitals. Right on the heels of it came word that San Francisco had responded superbly before the telegram was half a day old. Virginia rose as one man! A Sanitary Committee was hurriedly organized, and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in C street and tried to make the clamorous multitude understand {{that the rest of the}} committee were flying hither and thither and working with all their might and main, and that if the town would only wait an hour, an office would be ready, books opened, and the Commission prepared to receive contributions. His voice was drowned and his information lost in a ceaseless roar of cheers, and demands that the money be received now --they swore they would not wait. The chairman pleaded and argued, but, deaf to all entreaty, men plowed their way through the throng and <b>rained</b> <b>checks</b> of gold coin into the cart and skurried away for more. Hands clutching money, were thrust aloft out of the jam by men who hoped this eloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could not open. The very Chinamen and Indians caught the excitement and dashed their half dollars into the cart without knowing or caring what it was all about. Women plunged into the crowd, trimly attired, fought their way to the cart with their coin, and emerged again, by and by, with their apparel in a state of hopeless dilapidation. It was the wildest mob Virginia had ever seen and the most determined and ungovernable; and when at last it abated its fury and dispersed, it had not a penny in its pocket.|$|R

50|$|Generally, Major League Baseball (MLB) {{teams will}} {{continue}} play in light to moderate rain but will suspend play {{if it is}} raining heavily or if there is standing water on the field. Games can also be delayed or canceled for other forms of inclement weather, or if the field {{is found to be}} unfit for play, and for other unusual causes such as bees. Bee delays and cancellations have occurred in games such as the spring training game in 2005 that was canceled, as well as the 2009 Houston Astros-San Diego Padres game that was delayed in the ninth inning. However, rain {{is by far the most}} common cause for cancellations or stoppages of play. In case of rain out after the game has begun but before it is official, a <b>rain</b> <b>check</b> is issued; this dates to the 1870s, but did not become widespread until the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Literally translated, chauka means ‘rectangular enclosure’.

A concept of a quality index will be presented will be transferred together with the observational data to the user. The quality index field is based on results achieved in research over the last 25 years and will contain information about (i) broadening of the radar beam and height of the first radar echo; (ii) ground clutter contamination and beam shielding; (iii) contamination by attenuation; (iv) homogeneous beam filling; and (v) a consistency check between reflectivity, differential reflectivity ratio, and differential propagation phase. While (i) to (iii) are also important for conventional weather radars, the later two are focus solely on polarimetric radar observations. The consistency check is used for instance to monitor the performance of the radar system and reveal areas consisting of rain. Since the assumptions for the consistency check are valid only in <b>rain,</b> this <b>check</b> will fail in regions with other types of hydrometeors.
