5|$|A <b>research</b> <b>team</b> {{undertook}} {{a study in}} 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers, and confirmed a vocal range from F#2 to G5 (just over 3 octaves) but were unable to confirm claims of a 4-octave range. The <b>research</b> <b>team</b> studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, {{and a series of}} interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{existence}} of stable <b>research</b> <b>teams,</b> when each agent's preferences depend {{on the set of}} researchers collaborating with her. We introduce a property over researchers' preferences, called tops responsiveness guaranteeing {{the existence of}} stable <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> configurations. We also provide a stable mechanism, induced by the so-called tops covering algorithm, which is strategy-proof when researchers preferences satisfy tops responsiveness. Furthermore, we also find out that, in this framework the tops covering mechanism is the unique strategy-proof mechanism that always selects stable allocations.

This article investigates the relationship of team climate with project team innovation and performance in research and development organizations. It is argued that the relationship between team climate and innovation will be stronger for <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> than development <b>teams</b> as <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> have greater scope for creating novel and innovative ideas. A sample of 193 scientists and technologists in 20 <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> and 18 development teams were measured on their team’s climate for innovation, team performance, and six indicators of innovation. <b>Research</b> and development <b>teams</b> showed similar ratings for team climate and for measures of innovation. However, the relationships between team climate and individual and team innovation were stronger for <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> than development teams. These findings are significant for fostering innovativeness and innovation in knowledge work teams...|$|R

The purpose of the article is to investigate this assumption {{in the context of}} two distributed <b>research</b> <b>teams,</b> with different coordination and management needs. The results suggest that the positive impact of internet use on research productivity is limited and may only be relevant only when collaborative endeavours suffer coordination problems.
