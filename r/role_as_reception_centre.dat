50|$|A nearly {{completed}} hotel {{building in}} Dubai {{was taken over}} <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the wounded, with many suffering from burns, exposure and wounds from flying metal shards. The tide of wounded overwhelmed Al Maktoum Hospital and field stations were opened at Sheikh Rashid's Customs House office block.|$|R
50|$|Roath was a {{substantial}} station, having two platforms, each {{covered by a}} large wooden awning. During the First World War, the station was used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for wounded troops, who {{were taken to the}} nearby Splotlands Board School, which was then in use as a hospital.|$|R

50|$|The {{exhibition}} {{hall was}} called the Ahoy'-Hal. The apostrophe is a remnant of the original exclamation mark. The hall was used {{for a series of}} national and international events, such as the exhibition of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s work. During the North Sea flood of 1953 the hall also proved its worth <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for victims.|$|R

40|$|This article {{sets out}} the main {{findings}} of the research project Documenting the Humanitarian Migration Crisis in the Mediterranean, which maps migration trajectories and transit points across Europe {{in order to develop}} a humanitarian response to the Mediterranean migration ‘crisis’. On their long journeys, people seeking refuge in Europe pass through various places of transit, both informal spaces such as railways stations, parks and makeshift camps, and institutionalised spaces such <b>as</b> <b>reception</b> <b>centres,</b> detention centres and hotspots. The focus on transit points helps to understand migrants as subjects rather than objects and journeys as fractured and complex movements rather than linear routes from A to B. In addition, it sheds light on the effects of migration management policies on people on the move and puts forward a set of recommendations to EU policy-makers...|$|R
5000|$|The site {{became an}} army barracks in 1975 {{and on its}} closure in 1999 most of the housing was sold to private owners. The barracks {{buildings}} were used from 2000 to 2010 <b>as</b> an Immigration <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> by the Home Office.|$|R
50|$|In the Second World War, {{the school}} was at first used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for {{evacuees}} from London and the Medway towns; both staff and senior students helped to billet and feed the influx of children. The school was badly damaged in an air raid {{on the night of}} 1 June 1942 but continued on the Whitefriars site until it was relocated at its current site at Nackington in November 1959.|$|R
25|$|In 1934 Carclew was {{destroyed}} by fire and today just a few ruins are visible {{of what was once}} one of Cornwall's great houses. It was then owned by Captain Charles H. Tremayne, a descendant of Sir Charles Lemon. In the late 1930s though, one wing was ‘made habitable by hard work’ and brought into service <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for refugees coming from Europe. This was a project of the Society of Friends’ Peace Committee and was run by James T. Baily.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the Great Eastern Railway, the branch became part of the Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway when the various British railway {{companies}} were grouped into four large companies in 1923. The line was heavily used during World War I and World War II, with extra Air Ministry sidings provided at Dereham in 1943. In the early days of the war, Dereham was used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the construction materials used to build the local airfields.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the closure}} of Fernwood House <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre,</b> it was {{purchased}} by Greggs and used as their headquarters. The building was extensively altered to create a main entrance directly off Clayton Road, while also expanding the car park and landscaping the gardens. Prior to this change, the main entrance was located on the building close to Oakwood House and Denewood House. Several expansions took place in 1997, 2002 and in 2004. The expansions focused on {{the rear of the}} property, incorporating a stableman's cottage and taking down several outhouses. Many of the smaller buildings had stood since the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} town of Maryborough, originally and unofficially called Wide Bay Village, {{was established}} on the Mary River approximately eight kilometres upstream {{from the current}} town centre. In August or September 1847 George Furber built a wharf and store on the southern bank of what was then generally called Wide Bay River. It operated <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for squatters running sheep {{in the area and}} primarily provided transport for wool. The river was officially named Mary River on 7 September 1847 by Governor Sir Charles Fitz Roy and the first shipment of wool was dispatched from the wharf in December 1847.|$|R
50|$|Conditions at Camp Le Vernet, {{which had}} {{hitherto}} operated <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for republicans escaping from Franco following {{the defeat of}} the Second Spanish Republic, were initially less savage than those encountered in the concentration camps in Germany, but security was progressively tightened, and in 1941 the authorities prepared to separate out the many Jewish-German internees for transportation to purpose built concentration camps Germany where an uncertain fate would await them. Supported by contacts in the international writers' associations, and with help from Gilberto Bosques, the heroic Mexican consul in Marseilles, Bruno Frei succeeded in obtaining release and a passage to Mexico, travelling there via Trinidad and the USA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line was}} heavily used during World War I and World War II, with extra Air Ministry sidings {{provided}} at Dereham in 1943. [...] In {{the early days}} of the war, Dereham was used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the construction materials used to build the local airfields. In early 1944 Dereham was handling an average of 75 wagon loads of construction material per day. The line was also defended by an armoured train, reporting as Train G, based at Heacham and using F4 2-4-2 tank locomotive 7189 as motive power. The armoured train was frequently used on the Wells line, and once collided with some empty coaches at Wells.|$|R
50|$|Plans were {{formulated}} by the army, the Southend lifeboat service and various civilian services for a rescue {{attempt on the}} Monday. Great Wakering village hall and the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club at Burnham-on-Crouch were prepared <b>as</b> <b>reception</b> <b>centres,</b> and a flotilla of small boats, the lifeboat, a barge and an army DUKW amphibious truck reached the stranded people and evacuated them to the <b>reception</b> <b>centres.</b> 30 men refused to leave, because of the plight of their livestock, but 24 of them were compulsorily evacuated the following day. Two {{people died in the}} disaster. Rescue of the animals was difficult, because the road was not accessible, and all access to the island was across the sands, using the Broomway to Fisherman's Head, which was only possible at low tide. On Wednesday 4 February, a number of DUKWs and four-wheel-drive lorries reached the island with food and water for the stranded animals, which were rounded up and assembled at the churchyard, where the land is slightly higher. The following day, they were moved to Newhouse Farm, near to Fisherman's Head, ready for the arrival of 24 cattle lorries, which drove across the sands early on Friday morning. Most of the animals had been rescued by Saturday night, with the final sixteen dairy cows leaving by barge on Sunday morning. A total of 400 cattle, 14 calves, 28 horses, 72 sheep, 6 lambs, 3 pigs, 670 chickens, 100 ducks, 2 dogs, 10 rabbits, 4 budgerigars and the 16 dairy cows were rescued. Around 700 sheep and 249 pigs were drowned.|$|R
50|$|Thanbyuzayat {{became a}} {{prisoner}} of war administration headquarters and base camp in September 1942 and in January 1943 a base hospital was organised for the sick. The camp was close to a railway marshalling yard and workshops, and heavy casualties were sustained among the prisoners during Allied bombing raids in March and June 1943. The camp was then evacuated and the prisoners, including the sick, were marched to camps further along the line where camp hospitals were set up. For some time, however, Thanbyuzayat continued to be used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the groups of prisoners arriving at frequent intervals to reinforce the parties working on the line up to the Burma-Siam border.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II Kempton Park {{was closed}} for racing and used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for prisoners-of-war. The 1961 and 1962 runnings were both {{abandoned}} because of frost. It was cancelled in 1967 due to foot-and-mouth restrictions, and in 1968 because of frost. The 1970 running was abandoned because of snow. The race was abandoned in 1981 because of snow and frost. The [...] "1995" [...] race took place on 6 January 1996 at Sandown, having been postponed at Kempton due to snow and frost. It was switched to Sandown in 2005 as Kempton {{was closed for}} redevelopment. The [...] "2010" [...] race took place on 15 January 2011 after Kempton Park's 2010 Boxing Day meeting was cancelled due to snow and frost.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1848, Lord Ashley made {{a speech}} in {{parliament}} proposing funds should {{be made available to}} assist suitable boys from ragged schools to emigrate to the colonies where they could easily find employment. This suggestion was enthusiastically supported by Williams and the Homes. Twenty two scholars were selected to be in the first group that left for New South Wales. Each was given a new suit of clothes and a Bible. In 1857 ten girls were escorted to Canada- and looked after till they were settled with a job. This led to the society renting a house in Hamilton, Ontario to act <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the scholars. The society was involved with accompanied emigration until the 1920s ...|$|R
5|$|Survivors were {{initially}} received at Grayrigg Primary School, {{which had been}} opened <b>as</b> a Survivor <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre.</b> Hospitals in the area, including some over the Scottish border in Dumfries and Galloway, were put on standby, but not all received patients. According to BBC News, five passengers were admitted to Royal Preston Hospital in a critical condition. Police later released a statement revealing that one passenger, 84-year-old Margaret Masson from Glasgow, had died in hospital. Her funeral took place on 31 March 2007 at Craigton crematorium in Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the population of Mauritius are descendants of Indian indentured labourers brought in between 1834 and 1921. Initially brought to work the sugar estates following the abolition of slavery in the British Empire an estimated half a million indentured laborees were present on the island during this period. Aapravasi Ghat, in the bay at Port Louis and now a UNESCO site, was the first British colony to serve <b>as</b> a major <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for slaves and indentured servants for British plantation labour.|$|R
50|$|In July 2015 some Arab investors {{submitted}} proposals {{to convert the}} site to a leisure park. In September 2015 the main gas, electricity and water services were reconnected from the main Hardt-Rheindahlen road along Queens Avenue to the West boiler house to facilitate temporary use of the site <b>as</b> a refugee <b>reception</b> <b>centre.</b> In November 2015 the site was still a ghost town, with civilian security guards and in April 2016 {{it was revealed that}} the refugees would be accommodated in the billets area around the parade ground, off Beresford Road.|$|R
500|$|During {{the time}} he spent in Battambang for the coronation, Long {{organised}} {{the construction of a}} pagoda in the town, and in December, he unsuccessfully applied for a land concession. After the coronation, Long was taken to the That Son region in Châu Đốc, in the far south of the Mekong Delta. There the peasants built a temple for him. They used a small restaurant in a nearby village <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for the temple, as the temple was increasingly used as a military base, where fighters, weaponry and munitions were being assembled for an uprising. In the village of Tan Thanh, a local leader recruited his peasants for Long's revolt. The village chieftain predicted that a new Vietnamese monarch would descend from the sky at Cholon in March 1913, and that only the royalists would survive this miracle.|$|R
50|$|The barracks {{were built}} for local militia units between 1810 and 1815. In 1873 {{a system of}} {{recruiting}} areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the 101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers) and 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers). Following the Childers Reforms, the 101st and 104th regiments amalgamated to form the Royal Munster Fusiliers with its depot in the barracks in 1881. The Royal Munster Fusiliers were disbanded {{at the time of}} Irish Independence in 1922. The barracks were taken over by the Irish Republican Army in February 1922 and then secured by the forces of the Irish Free State in August 1922. The barracks continued to be used by the Irish Army and a newly refurbished headquarters block was opened at the barracks in April 2002. The site was also used <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for asylum seekers until the centre closed in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The base of {{the present}} Ahoy was laid in 1950. After the devastation caused by the Second World War, the city of Rotterdam had worked on {{reconstruction}} and Rotterdam port was virtually complete. To mark the occasion, the Rotterdam Ahoy! exhibition was held in a purpose-built hall on {{the site where the}} medical faculty of the Erasmus University now stands. The exhibition hall was called the Ahoy'-Hal. The apostrophe is a remnant of the original exclamation mark. The hall was used for a series of national and international events, such as the exhibition of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s work. During the North Sea flood of 1953 the hall also proved its worth <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for victims. Ahoy Rotterdam, in its current form, was built in 1970. The complex’s striking design won various national and international awards for its special steel structures. The first event to be held there was the Femina family exhibition. Since then, Ahoy has been expanded on a number of occasions, and was renovated and refurbished in 1998 to create today’s multifunctional venue.|$|R
50|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} {{the number of}} {{children}} placed at Allambie reached an all-time high. Overcrowding decreased <b>as</b> alternative <b>reception</b> and care programs were implemented by the Department. During the 1970s, changes in the structure of state-run facilities, including regionalisation of services, reduced the need for large-scale centralised <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> like Allambie. By the early 1980s, Allambie accommodated about 100 children. A review in 1985 recommended the closure of Allambie, and the redirection of funding to regional <b>reception</b> <b>centres.</b> The nursery at Allambie closed in 1986. Allambie <b>Reception</b> <b>Centre</b> closed in June 1990.|$|R
50|$|Slavery was {{abolished}} in 1835, and the planters ultimately {{received two}} million pounds sterling in {{compensation for the}} loss of their slaves who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The abolition of slavery had important impacts on Mauritius' society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of indentured labourers from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 Indian soldiers to the island. Aapravasi Ghat, in the bay at Port Louis and now a UNESCO site, was the first British colony to serve <b>as</b> a major <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for slaves and indentured servants for British plantation labour.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1952, {{parts of}} the camp were used <b>as</b> an {{emergency}} <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for refugees from communist Eastern Germany or GDR. On 1 April 1952, the Federal Ministry for Refugees established the Notaufnahmelager Sandbostel for young male refugees aged 15 to 24. In September 1952, a similar camp for women was established {{at the site of}} the POW camp at Westertimke. These two camps were under the supervision of the Durchgangslager Uelzen-Bohldamm and a committee decided on individuals' admission to Western Germany or to West-Berlin. Refugees also received help in finding jobs or apprenticeship positions. Most of the young people were in the camp for just one or two weeks. At Sandbostel, their number averaged around 800, at Westertimke around 300. Daily intake at Sandbostel was up to 100, with roughly the same number leaving each day. In total, around 250,000 young men and 80,000 young women passed through the camps. This use ended around 1960.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between two cultural memories in the postcolonial Netherlands: of World War II and of the Dutch-Indonesian war of decolonization. Through two case studies we analyse what happens when both memories encounter each other in public space. The first case concentrates on the early postwar commemoration practices centred on 4 May, the Dutch Remembrance Day of World War II. We show that the focus on heroes and national unity in the cultural memory of World War II enabled Indies veterans to articulate their own interests. The Indies veterans, on their turn, managed to change the content and ceremony of 4 May. The second case focuses on Camp Vught, a former concentration camp that was reused after the war <b>as</b> a <b>reception</b> <b>centre</b> for Moluccan soldiers of the colonial army and their families. This case illustrates that the site provided a platform for the Moluccan inhabitants to strive for recognition and speak about their history {{while at the same}} time increasing the site's silent hierarchy of suffering. We argue that there is an important resonance in the Netherlands between both cultural memories. In viewing them as part of the same memorial landscape, we state—in line with Michael Rothberg's concept of ‘multidirectional memory’—that these memories have a competitive relation as well as a strengthening impact on each other...|$|R
