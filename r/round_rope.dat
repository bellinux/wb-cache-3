6000|$|Climbing.--Climbing trees.--Colonel Jackson, in his book, 'How to Observe,' {{gives the}} {{following}} directions for climbing palms and other trees that have very rough barks:--"Take {{a strip of}} linen, or two towels or strong handkerchiefs tied together, and form a loop at each end, for the feet to pass tightly into without going through; or, for want of such material, make a rope of grass or straw in the same way. The length should embrace {{a little more than}} half of the diameter of the trunk to be climbed. Now, being at the foot of the tree, fix the feet well into the loops, and opening the legs a little, embrace the tree as high up as you can. Raise your legs, and pressing the cord against the tree with your feet, stand, as it were, in your stirrups, and raise your body and arms higher; hold fast again by the arms, open the legs, and raise them a stage higher, and so on to the top. The descent is effected in the same way, reversing, of course, the order of the movements. The ruggedness of the bark, and the weight of the body pressing diagonally across the trunk of the tree, prevent the rope from slipping. Anything, provided it be strong enough, is better than a <b>round</b> <b>rope,</b> which does not hold so fast." [...] A loop or hoop embracing the body of the climber and the tree, is a helpful addition. Large nails carried in a bag slung round the waist, to be driven into the bare trunk of the tree, will facilitate its ascent. Gimlets may be used for the same purpose. High walls can be climbed by help of this description; a weight attached to one end of a rope, being first thrown over the wall, and the climber assisting himself by holding on to the other end. Trees of soft wood are climbed by cutting notches two feet apart on alternate sides. Also by driving in bamboo pegs, sloping alternately to left or to right; these pegs correspond to the [...] "rungs" [...] of a ladder.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crossing}} of strands is important {{when dealing with}} <b>round</b> <b>rope</b> in other knots; for example, the figure-eight loop loses strength when strands are crossed while the knot is being [...] "finished" [...] and tightened. Moreover, the standing end or the end from which the hauling will be done must have the greater radius of curvature in the finished knot to maximize {{the strength of the}} knot.|$|E
50|$|Halters may be {{classified}} into two broad categories, {{depending on whether}} the material used is flat or round. Materials include cured leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Leather and rawhide may be flat or rolled. Fibers may be woven into flat webbing or twisted into <b>round</b> <b>rope.</b> Flat or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles or rings at attachment points; round materials are knotted or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1994 King of Pancrase tournament, {{the rules}} were {{slightly}} different, in that the first round had one 10-minute <b>round</b> and three <b>rope</b> escapes, and the finals had one 20 minute <b>round</b> with three <b>rope</b> escapes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] was {{answered}} in that prompt {{tone of voice}} which indicates thorough discipline and unquestioning obedience, while the men scrambled up the fore-hatch, and sprang up the ratlines hand over hand. A moment before, the vessel had lain quietly on the bosom of the unruffled deep, {{as if she were}} asleep, now she was all uproar and apparent confusion; sails slewed <b>round,</b> <b>ropes</b> rattled, and blocks creaked, while the sonorous voice of the first mate sounded commands like a trumpet from the quarter-deck.|$|R

60|$|No sooner was the spar {{alongside}} than {{a couple}} of sailors lowered themselves down and passed <b>ropes</b> <b>round</b> it. These <b>ropes</b> were then passed through blocks and taken to the capstan. The bars were fitted and seized by a dozen men. The boatswain's whistle sounded, and starting their anchor song the men tramped round and <b>round,</b> the <b>ropes</b> tightened, and the heavy spar was parbuckled up on to the deck. No sooner was it got on board than the four chiefs who had before visited the ship came alongside. There was another talk, and they were presented with a considerable number of presents for themselves and followers as a reward for their service in sending off the spar. Mr. Atherton and Wilfrid did not approach the group of passengers round the chiefs, keeping their attention vigilantly upon the boats, from which the danger, if it existed, would come.|$|R
60|$|Dschemil {{put them}} {{carefully}} in his pocket, and tied the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> her, {{and let her}} down over the wall.|$|R
60|$|Going {{down the}} path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those {{manholes}} like a bloody gaspipe {{and there was the}} poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> him. And be damned but he got the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> the poor devil and the two were hauled up.|$|R

50|$|A turn is one <b>round</b> of <b>rope</b> on a pin or cleat, or {{one round}} of a coil. Turns can be made around various objects, through rings, or around the {{standing}} part of the rope itself or another rope. A turn also denotes a component of a knot.|$|R
60|$|The {{instant the}} strain was off, {{he passed a}} <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> his waist and gave {{the end of it}} to the sailor.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{opened the}} front of his garment, and showed the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> his body. Captain Holland gave a low whistle of dismay.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is {{a matter}} which you can't speak to, John Bumpus, seeing that you've never gone beyond the putting of the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> your neck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ben Robinson and I. I {{had often}} been there, after sea anemones and weeds, and I had a <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> me, so don't be angry, Markham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Half-hanged, indeed," [...] said Bumpus, indignantly. [...] "I {{was more}} than half--three-quarters at least. Why, the worst of it's over w'en the <b>rope's</b> <b>round</b> your neck." ...|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{went down}} Bedford row, {{the handle of}} the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood <b>round</b> the <b>roped</b> prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths {{proposed}} gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was, {{like the}} rest of these desolate isles, all of dark whinstone, cracked in every direction, and worn with the action of winds, waves, and tempests since the world began. Over the greater part of it was not a blade of grass, nor a grain of earth; it was bare and iron-like stone, crusted, round all the coast as far as high-water mark, with limpet and still smaller shells. We ascended {{wrinkled}} hills of black stone, and descended into worn and dismal dells of the same; into some of which, where the tide got entrance, it came pouring and roaring in raging whiteness, and churning the loose fragments of whinstone into round pebbles, and piling them up in deep crevices with seaweeds, like great <b>round</b> <b>ropes</b> and heaps of fucus. Over our heads screamed hundreds of hovering birds, the gull mingling its hideous laughter most wildly." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{his feet}} they dragged {{him to the}} horse, {{and the end of}} the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> his ankles they tied to the horse's tail and about the rider's waist.|$|R
50|$|The Scout emblem {{incorporates}} the tricolor blue-red-green {{colors of the}} flag of Azerbaijan with two five edged stars <b>rounded</b> by <b>rope</b> and tied in a reef knot at the bottom. The Scout uniform consists of a khaki-colored shirt with shoulder straps, with adjustable sleeves, khaki-colored trousers or shorts, with a brown belt, and a tricolor blue-red-green neckerchief with a white border edge.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{this idea}} had been {{suggested}} by the <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> Stanley's waist, the cut end of which still dangled at his side, for Mr Durant took hold of it inquiringly.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you hadn't said it, I {{would have}} had some hope that the end was come!" [...] said Molloy, as they put a <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> his neck and led him away.|$|R
60|$|When Gordon and McCubine were {{standing}} under the fatal tree with the <b>ropes</b> <b>round</b> their necks, a sorrowing acquaintance asked the latter {{if he had}} any word to send to his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "If they're {{as good as}} {{they look}} we're lucky," [...] said Wade, as he tied the ends of his <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> their necks. [...] "Now are there any more you know are good?" ...|$|R
60|$|The cry {{was heard}} by Guy Foster, who, with a <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> his waist, {{had been for}} the last half-hour engaged in rescuing men and women from the fatal grasp of these {{retiring}} waves.|$|R
60|$|Charlie's sailor {{experience}} was very useful; and he shouted advice to Lance, who was tying the extemporary <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> Gertrude, not very easily, {{owing to the}} material, and to its being done under water.|$|R
50|$|The twine {{is first}} {{threaded}} diagonally through the rope. The twine is then wrapped <b>round</b> the <b>rope</b> including the diagonally threaded end. A needle is {{then used to}} thread the two ends through the rope to enclose the wrapping turns. Finally a reef (square) or a string of reef (square) knots is tied. Then this string of reef (square) knots is pulled through the rope to bury the ends.|$|R
60|$|ELDER DANIELS. Oh, Blanco, Blanco: spiritual pride {{has been}} your ruin. If youd only done like me, youd {{be a free}} and respectable man this day instead of laying there with a <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> your neck.|$|R
60|$|At {{intervals}} <b>round</b> the <b>ropes</b> Old Austinian {{number one}} was meeting Old Austinian number two (whom he emphatically detested, and {{had hoped to}} avoid), and was conversing {{with him in a}} nervous manner, the clearness of his replies being greatly handicapped by a feeling, which grew with the minutes, that he {{would never be able to}} get rid of him and go in search of Old Austinian number three, his bosom friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be over careful with them," [...] he said. [...] "Throw a picket <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> their necks, and make them trot beside you. They came out for a little excitement, let them have enough of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear. He'll knock {{us about}} a bit, but he don't want a <b>rope</b> <b>round</b> his neck, you be sure. And he ain't so bad neither, when he's not in the drink. He's sorry he hit me now." ...|$|R
