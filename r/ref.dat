5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink the Clown {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged <b>ref</b> bump, a second Doink the Clown (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|One cageside judge scored it a 10–8 {{round as}} Silva was {{credited}} with zero strikes. Sonnen connected with 76 strikes from the top position in the opening round, and held a 22-to-15 edge in significant strikes against Silva. However, Sonnen was unable to inflict substantial damage to the champion, and as the fight resumed Silva was repeatedly admonished by the <b>ref</b> for holding Chael's shorts. Being unable to score a takedown due to Silva's constant violations of the ref's commands, Sonnen failed to connect with a high-risk spinning backfist strike, leaving Sonnen in a scooting position for Silva to land a knee to the chest, then with punches to stop Sonnen with a TKO at 1:55 of the second round.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPurposeTo review recent {{original}} research publications {{related to}} imaging of osteoarthritis (OA) and identify emerging trends and significant advances. MethodsRelevant articles were identified through {{a search of}} the PubMed database using the query terms “OA” in combination with “imaging”, “radiography”, “MRI”, “ultrasound”, “computed tomography”, and “nuclear medicine”; either published or in press between March 2012 and March 2013. Abstracts were reviewed to exclude review articles, case reports, and studies not focused on imaging using routine clinical imaging measures. ResultsInitial query yielded 932 references, which were reduced to 328 citations following the initial review. MRI (118 references) and radiography (129 <b>refs)</b> remain the primary imaging modalities in OA studies, with fewer reports using computed tomography (CT) (35 <b>refs)</b> and ultrasound (23 <b>refs).</b> MRI parametric mapping techniques remain an active research area (33 <b>refs)</b> with growth in T 2 *- and T 1 -rho mapping publications compared to prior years. Although the knee is the major joint studied (210 <b>refs)</b> there is interest in the hip (106 <b>refs)</b> and hand (29 <b>refs).</b> Imaging continues to focus on evaluation of cartilage (173 <b>refs)</b> and bone (119 <b>refs).</b> ConclusionImaging {{plays a major role in}} OA research with publications continuing along traditional lines of investigation. Translational and clinical research application of compositional MRI techniques is becoming more common driven in part by the availability of T 2 mapping data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). New imaging techniques continue to be developed with a goal of identifying methods with greater specificity and responsiveness to changes in the joint, and novel functional neuroimaging techniques to study central pain. Publications related to imaging of OA continue to be heavily focused on quantitative and semiquantitative MRI evaluation of the knee with increasing application of compositional MRI techniques in the hip...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts (<b>REFs)</b> by transfected ras and myc oncogenes were explored. Under conditions of dense monolayer culture, neither oncogene {{was able to}} transform <b>REFs</b> on its own. However, {{the introduction of a}} ras oncogene together with a selectable neomycin resistance marker into <b>REFs</b> allowed killing of the normal nontransfected cells and the outgrowth of colonies of ras transformants, 10 % of which survived crisis and became tumorigenic. These cells expressed greater than 10 -fold-higher levels of ras p 21 than tumorigenic cells cotransfected with ras and myc oncogenes. The myc oncogene similarly was unable to induce tumorigenic conversion of <b>REFs</b> unless especially refractile colonies of oncogene-bearing cells, produced by use of a cotransfected selectable marker, were picked and subcultured. Tumorigenic conversion of <b>REFs</b> by single transfected oncogenes appears to require special culture conditions and high levels of gene expression...|$|R

40|$|A small {{breaking}} of R-parity reconciles thermal leptogenesis, gravitino dark matter and primordial nucleosynthesis. We {{find that the}} same breaking relaxes cosmological bounds on the axion multiplet. Naturally expected spectra become allowed and bounds from late particle decays become so weak that they are superseded by bounds from non-thermal axion production. In this sense, the strong CP problem serves as an additional motivation for broken R-parity.
