5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its <b>regulatory</b> <b>environment,</b> but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

40|$|Affordability {{continues}} to be a major challenge for housing in America. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University (JCHS), in 2006, 57 million households were moderately and severely cost burdened in America. Although high housing prices and the lack of real income growth are cited as the main factors behind the housing affordability problem, it has been proven that land use regulations have some responsibility in this matter as well. Data from the JCHS suggests that between 2002 and 2005, the average appreciation percentage in housing prices was greater in most stringent <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> when compared to less restrictive environments. Despite this fact, and compared to analyses performed in other states, the relationship between the stringency of local land use <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> and housing has not been fully addressed in Texas. The methodological approach used to characterize this relationship has been by means of the creation of a composite index measuring the stringency of local <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments.</b> In response to this lack of evidence of the characteristics of local land use <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> in Texas, this research created the first city-level index characterizing local <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> for housing markets in the Houston-Galveston Area. The index was created taking into account both the different and the most recent practices for the creation of indices. The index created proved to be a valid and reliable measure capable of taking into account the different aspects of the relationship between land use regulations and housing markets. Correlation procedures allowed the detection of a significant relationship between the stringency of local land use <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> and local traits such as median family income, race distribution, poverty, and median housing values. After alternative indices were developed for a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, the index proved to be a statistically robust measure against modifications on the different assumptions used for its creation. Further research could use this new composite index in empirical analysis to look at the statistical effect of <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> on variables such as housing values and rent prices...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} effect of {{different}} design features of deposit insurance, on long-run financial development, defined to include the level of financial activity, the stability of the banking sector, and the quality of resource allocation. Their empirical analysis is guided by recent theories of banking regulation, that employ an agency framework. The authors examine {{the effect of}} deposit insurance on the size, and volatility of the financial sector, in a sample of fifty eight countries. They find that generous deposit insurance, leads to financial instability in lax <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments.</b> But in sound <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments,</b> deposit insurance does have the desired impact on financial development, and growth. Thus, countries introducing a deposit insurance scheme, need to ensure that it is accompanied by a sound regulatory framework. Otherwise, the scheme will likely lead to instability, and deter financial development. In weak <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments,</b> policymakers should at least limit deposit insurance coverage.

25|$|In {{addition}} to changing regulations, {{changes in the}} industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC.

While banks struggle {{to keep up with}} the changes in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>environment,</b> regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks.

40|$|In {{the postwar}} period, systems of {{corporate}} finance and governance {{have emerged in}} the United States, Japan, and Germany that are dramatically different from one another. To date, {{there has been little}} focus on why. Stephen Prowse argues that differences in three aspects of the legal and <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> in these countries are responsible. First, the severity of legal and regulatory restraints on financial institutions being "active" investors in firms. Second, the degree to which corporate securities markets are suppressed by regulation. Finally, the degree to which securities markets are "passively" suppressed by the absence of mandated disclosure requirements.; Prowse compares the merits of each system and argues that the U. S. system may be more favorable to the growth of high-technology firms. He discusses the future evolution of each system. The German and Japanese <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> are changing rapidly to increase the role of securities markets in corporate finance. The U. S. environment is also changing to give financial institutions more latitude to be active investors in firms. Over the long term, the <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> of all three countries appear to be converging. The focal point of this convergence is an entirely new environment in which financial institutions are free to be active investors and corporate securities markets are unhindered by regulatory obstacles.
