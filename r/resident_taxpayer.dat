50|$|Under United States tax law, a {{personal}} exemption is an amount that a <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{is entitled to}} claim as a tax deduction against personal income in calculating taxable income and consequently federal income tax. It {{has the effect of}} reducing income tax payable, even to tax-free level, but not so as to result in a tax refund. In 2015 the personal exemption amount was US $4,000. The exemption for 2016 is $4,050, though the actual tax benefit depends on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. The personal exemption amount is adjusted each year for inflation.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} whether a dual <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{is entitled to}} tax treaties concluded by each residence state with a third state has been controversial. Since 2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Commentary on Article 4 (1) of the OECD Model states that such a taxpayer would be entitled to only the tax treaty network of residence state {{as determined by the}} tiebreaker rule of the tax treaty between the two residence states.

40|$|Most states {{within the}} EU {{have some kind}} of CFC-legislation that allows the state in {{question}} to tax its residents for gains accrued within foreign companies that they control. CFC-legislations are usually said to counteract tax avoidance and they generally target only income of companies in low tax regimes. Such tax regimes are however not only found in pure tax havens. Some of the member states of the EU have set up preferential tax regimes, often limited to foreign financial offshore activities. Can it be a restriction of the freedom of establishment in article 43 EC to tax a <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayer</b> on CFC-basis for the income of a company resident in another member state? In the affirmative, can such a restriction be justified and if so, on which ground? Can it perhaps be easier to argue in favour of CFC-rules after the recent judgment of Marks and Spencer where the ECJ seems to have applied a broader ground of justification in respect of the counteraction of tax avoidance? These are some of the main questions dealt with in this thesis...|$|E

FATCA also affects non-U.S.-person family members and business partners who share accounts with U.S. persons or who have U.S.-person signatories of accounts.

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in {{immigration}} rules and globalisation, most developed countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America are becoming more multi-cultural. The consequence of multiculturalism challenges the present assumption of culturally homogeneous <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayers.</b> With this, it warrants a re-examination of existing tax policies and tax administration which previously had not accounted for culturally diverse populations. With sparse research on tax compliance and multiculturalism, {{there is much to}} be gained from an in-depth qualitative study on actual ethnic taxpayers’ compliance behaviours. This study examines the tax compliance practices and perceptions and the cultural values of the four largest ethnic business groups in a developed nation, New Zealand, using Hofstede’s (1980, 2001) framework. It has been found that ethnic taxpayers do undertake varied tax compliance practices of which some have cultural underpinnings...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{understatement}} {{to say that the}} appropriate taxation of foreign business income is a controversial and potentially confusing topic. One of the mysteries of international taxation has been that the prescriptions of what, until recently, was the accepted academic wisdom differs so sharply from widespread international practice. In an important contribution, Richman (1963) noted that a home government confronted with the choice of where it would prefer one of its <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> to allocate a single unit of capital would weigh the after-foreign-tax return from investing abroad against the pre-tax return from investing at home. From this observation, she concluded that countries maximize their own welfare by subjecting foreign income to full current domestic taxation, permitting only a deduction for foreign tax payments. This analysis further implies that a policy of taxing foreign income while granting credits for foreign income tax payments maximizes world welfare...|$|R

40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{significant}} changes to Australia’s tax rules were those proposed {{by the government in}} this year’s budget as part of its response to the Global Financial crisis. Among the announced changes, superannuation contribution concessions have been halved, there are to be new private health insurance tiers, the s 26 AG exemption for <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> will be limited to aid workers and some government employees, the thin capitalisation rules are to change, the government proposes to improve the tax treatment of off-market share buy-backs, the foreign source income attribution regime is to be reformed, and the R&D concession is {{to be replaced by a}} new R&D credit. The Courts and the ATO have also been active and there have been a number of new cases and new and revised rulings – all of which have impacted on the law in varying degrees.

40|$|As of 1 January 2012, the Dutch {{corporate}} {{income tax}} (‘CIT’) system provides for international juridical double tax relief (‘DTR’) under a mechanism referred to in Dutch tax practice as the ‘base exemption for foreign business profits’ 1 (author’s translation). 2 The newly introduced DTR mechanism replaces the Dutch-style ‘tax exemption with progression method’ 3 {{in the area of}} corporate taxation regarding proceeds derived from foreign-source business activities. The rationale for this legislative shift, according to the Dutch tax legislator, is to arrive at an augmented level of converged tax treatment for corporate taxpayers carrying on business operations abroad either directly (i. e., through a permanent establishment; ‘PE’) or indirectly (i. e., through a subsidiary). 4 One of the introduced tax effects is that current losses suffered by <b>resident</b> corporate <b>taxpayers</b> from business activities carried on abroad through a PE are no longer taken into account for CIT calculation purposes. The tax legislator implicitly justifies its amendments by labeling the immediate horizontal cross-border loss set-off possibilities as available under the former DTR mechanism as a “cash flow advantage” granted to Dutch <b>resident</b> corporate <b>taxpayers.</b> That characterization reveals an underlying normative consideration. We do away with an ‘advantage’ to arrive at a taxing system devoid of anomalies at this point. The Dutch tax legislator suggests an improvement. But has he not in fact created a disadvantage? And, by doing that infringes upon the spirit of the internal market within the European Union (‘EU’) in the process...|$|R

5000|$|On {{election}} to office {{prior to the}} Global Financial Crisis, the Rudd Government announced a five-point plan to combat inflation. The first budget of the Rudd government was delivered by Treasurer Wayne Swan in May 2008 and a projected surplus of $21.7 billion was announced. In line with Rudd's explanation of his economic philosophy on taking office, his government intervened early as the global recession began to take hold by guaranteeing bank deposits and announcing two stimulatory spending packages. The first was worth $10.4 billion and announced in late 2008, and included measures such as lump sum payments for low to middle income earners, increasing the first homebuyers' bonus, doubling training places and fast-tracking a national infrastructure program. The second, worth $42 billion, was announced in February 2009 and included $900 cash payments to <b>resident</b> <b>taxpayers</b> who paid net tax in the 2007-08 financial year. Stating that his Government would [...] "move heaven and earth to reduce {{the impact of the}} global recession", Rudd delivered a spending program for infrastructure, schools and housing worth $28.8 billion as part of this package. After initially raising interest rates to combat inflation, The Reserve Bank cut official interest rates several times in increments of up to 1 percent, and fell to 3 percent in May 2009, the lowest since 1960. The second budget, released in May 2009, projected a $57.6 billion deficit for 2009-10. The majority of the deficit was created by a loss of taxation revenue {{as a result of the}} recession, with the rest made up in stimulus and other spending. The downturn was expected to remove $210 billion in taxation revenue from the budget over the next four years.|$|R
