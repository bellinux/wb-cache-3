5|$|The Finnish Red Guards {{seized the}} early {{initiative}} in the war, {{taking control of}} Helsinki on 28 January, and with a general attack phase lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalize on their initial momentum, {{and most of the}} offensives came to nothing. The military order chain functioned <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> at Red company and platoon level, but leadership and authority were weak, as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troopers. The common troopers were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|The November preview episode {{received}} 275,000 {{viewers and}} a 0.07 18–49 rating. The actual series premiere saw a sizeable {{rise in the}} ratings, with the 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. EST episodes performing <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> by GSN's standards, earning 421,000 and 451,000 viewers respectively. On February 23, 2017, the show hit a series high with 500,000 viewers and a 0.13 18–49 rating.|$|E

5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} {{from the latest}} Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is most likely a mature titanosaurian since {{the bones of the}} braincase have largely fused together.|$|E
5|$|Although {{situated}} in an unpopulated area, Wotton station was <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any {{station on the}} line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although the lines were not connected, a station (also named Wotton) {{was built on the}} new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a stationmaster.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the tour was over, St Hill had signed a {{contract}} to play professional cricket in the Lancashire League in England for Lowerhouse Cricket Club. Playing as an all-rounder, he performed <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> with bat and ball for three seasons from 1931 to 1933. He then played as a professional in several leagues, including the Huddersfield and Bradford leagues. During the Second World War, he joined the British Army and {{took part in the}} Dunkirk evacuation before returning to England; he resumed his league career and played many wartime charity games. He died in Manchester, aged 53.|$|E

50|$|Wooden objects {{have survived}} <b>relatively</b> less <b>well</b> {{than those of}} metal or stone, and their study by archaeologists and historians has been {{somewhat}} neglected until recently. Their strongly functional and undecorated forms have, however, been highly regarded by designers and collectors.|$|R

5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the {{oncoming}} Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He performed <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied <b>relatively</b> <b>well,</b> {{primarily}} by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E
5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
40|$|Transmigration {{of teeth}} is a <b>relatively</b> less <b>well</b> known phenomenon. Its {{etiology}} {{is not so}} well understood.

40|$|But it is {{not only}} palmitate itself, which can cause such an inhibition, but also {{metabolites}} built from palmitate like ceramide, a sphingolipid, which can also inhibit Akt activation. But also sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), a <b>relatively</b> less <b>well</b> researched sphingolipid, can negatively influence the insulin signaling pathway in many cell lines.|$|R
50|$|While {{positive}} in itself, {{the result was}} that local environmental services were <b>relatively</b> less <b>well</b> resourced, {{despite the fact that they}} are key determinants of public satisfaction with local government. The result was that councils were seen to be improving rapidly by Whitehall, but not by the public, whose satisfaction with local government declined.|$|R
5|$|In the {{transfer}} window, Arsenal purchased several players, including midfielders Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit and goalkeeper Alex Manninger; English midfielder Paul Merson departed to join Middlesbrough. Arsenal began the league season <b>relatively</b> <b>well,</b> but {{a run of}} three defeats in four matches between November and December 1997 left the team in sixth position before Christmas, and seemingly out of championship contention. Although they were 12 points behind reigning champions Manchester United {{at the end of}} February, a winning streak of nine matches ensured Arsenal won the championship with a 4–0 win over Everton on 3 May 1998.|$|E
5|$|Its {{location}} on a strategic transport crossroad in Podolia made the castle a prime target for foreign invaders, who rebuilt the castle {{to suit their}} own needs, adding to its multicultural architectural diversity. Specifically, the complex consists of the Old Town fortified by King Casimir IV, the Old Castle rebuilt by Kings Sigismund I and Stephen Báthory, and the New Castle founded by Kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV. However, {{in spite of the}} many architectural and engineering changes to the original structure, the castle still forms a coherent architectural design, being one of the few medieval constructions in Ukraine that is <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> preserved.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's {{economy is}} <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> diversified. Trade and finance {{combined}} {{account for nearly}} one-third of GDP; transportation and communication, public utilities, and construction account for one-fifth, and mining and manufacturing constitute nearly another fifth. Despite plans to expand the private sector, the state remains the dominant force in Jordan's economy. Net official development assistance to Jordan in 2009 totalled USD 761 million; according to the government, approximately two-thirds of this was allocated as grants, of which half was direct budget support.|$|E

5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (<b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|No ancient {{biographies of}} Theramenes are known, but {{his life and}} actions are <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> documented, due to the {{extensive}} treatment given him in several surviving works. The Attic orator Lysias deals with him at length in several of his speeches, albeit in a very hostile manner. Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories: Thucydides' account includes the beginnings of Theramenes' career, and Xenophon, picking up where Thucydides left off, gives {{a detailed account of}} several episodes from Theramenes career; Diodorus Siculus, probably drawing his account from Ephorus at most points, provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon's at several points. Theramenes also appears in several other sources, which, although they do not provide as many narrative details, have been used to illuminate the political disputes which surrounded Theramenes' life and memory.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{once again}} {{put up the}} only points for the offense in another humiliating blowout, this time a 45-14 loss to the Detroit Lions. Sanchez played <b>relatively</b> <b>well,</b> {{avoiding}} a 3-and-out on the first drive with a 5-yard scramble and managing {{to tie the game}} 7-7 with a touchdown pass to Brent Celek, but a defensive meltdown and lack of offensive momentum left the Eagles hopeless, and Sanchez finished his Eagles record with an 0-2 record as starter. Sanchez finished 19/27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, which translated into a passer rating of 116.1.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E
5|$|Each {{game has}} sold <b>relatively</b> <b>well</b> in its home market. The {{original}} game was a commercial success, selling over 120,000 {{units in the}} first week of release and eventually selling over 240,000 copies in Japan. Drakengard 2s first-week sales were similarly impressive, selling 100,000 units. It sold over 203,000 copies by the end of 2005. Drakengard 3 sold just over 15,000 units in its first week, and over 150,000 units by May 2014. The two versions of Nier—Gestalt and Replicant—sold roughly 12,500 and 60,000 copies in their first week respectively. Replicant eventually sold over 121,000 in Japan by the end of May 2010. The series has sold over 770,000 units in Japan as of May 2014. Sales figures for western regions are unavailable. The first two games in the main series have both been included in Square Enix's Ultimate Hits series, re-releases of popular titles developed or published by them.|$|E

2500|$|The console {{version of}} Saints Row 2 {{garnered}} generally positive reviews. The PC version was <b>relatively</b> less <b>well</b> received due to frame rate issues and visual pop-in. 1UP.com gave the game a B, stating that it [...] "relishes the hedonistic {{aspects of the}} open-world genre", that it has [...] "plenty of innovation" [...] and that the [...] "excellence in the presentation makes the world of Saints [...] 2 a great introduction for newcomers to open world games".|$|R
