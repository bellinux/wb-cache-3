Preceding calculations in chiral effective field theories only employed pion and nucleon degrees of freedom and {{were not able to}} reproduce the photon spectrum in the pioneering experiment of <b>radiative</b> muon <b>capture</b> on the proton from TRIUMF. For the past few years it has been speculated that the discrepancy between theory and experiment might be due to Delta(1232) related effects, which are only included via higher order contact interactions in the standard chiral approach. In this report we demonstrate that this speculation does not hold true. We show that contrary to expectations from naive dimensional analysis isobar effects on the photon spectrum and the total rate in <b>radiative</b> muon <b>capture</b> are of the order of a few percent, consistent with earlier findings in a more phenomenological approach. We further demonstrate that both ordinary and <b>radiative</b> muon <b>capture</b> constitute systems with a very well behaved chiral expansion, both in standard chiral perturbation theory and in the small scale expansion, and present some new ideas that might be {{at the bottom of the}} still unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment in <b>radiative</b> muon <b>capture.</b> Finally we comment upon the procedure employed by the TRIUMF group to extract new information from their <b>radiative</b> muon <b>capture</b> experiment on the pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon.

However, U-233, which is fissile, will be present in the UNF.

50|$|Free final state {{neutrons}} {{are captured}} in the gadolinium-doped water of the detector.

In order to enhance visibility of neutron capture events, Gadolinium salts are dissolved into ANNIE’s aqueous media. Gadolinium has a larger capture cross-section, around 49,000 barns, and this occurs on the orders of microseconds after the free neutron is emitted. Additionally, the capture event in gadolinium produces an 8 MeV cascade of 2- 3 gammas.|$|E

The excitation of multiple dipole resonances were verified in experiments at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Germany.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{indirect}} method, which can provide a powerful technique to obtain information about <b>radiative</b> <b>capture</b> reactions at astrophysically relevant energies. The idea of the indirect method {{is to use the}} indirect reaction A(a, s γ) F to obtain information about the <b>radiative</b> <b>capture</b> reaction A(x, γ) F, where a=(s x) and F=(x A). The main advantage of using the indirect reactions is the absence of the penetrability factor in the channel x+A, which suppresses the low-energy cross sections of the A(x, γ) F reactions and does not allow to measure these reactions at astrophysical energies. A general formalism to treat indirect resonant <b>radiative</b> <b>capture</b> reactions is developed when only a few intermediate states do contribute and statistical approach cannot be applied. Angular dependence of the triple differential cross section at fixed scattering angle of the spectator s is the angular γ-s correlation function. Using indirect resonant <b>radiative</b> <b>capture</b> reactions one can obtain the information about important astrophysical resonant <b>radiative</b> <b>capture</b> reactions, like (p, γ), (α, γ) and (n, γ) on stable and unstable isotopes.
