5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in <b>road</b> <b>making</b> and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the <b>road,</b> <b>making</b> it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop {{as a number of}} {{abandoned}} cars litter the <b>road,</b> <b>making</b> it impossible to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars {{out of the way and}} scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E

5|$|NY128 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 (ArmonkBedford Road), an arterial boulevard, in the hamlet of Armonk (within {{the town of}} North Castle). NY128 proceeds north on Main Street, a two-lane commercial street, intersecting with an old alignment of NY22, entering the town center for North Castle, where it maintains the commercial backdrop through town. Passing west of Wampus Brook Park, NY128 intersects with Old Mount Kisco Road, an old alignment as it leaves the town center. NY128 soon parallels the park and Wampus Brook on its way north, maintaining the Main Street moniker until an intersection with Old Mount Kisco Road. At that junction, the route becomes ArmonkMount Kisco <b>Road,</b> <b>making</b> a large bend westward near Al Ehrmann Park.|$|E
5|$|The former South {{station was}} near the A322 <b>road</b> <b>making</b> {{it one of the}} most easily {{accessed}} parts of the cemetery once the railway had closed, and the land surrounding it was now redundant. As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused Anglican chapel of 1854 into a crematorium, using a newer chapel built by Cyril Tubbs in 1908–09 for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations. Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by the hostile takeover bid, the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Ace Cafe {{was based}} on the North Circular Road. Open 24 hours a day, it catered for late-night party-goers and boy racers. It was a popular place for cars to be hot-wired and stolen, as drivers knew they could make a quick getaway. Regus founder Mark Dixon's first business on returning to Britain after an extended time aboard was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular <b>Road,</b> <b>making</b> his own buns. He grew the business into a full-time bakery which he sold in 1989 for £800,000 (now £).|$|E

5|$|When Parliament {{convened in}} January, the Liberals {{introduced}} no major proposals, and proposed nothing controversial. Diefenbaker turned over his parliamentary duties to British Columbia MP Howard Green and {{spent much of}} his time on the <b>road</b> <b>making</b> speeches across the country. Diefenbaker toured a nation in which Liberal support at the provincial level had slowly been eroding. When the Liberals gained Federal power in 1935, they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments, all except Alberta. By early 1957, the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province, Newfoundland, and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the <b>road,</b> <b>making</b> it impossible for larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage {{and had to be}} evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Buckingham built a short horse-drawn tramway to {{transport}} goods between his estates at Wotton and a terminus {{adjacent to the}} station. He extended it soon afterwards to provide a passenger service {{to the town of}} Brill, and the tramway was converted to locomotive operation, known as the Brill Tramway. All goods to and from the Brill Tramway passed through Quainton <b>Road,</b> <b>making</b> it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation, and traffic increased further when construction began on Ferdinand de Rothschild's mansion of Waddesdon Manor. The plan of extending the Brill Tramway to Oxford, which would have made Quainton Road a major junction station, was abandoned. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the Brill Tramway were absorbed by London's Metropolitan Railway (MR), which already operated the line from Aylesbury to London. The MR rebuilt Quainton Road and re-sited it to a more convenient location, allowing through running between the Brill Tramway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. When the Great Central Railway (GCR) from the north of England opened, Quainton Road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met, and by far the busiest of the MR's rural stations.|$|E

25|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of a rotating frame, moving with the car, there is a fictitious centrifugal force that tends to push the car toward {{the outside of the}} road (and to push the occupants toward the outside of the car). The centrifugal force balances the friction between wheels and <b>road,</b> <b>making</b> the car stationary in this non-inertial frame.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a {{road was}} built between El Llano de Huaxquilico to San Pedro Escanela, {{but it is}} {{controversial}} because of environmental concerns. Its building caused severe ecological damage in an area considered {{to be one of}} the most sensitive in the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, as it is where most of the local aquifers recharge. The area receives a large amount of rain, which has led to damage and mudslides affecting the <b>road,</b> <b>making</b> it almost impossible for more than one car to pass at a time.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to nearby {{areas of the}} Chilterns more land is given over to open space, namely agricultural, both arable and pasture; paddocks; heathland and most significantly the Common {{on either side of}} which the majority of houses are arranged. Mature woodland is a feature, including a stand of beech trees which mark out the circumference of the hillfort. Some beech plantation remains formerly associated with the chair-making industry in High Wycombe. Both chalk and a small amount of clay have been extracted over the years. The latter as a raw material for pottery and more recently brick-making. Meanwhile, in more recent times flint was dug out for <b>road</b> <b>making.</b> Both activities have left their mark in the form of small mounds and shallow depressions.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} direct routes {{begin at}} either end of the Walna Scar <b>Road,</b> <b>making</b> for the summit from the top of the pass. Ascents can be made from Seathwaite Tarn (pathless) or to the north of Goat's Hawse, but these give no clue to the grandeur of the crag on the eastern side of the ridge. For this the walker will leave the Walna Scar Road at The Cove, or climb to this point from Torver. From here Goat's Water is the next objective for a stunning view of Dow Crag. Two choices now present themselves- easy via Goat's Hause, or steep via the South Rake (see below). Many walkers will also reach the fell using the good paths from The Old Man of Coniston and Brim Fell.|$|E
25|$|When the MD 4 freeway was {{completed}} through Melwood in 1964, MD 223 was extended north along Melwood Road, which was reconstructed as a divided highway, to its present terminus. The highway was expanded to a divided highway {{on either side}} of MD 5 in 1989. MD 223's single-point urban interchange with MD 5 was constructed in 1992. Piscataway Road was extended south from Floral Park Road to Livingston Road as a county highway in 2007. In 2011, a barrier was constructed at the western end of MD 223 at Livingston <b>Road,</b> <b>making</b> Floral Park Road a dead end; through traffic now uses the county-maintained portion of Piscataway Road to reach Livingston Road. MD 223 was relocated at its intersection with Rosaryville Road in 2012; this work included a new bridge across the upper reaches of Pisacataway Creek.|$|E

25|$|It {{crosses to}} Meycauayan River {{and after a}} few meters is the Meycauayan Exit to serve its town proper. Another service road named St. Francis Service Road that is located beside the expressway's {{southbound}} lane. It passes through residential areas and institutions within the municipality, intersects with Lias Road, and continues straightforward. On Marilao, there is a Petron service area and after it are the Marilao River and its exit. It enters Bocaue after Marilao Exit and intersects with Duhat Overpass. This is where the Hermosa-Balintawak line connects with Meralco Duhat substation to make a cut-in connection with it thus NGCP calls the power line as Balintawak-Duhat and Duhat-Hermosa transmission lines as well as separating it into two individual lines. Another Meralco subtransmission line enters the expressway and adjacent to the said substation is a plant of Atlas Feeds. The Philippine Arena can be seen on this segment. The road turns eastward to serve Bocaue toll plaza, with a southbound lane being widened to 22 lanes with 4 from a service <b>road</b> <b>making</b> a grand total of 26 lanes, and on the middle of it is a newly built toll plaza and road. It turns westward, passes through Bocaue Exit, Santa Maria River, and Taal Bridge, and continues on a straight direction until Balagtas Interchange. Before it are the Petron for southbound and Shell for northbound lanes. Pass Shell service area is the Tabang Spur Road and Balagtas Interchange which was opened on March 20, 2012. This is the former terminus of the original segment of an expressway from 1967 to 1976 before it extended to Dau.|$|E
500|$|Snow blowers, {{also known}} as {{rotating}} snowplows or snow cutters, {{can be used in}} place of snowplows on winter service vehicles. A snow blower consists of a rapidly spinning auger which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached {{to the top of the}} blower. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of [...] of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can. In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the <b>road,</b> <b>making</b> passage easier for other road users and preventing the windrow from blocking driveways.|$|E
