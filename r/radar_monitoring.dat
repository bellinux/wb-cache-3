50|$|During World War II the {{military}} airfield {{served as a}} refueling and transit depot. During the Cold War, Naval Air Station Keflavik {{played an important role}} in monitoring marine and submarine traffic from the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the Atlantic Ocean. Forces from the United States Air Force were added to provide <b>radar</b> <b>monitoring,</b> fighter intercept, in-flight refueling, and aerial/marine rescue. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the base's role was cast into doubt. The base officially closed on 30 September 2006, when the United States withdrew the remaining 30 military personnel.|$|E
25|$|Modern radar {{technology}} {{enables the}} monitoring of large {{areas and the}} localization of avalanches at any weather condition, by day and by night. Complex alarm systems are able to detect avalanches {{within a short time}} in order to close (e.g. roads and rails) or evacuate (e.g. construction sites) endangered areas. An example of such a system is installed on the only access road of Zermatt in Switzerland. Two <b>radars</b> <b>monitor</b> the slope of a mountain above the road. The system automatically closes the road by activating several barriers and traffic lights within seconds such that no persons are harmed.|$|R

50|$|Passive (multistatic) radar, {{bistatic}} {{radar and}} especially multistatic radar systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional monostatic radars, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F117) reflects energy {{away from the}} transmitter's line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive <b>radars</b> <b>monitor.</b> Such a system typically uses either low frequency broadcast TV and FM radio signals (at which frequencies controlling the aircraft's signature is more difficult). Later stealth approaches do not rely on controlling the specular reflections of radar energy and so the geometrical benefits {{are unlikely to be}} significant.|$|R
50|$|Required {{navigation}} performance (RNP) {{is a type}} of performance-based navigation (PBN) that allows an aircraft to fly a specific path between two 3D-defined points in space. Area navigation (RNAV) and RNP systems are fundamentally similar. The key difference between them is the requirement for on-board performance monitoring and alerting. A navigation specification that includes a requirement for on-board {{navigation performance}} monitoring and alerting is referred to as an RNP specification. One not having such a requirement is referred to as an RNAV specification. Therefore, if ATC <b>Radar</b> <b>Monitoring</b> is not provided, safe navigation in respect to terrain shall be self-monitored by the pilot and RNP shall be used instead of RNAV.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of takeoff, {{cumulonimbus}} clouds were present at 700 meters, visibility was limited to six kilometers; wind was 6 km/h at 20° with gusts up to 14.5 km/h. At 11:16:37 weather observers recommended a storm warning to the manager, to which he said: [...] "busy." [...] In violation of the law, the information was not passed along the chain of command. At 11:16:47 the crew asked the controller about the radar visibility. The manager reported visibility at 2000 meters and stated that they were visible on radar. After receiving this information, the crew decided {{to go through the}} system. At 11:18:15 at a distance of 20 km from the airport, the manager passed the crew go to the dispatcher for landing. At a distance of 15 km from the airport at an altitude of 400 meters, the crew was instructed to take a course of 95° (due to the deviation to the left 300 m) and were warned about the absence of <b>radar</b> <b>monitoring</b> in the area of 6 km of the runway. After receiving this information, the crew decided not to do a go-around. On approach to Berdyansk at 11:20:15, the crew reported entering the glide path at 8600 meters, then were instructed to drop 400 meters. At 11:20:24 they were given permission to land at Berdyansk. At 11:20:25 weather observers {{at the request of the}} dispatcher gave weather information about the storm, downpour, windspeed, and visibility. Scud and cumulonimbus clouds were observed at a height of 210m and wind was 280° at 8 km/h with gusts up to 11 km/h. Visibility was reported to be limited to 500m. At 11:21 the pilot, questioning the visibility of 500 meters, attempted to assess visibility using his instruments, but in violation procedures did not disclose this to the controller. The plane landed about 5,000 ft down the 8,000+ ft runway while being too fast on the touchdown, and then hydroplaned. The pilot, not being quite sure about the plane's whereabouts on the runway, had then attempted to take off again (while having less than 1,000 ft of runway remaining), rolled off the departure end of the runway, and aborted the take-off attempt. The plane hit several trees, broke apart, then caught fire. Five passengers died at the scene, with one more passenger and two flight attendants dying later from their injuries.|$|E

BACKGROUND The primary purpose of <b>radar</b> <b>monitoring</b> is to insure safe separation of aircraft arriving on the parallel approach courses. This separation is compromised if an aircraft deviates off course towards an aircraft on the adjacent approach. The PRM was designed to facilitate the monitoring process.

50|$|Aerial {{surveillance}} is {{the gathering}} of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle—such as an unmanned aerial vehicle, helicopter, or spy plane. Military surveillance aircraft use a range of sensors (e.g. <b>radar)</b> to <b>monitor</b> the battlefield.|$|R
25|$|Meteorologists use <b>radar</b> to <b>monitor</b> {{precipitation}} and wind. It {{has become}} the primary tool for short-term weather forecasting and watching for severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, winter storms, precipitation types, etc. Geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radars to map the composition of Earth's crust. Police forces use <b>radar</b> guns to <b>monitor</b> vehicle speeds on the roads. Smaller radar systems are used to detect human movement. Examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring and hand and finger gesture detection for computer interaction. Automatic door opening, light activation and intruder sensing are also common.|$|R

40|$|Landfills and {{airports}} have a {{long history}} of incompatibility. Birds are attracted to landfills for various reasons including food sources, habitat, and orographic lift. Since landfills can be avian attractants, they are required to be sited at least 10, 000 feet away from commercial airports in the United States. Waste Management of Kentucky (WMK) operates a municipal landfill and recycling facility [...] the Outer Loop Recycling and Disposal Facility (OLRDF) located less than 1. 5 miles south of the Louisville Standiford airport which, as the hub airport for United Parcel Service, is the fourth largest cargo airport in the U. S. As part of an expansion permit, the FAA required that WMK implement a comprehensive bird control program. As a result, WMK has developed and maintains an extensive program that includes an advanced avian <b>radar</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, two full-time wildlife biologists, and a multi-faceted harassment program. The bird control program was developed and is overseen by BASH, Inc. and is operated day-to-day by DeTect, Inc. A MERLIN Avian Radar System is used to monitor bird activity on and off the landfill. The data to date has demonstrated that this landfill operates at or below background levels of avian activity through WMK s extraordinary efforts and commitment to managing local bird populations. This paper/presentation summarizes how the program was developed, how it is implemented, and results of the <b>radar</b> <b>monitoring</b> program...|$|E
