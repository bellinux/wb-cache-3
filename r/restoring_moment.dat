30|$|The {{curve of}} <b>restoring</b> <b>moment</b> and {{rotation}} angle of column foot joint has a reverse Z shape and anti-symmetric at {{positive and negative}} loading in Fig.  19, which has the similar tendency {{with the results of}} local compression of test [14]. The initial <b>restoring</b> <b>moment</b> is noted linear and increases rapidly, which shows column foot has a high resistance to small rotation angle. The reason is that compression interface decreases, which can lead to the compression reaction force move to the column edge quickly. The rapid movement of the compression reaction force makes the <b>restoring</b> <b>moment</b> increase rapidly. Besides, the compression stress is the elastic stage and isn’t up to the ultimate compression due to large compression interface. The curve is no longer linear after 0.01  rad and <b>restoring</b> <b>moment</b> shows a slow rising trend. The main reason is that the compression interface and the action point of the compression reaction force are close to the edge of column. Changing of the compression interface leads to small changing of the action point of compression reaction force, which causes small changing of <b>restoring</b> <b>moment.</b> Then, the <b>restoring</b> <b>moment</b> almost remains the same value after 0.015  rad, that is because the compression interface is located at the edge of column foot and the changing of compression interface cannot cause changing of action point of the compression force any more. <b>Restoring</b> <b>moment</b> of column foot remains to be positive and active in preventing the column from collapse at the maximum rotation angle, which shows column foot joint has certain amount of <b>restoring</b> <b>moment</b> during column rocking to resist the overturning of structure under lateral load.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A passive {{vibration}} absorber {{for reducing the}} motion of a planar pendulum is developed. The system is excited by the horizontal motion of the support. The design transforms the original one-degree-of-freedom pendulum into a double pendulum by adding a small secondary pendulating sacrificial mass between the main system and the base excitation point and two pretensioned springs that generate negative <b>restoring</b> <b>moments</b> (i. e., of opposite sign {{to that of the}} gravity-induced <b>restoring</b> <b>moments).</b> Optimal conditions for enhancing the transfer of energy from the main (lower) to the secondary (upper) pendulum are sought. The damping is assumed to be of a linear viscous-type. Due to the action of the springs, the transfer function between the pendulation angle of the main system and the disturbance, in the undamped linearized case, can be reduced to zero for any excitation frequency This is accomplished by requiring that the two spring stiffnesses satisfy an algebraic tuning relation. Due to the inherent inertial coupling, the two normal coordi-nates are coupled through off-diagonal terms in the damping matrix. Hence, the {{vibration absorber}} acts to block the transfer of disturbance energy to the main system while enhancing the transfer of energy due to initial conditions from the main pendulum to the secondary pendulum.
