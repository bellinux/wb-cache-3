50|$|Designed by the {{architectural}} firm of Ross and Macdonald, the building comprises twelve floors above ground and a 'T' shaped shopping concourse. The main entrance primarily serves The Gazette with the escalators {{leading to a}} mezzanine looking out onto the ground floor below. The main floor was conceived as an interior shopping arcade {{at a time when}} such a notion was highly experimental. Moreover, the original design allowed access to the retail spaces on the ground floor from outside and in. From the third floor up, the facade is twice set back; however, this is not as a result of municipal regulations (only the upper most levels are so regulated), but rather aesthetic choices designed with multiple 'prestige clients' in mind. As such, the twin setbacks form a double comb shape which provides ample sunlight throughout the building while further permitting natural light to pass through the setbacks onto Sainte-Catherine Street below. By doing so, the building maximizes the total amount of available rental space for comparatively small city block. Moreover, multiple offices within have several different views, and <b>recessed</b> <b>corners</b> provide additional corner offices on the 9th and 10th floors.|$|R

40|$|Local Name: YeşilköyLocal Informant: Osman YusmakLocal Information: Preservation: While nothing {{remains of}} the bridge on the north (right) bank of the gorge except {{weathered}} mortared rubble and scattered facing blocks, the remains on the south (left) bank are better preserved. These include {{a portion of the}} arch of the lower tier of the bridge, {{remains of the}} upper tier and buttress, and traces of the conduit. The downstream (west) side of the bridge is better preserved than the upstream side. Fallen voussoirs and large masses of masonry litter the streambed below. ** Construction: The bridge is constructed of mortared rubble faced with petit appareil masonry. The facing blocks and the upper voussoirs of the arch are fashioned from sandy conglomerate rock, while the lower voussoirs are carved from marble. The facing blocks are approximately 0. 5 m long and 0. 3 m high, while the voussoirs are 0. 50 m long, 0. 30 m wide, and 0. 40 – 1 m deep. Three types of mortar are visible. Ubiquitous is a white lime mortar with stone inclusions no larger than 0. 005 m. Also visible around the crumbling mass of the upper north pier is a light gray lime mortar with larger stone inclusions up to 0. 01 m in size. A third type of lime mortar {{can be found on the}} buttressed middle mass on the south bank; it has a very loose, pinkish tan matrix with stone inclusions as large as 0. 02 m. ** Description: The remains of the bridge suggest that it was originally two-tiered, with a lower arch spanning 13 m and supporting possibly four arches above, each spanning 5. 7 m, topped by the conduit. The bridge is preserved to a height of 17 m, a width of 3 m, and a length of 65 m. Traces of the conduit indicate that it was originally 65 m long and 27 m high. The single arch of the lower tier springs from the bedrock of the steep south (left) bank of the gorge at a height of 10 m above the bottom of the gorge. The tier is preserved to a height of 5. 5 m. The arch is constructed of two layers of voussoirs. The fallen marble blocks used as voussoirs are variously dressed with anathyrosis, clamp cuttings, lifting bosses, and moldings. The second tier of the bridge begins approximately 4. 5 m above the remains of the lower tier. A buttressing structure joins the downstream (west) side of the second tier in a clear seam. Approximately 1 m above the upper tier, the side walls of the conduit are visible. Latitude: 37. 36. 46. 285 Longitude: 28. 51. 02. 578 Elevation: 831 Axis: N-SDimensions: p. H: 17 m ** p.

W (south pier buttress) : 1. 5 mDescription: The remains of the aqueduct bridge indicate that the structure was constructed in two stories of arches in order to maintain the channel elevation across a deep gorge below. On the south bank of the gorge, one segment of the arch (5. 5 m. high) springs from the bedrock of the steep hillside, 10 m. above the bottom of the gorge. Only a mortared rubble mass remains of the corresponding pier on the north bank, with no trace of the arch. Approximately 4. 5 m. above the arched pier segment on the north bank, another mortared rubble mass is built into the hillside and suggests the use of a second story of arches, none of which now remain. A corresponding section of mortared rubble lies on the north bank. Some kind of buttress or support is built against the west (downstream) side of the remains of the higher story, with a clear seam delineating the two masonry structures. The east (upstream) side of both remaining segments of on the south bank is heavily eroded with lots of missing material and no preserved facing blocks. The buttress on the downstream side must have been built in consideration of the forces such as wind that could potentially jeopardize the stability of the tall structure. The side walls of the aqueduct channel are preserved on the south bank, approximately 1 m. above the preserved level of the second story. The top of the rubble mass on the north bank is at roughly the same elevation as the channel on the south bank, but no traces of the channel are visible here, perhaps due to the construction of a road in this area. ** The few facing blocks of the bridge that remain in situ are located on the west side of the south pier. The blocks are approximately 0. 5 m. long and 0. 3 m. high and face a mortared rubble core of unworked stones 0. 10 -. 50 m. long. The facing stones appear to be worked from the conglomeratic sandstone bedrock on site, while the rubble core includes stones of various types locally available. Three kinds of mortar are visible in the remaining sections of the structure. Most ubiquitous is a white lime-based mortar with stone inclusions not larger than 5 mm. Also visible around the crumbling mass of the upper north pier is a light gray lime-based mortar with larger stone inclusions, up to 10 mm. A third type of mortar can be found on the buttressed middle mass on the south bank: a very loose pinkish tan matrix with stone inclusions as large as 20 mm. ** The arch is constructed of two levels of voussoirs, the top level carved from the conglomeratic sandstone bedrock and the bottom of marble. Of the nine remaining courses of the lower level of voussoirs, only seven have preserved facing blocks. Three to four voussoirs are preserved in each course, and each is missing at least one more. The voussoir blocks are 0. 50 m. long, 0. 30 m. wide, and 0. 40 - 1 m. deep. The voussoir blocks seem to be the same width at the extrados and intrados, suggesting that the arch had a considerable span of c. 13 m. A large chunk of mortared rubble, 2. 40 m. by 2. 70 m., and many single marble blocks litter the stream bed below the structure and for at least 20 m. downstream along the gorge. Many of these fallen marble blocks, which were likely used as voussoirs, are worked in ways that suggest they were originally intended for another purpose. One block, located on the gorge bottom only about a meter downstream from the bridge, is dressed with anathyrosis on one side, two holes on an adjacent side, and a cutting for a butterfly clamp in a <b>recessed</b> <b>corner.</b> Another marble block has a lifting boss and molding along its edges. ** Based on these standing remains, the bridge has been theoretically reconstructed with a lower arch spanning the gorge across 13 m., topped by a second story of four arches, centered on the lower arch and each spanning 5. 75 m. Attempt has not been made to reconstruct the buttressing structure on the downstream (west) side of the bridge...|$|E

40|$|The {{advances}} in {{height of building}} structures have magnified their susceptibility to wind-induced vibrations, particularly in typhoon-prone cities. Consequently, considerable efforts have been devoted to the mitigation of wind-induced tall building motions, particularly {{in the areas of}} vibration control, wind tunnel high-frequency base balance (HFBB) analysis techniques, and building aerodynamics. However, the mitigation of the wind-induced 3 -dimensional (3 D) motions of modern tall buildings has been studied by few. Recent evolutions of tall building design have often resulted in significantly nonlinear mode shapes, for which the HFBB analysis techniques commonly adopted for wind tunnel model tests using empirical mode shape correction factors tend to provide substantially larger wind load predictions. The majority of the studies on building aerodynamics have focused primarily on wind load reductions with little consideration given to the practical constraints and the impacts on other engineering and financial aspects. Furthermore, very few studies have focused on the financial implications of response mitigation techniques and consequently {{there is a lack of}} vital information to facilitate the cost considerations of full-scale implementations. A systematic programme of wind tunnel pressure and HFBB studies has been carried out to advance knowledge of the response mitigation techniques, in order to accommodate the current trend of tall building design. A wind-excited benchmark building, which undergoes 3 D motions, was first of all developed to provide a standardised means for the study of vibration control and HFBB analyses. Both the acceleration and displacement responses of the benchmark building in the translational and torsional directions were significantly alleviated using a properly-designed bidirectional smart tuned mass damper (STMD), commanded by the linear quadratic regulator control algorithm. The robustness of the STMD to the potential wind-induced aeroelastic effects was then validated by numerically altering the stiffness and damping matrices of the building. A collaborative study was employed to reveal the capital and maintenance costs of the STMD and to develop a cost model for STMD. A new HFBB analysis, namely the linear-mode-shape (LMS) method, was developed and evaluated to provide more accurate response predictions for buildings with non-ideal mode shapes by establishing a new set of centres at which the translational mode shapes are “linearized”. The LMS method was found to be versatile and superior to provide accurate predictions for a wide range of mode shape exponents. The accuracy of the building responses was further improved by performing the LMS method in the time domain, whereby the modal responses are directly superimposed. The benefits of the LMS method in the time domain were highlighted by the extra reduction in the construction material costs, resulting from an element sizing optimisation. The understanding of the influence of chamfered and <b>recessed</b> <b>corners</b> on tall building responses was enhanced via a series of wind tunnel HFBB tests and analyses. The <b>recessed</b> <b>corners</b> were found to be more effective than the chamfered corners in reducing both alongwind and crosswind moments, particularly for buildings with shorter aspect ratios and smaller corner modifications. The combined effect of modified corners and additional storeys on the construction cost was then quantified by the derivation of empirical formulae to relate the building responses to the number of storeys. The building configuration that yielded the maximum financial profits was successfully identified through a systematic framework to assess the attributes to the rental incomes of an office building...|$|R
