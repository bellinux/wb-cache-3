The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah.

60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalarope,</b> roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E

6000|$|... 111. I {{must first}} get quit of the {{confusion}} of names for this bird. Linn√¶us, in the Fauna Suecica, p. 64, calls it 'Tringa Lobata,' but afterwards 'Northern Tringa'; and his editor, Gmelin, 'Dark Tringa.' Other people agree {{to call it a}} 'phalarope,' but some of them 'northern' phalarope, some, the 'dark' phalarope; some, the 'ashy' phalarope, some, the 'disposed to be ashy' phalarope; some, the 'red-necked' phalarope; and some, 'Mr. Williams's' phalarope; finally, Cuvier calls it a 'Lobipes,' and Mr. Gould, in English, 'red-necked phalarope.' Few people are likely to know what 'Phalarope' means,[24] and I believe nobody knows what 'Tringa' means; and as, also, nobody ever sees it, the little bird being obliged to live in Orkney, Greenland, Norway, and Lapland, out of human creatures' way, I shall myself call it the Arctic Fairy. It would come south if we would let it, but of course Mr. Bond says, [...] "The first specimen I ever had was shot by a friend of mine in September, 1842, near Southend, Essex, where he saw the phalarope swimming on the water, like a little duck, about a mile from land; not knowing what it was, he shot it, and kindly brought it to me." [...] Another was shot while running between the metals of the Great Eastern Railway, near the Stratford station, early in June, 1852; and on the Norfolk coast, four others have been killed during the last fifteen years; and the birds' visits, thus, satisfactorily, put a stop to. I can therefore study it only in Mr. Gould's drawing, on consulting which, I find the bird to be simply a sea dabchick,--brown stripes on the back, and all; but the webs of the feet a little finer, and in its habits it is more like the Lily-ouzel, according to the following report of Mr. St. John: [...] "The <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalarope</b> is certainly the most beautiful little wader of my acquaintance. There were a pair of them, male and female, feeding near the loch, in a little pool which was covered with weeds of different kinds. Nothing could be more graceful than the movements of these two little birds, as they swam about in search of insects, etc. Sometimes they ran lightly on the broad leaves of the water-lily which served them for a raft, and entirely kept them out of the water. Though not exactly web-footed, the phalarope swims with the greatest ease. The attachment of these two birds to each other seemed very great: whenever in their search for food they wandered so far apart as to be hidden by the intervening weeds, the male bird stopped feeding suddenly, and, looking round, uttered a low and musical call of inquiry, which was immediately answered by the female in a different note, but perfectly expressive of her answer, which one might suppose to be to the purport that she was at hand and quite safe; on hearing her, the male immediately recommenced feeding, {{but at the same time}} making his way towards her; she also flew to meet him; they then joined company for a moment or two, and, after a few little notes of endearment, turned off again in different directions. This scene was repeated a dozen times while I was watching them. They seemed to have not the slightest fear of me, for frequently they came to within a yard of where I was sitting, and after looking up they continued catching the small water-insects, etc., on the weeds, without minding my presence in the least." [...] What reward the birds got for this gentle behavior, we learn from the sentence following after the next two lines, containing the extremely valuable contribution to their natural history, that [...] "on dissecting the female we found two eggs in her." ...|$|E

40|$|Despite the hemispheric {{importance}} of Great Salt Lake (GSL) as a staging area for migratory birds, {{little is known}} about the resources that GSL provides to these birds, or how changes to the GSL ecosystem might impact the avian community. Three species of migratory waterbirds that stage at GSL are Wilson‚Äôs <b>phalaropes</b> (Phalaropus tricolor), <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalaropes</b> (Phalaropus lobatus), and eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis). My objective for this research was to study the impacts of prey availability on the staging ecology of these species. In Chapter 2, I examined the use of GSL habitats by both species of phalaropes. In the high-salinity bays of GSL, phalaropes were most strongly associated with shallow water. In the low-salinity bay, there were no strong associations between phalarope presence and particular habitat characteristics. In Chapter 3, I analyzed the behaviors of phalaropes relative to prey densities. Phalaropes commonly foraged in Carrington Bay, which had the highest densities of brine fly (Ephydridae) adults, and in Farmington Bay, which had high densities of benthic macroinvertebrates. Foraging behavior differed between Wilson‚Äôs and <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalaropes,</b> with Wilson‚Äôs phalaropes spinning more often than <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalaropes.</b> In Chapter 4, I examined interannual and nightly variations in eared grebe fall migration departures in relation to prey availability and environmental conditions. Eared grebes began migration relatively early when lake temperatures were relatively warm, densities of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) adults were high, and densities of brine shrimp cysts were low. The likelihood that eared grebes would depart on a given night was positively associated with the average barometric pressure 12 hours prior to sunset. The resources provided by GSL support substantial proportions of the staging populations of phalaropes and eared grebes. Management efforts should seek to maintain the habitats and resources needed by phalaropes and eared grebes at GSL. Future large-scale diversions of freshwater may threaten GSL‚Äôs suitability as a staging area for these birds...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Red-necked</b> <b>phalaropes</b> (Phalaropus lobatus) {{breed in}} Arctic and Subarctic {{lowlands}} throughout the circumpolar region. They are highly reliant on shallow freshwater ponds for social interaction, copulation, and foraging for small aquatic invertebrates. Threats related to warmer continental temperatures {{could lead to}} encroachment of shrub vegetation and premature drying of wetlands that serve as breeding habitat. We documented patterns of pond use over the breeding season and investigated pond characteristics associated with high occupancy by <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalaropes.</b> Research was conducted during two breeding seasons in a large wetland on Niglintgak Island, located {{in the mouth of}} the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories. The frequency of pond occupancy declined between the onset of incubation and average hatch dates. Neither invertebrate assemblages (potential prey) nor physical characteristics (water chemistry and vegetation characteristics) varied significantly between ponds categorized as high-use, low-use, and no-use, in either year. Dry weight of potential prey (g/m 3) was higher during the incubation period than during the nest initiation period. Pond occupancy both prior to and during incubation showed a clumped distribution, suggesting that choice of ponds was related in part to social stimulation. Future studies should examine the proximity of ponds to nest sites, the effects of premature drying of ponds on food availability, the distribution of resources surrounding ponds, and the occupancy of ponds by broods during the period preceding fall migration...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{migration}} and wintering patterns of a wader with a pelagic lifestyle during the non-breeding period, the rednecked phalarope Phalaropus lobatus. Using light-level geolocation, we obtained three full annual tracks and one autumn migration track of male <b>red-necked</b> <b>phalaropes</b> caught during breeding in Scandinavia. Th ese tracks confi rmed expectations that {{individuals from the}} Scandinavian population winter in the Arabian Sea. Migration was accomplished in two to four migration leaps, staging {{for a few days}} in the Gulf of Finland (autumn) or the southern Baltic Sea (spring) and for up to a month in or near the Black and Caspian Sea (autumn and spring). In addition, travel speeds suggested that only the fl ights between the Baltic and Black/Caspian Sea are non-stop, and thus the birds seem to make additional short stops during the other flights. Stopover time in the Black/Caspian Sea is only 8 ‚Äì 10 d in spring but up to 36 d in autumn, which is longer than expected if only used for pre-migratory fattening to cover the ca 2000 km to the Gulf of Oman. After entering the Arabian Sea via the Gulf of Oman, birds dispersed over the entire presumed winter range. Winter movements appear to correspond to the spatio-temporal patterns in primary production linked to seasonally changing monsoon winds.
