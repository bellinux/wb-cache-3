[...] The Bureau of Land Management is assessing the impact on the natural areas and considering how off-road activities can be effectively controlled.|$|E
2500|$|Lost Forest {{offers the}} {{opportunity}} to study isolated plant and animal populations in a unique environment. [...] As a result, researchers {{have been looking at}} various aspects of the Lost Forest for well over one hundred years. [...] Early settlement patterns, geology, and natural resources of Lost Forest and Christmas Lake Valley were initially documented in 1884, 1889, and 1908. [...] In 1937, analysis of tree rings highlighted long-term climatic changes that have occurred in the region. [...] Additional tree ring studied were conducted in 1938 and 1964 expanded that knowledge. [...] The sedimentary geology of nearby Fossil Lake was studied in 1942, 1945, and 1954. [...] The area's fossil birds were described in a 1946 study. [...] Two studies in the mid-1940s, found some evidence of prehistoric man in areas around Lost Forest. [...] In 1963, the Bureau of Land Management conducted a comprehensive study of Lost Forest vegetation. [...] That study also included soil descriptions and noted unique aspects of ponderosa pine reproductive physiology. [...] Another vegetation study was conducted in 1973, and a health assessment of ponderosa pine stands in the Lost Forest was completed in 2007.

40|$|To assess {{effects of}} low-intensity fire, we {{combined}} two silvicultural prescriptions with prescribed {{fire in the}} California Cascade Range. In the first treatment, two 100 -ha stands were thinned to reduce density while retaining old-growth structural characteristics, yielding residual stands with high structural diversity (HSD). Two other 100 -ha plots were thinned to minimize old growth structure, producing even-aged stands of low structural diversity (LSD), and one 50 -ha split-plot from each treatment was burned. In addition, two 50 ha old-growth <b>Research</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Areas</b> (RNA) were selected as untreated reference plots, {{one of which was}} also burned. Fire treatments profoundly altered mite assemblages in the short term, and forest structure modification likely exacerbated that response. Sampling conducted two years following treatment confirmed a continuing decline in oribatid mite abundance. Oribatid species richness and assemblage heterogeneity also declined, and community dominance patterns were disrupted. Oribatid responses to fire were either more intense or began earlier in the LSD treatments, suggesting that removal of old-growth structure exacerbated mite responses to fire. Prostigmatids recovered quickly, but their populations nonetheless diminished significantly in burned split-plots. Mite assemblage responses to prescribed fire were continuing nearly two years later, with no clear evidence of recovery...|$|R

40|$|The Tongass National Forest {{encompasses}} a large expanse of temperate rainforest in southeastern Alaska and contains 12 designated <b>Research</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Areas</b> (RNAs). Existing in as near a natural condition as possible, RNAs receive minimal commercial and recreational use. Because few bird {{studies have been}} conducted on RNAs, we used point counts and area searches to determine the occurrence and abundance of breeding landbirds present in vegetation communities of RNAs. Of 49 species of small landbirds detected during area searches, the most widely distributed birds among RNAs were rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufa), chestnutbacked chickadee (Poecile rufescens), winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus), hermit thrush (C. guttatus), varied thrush (Ixoreus naevius), and Townsend’s warbler (Dendroica townsendi). The 8 most abundant species recorded on 187 point counts (. 0. 5 birds/point) were Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), hermit thrush, varied thrush, winter wren, golden-crowned kinglet, Townsend’s warbler, and chestnut-backed chickadee. Several species had significant differences in abundance between low- elevation hemlock-spruce forest and their abundance in either high- elevation fir-spruce forest or mixed conifer-shore pine muskeg. Because RNAs provide forests that are not disturbed by human activities, these sites could provide a standard to evaluate changes in bird abundance and richness that may occur on developed land in southeastern Alaska...|$|R
40|$|Special {{interest}} areas (SIA) are authorized under CFR 36 294. 1 {{and defined}} as areas {{which should be}} managed principally for recreation use substantially in their natural condition. They are managed for their unique scenic, geologic, historical, archaeological, botanical, cultural, or other memorable features. 1 <b>Research</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Areas</b> (RNA) are authorized under Forest Service Manual (FSM) Section 4063 and defined as a physical or biological unit in which current natural conditions are maintained insofar as possible. These conditions are ordinarily achieved by allowing natural physical and biological processes to prevail without human intervention to provide a baseline against which man-caused changes elsewhere can be measured (Moir 1972; Burns et al 1984). RNAs are established specifically to preserve a representative example of an ecological community primarily for scientific and educational purposes. 2 The FSM 4063. 1 states: "Research <b>Natural</b> <b>Areas</b> must {{be large enough to}} provide essentially unmodified conditions within their interiors. In the West, 300 acres of land is generally considered the minimum size. " However, in order to represent a variety of successional stages, landscape patterns, plant associations, and environmental variables, RNAs for some ecosystem types will often need to be considerably larger than 300 acres. Some proposed RNAs in the Rocky Mountain Region currently exceed 5, 000 acres. The viability of species and persistence of natural disturbance patterns are also often size dependent (Andrews 1993). The forest plan revision process is the opportunity to address directly the protection of existing special interest areas (geological, botanical, historical, 1 See Appendix D for existing status of Special Interest Areas for Sierran Forests. 2 See Appendix D for existing status of Research Natura...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{change is}} often hard to {{document}} {{because of a}} lack of reliable baseline data. Several recent then-versus-now surveys of temperate forest and grassland communities demonstrate losses of local plant species, but most are based on data from a single site. We resurveyed understory communities in 62 upland forest stands in northern Wisconsin (U. S. A.) for which quantitative baseline data exist from 50 years ago. These stands are within a largely unfragmented region but vary in species composition and successional stage. We collected data on changes in (1) total and native species richness, (2) the ratio of exotic to native species, (3) the relative abundance of habitat generalists, and (4) community similarity among sites. We also compared how these rates of change varied over time. Over the past 50 years, native species density declined an average of 18. 5 % at the 20 -m(2) scale, whereas the ratio of exotic species to native species increased at 80 % of all sites. Habitat generalists increased, and habitat specialists declined, accounting in part for an 8. 7 % rise in average similarity in species composition among sites. Most of these changes cannot be related to succession, habitat loss, or invasion by exotic species. Areas without deer hunting showed the greatest declines in native species density, with parks and <b>research</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas</b> faring no better than unprotected stands. Animal-pollinated and animal-dispersed species also declined, particularly at unhunted sites. These results demonstrate the power of quantitative multistand data for assessing ecological change and identify overabundant deer as a key driver of community change. Because maintaining forest habitats alone fails to preserve plant diversity at local scales, local biotic simplification seems likely to continue in the region unless active efforts are taken to protect diversity...|$|R
