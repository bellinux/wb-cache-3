40|$|Abstract This paper investigates {{an advance}} sales system wherein a firm sells an {{inventory}} over a limited planning time interval. The firm divides the planning time interval into several reservation periods and delivers the <b>reserved</b> <b>orders</b> {{at the end}} of each reservation period. The demands are considered as price and waiting time dependent. In addition, the situation in which customers may cancel their orders before receiving them is also considered. Two continuous time models are developed and analyzed. The ratio of refund to sales price is assumed to be fixed in the first model while is assumed to be time-dependent in the second model. Solution procedures are developed for both models in order to determine the number of reservation periods, the optimal sales price, and order size...|$|R
