40|$|Young stock <b>rearing</b> is an {{important}} factor on dairy farms. However, the costs of young stock <b>rearing</b> are often unknown while most costs are contributed to the dairy cows. In addition to that, most farmers have great difficulties in estimating the costs of young stock <b>rearing.</b> Previous research shows that the costs of young stock <b>rearing</b> can be up to € 1540 per successfully bred heifer or 13 % of the cost price of milk (Mohd Nor et al., 2012). In order to calculate the young stock <b>rearing</b> costs on Dutch dairy farms, 43 farms were visited and a calculation of their young stock <b>rearing</b> costs was made using JonKos, a module designed by WUR Livestock Research, DLV and WUR Business economics (WUR Livestock Research et al., 2011). The average costs of young stock <b>rearing</b> on dairy farms according to this research project were € 1559 per successfully <b>reared</b> heifer. Young stock <b>rearing</b> farms had lower average <b>rearing</b> costs than dairy farms (€ 1273 versus € 1606 resp.), although this proved not to be significant (p= 0. 056; B=- 0. 294). The total hours spent on young stock <b>rearing</b> had a significant effect on the total young stock <b>rearing</b> costs per heifer on dairy farms (p= 0, 049; B= 0. 326). In addition, a rise in the average age at first calving did lead to a significant rise the costs of young stock <b>rearing</b> per 100 kg milk (p= 0, 01; B= 0, 426). The farmers that participated in this research project estimated their <b>rearing</b> costs to be € 994 per successfully <b>reared</b> heifer, thereby underestimating the young stock <b>rearing</b> costs by € 312 per heifer. There was no significant relation between the calculated young stock <b>rearing</b> costs on a farm and the estimation by the farmer, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} farmers that participated in this project were not able to make an educated guess of their young stock <b>rearing</b> costs. All farmers that participated in this research project wanted more information on young stock <b>rearing</b> and the costs accompanied with the <b>rearing</b> period. In addition, all farmers would recommend calculating the costs of the young stock period to other farmers...|$|R
40|$|Background: As farmers do {{not often}} keep {{a record of}} the {{expenditures}} for <b>rearing,</b> an economic tool that provides insight into the cost of <b>rearing</b> is useful. In the Netherlands, an economic tool (Jonkos) has been developed that can be used by farmers to obtain insight into the cost of <b>rearing</b> on their farm. The first objective {{of this study is to}} calculate the total cost of <b>rearing</b> young stock in Dutch dairy herds using Jonkos. The second objective is to compare the calculated total cost of <b>rearing</b> with the farmers' own estimation of the cost of <b>rearing</b> (the perceived cost). Findings: Information was available for 75 herds that <b>reared</b> their own young stock and who had used the Jonkos tool. The perceived cost of <b>rearing</b> young stock was only available for 36 herds. In the 75 herds, the average herd size was 100 dairy cows. The average calculated total cost of <b>rearing</b> a heifer was € 1, 790. The average perceived total cost of <b>rearing</b> a heifer (including labour and housing costs) was € 1, 030. Conclusion: Most Dutch farmers in the study underestimated the total cost of <b>rearing.</b> The Jonkos economic tool has the advantage that herd-specific information can be entered as input values. The output of the tool can improve the awareness of farmers about the total costs of <b>rearing.</b> This awareness can lead to a higher priority of young stock <b>rearing</b> and consequently to an improved quality of young stock <b>rearing.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Two broods of {{coho salmon}} {{fingerlings}} (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were <b>reared</b> at three densities (25, 000, 50, 000, and 75, 000 fish/raceway) and at {{three levels of}} water inflow (757, 1, 514, and 2, 271 L/min per raceway) at a year-round coldwater hatchery. All nine density-inflow com-binations were tested (2 raceways/treatment). During the <b>rearing</b> phase of the study, various phys-iological and disease status indicators were tested for differences from <b>rearing</b> density (kg of fish/ m 3 of <b>rearing</b> space) and loading (kg of fish/[L of water flow-min]). After release from the hatchery, survival, adult contribution, and fishery catch data were also examined for treatment effects. Fingerlings <b>reared</b> at the lowest density were smaller at release than fish <b>reared</b> at the two higher densities. Gill ATPase at release was reduced in fish <b>reared</b> at the highest density and also in fish <b>reared</b> at the lowest water inflow rate. Increased <b>rearing</b> density produced small but significant reductions in percent survival of smolts after release but did not significantly depress total adult contributions per raceway. A direct linear relationship was found between increased <b>rearing</b> density and adult contribution per raceway.

40|$|The {{costs of}} <b>rearing</b> young dairy cattle {{are a part}} of the cost of the price of milk, as <b>rearing</b> {{produces}} the future dairy cows. As most dairy farmers are not aware of the <b>rearing</b> costs, the <b>rearing</b> of dairy replacements often does not get the attention it deserves. Calculating the distribution of the <b>rearing</b> costs throughout the <b>rearing</b> process is difficult as the costs are correlated with biological processes, such as variation in growth rate and disease uncertainty. In this study, a calf level simulation model was built to estimate the <b>rearing</b> costs and their distribution from 2 weeks of age until first calving in the Netherlands. The uncertainties related to calf diseases (calf scours and bovine respiratory disease) were included, in which both the probabilities of disease and the effects of diseases (growth reduction) differ at different ages. In addition, growth was modeled stochastically and in a detailed manner using a two-phase growth function. The total cost of <b>rearing</b> young dairy cattle was estimated as € 1567 per successfully <b>reared</b> heifer and varied between € 1423 and € 1715. Reducing the age of first calving by 1 month reduced the total cost between 2. 6 % and 5. 7 %. The difference in the average cost of <b>rearing</b> between heifers that calved at 24 months and those calving at 30 months was € 400 per heifer <b>reared.</b> Average <b>rearing</b> costs were especially influenced by labor efficiency and cost of feed. The <b>rearing</b> costs of a heifer that experienced disease at least once (20 % of the simulated heifers) were on average € 95 higher than those of healthy heifers. Hence, for an individual diseased heifer, disease costs can be rather high, while the relative contribution to the average <b>rearing</b> cost for a standard Dutch dairy farm is low (approx. 3 %). Overall, the model developed proved to be a useful tool to investigate the total cost of <b>rearing</b> young dairy cattle, providing insights to dairy farmers with respect to the cost-efficiency of their own <b>rearing</b> managemen...|$|R

5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction.

40|$|After hatchery-reared {{salmonids}} {{are released}} into the wild, their survival and performance are frequently {{lower than those of}} wild conspecifics. Additionally, negative effects of hatchery fish on wild fish are cited as factors affecting the recovery of salmonid populations. Alternative hatchery <b>rearing</b> environments and release practices have been proposed to mitigate both problems. We investigated the postrelease growth, survival, habitat use, and spatial distribution of hatchery steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss fry <b>reared</b> in conventional and enriched environments and compared their performance with that of naturally <b>reared</b> steelhead fry from the same parent population in two streams. Average instantaneous growth rates differed between streams but not among the three <b>rearing</b> groups. The survival of naturally <b>reared</b> fry was significantly greater than that of both types of hatchery fry (relative survival ¼ 0. 33) but did not differ between the conventional and enriched environments. Naturally <b>reared</b> fry grew and survived equally well regardless of the type of hatchery fry with which they were stocked. Supplementation increased fry population size in all stream sections but produced hatchery-biased populations. Steelhead fry preferred pool habitat within stream sections, but pool use was affected by an interaction between <b>rearing</b> environment and stream. Hatchery fry had more clumped spatial distributions than naturally <b>reared</b> fry, which were affected by a significant interaction between <b>rearing</b> type and stream. Hatchery <b>rearing</b> type and stream had no effect on the spatial distribution of naturally <b>reared</b> fry. We conclude that (1) hatchery steelhead fry released in streams grow as well as naturally <b>reared</b> fry but do not survive as well, (2) enriched hatchery environments do not improve postrelease growth or survival, and (3) upon release, fry raised in enriched hatchery environments affect the growth and survival of naturally <b>reared</b> fry {{in much the same way}} as fry <b>reared</b> in conventional hatchery environments...|$|R
