40|$|Basic {{elements}} of t h e <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> {{policy in the}} Federal Republic of Germany are presented in the paper. The role of t he <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy is first described {{in order to identify}} its objectives, scope, subjects, and instruments. The <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy is a well-established component of the FRG's economic policy. A lederai state structure necessitates some specific regulations of the problem of relations between objects. The pyramid of objectives adopted within a social market economy defines the objectives of the <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy. These objectives, in turn, determine appropriate instruments. Both theoretical and practical experience indicates that regardless of the extent of the state's economic interventionism, a <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy must be continued.

40|$|The article {{contains}} a presentation {{of the main elements}} of the concept of <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy of the Federal Republic of Germany. A point of departure for the analysis is a defnition of role and place of the <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy within economic sciences. It allows to determine its role and scope, goals of particular entities and applied instruments. The <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy holds a permanent place in the German economic thought as a part o f the economic policy pursued by the State. A specific character of the federal state implies special regulations concerning the problem of subjectiveness. Goals of the <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy ensue from the pyramid of goals accepted within the framework of social market economy doctrine. The instruments applied have been subordinated to these goals. Both the theoretical experiments and the economic practice in Germany point a t the necessity of conducting a <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> policy by the State irrespective of various discussions on the scope of state intervention in the economy.

The <b>structural</b> <b>research</b> {{framework}} {{of the effects of}} marketing mix elements on brand equity and customer response is defined with the existing theoretical findings. Research hypotheses are defined according to the identified <b>structural</b> <b>research</b> framework. A householder appliance brand, Hisense, is taken as a demonstrative brand. In order to test the defined <b>structural</b> <b>research</b> framework and research hypotheses empirical research was conducted on the sample of Hisense consumers in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and the multiple regression statistical method with the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 11. 0) are used to analyze the data. Research results indicate that the <b>structural</b> <b>research</b> framework has an acceptable level of fit to the empirical data.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop and better {{understanding}} of the <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> controls of the metallic mineral deposits of Alaska, a detailed examination was made of the linear features and trends interpreted from Landsat imagery. In addition, local structural features and alteration zones were examined by ratio analysis of selected Landsat images. The linear trend analysis provided new <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> data for previously proposed mineral deposit models and also provided new evidence for the extension of the existing models. Preliminary evidence also suggests linear intersection control of some types of mineral occurrences and that trend analysis may result in the definition of areas favorable for future mineral exploration. Ratio image analysis indicates that alteration zones and local structural features can be identified by use of Landsat imagery. Ratio image analysis for the definition of alteration zones must be used with caution, however, since the alteration associated with the various mineral deposits may not be differentiated by the technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} depth {{maps for}} eight key horizons and seven thickness maps covering the onshore and offshore areas for the Late Permian to recent sedimentary {{section of the}} Netherlands. These maps, prepared {{in the context of}} a TNO regional mapping project, are supported by nine <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> cross sections and a table summarizing the timing of tectonic activity from Carboniferous to recent. These new regional maps enable the delineation of various structural elements but also reveal the development of these elements through time with improved detail. Since the latest Carboniferous the tectonic setting of the Netherlands changed repeatedly. During successive tectonic phases several pre-existing structural elements were reactivated and new elements appeared. The various identified <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> elements are grouped into six tectonically active periods: Late Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. This study demonstrates that many structural elements and fault systems were repeatedly reactivated and that a clear distinction exists between long-lived elements, such as the Roer Valley Graben, and short-lived structural elements, such as the Terschelling Basin...|$|R

30|$|These {{results have}} {{important}} implications. The {{fact that both}} groups share similar dynamic adjustments in terms of participation rates and employment levels, but unemployment rates are more persistent in “low unemployment” regions, implies that spatial mobility is more relevant to explain relative adjustments in the “high unemployment” regions. Consequently, absolute differences between the regional unemployment rates of these groups should be ascribed to either <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> differences, to nation-wide shocks producing different impacts, or to both circumstances. Not, in any case, to different responses to one-off regional employment shocks.|$|R
30|$|Specific and place-based {{innovation}} policy tools {{belong to a}} type of policy aimed at developing industries and regions based on their specific capabilities, characteristics and development opportunities (Asheim et al., 2006; Tödtling and Trippl, 2005). The policy takes into account that processes of <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> change can vary greatly across different (subnational) regions. Regions differ in their capacity to initiate innovation activity and new industrial growth paths (Isaksen and Trippl, 2016). Uneven preconditions and barriers to new paths of development across regions entails that the policy must be differentiated and adapted to specific regional characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Working {{within the}} "distributional approach," this {{research}} offers evidence {{of past and}} future polarization in aggregate regional labor productivity in EU- 15. This finding is robust to alternative definitions of the spatial units used and {{does not appear to}} be the result of <b>regional</b> <b>structural</b> change. Spatial effects are found but are of rather localized nature. Turning to separate sectoral analyses suggests that past and future polarization in labor productivity across European regions may be associated with regional productivity differences in the services sectors.
