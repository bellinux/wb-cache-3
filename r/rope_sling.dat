50|$|The initial rescue {{attempt was}} carried out under the {{direction}} of Humble, Carr (owner and viewer), G B Hunter (Cowpen & North Seaton), Hugh Taylor (Backworth) and Matthias Dunn (HM Inspector of Mines). By midnight rescuers had reached the damaged cage and George Sharp Snr was brought up in a <b>rope</b> <b>sling.</b> However, he jammed against some overhanging timbers, came out of the sling and fell to his death. The rescuers (including the by then rested Chapman) then descended the pump staple and lowered a <b>rope</b> <b>sling</b> from the high main. William Shape and Ralph Robinson were brought up from the cage in this manner. Thomas Watson, a local preacher, had earlier descended from the cage to the men who had fallen. He remained with them to pray and comfort them until they died. Watson likewise ascended in a sling and was therefore the last man out alive.|$|E
50|$|A whoopie sling is {{an easily}} {{adjustable}} <b>rope</b> <b>sling</b> designed for tree pruning or tree removal. The whoopie sling works by wrapping the sling around {{the trunk of}} a tree or a heavy load bearing limb and pulling the end of the rope within the sling through a spliced choker. By adjusting the size of the eye in the rope through the choker the user is able to adjust the length of the sling constricting around the tree without needing knots. It is also becoming more common (usually in smaller diameter) for suspending hammocks during hiking or camping.|$|E

Loud growling noises could be heard through the door of the apartment, causing the officer to avoid entering. Another police officer was sent to the roof, from which he lowered himself on a <b>rope</b> <b>sling</b> to peer in through the apartment’s windows. Ming attempted to attack him, nearly breaking through the window, frightening the officer. An animal control team was then sent into the apartment; they anesthetized the tiger and also discovered the alligator. Yates was later located at a Philadelphia hospital and placed under guard.|$|E
50|$|The mast {{is made of}} glued clean wood, conical, without stays or shrouds. Boom, pole, gaff, {{spreaders}} {{and such}} are completely omitted. The mast is supported by two ball bearings, one at the keel and one at the deck hole, and can thus rotate freely. The rotation is created using a wooden collar, with a V-shaped track, around the mast below deck. Around this collar an infinite <b>rope</b> <b>sling</b> runs through two blocks to a winch, powered by hand or an electric motor. In this way the sail is rolled onto the mast when less area is needed or when the sailing is finished. As {{a result of the}} conic mast, the clew will move up the less sail that exposed. As a result of the mast taper the clew will end up higher and higher the closer it is to the mast.|$|E

40|$|RNA {{structural}} motifs are {{the building}} blocks of the complex RNA architecture. Identification of non-coding RNA structural motifs is a critical step towards understanding of their structures and functionalities. In this article, we present a clustering approach for de novo RNA structural motif identification. We applied our approach on a data set containing 5 S, 16 S and 23 S rRNAs and rediscovered many known motifs including GNRA tetraloop, kink-turn, C-loop, sarcin–ricin, reverse kink-turn, hook-turn, E-loop and tandem-sheared motifs, with higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art clustering method. We also identified a number of potential novel instances of GNRA tetraloop, kink-turn, sarcin–ricin and tandem-sheared motifs. More importantly, several novel structural motif families have been revealed by our clustering analysis. We identified a highly asymmetric bulge loop motif that resembles the <b>rope</b> <b>sling.</b> We also found an internal loop motif that can significantly increase the twist of the helix. Finally, we discovered a subfamily of hexaloop motif, which has significantly different geometry comparing to the currently known hexaloop motif.

Resource: The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether and to what extent people experience flow in overcoming ropes obstacles and how their flow is affected by their previous experiences from other sports. Methods: Polling had one hundred and fifty respondents who were regular visitors to the <b>rope</b> <b>sling.</b> Polling was carried out immediately after crossing the rope obstacles using a questionnaire-Flow Kurzskala (FCS). The data obtained were divided into individual files, depending on the hypotheses posed.

50|$|Prior to the 1940s, the {{majority}} of cargo movement in ports were mainly done by hand and required {{a large number of}} skilled workers. There were some new technologies that were introduced in order to aid in the movement of shipments, such as <b>rope</b> <b>slings,</b> dollys, forklifts, and even cranes that helped longshoremen take large loads off of ships. However, longshoremen were still needed as they were skilled to maximize the space in each container. The methods of cargo movement differed greatly between each port on the Pacific Coast. Depending {{on the size of the}} cargo and what was being shipped, many ports required extensive manual labor of dock workers while others required the use of specialized mechanical cranes to hoist large truck containers off of ships.

40|$|Chokers are wire <b>rope</b> <b>slings</b> used {{to secure}} the felled trees to the rigging during cable yarder extracting. Standard chokers are set {{manually}} by the choker-setters along the corridor, and then unhooked manually by the yarder operator at the landing. Radio-controlled chokers are also set manually but have the advantage {{that they can be}} released remotely at the landing. In addition to possible safety improvement at the landing, the advantage is that it reduces the unhook phase of the operation and thereby potentially improve productivity. However, the additional weight of the radio controlled chokers may also increase the work load of the choker-setters on the slope. A standard manual choker bell weighs 0. 34 kg, whereas the radio- controlled choker bell weighs 1. 6 kg. To assess the possible efficiency and ergonomic benefits of radio-controlled chokers a study was carried out on aWanderfalke yarder. The study site was in the eastern Austrian Alps, working in Norway Spruce with a piece size ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 86 m 3, on slopes between 50 and 60 %, and in corridors of 90 to 200 m long. It included both a time and motion study in a full factorial layout as well as measuring the choker-setter workload through continuous monitoring of the heart-rate. Results showed that therewas a 9 %productivity gain using the radio-controlled chokers at the average piece size. However the workload of the choker-setter also increased; the percent heart rate reserve, a measurement of worker strain, increased from 40 to 44 %. So although this study showed that productivity improvements are possible with radio-controlled chokers, it was at the expense of increased worked load of the choker-setter...|$|R

50|$|For {{many years}} via ferratas were climbed using simple {{equipment}} - carabiners fixed to short lengths of <b>rope</b> or <b>slings</b> {{attached to a}} chest (or sit) harness, {{on the basis that}} one would not fall very far. However, it gradually became apparent that these systems did not prevent serious injury. Essentially, the problem is that there is only a short length of rope to absorb the energy of a fall which can be much longer, depending on the gaps between anchor points for the safety cable - put technically the fall factor, which in rock climbing does not normally exceed two, can in a via ferrata be much higher. These high factors generate considerable forces which the human body, as well as most items of climbing equipment, cannot withstand, leading to serious injury and equipment failure. To address this, a number of devices have been developed to act as shock absorbers or progressive brakes. They aim to dissipate the energy of the fall more effectively than a short rope length and so keep the climber and equipment intact.|$|R
