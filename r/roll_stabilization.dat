The first six of these experiments are described and the results summarized. Five of the experiments were conducted on large amplitude motion base simulators; V/STOLAND UH- 1 H variable stability helicopter was used in the flight experiment. Airworthiness implications of selected variables that were investigated across all of the experiments are discussed, including the level of longitudinal static stability, the type of stability and control augmentation, the addition of flight director displays, and the type of instrument approach task.

40|$|Dynamical {{systems may}} {{experience}} undesirable behavior or instability, {{which can be}} eliminated using feedback control means. However, {{in the absence of}} feedback control, the stability of some systems may be increased by imposing parametric excitation. In other cases, the exit time of the system response from the stable to the unstable domain may be prolonged by imposing external noise, a phenomenon termed noise-enhanced stability (NES). This article presents an assessment of the mechanisms of stabilization via multiplicative noise and noise-enhanced stability. The first part deals with stabilization via deterministic parametric excitation of gravity-defying systems such as the inverted simple and spherical pendulums, aeroelastic structures, human walking, and quantum nonlinear couplers.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an approach}} for generating {{a series of}} optimal control actions in processes, which cannot (or can only partly) be modelled mathematically, by combining learning with problem solving methods. This approach has a suitable real time behaviour and can handle {{a larger number of}} different discrete control actions. A training data set is generated by a problem solver which generates for any points of the state space an optimal control action. "Optimal" means that an evaluation of that action is obtained from an empiric evaluation function. For the choice of that function some apriori knowledge of the current process is desirable. Classification algorithms (e. g. CAL 5 and DIPOL) were used to split the state space into boxes with a unique control action attached. Optimal control trajectories are automatically generated by applying the resulting classifier recursively. A simulation of the <b>roll</b> axis <b>stabilization</b> of a communication satellite in orbit was taken to illustrate thi s approach. The main result is that the controller based on the learned classifier properly operates and it delivers better results in most cases than an appropriate "classical" PD- controller...|$|R

The hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural <b>roll</b> and pitch <b>stabilization</b> characteristics, in which planar flight control can be developed conveniently.

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> for monohulls is an {{important}} issue in naval architecture. Several methods including <b>roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> tanks, active control fins, rudder <b>roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> systems, and bilge keels are commonly used for <b>roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> purposes and each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this thesis <b>roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> is studied by using passive and active <b>roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> configurations with hydrofoils. The main objective of this research is to identify an effective <b>roll</b> <b>stabilization</b> system for use on high- speed monohull vessels. The analysis of the performance of a passive hydrofoil configuration is used {{as a starting point for}} the development of active control mechanisms. A generic fast monohull was created for study purposes and the SWAN- 2 code (ShipWaveANalysis), a state-of-the-art time domain simulation program, was used for the analysis of the linear free-surface flow around the vessel. Simulations were carried out in regular waves incident at angles ranging from 90 ⁰, 105 ⁰, 120 ⁰, 135 ⁰ and 150 ⁰ degrees relative to the ship axis, 900 being beam waves and 180 ⁰ degree being head waves. The ship was equipped with a hydrofoil fixed amidships, quarter to aft and aft to determine the sensitivity of roll motion on the longitudinal position of the lifting appendage. (cont.) It was found that the most efficient location for the hydrofoil is amidships leading to a 20 % to 60 % roll motion reduction (depending on the wave angle and ship speed) of the RMS value of roll motion in an ISSC spectrum. Also studies were performed to determine the planform area of the hydrofoil for optimal roll motion reduction. In addition, four different Froude numbers are used, ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 9, to evaluate the effect of the speed on the effectiveness of the lifting appendage. As expected, higher speeds lead to better seakeeping performance, namely better roll reduction compared to lower speeds. Passive hydrofoils were found to be very effective in reducing the rolling motion. Active roll control mechanisms were also investigated by seeking the optimal time-dependent variation of the modulus and phase of the hydrofoil angle of attack and found to be very effective leading to increased roll reduction. The development of such optimal control algorithms is expected to lead to an enhanced roll seakeeping performance over a broader range of sea state conditions and ship speeds. by Talha Ulusoy.
