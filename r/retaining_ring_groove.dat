40|$|The {{knowledge}} of strength characteristics obtained with sufficient statistical security from fatigue tests is indispensible {{to the design}} of highly loaded shafts. This is particularly true for the calculation of critical shaft sections with functional sharp notches such as <b>retaining</b> <b>rings.</b> To extend the existing {{knowledge of}} the parameters influencing fatigue strength and, thus, to extend the designer's capabilities of exerting influence, fatigue tests were carried out on shafts with <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> <b>grooves.</b> Therefore, research of influences through material variations and material aftertreatments were in the fore. Starting from previous investigations of notched Ck 35 N shafts, also shafts made of the alloys 42 CrMo 4 V and 17 CrNiMo 6 were tested. In cases where material and aftertreatment variations were carried out, fatigue strength increases by up to 150 % were possible. (orig.)

40|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> {{arrangement}} is proposed to suppress unstable flow or surge in a centrifugal blower. The <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement connects the upstream position of impeller inlet and the inducer throat tip through a bypass. The recirculation flow {{was formed by}} the pressure {{difference between the two}} positions, and the recirculation flow rate was changed by increasing the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> widths. The inlet recirculation results in a decrease in the flow rate of unstable flow inception, and an up to 8 % improvement in stall limit was obtained by the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement at a small expense of the delivery pressure drop. The improvement of stall limit in the present experiment seems to be mainly due to decrease in flow incidence based on the inlet recirculation flow. Tre flow incidence decreases more as the recirculation flow rate increases, thus resulting in a larger improvement in stall limit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The three {{dimensional}} {{model was}} established for studying performance of spiral groove gas face seal. According to machining features of different surface area, the seal face {{can be divided}} into three parts, rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area, rotor <b>ring</b> non-grooved area and static ring area. The effect of roughness on seal performance was analyzed based on calculation of three dimensional flow field. The analysis results show that the surface roughness of rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area has great influence on the seal performance, but the influence is little when roughness on non-grooved rotor ring surface and static ring surface. The influence must be considered when surface roughness of rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area bigger than 0. 2 µm. Roughness of rotor ring surface can increase the loading force while it also can cause the increase of leakage. It is important to select rational roughness when designing gas face seal...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-pressure}} {{ratio and}} a wide operating range are highly required for a turbocharger in diesel engines. Ring groove arrangement is effective for flow range enhancement of centrifugal compressors. Two <b>ring</b> <b>grooves</b> on the suction pipe and the shroud casing wall are connected {{by means of the}} annular passage, and the stable recirculation flow is formed at small flow rates from the downstream groove toward the upstream groove through the annular bypass. It is well known that the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement shows the following two merits; (1) the formation of recirculation flow removes the low energy fluid around the downstream groove located near the splitter blade leading edge, (2) the flow incidence can be reduced because the recirculation flow merges again with the incoming main flow upstream of the impeller inlet.

40|$|Failures in {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion}} engines operating with landfill gas are not uncommon. In general, damage {{is located in}} the combustion chamber surfaces and in the <b>ring</b> <b>grooves,</b> where a layer of non-volatile combustion products is deposited. These deposits attached to the surfaces reduce heat transfer and increase inner temperature, which produces a knocking phenomena damaging the crank bearings and fusing of the piston head material. Lubrication problems also appear due to the formation of a layer of soft paste silicone deposits in the <b>rings</b> <b>grooves,</b> which increases friction losses and accelerates wear on cylinder and rings. In this paper, some typical examples of damaged engines are presented. The deposits found were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–-EDX). Additionally, the engine oil used was also analysed by Infra-Red Spectrometry (IR) and the results were compared with known organo-compounds. A method to detect incipient failure caused by organo-compounds contained in landfill gas is introduced. Silica appears in the layers covering the combustion chamber, as well as silicone compound in the top cylinder zone, piston and <b>ring</b> <b>grooves.</b> Damage is associated with siloxanes (organo-silicon compounds) contained in the landfill gas, which decompose in the combustion chamber, generating silicic acid and formaldehyde under the high temperature conditions throughout the combustion processes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{several studies}} relating to fundamental characterization of CMP consumables in planarization processes. These are also evaluated with {{the purposes of}} minimizing environmental impact and reducing cost of ownership (COO). The first study is conducted to obtain the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> wear rate in a typical ILD CMP process and is specifically intended to investigate the effect of <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> materials and slot designs during the CMP process. The results show that <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> materials have effect on the COF, pad temperature and <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> wear rate, while <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs affect the pad surface abruptness. The second study is performed to compare the effect of different <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs on the slurry film thickness within the pad-wafer interface. A novel non-intrusive optical technique, dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence (DEUVEF), was applied to accurately measure the film thickness of the slurry underneath the wafer during polishing. It is indicated that the optimized <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot design can significantly reduce the COO of CMP processes by increasing slurry utilization. A COF method is applied to measure the slurry mean residence time (MRT) during CMP. This technique uses transient COF data induced by a shift in slurry concentration to determine MRT. Variations in consumables as well as sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate can affect the slurry MRT. One study in this dissertation focus {{on the effect of}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs on the slurry MRT. Another study compares the slurry MRT under same polishing conditions using pads with different groove width. Both studies are conducted on multiple sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate variations to understand the characteristics of consumable designs. The method of measuring MRT during polishing presented in this dissertation can be easily applied in general CMP processes. The subsequent studies focus in the diamond conditioner discs characterization techniques. A newly developed method for determining active diamonds and aggressive diamonds on a diamond conditioner disc under a certain vertical load is elaborated in this dissertation. Later, this technique together with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging is implemented to analyze diamond pullout and fracture in CMP. Five different types of diamond conditioner discs are subjected to a novel accelerated wear test respectively to compare the extent of diamond pullout and fracture under the same conditioning conditio...|$|R
