500|$|The Tagora´s {{handling}} {{was deemed}} [...] "on the good side", wrote Autocar, and performance {{was described as}} [...] "good but not outstanding". As such the car lay [...] "uneasily close to being listed as under-engined" [...] though the authors conceded that generally the Tagora did not feel under-engined when in use. LJK Setright dissented saying the Tagora was as [...] "refined in its ride as should be expected of it" [...] and that [...] "the car also has {{a good deal more}} <b>road-holding</b> and cornering than might be expected". However, in December 1981 Car magazine judged the car (2.2 GLS model) to be prone to [...] "untidy" [...] handling, tending to under-steer first followed by excessive over-steer. The magazine made a particular note of the advantage in handling and grip enjoyed by the older live-axled Volvo 244, underlining the point about the Tagora's lack of advantage in terms of road manners.|$|E
2500|$|Suspension {{was handled}} by double {{wishbones}} {{with coil springs}} and telescopic dampers at the front, and a de Dion tube system with torsion bar springs at the rear. While this arrangement had been state-of-the-art {{in the early years}} of the 1950s, by the time that the DBR4 made its first public appearance most racing car manufacturers were moving to all-round independent suspension, offering better handling, traction and <b>road-holding</b> than the older system employed at the rear of the Aston. [...] The DBR4 was the last new Grand Prix car to use the de Dion system. This same suspension system would be adapted to the DBR3 sports car which was being developed at the same time as the DBR4, but would be abandoned less than a year later when the DBR3 was considered a failure. [...] To bring the car to a halt, Girling disc brakes were fitted all round.|$|E
50|$|The weight {{reduction}} improves {{shock absorber}} response, <b>road-holding</b> comfort, agility, fuel economy, and thus driving comfort.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 the {{instrument}} cluster was modernised, and more importantly, it was fitted with inverted front forks, to improve <b>road-holding</b> and cornering stability.|$|E
50|$|Scooter-type {{motorcycles}} use {{an integrated}} engine-gearbox-final drive system that pivots {{as part of}} the rear suspension and hence is partly unsprung. This arrangement is linked to the use of quite small wheels, further affecting the reputation for <b>road-holding.</b>|$|E
50|$|Underbones {{can have}} spoked or alloy wheels which are spindle mounted, usually the size fitted to small {{conventional}} motorcycles. These provide much better <b>road-holding</b> and braking than scooters, {{though it does}} make the (increasingly rare) punctures more difficult to repair.|$|E
50|$|Sandwiched {{between the}} Great Depression and the Second World War, the 1930s were {{a period of}} decline in {{importance}} for sports car manufacturers, although the period was not devoid of advances, for example streamlining. Cheap, light-weight family saloons with independent front suspension by firms such as BMW, Citroen and Fiat challenged the standards of <b>road-holding</b> and comfort available from much more expensive sports cars. Powerful, reliable and economical (although softly suspended) American saloons began to be imported to Europe in significant numbers. In turn, inexpensive small sports cars, based on popular touring car chassis and suspension (for example Austin and Wolseley) increased ownership of sports cars while not necessarily advancing limitations in engine output and <b>road-holding</b> inherited from their mass-produced components.|$|E
50|$|Gearbox changes {{included}} higher second, {{third and}} top gear ratios, and a reduced angle of gear lever movement {{to make for}} shorter lever travel and snappier changes. New front disc brakes significantly improved the Rapier's braking capability and widened its front track to give greater stability and improved <b>road-holding.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Understeer - {{the front}} wheels tend to crawl {{slightly}} or even slip and drift towards {{the outside of the}} turn. The driver can compensate by turning a little more tightly, but <b>road-holding</b> is reduced, the car's behaviour is less predictable and the tires are liable to wear more quickly.|$|E
50|$|The Imp uses an 875 cc all-aluminium power unit, {{adapted by}} Rootes from a Coventry Climax FWMA fire pump engine which had enjoyed some racing success, but {{significantly}} different {{in areas such}} as cylinder head design. It is mounted behind the rear wheels and canted over at 45°, keeping the centre of gravity low to optimise <b>road-holding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The engine {{displacement}} {{jumped from the}} 2.3 L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5 L, then 3.9 L (1990), 4.0 (1998-2004) with an optional 4.6L (1996-2000) all {{based on the same}} Land Rover block. However, the V-8 was no longer than the Triumph. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its <b>road-holding</b> capability.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{reception}} of the car was broadly favourable. In the June 1970 edition of the Monthly Driver's Gazette, tester Archie Vicar wrote of the gearchange that it was [...] "...in Ford fashion easy to operate but not very jolly". In the same review Vicar summed up the car as follows: [...] "Perhaps {{with a bit of}} work it can be given <b>road-holding</b> and performance less like an American car and more like a European one".|$|E
50|$|The car {{was one of}} {{the first}} of the modern superminis, and won praise for its {{utilisation}} of space (80 percent of the floor space was available for passengers and luggage) as well as its <b>road-holding.</b> It was launched a year before the comparable Renault 5, and before the end of the 1970s most mass market European manufacturers were producing similar cars, notable examples being the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo, while General Motors added a three-door hatchback to the Opel Kadett range, which was reworked for British production and sold as the Vauxhall Chevette.|$|E
5000|$|Excessive load {{transfer}} - On any vehicle that is cornering, the outside wheels are more heavily loaded than the inside {{due to the}} CG being above the ground. Total weight transfer (sum of front and back), in steady cornering, {{is determined by the}} ratio of the height of a car's center of gravity to its axle track. When the weight transfer equals half the vehicle's loaded weight, it will start to roll over. This can be avoided by manually or automatically reducing the turn rate, but this causes further reduction in <b>road-holding.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1951 {{the twin}} seater cabriolet-saloon Champion 400 was {{presented}} with a full width canvas roof reminiscent of the open-topped Fiat Topolino though in other respects the overall architecture of the design remained closer to Wolfsburg than to Turin. [...] The steel bodied car {{was reported to be}} notably more solidly constructed and the suspension had gained both in sophistication and in terms of ride comfort. [...] The weight of the car was now virtually doubled as against the original 250 model, to 520 kg, and <b>road-holding</b> on the corners became more challenging.|$|E
50|$|After Germany fell, Mays {{had access}} to several of the Mercedes and Auto Union designs, {{as well as other}} {{relevant}} German wartime technology. This showed {{in the design of the}} chassis, with Auto Union derived trailing arm suspension at the front and Mercedes inspired de Dion radius arms at the rear. This arrangement did little for the car's <b>road-holding,</b> although few cars of the period handled particularly well. However the car used Lockheed oleo-pneumatic struts in place of the conventional coil spring and damper units, it being thought at the time that this aviation-derived system would become a common road car arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The brakes {{were now}} {{controlled}} using a hydraulic mechanism. The suspension featured synchromous springing, a suspension configuration already {{seen on the}} manufacturer's larger models {{and based on the}} Dubonnet system for which General Motors in France had purchased the license. The General Motors version, which had been further developed by Opel’s North American parent, was intended to provide a soft ride, but there was some criticism that handling and <b>road-holding</b> were compromised, especially when the system was applied to small light-weight cars such as the Kadett. By the end of 1937 33,402 of these first generation Kadetts had been produced.|$|E
50|$|In May 2017 a story {{emerged that}} the car had been bought new for £70,000 in September 1994, and three months later was stolen and driven so hard that it rolled over several times and was found upside down in a field, {{and that it was}} written off and sent for scrap, but was {{recovered}} and repaired and sold, and ended up in the Hôtel Ritz Paris's car pool; and that two months before 30 August 1997 a friend of photographer Pascal Rostain warned the hotel {{that the car}}'s <b>road-holding</b> was bad at speeds over 60 km/h.|$|E
50|$|A {{major problem}} was the effect of their weight on the track of the time. Engines were {{increasing}} in size as more power was needed. Robert Stephenson had developed the Patentee with an extra pair of wheels to distribute the weight. However this brought problems in that the extra length affected <b>road-holding</b> on curves. Such locomotives used a heavy, rigid frame of timber sandwiched between iron plates outside the wheels, plus internal iron sub-frames. Bury adopted a different approach by keeping to two axles and fabricating a bar frame inside the wheels, consisting (on each side) of two wrought-iron bars, a rectangular-section bar above the axle bearings and a round-section bar below.|$|E
50|$|The S4-E {{incorporated}} the technically advanced {{features of the}} S4 DA such as an engine with twin overhead camshaft, hemispherical piston heads with the centrally positioned spark plugs. The chassis featured rack and pinion steering, with independent suspension at the front. However, the front suspension was now refined through the addition of longitudinal torsion bars, an approach probably copied from the Citroën Traction that had appeared the year before. Commentators noted that the new engine and suspension enhancements {{gave rise to a}} combination of performance and <b>road-holding</b> that was among the best in class for the time. Another novelty for the S4-E was a hydraulically controlled brake circuit in place of the then conventional mechanical linkage.|$|E
5000|$|The Times {{motoring}} correspondent {{tested and}} after describing its technical features in detail reviewed the car. Salient comments have been summarised as follows. The four-seater saloon {{was described as}} [...] "distinctly fast in acceleration and speed" [...] with a comfortable body such that a passer-by looks twice at it. A third person could be squeezed into the back seat. The four windows in the four doors allowed a good view all round. It was noted that each front wheel was independently steered and sprung in the manner introduced on the Alvis Crested Eagle and used on Alvis's racing cars since 1925, the aim being to provide good directional stability, <b>road-holding</b> and comfort.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{advances}} {{were made}} with the rear suspension. The previous large Taunus had featured a rigid rear axle, suspended using traditional leaf-springs, but with the TC Ford used a rear suspension configuration involving coil springs, with the axle located using two longitudinal and two lateral linkages. The front wheels, no longer driven, were suspended with a conventional wishbone suspension, which eschewed shock absorbers and gave the car a soft 'freeway' ride and, with the heavier 6-cylinder engines, a tendency to excessive understeer. Press criticism of the trade-off between the car's <b>road-holding</b> and ride-comfort soon evolved into a more general critique, not convincingly addressed by the manufacturer for several years, that Ford had launched the Taunus TC before they had finished developing it.|$|E
50|$|Tyres {{can be no}} {{wider than}} 355 and 380 mm at the rear, front tyre width reduced from 270 mm to 245 mm for the 2010 season. Unlike the fuel, the tyres bear only a {{superficial}} resemblance to a normal road tyre. Whereas a roadcar tyre has a useful life of up to 80000 km, a Formula One tyre does not even last the whole race distance (a little over 300 km); they are usually changed {{two or three times}} per race, depending on the track. This {{is the result of a}} drive to maximise the <b>road-holding</b> ability, leading to the use of very soft compounds (to ensure that the tyre surface conforms to the road surface as closely as possible).|$|E
50|$|It was in Sweden that Parnell shows true British ingenuity. He {{was there}} for the 1947 Swedish Winter Grand Prix at Rommehed, which he duly won, leading an ERA clear sweep of the podium, as the only three cars to finish. Their chief rivals - the French - were {{stranded}} miles away from the circuit, on a ship stuck fast in the ice. The organiser decided to rerun the event as the Stockholm Grand Prix, on Lake Vallentuna. Meanwhile, between the two races Parnell had the idea of fitting twin rear wheels to his ERA to improve its <b>road-holding</b> on the ice. When he arrived at the race, the lead French driver, Raymond Sommer immediately objected but Parnell had checked the rules beforehand and found that there was nothing to preclude twin rear wheels. Despite temperatures of -15° Fahrenheit, Parnell's extra wheels really made the difference, as he skated to victory.|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{was handled}} by double {{wishbones}} {{with coil springs}} and telescopic dampers at the front, and a de Dion tube system with torsion bar springs at the rear.

5000|$|The Dodge Rampage {{was based}} on the popular Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon. Their fuel economy (21 MPG city/29 MPG highway, {{according}} to the EPA) and price were good for the time. The Rampage's front-wheel drive configuration was a source of either love or hate depending on one's preferences. A front-wheel drive layout is not usually used for trucks in North America; however, it gave the Rampage great <b>road-holding</b> and traction when unladen without the [...] "fish-tailing" [...] that comes with most rear-wheel-drive pickups. In short, the Rampage drove less like a truck and more like a compact car. A re-badged version, the Plymouth Scamp, was only sold in 1983. The Rampage lasted three years before being dropped from production after the 1984 model year. There was a [...] "Shelby Rampage" [...] built by Chrysler/Shelby engineers in their free time for Carroll Shelby, but there is no official record of the existence of such a vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Dubbed [...] "Super Hugger", the second-generation Camaro was {{developed}} without {{the rush of}} the first generation and benefited from a greater budget justified by the success {{of the first generation}}. Although it was an all-new car, the basic mechanical layout of the new Camaro was familiar, engineered much like its predecessor with a unibody structure utilizing a front subframe, A-arm and coil spring front suspension, and rear leaf springs.The chassis and suspension of the second generation were greatly refined in both performance and comfort; base models offered significant advances in sound-proofing, ride isolation, and <b>road-holding.</b> Extensive experience Chevrolet engineers had gained racing the first-generation led directly to advances in second-generation Camaro steering, braking, and balance. Although it began its run with a number of high-performance configurations, as the 1970s progressed, the Camaro grew less powerful, succumbing, like many production cars of the era, to the pressures of tightening emissions regulations and a fuel crisis. Major styling changes were made in 1974 and 1978; 1981 was the final model year for the second-generation Camaro.|$|E
50|$|The Alfasud {{was shown}} at the Turin Motor Show three years later in 1971 and was {{immediately}} praised by journalists for its styling. The four-door saloon featured an 1,186 cc Boxer water-cooled engine with a belt-driven overhead camshaft on each cylinder head. It also featured an elaborate suspension setup for a car in its class: (MacPherson struts at the front and a beam axle with Watt's linkage at the rear). Other unusual features for this size of car were four-wheel disc brakes (with the front ones being inboard), and rack and pinion steering. The engine design allowed the Alfasud to have a low bonnet line, making it very aerodynamic for its day, also giving it a low centre of gravity. As {{a result of these}} design features, the car had excellent performance for its engine size, and levels of <b>road-holding</b> and handling that would not be equalled in its class for another ten years. Despite its two-box shape, a hatchback was not initially part of the range. Some of the controls were unorthodox, the lights, turn indicators, horn, wipers and heater fan all being operated by pulling, turning or pushing the two column stalks.|$|E
5000|$|British Motor {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} 130 {{and decided that}} the car´s strong points were excellent handling and <b>road-holding,</b> smooth ride, very high standard of interior and comfort plus an enormous boot. Against the car were its noisy engine, heavy fuel consumption and price. Motor described ultimate cornering power as very high. The UK´s Autocar tested the car and {{described it as a}} dignified Italian. The overall verdict from Autocar was similar to that of Motor, but they added that the brakes were spongy and road noise was obtrusive, though to its credit the car was very well appointed and finished and had first-class visibility. Concerning the handling, the road-testers went on to write, [...] "seldom have we encountered such excellent handling in a car of this size. Its superbly balanced feel inspires tremendous confidence, allowing high averages to be achieved without conscious driver effort". Under a review of the coupe version of the 130, Car described the engine as providing a comfortable level of overall performance with good intermediate range torque. According to Car the saloon had a less-controlled ride than the coupe and less positive handling, the hard-driven saloon getting [...] "more wallowy at times" ...|$|E
50|$|The GP circus {{arrived in}} South Africa in March, at the fast Kyalami circuit between Johannesburg and Pretoria {{in the midst}} of an African summer. Alain Prost crashed his McLaren at the Esses and broke his wrist; he would miss this and the next race in Long Beach; while Marc Surer had it worse - he crashed heavily at Crowthorne and broke his leg; he missed the next 3 races. Like Interlagos before, the even higher {{altitude}} of Kyalami helped the Renaults even more so than in Brazil, and this proved to be an invaluable advantage, and the yellow French cars dominated the race. And as in São Paulo, Jabouille led for a while and retired, and Arnoux took the lead from 2nd place and won the race. However, this race effectively brought the FISA-FOCA war into the spotlight. FISA, the governing body of international motorsports (and the organization that the 3 big constructors - Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo - were aligned to) led by Jean-Marie Balestre, argued that the ground effect cars of the time were too fast through corners, and FOCA (Formula One Constructor's Association, representing the mostly British independent constructors) led by Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley, argued that the superior <b>road-holding</b> of the independent teams' cars equalized their cars to the power advantages that particularly the Renaults had.|$|E
50|$|The 1960s {{also saw}} the swan song of the rear-engined rear-wheel-drive car RR layout. The first models {{designed}} with this layout in Central Europe before the second world war, had better traction than any other two wheel drive car layout. They were very capable in the mountainous country there, that had lots of unsurfaced roads, just how capable was shown by {{the performance of the}} two wheel drive military Kübelwagen version of the VW Beetle. This layout also had better interior space utilisation than front engine rear-wheel-drive cars, and a better ride than those with a live rear beam axle. It was an affordable way to produce a car with all round independent suspension, without the need for expensive constant-velocity joints needed by front-wheel-drive cars, or axle arrangements of FR layout cars. They could have <b>road-holding</b> issues due to unfavorable weight distribution and wheel camber changes (rear wheel tuck under), of the lower-cost swing axle rear suspension design. These were highlighted and a little exaggerated by Ralph Nader. These problems were ameliorated on later Beetles and were eliminated on the second-generation Chevrolet Corvair with the switch to a four-link, fully independent rear suspension. The Hillman Imp, NSU Prinz and Soviet Zaporozhets all had styling cues derived from the original Corvair. Connections to the Corvair are mentioned on their respective Wikipages. The only economy cars with this layout launched since the 1960s have been the turn of the millennium ultra compact two seater city car Smart Fortwo and Indian market Tata Nano.|$|E
5000|$|... "The 250GT Ferrari {{must surely}} {{represent}} {{the ultimate in}} modern high-speed sporting travel, or GT competition, and holds today a position similar to the Bugatti 57SC of 1939.

[...] MOTOR SPORT, March 1963.1953 saw the first serious attempt to series produce the Ferrari motor car, two models of the Type 250 Europa being produced. The cars were an evolution of the previous models, available with either the Colombo or Lampredi versions of the 250 V12 engine, coil spring front suspension, an improved sports gearbox (four speeds) with Porsche synchromesh, large drum brakes and luxurious outfitting. A few appeared in motorsports but did not initially threaten the international Mercedes-Benz 300 SL and Porsche 356 competition. [...] "In the Mille Miglia of 1956 the first of the lightweight Grand Touring coupés, driven by Gendebien, battled with the Mercedes 300SL of Metternich and Einsendel to come in fifth overall and first in G.T. over 2,000 c.c. The G.T. Ferrari had arrived!" [...] MOTOR SPORT, March 1963.After its 1956 debut, the 250 GT [...] "went from strength to strength". Powered by the Colombo 250 engine, output was up to 240 b.h.p. at 7,000 r.p.m. A short-wheelbase (SWB) version of the 250 chassis was employed for improved handling and <b>road-holding</b> in corners, and top speed was up to 157 m.p.h. In 1957 Gendebien finished third overall in the Mille Miglia, and won the [...] "index of performance". Alfonso de Portago won the Tour de France and GT races at Montlhéry and Castelfusano in a lightweight Carrozzeria Scaglietti 250 GT. Gendebien became a gran turismo specialist in 250 GTs when he wasn't driving sports racing Ferrari Testa Rossas ("Red Heads" [...] for their red engine covers), achieving success in both the Giro Sicilia and Tour de France.|$|E
5000|$|In many ways, the Triumph 1300 was {{a failed}} venture for Triumph and Leyland, as {{management}} resources {{were focused on}} finding replacements for the successful but ageing Austin-Morris models. Their Triumph-badged 'in-house' competitor failed to achieve anything like the sales figures of the BMC small FWD cars, though {{it should be pointed}} out that the BMC 1100 range featured several badge-engineered variants. Moreover, the front wheel drive configuration failed to realise the handling and <b>road-holding</b> advantages that Triumph had hoped for, and the tall profile limited other uses for the FWD drive train, such as in the Spitfire. The 1300 was well-made and sold reasonably well in the small luxury sector, but after its direct successor was quietly switched to rear wheel drive in 1973, Triumph never designed another FWD car. More significantly, from 1970 the 1300 was re-engineered as a rear-wheel drive car and went on to form the core of Triumph's compact range as the 1300 cc Triumph Toledo (launched in 1971) and the larger engined Triumph Dolomite released in 1972. Like all Standard-Triumph offerings, DIY servicing was simple: the oil filter could be replaced without jacking the car, the clutch plate could be replaced from inside the car, and unlike the Mini-based vehicles, changing CV joints was a three-spanner operation. This simplicity is what made this vehicle stand out from other British made front wheel drive cars. The N/S engine configuration allowed a lot of working space around the engine. The starter was repositioned to the front of the engine and although was a two minute job to replace, it made the car extremely noisy during startup. It takes its place in history as being the only production car made in Britain to begin life as a front-wheel drive, and end it as a rear-wheel drive until Leyland's successor, MG Rover, repeated the trick in turning the Rover 75 into the MG ZT 260. The Achilles heel of the 1300 was, primarily the poorly designed suspension wishbone layout and the front stabilizers. The engine was too heavy for this particular design and owners found it very frustrating as the rubber bushes had to be changed every few months. Triumph's alternative engineering design answer to the E/W Mini configuration, was a catastrophic failure. The 1300 was also assembled in Israel by the local partner of Standard-Triumph International, Autocars Co. of Tirat Carmel. However, due to the Israeli government's ridiculous policy regarding car assembly, Triumph was forced to introduce this vehicle in a 1493 cc version in early 1968, two years ahead of this engine's introduction in the UK. In fact, it was not until another Israeli assembler, Illin Industries, had shut down operations before Triumph could assemble the 1300 in Israel. One curious design offshoot of the 1300 was the [...] "Pony" [...] jeep-like farm vehicle, later renamed [...] "Dragoon". The Pony was exclusively offered for Autocars within the joint venture contract, but very few units were actually produced in Israel, as of 1968. The same 4WD-design was used in a rally version of the Triumph 1300. The rally project enjoyed some success before the vehicle crashed and rolled in 1969. The 4WD Triumph 1300 was subsequently abandoned.Although the FWD 1300 was something of a disappointment, the basic design went on to provide Triumph with a popular small car until the end of Dolomite production in 1980 and overall, delivered an outstanding return on their original investment.|$|E
