40|$|I N A {{paper on}} arctic ice islands (Koenig et al., 1952) {{it was pointed}} out chat surface rolls are {{characteristic}} features of both the Ellesmere Ice Shelf and the floating ice islands.

Comparison of <b>roll</b> <b>patterns</b> of other ice islands with the <b>roll</b> <b>pattern</b> on the ice shelf may indicate the exact areas from which the ice islands have calved.

Steady longitudinal rolls are obtained numerically. In a bifurcation diagram in which A is changed as a bifurcation parameter, the roll solution forms a single-valued branch when the Rayleigh number Ra exceeds but is still close to the critical value. When Ra is relatively higher, the solution branch has a folded structure, that is, it can be triple-valued. The secondary instability of the roll solution with respect to two-dimensional disturbances is investigated. The roll solutions with a certain symmetry {{are found to be}} linearly stable.

40|$|International audienceThe {{secondary}} instability {{mode and}} {{transition to a}} weak chaotic regime in a one-dimensional <b>roll</b> <b>pattern</b> have been investigated in the Taylor-Dean system. The spatiotemporal modulation of a <b>roll</b> <b>pattern,</b> called a triplet state in Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 1729 1990, is quantitatively characterized using the demodulation technique by the Hilbert transform. A triplet pattern arises from the primary structure by a periodic modulation of the phase both in space and time. The amplitude of the modulation, chosen as an order parameter, has been measured, and it grows as a square root of the reduced control parameter. The correlation length and time of the triplet pattern are maximal near the threshold, and decrease to values comparable to the size and period of a triplet in the chaotic regime. In the chaotic regime, regular oscillations of triplets are observed with a finite frequency, suggesting a phase modulation of the triplet pattern itself. S 1063 - 651 X 9802209 -...|$|R

When the fluid layer thickness is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer depth, the azimuthal velocity axial gradient is nearly constant and this rotating disk flow is a torsional Couette flow. As in the plane Couette flow or the cylindrical Couette flow, transition to turbulence occurs via the appearance of turbulent domains inside a laminar background. Nevertheless, we show that in the rotating disk case, the nucleation of turbulent spirals is connected to the birth of structural defects in a periodic underlying spiral <b>roll</b> <b>pattern...</b>|$|R
