The isolation of nine additional <b>rotenoid</b> derivatives (3 - 11), including the new boeravinones I (10) and J (11), from the extract of B. diffusa roots allowed us to establish structure-activity relationships toward inhibition of BCRP-mediated drug transport activity.

40|$|Rotenone and rotenoid-containing botanicals, {{important}} insecticides {{and fish}} poisons, {{are reported to}} have anticancer activity in rats and mice. The toxic action of rotenone is attributed to inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and the purported cancer chemopreventive effect of deguelin analogs {{has been associated with}} inhibition of phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. This study defines a possible relationship between these two types of activity important in evaluating the toxicology of <b>rotenoid</b> pesticides and the suitability of the anticancer model. Fractionation of cubé resin (the commercial <b>rotenoid</b> pesticide) establishes that the activity in both assays is due primarily to rotenone (IC 50 = 0. 8 – 4 nM), secondarily to deguelin, and in small part to rotenolone and tephrosin. In addition, the potency of 29 rotenoids from cubé insecticide for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in vitro assayed with bovine heart electron transport particles satisfactorily predicts their potency in vivo in the induced ODC assay using noncytotoxic <b>rotenoid</b> concentrations with cultured MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells (r = 0. 86). Clearly the molecular features of rotenoids essential for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase are similar to those for blocking ODC induction. This apparent correlation extends to 11 flavonoids and stilbenoids from cubé resin (r = 0. 98) and genistein and resveratrol except for lower potency and less selectivity than the rotenoids relative to cytotoxicity. These findings on cubé insecticide constituents and our earlier study comparing rotenone and pyridaben miticide indicate that inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity lowers the level of induced ODC activity leading to the antiproliferative effect and anticancer action...|$|E
