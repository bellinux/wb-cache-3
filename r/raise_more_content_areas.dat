To determine the factors that contribute to or compromise the effectiveness of multiscored items, in this study we combine analysis of statewide score data from the 1996 Maryland School Performance Assessment Program tests, administered at Grades 3, 5, and 8, with systematic analysis of 60 activities providing measures of writing, language usage (LU), or both, as well as one or <b>more</b> <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> Although test developers to date have had greater success in creating writing/LU items that can also be scored for reading and social studies than for mathematics and science, we ar-gue for the validity of multiple-measure items across all <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> and suggest that, across <b>content</b> <b>areas,</b> successful multiple-measure items (a) make information sources explicit and allow students to draw on both text-based and personal knowl-edge; (b) identify the specific <b>content</b> <b>area</b> skills or concepts being assessed; (c) per-mit open-ended development; (d) maintain a good fit between content demands and the rhetorical situation, creating an authentic writer–audience relationship; and (e) are uncluttered, focused, and direct, with good recall capability.

Students in this model will often spend “blocks” of time with their teachers, which are parsed into content instruction.

30|$|In {{comparison}} to the self-contained model, models of ECS allow teachers to focus on fewer <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> Teachers in model A only specialize in one <b>content</b> <b>area,</b> thereby “giving up” one <b>content</b> <b>area</b> to their team partner. This relieves them of one <b>content</b> <b>area,</b> placing this model slightly below self-contained on the continuum (Fig.  1). Teachers in models B, C, and E have fewer <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> on which to focus, because they either specialize in <b>more</b> than one <b>content</b> <b>area</b> (B, some E) or teach more classes of students (C, some E), thus relieving them of additional <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> The lowest on this continuum are models D and F, in which teachers are responsible for very few <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> Most specialists in models D and F are responsible for one <b>content</b> <b>area,</b> although this number may be slightly higher for some specialists.|$|R
30|$|Model D is also {{characterized}} by three teachers sharing three classes {{of students at}} the same grade level.

Our sample includes two EMS {{who are responsible for}} mathematics instruction for three classes every day of the school year and two ESS who are responsible for both science and social studies. Rather than dividing a daily instructional block between two <b>content</b> <b>areas,</b> ESS alternate one unit or time period (e.g., semester or quarter) of science with one unit or time period of social studies.

METHODS: Site visits were conducted at eight partner schools in 1999 and 2001. Written proposals, progress reports, and final reports of 18 schools were reviewed. Senior medical students 2 ̆ 7 responses to questionnaires, including the annual Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire and a UME- 21 supplemental graduation questionnaire, were analyzed.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} {{of popular music}} as a <b>content</b> <b>area</b> in music education is not uncommon. The musicological study of popular music is well established in higher education, and even the practice of popular music is becoming more common in both secondary education and the post-compulsory sector. However, when this occurs, {{it is likely to}} be taught in more or less the same way as other <b>more</b> established <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> like western classical music or jazz, with teachers being in control of the process and the curriculum, the feedback and the assessment. But popular music is usually learned in the broader community as a self-directed activity, sometimes including interactions with peers and group activities, but rarely under the direction of an expert mentor/teacher. One Australian conservatorium has adopted the pedagogy of popular music through the creation of a scaffolded self-directed learning environment within its bachelor of popular music program. This paper argues that the pedagogical approach employed in this program relates well to the prior learning activities of its students. It draws on the results of a survey of the learning experiences of students before they entered this program, as a background to subsequent research into their participation in two course activities that provide opportunities for the provision feedback to peers. The study draws on data from surveys, on-line participation in the provision of work-in-progress feedback, and written feedback provided as part of formal assessment. Students are found to have usually engaged with multiple musical activities and used a variety of ways to enhance their musical abilities before commencing their conservatoire studies. These characteristics are also found to be present in students' engagement with their degree studies. The paper concludes that these students are well prepared for this kind of peer learning activity and provide useful feedback through the structures provided by the program.

In my work with <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teachers, they have expressed the need for support as they try new literacy strategies when engaging students in content material. Literacy skills are a part of all <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> Therefore, literacy scholars need an ongoing understanding of how content teachers define and perceive literacy in their <b>content</b> <b>area</b> in order to provide this support. Framed within a sociocultural lens (Vygotsky, 1978), this action research study (Schmuck, 2006) examined how high school <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teachers engaged students in reading content material as they implemented literacy strategies to support students’ access to content. Guiding this study were the following questions: (a) How do <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teachers define and perceive literacy and specifically define literacy in their <b>content</b> <b>area?</b> (b) How do teachers use literacy strategies they learn in professional development sessions? (c) Is there a benefit when a literacy specialist and a <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teacher collaborate to design literacy instruction? Participants in this study included three <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teachers: a math teacher, a business teacher, and English teacher.

Strategies for teaching multilevel models for each type of data are discussed. The first, a panel study, uses multiple linear regression models to show how a hierarchical linear model can be developed. The second, a repeated cross-sectional design, uses simple analysis of variance models to show how a random coefficients model can be fit to the data. Complex multilevel models may be easier to understand and apply when broken down into these more familiar strategies. Analyses are presented using the HLM program and SAS.

In most applied multivariate statistics courses, students are typically instructed in the analysis of repeated measures data through multivariate or univariate analysis of variance models.

This experimental research was carried out in MAN 1 Bojonegoro in the academic year of 2012 / 2013 from September to November 2012. The population was the first semester of Rintisan Madrasah Bertaraf Internasional (RMBI) students in the academic year of 2012 / 2013. The number of population was three classes (72 students) that consisted of XI-Bilingual 1, XI- Bilingual 2, and XI-Bilingual 3. The samples were XI-Bilingual 2 as the experimental group and XI-Bilingual 3 as the control group. Each group consisted of 24 students. The experimental group was treated by using Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR) Strategy, while the control group was treated by using Lecturing Strategy. The post-test was conducted in form <b>content</b> <b>area</b> reading comprehension test. Before the <b>content</b> <b>area</b> reading comprehension test was administered to the both groups, it was firstly tried out to non-sample class to know the validity and the reliability of the test. Then, the data from the post-test were described using descriptive statistics and were tested their normality and homogeneity.

Heather Robyn Azevedo 2009 Master of Arts in Education Reading/Language Arts Option California State University, Chico Summer 2009 This {{project is}} {{designed}} to help <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teachers assist the students in their class that are currently two to four grade levels behind in reading and build sufficient literacy skills to be able to succeed in those classes. The project contains an annotated bibliography identifying resources in <b>content</b> <b>area</b> literacy, and strategies suggested by research to decrease the overall reading gap between student???s current level of reading performance and the reading requirements of <b>content</b> <b>area</b> classes. The review of the literature provides a rationale {{for the development of a}} competent <b>content</b> <b>area</b> literacy program. In Chapter II the literature describes the reading process and how teaching reading differs throughout grade levels and Chapter III examines reading strategies and how they can be applied within the <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> In x addition, it provides further reviews of methods for teaching content reading skills that recent research recommends. This project was created based on the information obtained from the literature review, and the data collected which provided evidence of those students who are currently reading two to four grades levels below the reading level expectations for their <b>content</b> <b>area</b> classes. The literature, data, and collaboration with <b>content</b> <b>area</b> teachers indicated that there was a need for additional reading support within the <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> In order to assist these students, this handbook is intended to be used to assist teachers and other staff, which provides students with strategies that are easily and readily applied to their <b>content</b> <b>area</b> reading requirements. The handbook is divided into three sections: an annotated bibliography, a description of reading/thinking skills, and nine universal strategies for assisting students with their <b>content</b> <b>areas</b> reading requirements. The research portion of the handbook is an annotated bibliography meant to serve as additional reference for the teacher who may want to further explore content reading strategies beyond those provided in the handbook associated with this project. The reading/thinking section of the handbook {{is designed to}} illustrate the skills that students need to use before, during, after and beyond reading as well as explaining the importance of this process and how these skills make students more conscious of their reading. The final section includes nine universal strategies that can be used within the <b>content</b> <b>areas.</b> A brief background of each strategy will be given, along with the purpose of the strategy. This segment will then be followed with examples of how the strategy can be used within each <b>content</b> <b>area.</b> xi Recommendations for further development of this handbook include continued review of current literature, maintaining suggested strategies and diagnostic information throughout each school year in order to be assured that student needs are being addressed. It is also suggested that primary and elementary teachers who have students reading below grade level, and who need to develop content reading skills, refer to the handbook for some additional support and strategies.
