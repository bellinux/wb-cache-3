25|$|Both minimum <b>recycled</b> <b>content</b> {{mandates}} {{and utilization}} rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations.

Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob industry of necessary flexibility.|$|E

The Social Sciences Building that cost {{a grand total of}} $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work. This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities. This building is very different among the rest of the university’s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their <b>recycled</b> <b>content,</b> a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof. The green wall is the tallest living biofilter wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building’s air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn’t need to be artificially introduced.|$|E

During Jordan's 10-year tenure the university received [...] of land in 1972 from the Hoblitzelle Foundation and the campus expanded {{with the addition of}} a number of new facilities including the Hoblitzelle Hall, Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded. Prior to 1975 only graduate students were enrolled. Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students. The university's first bachelor's degree was awarded at the school's spring commencement in 1976. The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences). Also in 1975, the School of Management opened and has become the university's largest and offers programs at the undergraduate, graduate and executive levels. UT Dallas's first Nobel laureate, the late Polykarp Kusch, was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982. When he retired, the university endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme Concerns of the Lively Mind in his honor. Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the Rutford Ice Stream and Mount Rutford in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982. Rutford served as head of the university until 1994. During his tenure as president, the university secured approval for a school of engineering, added freshmen and sophomores to its student body and built the first on-campus housing. UT Dallas school of engineering opened in 1986 due to the efforts of business, community and education leaders. The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science is now the second-largest school at the university. By its 20th anniversary, in 1989, enrollment at UT Dallas topped 8,000. In 1990, the Texas Legislature authorized the university to admit freshman and sophomore students. [...] The Dallas philanthropist Peter O'Donnell had pushed for expansion of the university into a four-year institution. The Arts and Technology Building at UT-Dallas was named in 2013 in honor of O'Donnell's wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell. It was designed by VAI Architects and STUDIOS Architecture.

Nine concrete mixtures with different <b>recycled</b> aggregates <b>contents</b> and with different water to binder (w/b) ratio were studied. The mean compressive strength for the reference concretes is comprised between 30 and 60 MPa. Tests were performed to measure compressive strength, porosity, chloride diffusion and gas permeability. The results indicated that the porosity of recycled aggregates concrete strongly depends on <b>recycled</b> aggregates <b>contents.</b> Chloride diffusion and permeability are also modified.

The results indicated that, during 2 h of CO 2 curing period, the moisture content and aggregate to cement ratio of the prepared blocks had significant effects on the CO 2 curing degree and the compressive strength. Appropriate pre-drying of the block specimens before CO 2 curing enabled the maximum curing degree, and the compressive strength attained was comparable or superior {{to that of the}} 6 h steam cured blocks.
