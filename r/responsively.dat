25|$|Baley {{furthermore}} {{proposes that}} the Solarians {{may one day}} use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more <b>responsively</b> and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant. This possibility is referenced in Foundation and Earth where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} of Broomfield was incorporated in 1961 {{in the southeastern}} corner of Boulder County. While it is unsure how it received its name, most researchers guess it's from the broomcorn grown in the area. Over the next three decades, the city grew through annexations, many of which crossed the county line into three adjacent counties: Adams, Jefferson and Weld. In the 1990s, city leaders began to push {{for the creation of}} a separate county to avoid the inefficiencies of dealing with four separate court districts, four different county seats, and four separate county sales tax bases. It also had longstanding political differences with Boulder County, which impelled it to separate. Broomfield reasoned that it could provide services more <b>responsively</b> under its own county government, and sought an amendment to the Colorado State Constitution to create a new county. The amendment was passed in 1998, after which a three-year transition period followed. On November 15, 2001, Broomfield County became the 64th, newest, and smallest county of Colorado. It is also the newest county in the United States (if not including county equivalents).|$|E
2500|$|Kaddish Yatom (heb. [...] lit. [...] "Orphan's Kaddish") or the [...] "Mourner's" [...] Kaddish, is said at all prayer services, {{as well as}} at {{funerals}} and memorials. [...] Customs for {{reciting the}} Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. [...] In many Ashkenazi synagogues, particularly Orthodox ones, it is customary that everyone in the synagogue stands. [...] In Sephardi synagogues, most people sit for most sayings of Kaddish. In many non-Orthodox Ashkenaz ones, the custom is that only the mourners themselves stand and chant, {{while the rest of the}} congregation sits, chanting only <b>responsively.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{relative}} {{certainty of}} the measurements and current state estimate {{is an important}} consideration, and {{it is common to}} [...] discuss the response of the filter in terms of the Kalman filter's gain. The Kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate, and can be [...] "tuned" [...] to achieve particular performance. With a high gain, the filter places more weight on the most recent measurements, and thus follows them more <b>responsively.</b> With a low gain, the filter follows the model predictions more closely. At the extremes, a high gain close to one will result in a more jumpy estimated trajectory, while low gain close to zero will smooth out noise but decrease the responsiveness.|$|E
2500|$|While at Yale, Shevlin also {{developed}} {{a passion for the}} new sport of automobile racing. [...] In early 1905, he purchased a $15,000 French automobile and spent considerable time racing it throughout New England. [...] He twice left New Haven racing to beat the express train to Meriden, Connecticut. [...] On the second occasion, the mayor of Meriden saw Shevlin [...] "whirling riotously into town" [...] and set the police after him. [...] A Meriden police officer was tasked with finding Shevlin and followed his trail for two days. [...] The pursuit was unsuccessful, but Shevlin turned himself in after hearing that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. [...] Shevlin paid a $40 fine and returned to New Haven. [...] Shevlin drew a further fine when he and a friend drove an automobile [...] "at furious pace" [...] up and down past the dormitories of Smith College as young women [...] "waved <b>responsively</b> to the reckless autoing." ...|$|E

60|$|The Lammles were {{so fond of}} {{the dear}} Veneerings {{that they could not}} for some time detach {{themselves}} from those excellent friends; but at length, either a very open smile on Mr Lammle's part, or a very secret elevation of one of his gingerous eyebrows--certainly the one or the other--seemed to say to Mrs Lammle, 'Why don't you play?' And so, looking about her, she saw Miss Podsnap, and seeming to say <b>responsively,</b> 'That card?' and to be answered, 'Yes,' went and sat beside Miss Podsnap.|$|E

"Mademoiselle Davidoff," [...] the Baron {{began in}} French, with a {{lingering}} cadence as he pronounced her name, and a faint tremor {{in his voice}} that thrilled <b>responsively</b> through her inmost being; [...] "Mademoiselle Davidoff, I have been waiting long for this opportunity of speaking to you alone, because I have something of some importance--to me at least, mademoiselle--about which I wish to confer with you.

60|$|This {{resolution}} he intimated with a yawn, resistless {{as that of}} the Goddess in the Dunciad, {{which was}} <b>responsively</b> echoed by his giant sons, as they dispersed in quest of the pastimes to which their minds severally inclined them--Percie to discuss a pot of March beer with the steward in the buttery,--Thorncliff to cut a pair of cudgels, and fix them in their wicker hilts,--John to dress May-flies,--Dickon to play at pitch and toss by himself, his right hand against his left,--and Wilfred to bite his thumbs and hum himself into a slumber which should last till dinner-time, if possible.

60|$|The {{week before}} Christmas {{the sky had}} {{smoothed}} away its every trace of rain. Light snows had sugared the feathery outlines of the distant peaks, and the delighted tourist had hung up his mackintosh and umbrella, deciding that the climates of Southern France and Italy {{were not to be}} considered with that of Southern California. Now the clouds had returned reÃ«nforced. The range had grown richer in color, almost black, except when the sun shot for a moment his presence in temporary triumph against a spur, that glistened <b>responsively,</b> while the caÃ±ons scowled in dark disapproval. Then, all at once, a gloom, like a half-dropped curtain, settled back of the foothills, defying the prophecies of the most ancient mariner of the Coast.|$|E
6000|$|There isn't much {{in those}} two words; {{but they may be}} {{pronounced}} with a good deal of difference in the intonation; and Isaline's intonation did not leave one in much doubt as to how she used them.

60|$|He rose, and, {{approaching}} the table, leaned both {{his elbows on}} it; Lakamba <b>responsively</b> edged his seat a little closer, while Babalatchi scrambled {{to his feet and}} thrust his inquisitive head between his master's and Dain's. They interchanged their ideas rapidly, speaking in whispers into each other's faces, very close now, Dain suggesting, Lakamba contradicting, Babalatchi conciliating and anxious in his vivid apprehension of coming difficulties. He spoke most, whispering earnestly, turning his head slowly from side to side so as to bring his solitary eye to bear upon each of his interlocutors in turn. Why should there be strife? said he. Let Tuan Dain, whom he loved only less than his master, go trustfully into hiding. There were many places for that. Bulangi's house away in the clearing was best.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Vanderbank all <b>responsively,</b> [...] "but it isn't {{as if you}} {{proposed}} to me, is it, anything dreadful? If one cares for a girl one's deucedly glad she has money. The more of anything good she has the better. I may assure you," [...] he added with the brightness of his friendly intelligence and quite as if to show his companion the way to be least concerned--"I may assure you that once I were disposed to act on your suggestion I'd make short work of any vulgar interpretation of my motive. I should simply {{try to be as}} fine as yourself." [...] He smoked, he moved about, then came up in another place. [...] "I dare say you know that dear old Mitchy, under whose blessed roof we're plotting this midnight treason, would marry her like a shot and without a penny." ...|$|E
60|$|Cable {{has been}} here, {{creating}} worshipers on all hands. He is a marvelous talker on a deep subject. I {{do not see}} how even Spencer could unwind a thought more smoothly or orderly, and {{do it in a}} cleaner, clearer, crisper English. He astounded Twichell with his faculty. You know {{when it comes down to}} moral honesty, limpid innocence, and utterly blemishless piety, the Apostles were mere policemen to Cable; so with this in mind you must imagine him at a midnight dinner in Boston the other night, where we gathered around the board of the Summerset Club; Osgood, full, Boyle O'Reilly, full, Fairchild <b>responsively</b> loaded, and Aldrich and myself possessing the floor, and properly fortified. Cable told Mrs. Clemens when he returned here, that he seemed to have been entertaining himself with horses, and had a dreamy idea that he must have gone to Boston in a cattle-car. It was a very large time. He called it an orgy. And no doubt it was, viewed from his standpoint.|$|E
6000|$|This new {{instalment}} of your admirable {{book has}} held me so tight, from chapter to chapter, {{that it is}} as if I were hanging back from mere force of appreciation, and yet I found myself, as I read, vibrating <b>responsively,</b> in so many different ways, that my emotions carried me at the same time all over the place. You of course know far better than I how you have dealt with your material; but I doubt whether you know what a work of civilization you are perpetrating internationally by the very fact of your producing so exquisite a work of art. The American, the Englishman, the artist, and the critic in me--to say nothing of the friend!--all drink you down in a deep draught, each in turn feeling that he is more deeply concerned. But it is of course, as with the other volume, the book's being so richly and authoritatively English, so validly true, and yet so projected as it were into the American consciousness, that will help to build the bridge across the Atlantic; and I think it is the mystery of this large fusion, carried out in so many ways, that makes the thing so distinguished a work of art; yet who shall say, so familiarly--when a thing is such a work of art--I mean who shall say how it has, by a thousand roads, got itself made so? ...|$|E
6000|$|Ozias Midwinter, {{recovering}} from brain-fever, was a startling object to contemplate {{on a first}} view of him. His shaven head, tied up in an old yellow silk handkerchief; his tawny, haggard cheeks; his bright brown eyes, preternaturally large and wild; his rough black beard; his long, supple, sinewy fingers, wasted by suffering till they looked like claws--all tended to discompose the rector {{at the outset of}} the interview. When the first feeling of surprise had worn off, the impression that followed it was not an agreeable one. Mr. Brock could not conceal from himself that the stranger's manner was against him. The general opinion has settled that, if a man is honest, he is bound to assert it by looking straight at his fellow-creatures when he speaks to them. If this man was honest, his eyes showed a singular perversity in looking away and denying it. Possibly they were affected in some degree by a nervous restlessness in his organization, which appeared to pervade every fiber in his lean, lithe body. The rector's healthy Anglo-Saxon flesh crept <b>responsively</b> at every casual movement of the usher's supple brown fingers, and every passing distortion of the usher's haggard yellow face. [...] "God forgive me!" [...] thought Mr. Brock, with his mind running on Allan and Allan's mother, [...] "I wish I could see my way to turning Ozias Midwinter adrift in the world again!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{country through}} which we made the hour's run was sympathetically squalid. We had, to be sure, the sea on one side, and that was clean enough; but the day was gray, and the sea was <b>responsively</b> gray; while the earth {{on the other side}} was torn and ragged, with people digging manure into the patches of broccoli, and {{gardening}} away {{as if it had been}} April instead of January. There were shabby villas, with stone-pines and cypresses herding about the houses, and tatters of life-plant overhanging their shabby walls; there were stucco shanties which the men and women working in the fields would lurk in at nightfall. At places there was some cheerful boat building, and at one place there was a large macaroni manufactory, with far stretches of the product dangling in hanks and skeins from rows of trellises. We passed through towns where women and children swarmed, working at doorways and playing in the dim, cold streets; from the balconies everywhere winter melons hung in nets, dozens and scores of them, such as you can buy at the Italian fruiterers' in New York, and will keep buying when once you know how good they are. In Naples they sell them by the slice in the street, the fruiterer carrying a board on his head with the slices arranged in an upright coronal like the rich, barbaric head-dress of some savage prince.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you." [...] He {{had found}} at his command {{a tone that}} made him feel more gentlemanlike {{than he had ever}} felt in his life or should doubtless ever feel again. It might have been enough--but somehow as they stood there with this immense {{clearance}} between them it wasn't. The clearance was like a sudden gap or great bleak opening through which there blew upon them a deadly chill. Too many things had fallen away, too many new rolled up and over him, and they made something within shake him to his base. It upset the full vessel, and though she kept her eyes on him he let that consequence come, bursting into tears, weakly crying there before her even as he had cried to himself in the hour of his youth when she had made him groundlessly fear. She turned away then--that she couldn't watch, and had presently flung herself on the sofa and, all <b>responsively</b> wailing, buried her own face on the cushioned arm. So for a minute their smothered sobs only filled the room. But he made out, through this disorder, where he had put down his hat; his stick and his new tan-coloured gloves--they had cost two-and-thruppence and would have represented sacrifices--were on the chair beside it He picked these articles up and all silently and softly--gasping, that is, but quite on tiptoe--reached the door and let himself out.|$|E
6000|$|The {{object of}} this design hovered there again, {{considerably}} restless, shifting {{from foot to}} foot, changing his place, beginning and giving up motions, striking matches for a fresh cigarette, offering them again, redundantly, to his guest and then not lighting himself--but all the while with the smile of another creature than the creature known to Mark; all the while {{with the history of}} something that had happened to him ever so handsomely shining out. Mark was conscious within himself from this time on of two quite distinct processes of notation--that of his practically instant surrender to the consequences of the act of perception in his host of which the two women trained suppos-ably in the art of pleasing had been altogether incapable; and that of some other condition on Newton's part that left his own poor power of divination nothing less than shamed. This last was signally the case on the former's saying, ever so <b>responsively,</b> almost radiantly, in answer to his account of how he happened to come: [...] "Oh then it's very interesting!" [...] That was the astonishing note, after what he had been through: neither Mrs. Folliott nor Florence Ash had so much as hinted or breathed to him that he might have incurred that praise. No wonder therefore he was now taken--with this fresh party's instant suspicion and imputation of it; though it was indeed for some minutes next as if each tried to see which could accuse the other of the greater miracle of penetration. Mark was so struck, in a word, with the extraordinarily straight guess Winch had had there in reserve for him that, other quick impressions helping, there was nothing for him but to bring out, himself: [...] "There must be, my dear man, something rather wonderful the matter with you!" [...] The quite more intensely and more irresistibly drawn grin, the quite unmistakably deeper consciousness in the dark, wide eye, that accompanied the not quite immediate answer to which remark he was afterward to remember. [...] "How do you know that--or why do you think it?" [...] "Because there must be--for you to see! I shouldn't have expected it." ...|$|E
6000|$|They all enjoyed, in fine, while I somehow but wastefully mused--which {{was after}} all my form of enjoyment; I was shy for it, {{though it was}} a truth and perhaps odd enough withal, that I didn't really at all care for gems, that rubies and pearls, in no matter what collocations, left me {{comparatively}} cold; that I actually cared for them about as little as, monstrously, secretly, painfully, I cared for flowers. Later on I was to become aware that I [...] "adored" [...] trees and architectural marbles--that for a sufficient slab of a sufficiently rare, sufficiently bestreaked or empurpled marble in particular I would have given a bag of rubies; but by then the time had passed for my being troubled to make out what in that case would represent on a small boy's part the corruptibility, so to call it, proclaimed, before the vitrines, by the cousins. That hadn't, as a question, later on, its actuality; but it had so much at the time that if it had been frankly put to me I must have quite confessed my inability to say--and must, I gather, by the same stroke, have been ashamed of such inward penury; feeling that as a boy I showed more poorly than girls. There was a difference meanwhile for such puzzlements before the porticos of the theatres; all questions melted for me there into the single depth of envy--envy of the equal, the beatific command of the evening hour, in the rÃ©gime of Honorine's young train, who were fresh for the early sparrow and the chiffonier even after shedding buckets of tears the night before, and not so much as for the first or the second time, over the beautiful story of La Dame aux CamÃ©lias. There indeed was another humiliation, but by my weakness of position much more than of nature: whatever doing of [...] "everything" [...] might have been revealed to me as a means to the end, I would certainly have done it for a sight of Madame Doche and Fechter in Dumas's triumphant idyll--now enjoying the fullest honours of innocuous classicism; with which, as with the merits of its interpreters, Honorine's happy charges had become perfectly and if not quite serenely, at least ever so <b>responsively</b> and feelingly, familiar. Of a wondrous mixed sweetness and sharpness and queerness of uneffaced reminiscence is all that aspect of the cousins and the rambles and the overlapping nights melting along the odorously bedamped and retouched streets and arcades; bright in the ineffable morning light, above all, of our peculiar young culture and candour! ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took down}} Ann Veronica in deep rich {{draughts}} {{during the two}} days following your magnanimous [...] "donation" [...] of her, and yet have waited till now to vibrate to you visibly and audibly under that pressed spring. I never vibrated under anything of yours, on the whole, I think, more than during that intense inglutition; but if I have been hanging fire of acclamation and comments, as I hung it, to my complete self-stultification and beyond recovery, over Tono-Bungay, it is simply because, confound you, {{there is so much}} too much to say, always, after everything of yours; and the critical principle so rages within me (by which I mean the appreciative, the real gustatory,) that I tend to labour under the superstition that one must always say all. But I can't do that, and I won't--so that I almost intelligently and coherently choose, which simplifies a little the question. And nothing matters after {{the fact that you are}} to me so much the most interesting representational and ironic genius and faculty, of our Anglo-Saxon world and life, in these bemuddled days, that you stand out intensely vivid and alone, making nobody else signify at all. And this has never been more the case than in A.V., where your force and life and ferocious sensibility and heroic cheek all take effect in an extraordinary wealth and truth and beauty and fury of impressionism. The quantity of things done, in your whole picture, excites my liveliest admiration--so much so that I was able to let myself go, <b>responsively</b> and assentingly, under the strength of the feeling communicated and the impetus accepted, almost as much as if your [...] "method," [...] and fifty other things--by which I mean sharp questions coming up--left me only passive and convinced, unchallenging and uninquiring (which they don't--no, they don't!) I don't think, as regards this latter point, that I can make out what your subject or Idea, the prime determinant one, may be detected as having been (lucidity and logic, on that score, not, to my sense, reigning supreme.) But there I am as if I were wanting to say [...] "all"!--which I'm not now, I find, a bit. I only want to say that the thing is irresistible (or indescribable) in its subjective assurance and its rare objective vividness and colour. You must at moments make dear old Dickens turn--for envy of the eye and the ear and the nose and the mouth of you--in his grave. I don't think the girl herself--her projected Ego--the best thing in the book--I think it rather wants clearness and nuances. But the men are prodigious, all, and the total result lives and kicks and throbs and flushes and glares--I mean hangs there in the very air we breathe, and that you are a very swagger performer indeed and that I am your very gaping and grateful ...|$|E
