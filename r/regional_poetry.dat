40|$|This article investigates how Gabriele D’Annunzio’s The Triumph of Death brings {{together}} Nietzsche’s ideas and Wagner’s music and interweaves {{them with the}} motifs of literary Decadence and the author’s own particular sexual politics. The novel is an experimental text striving to be a Gesemtkunstswerk, an integrated work that incorporates music, painting, <b>poetry,</b> <b>regional</b> folklore, and private thoughts about personal and national power. I discuss the novel’s themes of violent sexuality and the anxiety of powerlessness and explore their implications for the fascist political aesthetics in which D’Annunzio played a pioneering role...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a world-famous {{collection}} of the once exteremely popular literary genre of 'poesis tacens' (silent poetry), entitled Emblemes Divine and Morall (1635), written by the English poet-moralist, Francis Quarles (1592 - 1644). The rich Quarlesian ouvre was analysed from various aspects - {{the purpose of the}} present small contribution to its research was to clarify its continental, mainly German background. The road leads first of all to Heidelberg, where Quarles was one of Princess Elizabeth's cupbearers at her pompous Valentine wedding with Frederick V., the Elector Palatine, in 1613. The highly visual-theatrical nature of the royal nuptial events are also discussed within the framework of my survey, mainly as the perhaps most important formative factors in the author's intellectual and artistic development. William Marshall and William Simpson, the two illustrators are also called back on some pages and a late 17 th - early 18 th century Hungarian Jesuit stage design collection is also mentioned - as a somehow coincidental parallel of the Emblemes. The primary texts, illustrations, the precious emblem-catalogues of Cesare Ripa, Arthur Henkel and Albrecht Schöne, the publications of Prof. Karl Joseph Höltgen (University of Erlangen) and - last, but not least - the 1988 edition of <b>regional</b> contemporary Latin <b>poetry,</b> the Parnassus Palatinus (ed., transl. by Wilhelm Kühlmann and Hermann Wiegand) were the main and very useful sources of my efforts...|$|R

40|$|American poet Robert Frost (1874 - 1963) {{was born}} in San Francisco, California. After {{the death of his}} father, the family moved to New England, which {{provided}} the backdrop for Frost's trademark <b>regional</b> <b>poetry.</b> Frost briefly attended both Dartmouth College and Harvard University but did not earn a degree. Frost initially encountered difficulties in establishing himself as a published poet in American newspapers and literary journals. After little success in America, Frost and his family moved to England for three years, which proved to be more fertile publishing ground. By the time he returned to the United States in 1915, Frost had published two well-received full-length collections, A Boy's Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), which solidified his reputation on both continents. By the 1920 s, he was the most celebrated poet in America. Frost was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature four times: for New Hampshire (1923), Collected Poems (1930), A Further Range (1936), and A Witness Tree (1942). Frost received more than forty honorary degrees from colleges and universities, including Oxford and Cambridge Universities, Amherst College, and the University of Michigan. He also had the honor of participating in President John F. Kennedy's inauguration ceremonies, 1961, by reading his poems "Dedication" and "The Gift Outright. " This collection includes manuscripts of "Closed for Good" and "The Middleness of the Road"; page proofs of the verse drama A Masque of Reason (1942) and galley proofs of Steeple Bush (1947); art work, photographs, correspondence, work papers, an award, sheet music, serials, and audio recordings of Frost. The collection is unprocessed, but a preliminary inventory is available...|$|E
40|$|Colors, textures, lines, shapes, {{and forms}} are all rich visual elements-and, perhaps, no more {{honestly}} open to discovery {{than in the}} seeming infinity of the heavens above. But if one stares at the sky uninterruptedly for a long time, things may seem to start to come unbuttoned. No matter what riches nature provides for the human eye or the camera lens, it is always important to recognize the human perspective in the process. By paying heed to the horizon line and constantly referencing {{the fact that one}} 2 ̆ 7 s feet (or the camera 2 ̆ 7 s tripod) are planted firmly upon the earth, Wyman Meinzer allows us to experience most completely the complexities and subtleties of the world above us all. The artist knows this intuitively, of course, having trod many miles to find these natural elements and work his photographic vision with the light that reveals· all their elegant detail and emotive richness. Meinzer has worked this magic before in countless earlier books and prints, but it is throughout this volume that he is able to display most elegantly both his assured technique and his emotional honesty. With Between Heaven and Texas he honors earth and sky, of course, but above all he recognizes how the very act of photography forces both artist and viewer to connect with the world itself. To provide a deeper resonance to his words and images, Sarah Bird-one of the state 2 ̆ 7 s great novelists and essayists-provides a moving memoir on clouds and skies, reflecting upon 2 ̆ 2 how my thoughts soared here in this land with no lid. Forced to reach out to distant clouds, the range of my dreams increased as well.... 2 ̆ 2 Combined with <b>regional</b> <b>poetry</b> selected by Texas 2 ̆ 7 s finest living poet, Naomi Shihab Nye, the entire volume is a beautiful journey in which photographs and words, even more than complementary, become incalculably satisfying. Meinzer speaks of the 2 ̆ 2 frontier 2 ̆ 2 of the sky, and as one views the majestic images he has created it becomes evident that he invests that description with the same sense of history, emotion, and cultural dynamism that historians like Webb and geographers like Jackson have also invoked in their descriptions of Plains and people. More than a relationship, it becomes, through this photographer 2 ̆ 7 s eloquent eye, an important passage we are all invited to make with him. Meinzer, like countless pioneers of land and ideas before him, never forgets where he is standing and makes us see anew what William A. Quayle noted a century ago: 2 ̆ 2 The prairie path leads to the sky path; the paths are one: the continents are two; and you must make your journeys from the prairies to the sky. 2 ̆...|$|E
