40|$|AbstractStudies on HIV- 1 mucosal {{transmission}} {{to evaluate}} early events in pathogenesis {{and the development}} of effective preventive/prophylactic methods have thus far been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model susceptible to HIV- 1 infection by either vaginal and/or <b>rectal</b> <b>routes.</b> In this regard, while primate-SIV/SHIV and cat-FIV models provided useful surrogate platforms to derive comparative data, these viruses are distinct and different from that of HIV- 1. Therefore an optimal model that permits direct study of HIV- 1 transmission via mucosal routes is highly desirable. The new generation of humanized NOD/SCID BLT, NOD/SCIDγc−/−, and Rag 2 −/−γc−/− mouse models show great promise to achieve this goal. Here, we show that humanized Rag 2 −/−γc−/− mice (RAG-hu) engrafted with CD 34 hematopoietic progenitor cells harbor HIV- 1 -susceptible human cells in the rectal and vaginal mucosa and are susceptible to HIV- 1 infection when exposed to cell-free HIV- 1 either via vagina or rectum. Infection could be established without any prior hormonal conditioning or mucosal abrasion. Both R 5 and X 4 tropic viruses were capable of mucosal infection resulting in viremia and associated helper T cell depletion. There was systemic spread of the virus with infected cells detected in different organs including the intestinal mucosa. R 5 virus was highly efficient in mucosal transmission by both routes whereas X 4 virus was relatively less efficient in causing infection. HIV- 1 infection of RAG-hu mice by vaginal and <b>rectal</b> <b>routes</b> as shown here represents the first in vivo model of HIV- 1 transmission across intact mucosal barriers and as such may prove very useful for studying early events in HIV- 1 pathogenesis in vivo, as well as the testing of microbicides, anti-HIV vaccines/therapeutics, and other novel strategies to prevent HIV- 1 transmission...|$|R

50|$|Another {{means of}} {{medication}} delivery, {{available for use}} when the oral route is compromised, is a specialized catheter designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications via the <b>rectal</b> <b>route.</b> The catheter was developed to make rectal access more practical and provide a way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum so that health practitioners can leverage the established benefits of rectal administration. Its small flexible silicone shaft allows the device to be placed safely and remain comfortably in the rectum for repeated administration of medications or liquids. The catheter has a small lumen, allowing for small flush volumes to get medication to the rectum. Small volumes of medications (under 15ml) improve comfort by not stimulating the defecation response of the rectum, and can increase the overall absorption of a given dose by decreasing pooling of medication and migration of medication into more proximal areas of the rectum where absorption can be less effective.|$|E
50|$|A {{drug that}} is {{administered}} rectally will in general (depending on the drug) have a faster onset, higher bioavailability, shorter peak, and shorter duration than the oral route. Another advantage of administering a drug rectally, {{is that it}} tends to produce less nausea compared to the oral route and prevents any amount of the drug from being lost due to emesis (vomiting). In addition, the <b>rectal</b> <b>route</b> bypasses around {{two thirds of the}} first-pass metabolism as the rectum's venous drainage is two thirds systemic (middle and inferior rectal vein) and one third hepatic portal system (superior rectal vein). This means the drug will reach the circulatory system with significantly less alteration and in greater concentrations. Finally, rectal administration can allow patients to remain in the home setting when the oral route is compromised. Unlike intravenous lines, which usually need to be placed in an inpatient environment and require special formulation of sterile medications, a specialized rectal catheter can be placed by a clinician, such as a hospice nurse or home health nurse, in the home. Many oral forms of medications can be crushed and suspended in water to be given via a rectal catheter.|$|E
5000|$|Administration {{through the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract is sometimes termed enteral or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, {{in the sense}} that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.Many drugs as tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods directly into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and enteral nutrition. Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.The <b>rectal</b> <b>route</b> is an effective route of administration for many medications, especially those used at the end of life.

Specifically, our purpose was to evaluate the potential of such a vaccine strain to induce specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) at genital and rectal surfaces. Oral and <b>rectal</b> <b>routes</b> of immunization were compared: oral immunization induced seroconversion against the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in six out of seven volunteers, while after rectal immunization only one out of six volunteers seroconverted against LPS.

Acceptability of this mode of drug delivery in Laos is not known. In 2009 the acceptability of rectal treatments was evaluated among the general Lao population and Lao doctors in a national survey. Methods A cross sectional survey was performed of 985 households selected through a multi-stage random sampling process from 85 villages in 12 / 18 provinces and of 315 health staff randomly selected at each administrative level. Results Out of 985 families, 9 % had used the <b>rectal</b> <b>route</b> to treat children (the main indication was seizures or constipation). The population considered it less effective than other routes. Other concerns raised included pain (28 %), discomfort for children (40 %) and the possibility of other side effects (20 %). Of 300 health staff surveyed (nurses 44 %, doctors 66 %), only 51 % had already used the <b>rectal</b> <b>route</b> with a suppository, mostly to treat fever (76 %). Health staff working in provincial hospitals had more experience of using the <b>rectal</b> <b>route</b> than those in urban areas.

30|$|Prostaglandins {{had been}} shown to be {{effective}} for cervical ripening in non-pregnant women undergoing hysteroscopic procedures being administered orally or vaginally [11 – 13]. However, misoprostol use via <b>rectal</b> or sublingual <b>route</b> for the same indication was not thoroughly studied and there is scarce evidence to support or decline such role. Hence it was considered worthwhile to investigate such role in this work.|$|R
40|$|Intravaginal {{infection}} with Chlamydia muridarum in mice can ascend {{to the upper}} genital tract, resulting in hydrosalpinx, a pathological hallmark for tubal infertility in women infected with C. trachomatis. Here, we utilized in vivo imaging of C. muri-darum infection in mice following an intravaginal inoculation and confirmed the rapid ascent of the chlamydial organisms from the lower to upper genital tracts. Unexpectedly, the C. muridarum-derived signal was still detectable in the abdominal area 100 days after inoculation. Ex vivo imaging of the mouse organs revealed that the long-lasting presence of the chlamydial signal was restricted to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which was validated by directly measuring the chlamydial live organisms and ge-nomes in the same organs. The C. muridarum organisms spreading from the genital to the GI tracts were detected in different mouse strains {{and appeared to be}} independent of oral or <b>rectal</b> <b>routes.</b> Mice prevented from orally taking up excretions also de-veloped the long-lasting GI tract infection. Inoculation of C. muridarum directly into the upper genital tract, which resulted in a delayed vaginal shedding of live organisms, accelerated the chlamydial spreading to the GI tract. Thus, we have demonstrated that the genital tract chlamydial organismsmay use a systemic route to spread to and establish a long-lasting infection in the GI tract. The significance of the chlamydial spreading from the genital to GI tracts is discussed. Chlamydia muridarum has been extensively used for studyingthe mechanisms of Chlamydia trachomatis pathogenesis and immunity (1 – 4) because intravaginal infection of mice with the C. muridarum organisms results in hydrosalpinges and infertility (1...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium difficile is the {{bacterial}} pathogen {{identified as the}} cause of pseudomembranous colitis and is principally responsible for nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. The pathologic findings associated with this infection are believed to be caused by two large (∼ 300 -kDa) exotoxins, toxins A and B. Because of the mucosal nature of this infection, vaccination strategies aimed at providing prophylactic or therapeutic immune protection have included immunization by mucosal routes. Using the hamster model of C. difficile infection, we examined the protective efficacy of inactivated toxin (toxoid) vaccine formulations prepared as either culture filtrate or partially purified toxoid. We compared combination parenteral and mucosal vaccination regimens involving intranasal, intragastric, or <b>rectal</b> <b>routes</b> of immunization and found that rectal immunization in conjunction with intramuscular (i. m.) vaccination provided full protection of hamsters from death and diarrhea while the other mucosal routes did not. Protection was associated with high levels of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in serum. The requirement for adjuvants for protection was assessed by using sequential i. m. and rectal or i. m. vaccination regimens. Unexpectedly, i. m. immunization without adjuvant conferred the highest protection from death and diarrhea; this regimen elicited the highest serum anti-toxin B titers as well as toxin B neutralizing titers. Passive transfer of mouse antitoxin antibodies protected hamsters in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the principal role of circulating antitoxin antibodies in immunity from this toxin-mediated mucosal disease. These results suggest that prophylactic parenteral vaccination or intravenous immunotherapy could provide protection from C. difficile disease in humans...|$|R
