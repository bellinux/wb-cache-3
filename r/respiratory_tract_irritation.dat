40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Pharmaceutical Sciences) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2009. Quality control {{procedures}} are vital in {{the pharmaceutical industry}} to guarantee the authenticity and quality of products. A major challenge in quality assurance of herbal material is the vast variation of active constituents in plants from the same species. As {{a result of this}} variation, the selection of only a few compounds as criteria for quality control is inadequate. Pelargonium (P.) sidoides is indigenous to South Africa and highly valued by traditional healers as a remedy to treat coughs, upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> <b>irritations</b> and gastrointestinal conditions. An ethanolic extract of P. sidoides is used in the proprietary herbal tincture known as Umckaloabo®. The composition and concentration of polyphenols are parameters which determine the quality of this herbal medicine because it provides several therapeutic benefits in the non-specific medicinal treatment of infectious diseases. Despite the commercial development of P. sidoides very few studies have been conducted to document the full phytochemical range of variation for natural populations and no study has been published on the development of a fast accurate quality control method for the validation of raw material...|$|R

In this study P. sidoides (n= 96) and P. reniforme (n= 57) fresh root samples were collected from different localities in southern Africa. Phytochemical fingerprints of the two species were generated by analytical techniques including high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS), Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR), Fourier transform mid infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic (1 H NMR) spectroscopy and NIR hyperspectral imaging. Fingerprinting results revealed distinct phytochemical differences and similarities between the two species.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a {{comprehensive}} picture of phthalates: their properties, uses, occurrence, modes of possible exposure, their impact on human health, legislation on phthalates, phthalate occurrence in {{fruits and vegetables and}} their impact. Phthalates are esters of 1, 2 -Benzenedicarboxylic acid (phthalic acid). They are most commonly used as plasticizers, but also in adhesives, sealants, creams, oils, varnishes, perfumes, and in medical devices. They are also part of many packages used in the food industry. Due to the fact that phthalates are not chemically bonded in these products they are being continuously released into the air and dissolved in liquids and food, leading to exposure through food and drinks consumption, transmission through the skin or by inhaling. In the Slovak legislation currently are no limits restricting the presence of phthalates in food and beverages. Limits were set by the decree of Ministry of Agriculture of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Republic Ministry of Health of 15 March 2004 No. 608 / 3 / 2004 - 100, which issued the chapter of Codex of the Slovak Republic regulating contaminants in food. This Codex was in force until April 2008. Currently there are specific migration limits, indicating the maximum quantity of phthalate, which can migrate from the packaging to the food. Several studies point to possible carcinogenic effects of phthalates. Oestrogenic activity, teratogenic properties, skin, eye and <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> <b>irritations</b> are another results of increased exposure to phthalates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Acrolein is a {{chemical}} {{used as an}} intermediate reactive aldehyde in chemical industry. It is used for synthesis of many organic substances, methionine production, and methyl chloride refrigerant. The general population is exposed to acrolein via smoking, second-hand smoke, expo-sure to wood and plastic smoke. Firefighters and population living or working in areas with heavy automotive traffic may expose to higher level of acrolein via inhalation of smoke or automotive exhaust. Degradation of acrolein in all environmental media occurs rapidly, therefore, environ-mental accumulation is not expected. Acrolein degrade in 6 days when applied to surface water, {{and it has not}} been found as a contaminant in municipal drinking water. Acrolein vapor may cause eye, nasal and <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> <b>irritations</b> in low level exposure. A decrease in breathing rate was reported by volunteers acutely exposed to 0. 3 ppm of acrolein. At similar level, mild nasal epithelial dysplasia, necrosis, and focal basal cell metaplasia have been observed in rats. The acrolein effects on gastrointestinal mucosa in the animals include epithelial hyperplasia, ulceration, and hemorrhage. The severity of the effects is dose dependent. Acrolein induces the respiratory, ocular, and gastrointestinal irritations by inducing the release of peptides in nerve terminals inner-vating these systems. Levels of acrolein between 22 and 249 ppm for 10 min induced a dose-related decrease in substance P (a short-chain polypeptide that functions as a neurotransmitter or neuro-modulator).

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> and ocular <b>irritation</b> {{is critical for}} identifying and remedying problems related to overexposure to volatile chemicals, {{as well as for}} establishing parameters of irritation useful for regulatory purposes.

Although traditionally animal models have been used as the first step in assessing such irritation, they are not addressed here since (a) there are numerous reviews available on this topic and (b) many rodents and rabbits are obligate nose breathers whose nasal passages differ considerably from those of humans, potentially limiting generalization of animal-based data to humans.

40|$|Objectives: Chloramines are {{by-products}} {{of chlorine}} disinfected swimming pools and are hazardous to people if chloramines evaporate into the air. There {{is evidence that}} chloramines cause upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> and eye <b>irritation.</b> It was suspected that ozone treatment in addition to chlorine disinfection will reduce chloramine levels in the pool. The following study compared chloramine concentration in a strictly chlorine disinfected swimming pool and whirlpool (C. G.

The study also compared each pool and whirlpool to the 1. 0 mg/L combined chlorine concentration limit in the B. C. Pool Regulation. Methods: Chloramine concentrations were determined by using a Hach Pocket Colorimeter 2 Analysis System which used a DPD method of analysis. Chloramine was determined by subtracting total chlorine by the free chlorine. Thirty pool water samples were analyzed based on two samples per pool per day for fifteen days.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} them, {{isocyanates}} can induce serious {{injuries in the}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> and <b>irritation</b> on the skin and in the eyes. They are therefore interesting {{from the point of}} view of occupational health. The purpose of this thesis was to collect isocyanates in air with impinger-filter samplers and solvent free samplers. Furthermore the isocyanates were to be analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The solvent free sampler consists of a polypropylene tube and filter holder fitted with glass fiber filters impregnated with derivatization reagent, coupled with a pump. The impinger-filter sampler was made out of an impinger flask, containing a derivatization solution, coupled in series with a filter holder and a pump. Di-n-butylamine was used as derivatization reagent in both samplers to stabilize the reactive isocyanates and to enable mass spectrometric detection. The solvent free sampler is highly advantageous because of its user friendliness during field measurements, as opposed to the impinger-filter method. An exposure chamber, equipped with two interior fans to ensure good circulation, was used to generate an atmosphere containing isocyanates. Analyzing the isocyanate-DBA derivates with LC-MS/MS worked very well and the method made it possible to detect isocyanate levels below 1 ng/mL. During quantification of isocyanates a standard curve with concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/mL was used. Detection of isocyanate levels as low as one fifth of the limit value of some isocyanates was found to be possible, which would indicate that the methods are sensitive. Even though the solvent free sampler worked, the impinger-filter sampler was found to be more effective in collecting isocyanates. The coefficient of variation calculated from concentrations of isocyanates from the solvent free sampler varied between 0 - 35 %. The reason for this might be due to the fact that an optimized extraction method had not been tried out within the time limit of this project. Questions, identified during this thesis work, need to be answered before being able to obtain reliable results from field measurements with the solvent free sampler...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExposure to {{airborne}} pollutants {{can result}} in adverse health effects. Acute symptoms can for instance comprise of irritation of the eyes or of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> (called sensory <b>irritation).</b> In a recent case, health problems were reported in a French school and supposedly attributed {{to the presence of}} airborne irritant pollutants. Based on measured concentrations, the risk of developing the described health effects was assessed. Numerous airborne sensory irritants (aldehydes, organic acids, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), SO 2, NH 3) were identified and quantified in the indoor air by using active and passive sampling and online monitoring techniques. Reference values based on toxicological properties of compounds (sensory irritants) were taken from the literature. If not available, tentative values were specialty developed for this purpose. Concentrations of all sensory irritants remain below their corresponding guideline values and are comparable to literature data. It was concluded that the risk of developing sensory irritation due to the presence of the studied compounds is negligible. This holds both for individual compounds and for the mixture of studied compounds. Limitations of the employed sampling strategy, and of existing sampling and analytical techniques, which do not allow for analysing more reactive compounds-which are strong sensory irritants-may play a role. New sampling techniques need to be developed. Psychosocial factors (group behaviour, increased attention to sensory irritation) should also be taken into account when dealing with health complaints on sensory irritation...|$|R
