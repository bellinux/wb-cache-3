40|$|In this study, {{the wheel}} <b>ruts</b> {{frequency}} and dimensions were investigated according to geographical aspects, longitudinal gradient and surfacing layer of rural roads in Denji Kola village, Mazandaran Province, Iran. <b>Ruts</b> {{were divided into}} shallow and deep wheel <b>ruts.</b> Results showed that the <b>ruts</b> length and area were significantly affected by longitudinal gradient of rural roads (p< 0. 0001). <b>Ruts</b> length in longitudinal gradient class 8 - 12 % was significantly more than other classes (p< 0. 05).

Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist Paul Potts made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on Nineteen Eighty-Four. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend David Holbrook arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days, he found the reality very different, with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party. Susan Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the stiffness and <b>rutting</b> resistance of hot-mix asphalt. Ten different types of hot-mix asphalt were examined. The Superpave mix design method was utilized to produce nine mixes; the remaining mix was designed using the Marshall method. The asphalt mixes were tested for stiffness and <b>rutting</b> resistance under the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology research program at the University of Waterloo. The stiffness was determined by the laboratory resilient and dynamic moduli tests. The dynamic modulus test was conducted at six different loading frequencies and five different temperatures. The <b>rutting</b> test was executed by the Hamburg Wheel <b>Rut</b> Tester and the French Laboratory <b>Rutting</b> Tester to obtain <b>rutting</b> depth. The regression analysis was performed to examine the relationships of resilient and dynamic moduli with <b>rutting</b> depth. The results of the regression analysis revealed that resilient modulus did not correlate well with <b>rutting</b> depth. In contrast, dynamic modulus showed strong correlation with <b>rutting</b> depth for a number of loading frequencies and temperatures. The strong relationship was observed at the higher temperatures of + 46. 1 oC and + 54. 4 oC. Moreover, {{the relationship between}} dynamic modulus and <b>rutting</b> depth was better for lower loading cycles/wheel passes applied in the <b>rutting</b> test. It was also noticed that dynamic modulus exhibited a better relationship with <b>rutting</b> depth obtained from the French Laboratory <b>Rutting</b> Tester.

40|$|AbstractMonitoring {{pavement}} <b>rutting</b> {{condition is}} crucial to highway agencies. <b>Rutting</b> depth measures have been extensively referenced for different purposes such as determining pavement present serviceability, modeling pavement deterioration, and so on. Over the decades, various methods {{have been developed to}} measure <b>rutting</b> depth; however, two major problems have compromised the reliability and consistency of <b>rutting</b> depth measurement in current practice. First, one measure or discrete <b>rutting</b> depths collected at relatively long intervals have been used to represent the <b>rutting</b> condition of the entire pavement section, which results in imprecise and partial characterization of the actual condition. Second, the <b>rutting</b> depth measures for left and right wheel-path have always been simply averaged for further applications including integrating pavement indices, <b>rutting</b> classification, and so on.

Almost all hatchlings (91 %) were unable to traverse a single 15 cm <b>rut,</b> indicating that <b>ruts</b> of this depth are particularly detrimental to hatchling dispersal.
