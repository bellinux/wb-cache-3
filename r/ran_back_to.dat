5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
5|$|Coletti, Leal, Dillmann, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon, Binder, Giovesi, Haryanto, Rosenzweig and Abt {{were all}} {{trapped in the}} {{blockade}} {{with varying degrees of}} car damage. Nasr was near Bird and Ceccon and managed to avoid the collision between Leal and Palmer. Drivers <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their cars and remonstrated with marshals to enable them to take the restart. A forty-minute delay was necessitated to allow the track to be cleaned before the race could be restarted. Nine drivers had enough damage to warrant their retirement from the race: Cecotto, Leimer, Palmer, Leal, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon and Giovesi. The running order at the restart was determined by the order of the drivers that went through the first sector with the cars that did not enter being put in their starting position. This meant Evans led the field behind the safety car followed by Bird, Ceccon, Nasr and Calado. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap two and racing resumed with Evans leading Bird. Both drivers opened up a two-second advantage over Ceccon, Nasr, Calado and Richelmi. Although Evans had switched to the supersoft tyres during the stoppage Bird set consecutive fastest laps of the race on the soft tyres.|$|E
5|$|During the ordeal, several forward air-controllers {{were sent}} out to make low passes over Khâm Đức, to locate the CCT, without success. Then, in {{response}} to a call for the nearest aircraft to land on the runway to search for the stranded CCT, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred J. Jeanotte approached the airfield from the south and landed his C-123 on the runway with support from fighter-bombers, which were used to suppress enemy fire. Not seeing the men, Jeanotte applied full power and took off to avoid taking hits from North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire. As the C-123 rolled past the CCT's position, the three men came out of their position chasing the aircraft with their arms waving. Believing that the aircraft had missed them, the three men <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the ditch {{on the left side of}} the runway. As the C-123 was airborne, Jeanotte banked his aircraft to the left, and that enabled the aircrew to see the three men running back towards the ditch. However, Jeanotte was deterred from making another attempt at landing, because of low fuel. The next C-123 in line, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, landed on the runway as fire swept through the Khâm Đức facility, and the aircrew were able to extract the stranded CCT under heavy fire, and they flew out to Đà Nẵng. By 17:00, the evacuation was over. On 13 May, 60 B-52s bombed the Khâm Đức camp.|$|E

50|$|Lupus <b>runs</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house, but Felix {{is nowhere}} to be found. His wife, Polla, does not seem to {{comprehend}} Lupus’s urgent appeals for help. Polla tells Lupus that Felix is away at Rome, and Lupus <b>runs</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the grotto to free the children himself. When he communicates this, Pulchra confides shamefully that her mother has spells of mental illness, and her father rarely leaves the house for that reason. Lupus cuts the children free, but just as they are about to escape, the pirates find them and seize Flavia, threatening to kill her if they don’t stand still. Lupus manages to get away again, and <b>runs</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the villa, praying that Felix will be there.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Qiu and {{the other}} eunuchs were at the Left Jinwu headquarters. Han, however, had become fearful and was nervous and sweating. Qiu began to sense that {{something}} was wrong. Suddenly, {{a gust of wind}} blew up a screen, and Qiu saw many armed soldiers and heard the sounds of clanging weapons. Qiu {{and the other}} eunuchs were surprised and quickly ran outside. The guards at the Left Jinwu headquarters were about to close the gate to close them in, but Qiu yelled at them, and they, surprised, were unable to close the gates. Qiu and the other eunuchs <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hanyuan Hall, preparing to report to Wenzong what was happening.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of April 20, {{the day after the}} Orthodox Easter was celebrated in the tent colony, three Guardsmen {{appeared}} at the camp ordering the release of a man they claimed was being held against his will. This request prompted the camp leader, Louis Tikas, to meet with a local militia commander at the train station in Ludlow village, a half mile (0.8km) from the colony. While this meeting was progressing, two companies of militia installed a machine gun on a ridge near the camp and took a position along a rail route about half a mile south of Ludlow. Anticipating trouble, Tikas <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the camp. The miners set out to flank the militia positions and a gunfight soon broke out.|$|E
25|$|In {{the face}} of Loison's first assault, Leite's and Moretti's men took to their heels. The Spanish hussars bolted without even {{attempting}} to stop the French charge. Leite fled, but most of his men <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the town and tried to defend the place. The French troops were able to fight {{their way into the}} town at a number of places. In the butchery that followed, at least 2,000 Portuguese and Spanish fell, including many townspeople. French losses were 90 killed and 200 wounded. After the killing stopped, the French soldiers thoroughly sacked Évora. According to one account, the French massacred the town's entire population. Whatever the exact truth, the atrocity made it easier for the proud Portuguese to accept British aid in their struggle. Loison continued east to drive the Portuguese away from Elvas before being ordered back to Lisbon to face a new threat.|$|E

25|$|The Tigers {{had their}} first shutout {{of the season in}} week four, when they {{traveled}} to the Orange Bowl and defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 41–0. On its first possession LSU drove down to the Miami 49-yard line, where a pass from Rabb was intercepted and <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the LSU 42-yard line. The Hurricanes went three-and-out on their offensive possession and attempted a field goal, but the kick was short. After punts by both teams, the Tigers scored their first touchdown of the game on a 51-yard run by Don Purvis. Miami was forced to punt on the first play of the second quarter and it was downed at the LSU 5-yard line. LSU was also forced to punt, but the Hurricanes fumbled on the return and the Tigers recovered it at Miami's 27-yard line. After a first down run by Cannon, Rabb threw a touchdown pass to Billy Hendrix to make the score 13–0 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|At 10:00 on Yom Kippur, Ben-Gal {{and other}} brigade commanders convened with General Yitzhak Hofi in Nafakh, where Hofi {{told them that}} Intelligence was {{estimating}} the Syrians would attack that day, at around 18:00. The 7th Brigade was assigned as a reserve force around Nafakh and was {{to prepare for a}} counterattack in either the north or south sector, or to split and support both. Ben-Gal then drove to meet one battalion in Sindiana and address the officers. He called an orders group at Nafakh for 14:00, assuming it would give his second Battalion enough time to organize. As they gathered to wait for him, the Syrian artillery and planes began to attack. Ben-gal's men <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their battalions while Ben-Gal moved the headquarters out of the camp. After an hour, he was ordered to move to the northern sector in the Kuneitra area and to transfer the 2nd battalion to the southern sector, under command of the Barak Brigade. The 7th Brigade was left in charge of the northern sector from Kuneitra northwards with two battalions.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2006 Raviraj led a {{demonstration}} outside the UNICEF office in Colombo protesting against the Vaharai bombing in which 45 {{civilians were killed}} by army shelling. The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving slowly down Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and waited on the pavement with a bag over his shoulder. As Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the shoulder bag and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The shoulder bag, with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E
