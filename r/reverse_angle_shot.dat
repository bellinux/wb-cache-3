50|$|A <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot,</b> in cinematography, is a shot {{taken from}} an angle 180˚ (opposite) to the {{previous}} one. It is used {{to show how the}} character reacts {{to the previous}} shot.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Marmalade" [...] Auntie Mabel flies to Seville to visit an orange grove. Shooting was {{restricted}} to the one day on which the oranges were ready for harvesting. This was only known with very short notice and consequently arrangements to fly out were made at the last minute. It happened well outside the main production period by which time Lynda Baron was committed to other work and was not free to travel to Seville. To make it appear that Auntie Mabel had visited the orange grove, she was recorded in the studio against a Chroma key background while a body double was used for <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> of her in Spain.|$|R
50|$|The film is shot strikingly {{with visual}} {{imagination}} of the rural pastoral landscapes, the solitary huts of the wrestlers and the isolated church, contrasted against the malignant presence of the three urban yobs and their brutality. Filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta employs a unique strategy of shooting where he consistently shot periods of Uttara just after dawn and before sunset to emphasise the natural lighting on the landscape and to create atmosphere. In addition, this is precisely matched with <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> and unusually deep focus for framing and blocking. The cumulative result of such a technique adds to the formal unease, {{in a world where}} distinct natural beauty and deadly human menace coexist in equal measure. The cinematography, with the increasing or diminishing light of day is intended to directly coincide with the volatile changes in the ambience and mood of the film. The intense sunrise in one of the scenes as tension surmounts attempts to exude a feeling of heat, giving reflecting the burning emotions between the two wrestlers who are overcome by lust and jealousy.|$|R
5000|$|During {{this short}} film {{the camera is}} focused on Rita, without <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> Rita is under everyone’s gaze, the gaze of others which acts also as a {{controlling}} element, a form of surveillance. We can’t see what Rita has before her because she can’t either. For example, we see her mother’s hands flit {{in and out of}} the frame, when her mother is fussing around her, but we never see her mother. We feel the desire to see what stands before her but, for the most part of the short film, we are not granted any gratification of this desire. For Rita hearing is fundamental, and that is why the story, from her “point of view” is told through the sounds, the noises. The sounds represent what we can’t see, they evoke it, and to some extent create it. Only through an unexpected and enigmatic encounter does the staging change, because this meeting suddenly enables her to [...] "see" [...] and we, for the first time, are gifted with her perspective and share her vision. The film explores this brief moment of grace. Then everything goes back to normal for Rita and for us.|$|R
500|$|Vulcan and the Bird-of-Prey {{exterior}} {{was created}} {{with a combination}} of matte paintings and a soundstage. Nimoy had searched for a suitable location for the scene of the Enterprise crew's preparations to return to Earth, but various locations did not work, so the scene was instead filmed on a Paramount backlot. The production had to mask the fact that production buildings were [...] away. A wide-angle shot of Spock {{on the edge of a}} cliff overlooking the scene was filmed at Vasquez Rocks, a park north of Los Angeles. The Federation council chamber was a large set filled with representatives from many alien races. Production manager Jack T. Collis economized by building the set with only one end; <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> used the same piece of wall. The positions of the Federation President's podium and the actors on the seats were switched for each shot. Since The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film to show the operations at Starfleet Command, Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to learn how a real deep space command center might look and operate. Among the resulting set's features was a large central desk with video monitors that the production team nicknamed [...] "the pool table"; the prop later became a fixture in USS Enterprise-D's engine room on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.|$|R
5000|$|André Bazin wrote a {{detailed}} {{review of the}} film in which he took {{up the idea of}} [...] "pure cinema" [...] and tried to analyse how Cocteau had succeeded in creating it out of the most uncinematic material imaginable. Bazin highlights three features which assist this transition. Firstly the confidence and harmony of the actors, who have previously played their roles together many times on stage and are able to inhabit their characters as if by second nature, allow them to maintain an intensity of performance despite the fragmentation of the film-making process. Secondly, Cocteau shows unusual freedom in his choice of camera positions and movements, seldom resorting to the conventional means of filming dialogue with <b>reverse</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots,</b> and introducing close-ups and long shots with a sureness of touch that never disrupts the movement of the scene; the spectator is always placed in the position of a witness to the action (as in the theatre), rather than a participant, and even that of a voyeur, given the intimacy of the camera's gaze. Thirdly, Bazin notes the psychological subtlety with which Cocteau chooses his camera positions to match the responses of his 'ideal spectator'. He cites an example of the shot in which Michel tells Yvonne about the girl he loves, his face placed above hers and both facing the audience, just as they had done in the theatre; but in the film Cocteau uses a close-up which shows only the eyes of Yvonne below and the speaking mouth of Michel above, concentrating the image for the greatest emotional impact. In all of these aspects, the theatricality of the play is preserved but intensified through the medium of film.|$|R

5000|$|A Dutch {{angle is}} a camera shot {{in which the}} camera has been rotated {{relative}} to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many Dutch <b>angles</b> are static <b>shots,</b> but in a moving Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot.|$|R
50|$|For much of {{his career}} Hoepker used Leica cameras. In the 1970s he began to also use Single-lens reflex cameras {{alongside}} his Leica, using Leicas for wide <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> and Nikon or Canon cameras with zoom lenses. In 2002 he began using digital SLRs.|$|R

50|$|In extra time, Clarke came to Huddersfield's rescue {{in his own}} penalty area, {{blocking}} Stephen Quinn's {{drive in}} the 98th minute.

50|$|Angled shotAs {{compared}} to the fast return that uses speed to catch the opponent off-guard, <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> {{are meant to be}} more subtle but are harder to pull off. However, if executed correctly, it is probably the most efficient way of hitting a passing shot. It involves hitting the ball at as acute an angle as possible, usually cross-court such that the ball falls {{right in front of the}} net, but bounces towards the side, making it impossible for the opponent to return the ball. To hit at such an angle, a lot of top-spin on the ball is usually required as well as a soft touch. Thus, players who can execute <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> well are usually players who are familiar with using a lot of top-spin in their play, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who is famous for hitting Half-volley <b>angled</b> passing <b>shots.</b> Chris Evert is usually considered to have had one of the best directed passing shots in the history of the game, hitting her shots with pinpoint precision against serve and volley players.|$|R

50|$|The 1949 film The Third Man makes {{extensive}} use of Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shots,</b> to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment.
