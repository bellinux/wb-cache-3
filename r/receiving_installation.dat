50|$|While only {{a limited}} number of local {{stations}} can normally be received at satisfactory signal strengths in any given area, tuning into other channels may reveal weaker signals from adjacent areas. More consistently strong signals, especially those accentuated by unusual atmospheric conditions, can be achieved by improving the antenna system. The development of interest in TV-FM DX as a hobby can arise after more distant signals are either intentionally or accidentally discovered, leading to a serious interest in improving the listener's antenna and <b>receiving</b> <b>installation</b> for the purpose of actively seeking long-range television and radio reception. The TV-FM DX hobby is somewhat similar to other radio/electronic related hobbies such as amateur radio, Medium Wave DX, or short-wave radio, and organisations such as the Worldwide TV-FM DX Association have developed to coordinate and foster the further study and enjoyment of VHF/UHF television and FM broadcast DX.|$|E

5000|$|Eight {{additional}} such {{tours of}} duty, {{prior to the}} end of 1962, permitted ship's company to gain a great deal of familiarity with the area. Midshipman cruises and NATO maneuvers added new vistas and dimensions to her training exercises as did several rescue operations. Twice in 1952 this destroyer received commendations for her efforts after ships had collided at sea, while in 1957 and again in 1961 aviators from the carriers [...] and [...] respectively were plucked from the sea. Meanwhile, to update and increase her value to the Navy, O'Hare was converted during 1953 to a radar picket ship (DDR-889) and in 1958 <b>received</b> <b>installation</b> of the electronic data system. The next major modification, in 1963, a FRAM Mk I overhaul, restored her original designation.|$|R

5000|$|On 29 August 2006, {{the carrier}} Abraham Lincoln arrived at Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington, and on 8 September 2006, the carrier entered Dry Dock No. 6 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS & IMF) {{to begin a}} {{scheduled}} Docked Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA) yard maintenance period. [...] Major projects for this DPIA included the refurbishment of ship tanks, work on {{three of the four}} catapults, modernization of navigation systems, resurfacing of the flight deck, and updates to the ship’s Local Area Network (LAN). Abraham Lincoln also <b>received</b> <b>installation</b> of the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) system, which improved the ship’s close range defensive capabilities. [...] On 18 December 2008, Abraham Lincoln left dry dock ahead of schedule and under budget because PSNS & IMF yard team was able to cut the time of ship tank maintenance by more than half, completing 18 tanks in 89 days.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{research}} carried out {{as part of the}} national health impact evaluation of the Warm Front Scheme, a government initiative aimed at alleviating fuel poverty in England. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in a purposive sample of 49 households which received home energy improvements under the Scheme from five urban areas (Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Southampton). Each household had <b>received</b> <b>installation,</b> replacement or refurbishment of the heating system and, in some cases, also insulation of the cavity wall or loft or both, and draught-proofing measures. Most householders reported improved and more controllable warmth and hot water. Many also reported perceptions of improved physical health and comfort, especially of mental health and emotional well-being and, in several cases, the easing of symptoms of chronic illness. There were reports of improved family relations, an expansion of the domestic space used during cold months, greater use of kitchens and improved nutrition, increased privacy, improved social interaction, and an increase in comfort and atmosphere within the home. Greater warmth and comfort also enhanced emotional security, and recipients were more content and at ease in their homes. However there was little evidence of substantially lower heating bills. These results provide evidence that Warm Front home energy improvements are accompanied by appreciable benefits in terms of use of living space, comfort and quality of life, physical and mental well-being, although there is only limited evidence of change in health behaviour. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Despite six nonfatal {{accidents}} {{in the previous}} sixteen years, there was substantial local opposition to closing the remaining 11 crossings. Outright closing the crossing would eliminate the sole access points to several of the places they served, while grade separation would have been expensive and required land takings. Instead, the crossings were supplied with additional protections. In 1998, School Street in Groton was the first four-quadrant gate installation {{in the country with}} vehicle detection sensors tied into the line's signal system. It cost $1 million rather than the $4 million for a bridge. Seven more crossings <b>received</b> similar <b>installations</b> in 1999 and 2000; only the three in New London (which are on a tight curve with speed limits under [...] ) did not.|$|R

[...] Radio Broadcast expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: [...] "...there is a future for the audio cable...

The artist herself explains that “the way she installs her shows are more like conversations between different pieces…the works kind of shift meaning every time there’s a new company of other works.” Pica’s interest in human modes of communication extends to exploration of the human desire to be understood despite the imperfections of those forms of communication.|$|R
