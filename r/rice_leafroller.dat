40|$|BACKGROUND: Rice–duck {{cultivation}} is {{the essence}} of Chinese traditional agriculture. A scientific assessment of the mechanism and its capacity is of theoretical significance and practical value in improving modern agricultural technology. RESULTS: The duck’s secretions, excreta and their treading, pecking and predation decrease the occurrence of plant diseases, pests and weeds, enrich species diversity and improve the field environment. The rice–duck intergrowth system effectively prevents rice planthoppers and rice leafhoppers. The control effects can be up to 98. 47 % and 100 % respectively; it also has effects on the control of Chilo suppressalis, Tryporyza incertulas and the <b>rice</b> <b>leafrollers.</b> Notable control results are found on sheath blight, while the effects on other diseases are about 50 %. Harm from weeds is placed under primary control; prevention of weeds is sequenced by broadleaf weeds> sedge weeds>Gramineae weeds. Contents of soil organic matter, N, P and K are improved by the system; nutrient utilization is accelerated, resulting in decreased fertilizer application. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 1 – 2 % and duck fodder is saved in this system. There is also an obvious economic benefit. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional rice cultivation, rice–duck cultivation shows great benefits to ecologic cost an...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the selectiveness of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Güenée (commonly known as the rice leaffolder or <b>rice</b> <b>leafroller)</b> towards five rice varieties (Yangfujing 8, Yangdao 6, Shanyou 136, Huaidao 9 and Ningjing 1) and three weed species (Echinochloa crusgalli, Leptochloa chinensis and Leersia hexandra). The {{results showed that the}} rice varieties carried significantly higher numbers of C. medinalis moths and eggs than the weed species. Among the rice varieties, Yangfujing 8 was associated with a higher moth number. However, there was little difference in the number of C. medinalis eggs among the rice varieties. Additionally, a laboratory experiment was performed to investigate the olfactory response of female C. medinalis towards volatile compounds from different rice varieties, as well as its oviposition preference towards these rice varieties. The volatiles of Yangfujing 8, Yangdao 6 and Shanyou 136 attracted C. medinalis similarly to those of TN 1. In contrast, the volatiles of Huaidao 9 and Ningjing 1 clearly deterred C. medinalis. Nevertheless, C. medinalis did not exhibit clear oviposition preference towards any of the five tested rice varieties...|$|E
40|$|Wolbachia are a {{group of}} {{intracellular}} inherited endosymbiontic bacteria infecting {{a wide range of}} insects. In this study the infection status of Wolbachia (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) was measured in the Asiatic <b>rice</b> <b>leafroller,</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), from twenty locations in China by sequencing wsp, ftsZ and 16 S rDNA genes. The results showed high infection rates of Wolbachia in C. medinalis populations. Wolbachia was detected in all geographically separate populations; the average infection rate was ~ 62. 5 %, and the highest rates were 90 % in Wenzhou and Yangzhou populations. The Wolbachia detected in different C. medinalis populations were 100 % identical to each other when wsp, ftsZ, and 16 S rDNA sequences were compared, with all sequences belonging to the Wolbachia B supergroup. Based on wsp, ftsZ and 16 S rDNA sequences of Wolbachia, three phylogenetic trees of similar pattern emerged. This analysis indicated the possibility of inter-species and intra-species horizontal transmission of Wolbachia in different arthropods in related geographical regions. The migration route of C. medinalis in mainland China was also discussed since large differentiatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{high number}} of pest and {{diseases}} in rice plants, often {{make it difficult for}} the target pest and disease priorities that need to be controlled. The accuracy of determining the target pest and disease is an important step because it will determine how to control accurately, thereby reducing cost. This study aims to: (a) determine the development of major pests and diseases in rice farming in Papua; (b) determine the dominance of major pests and diseases in rice farming Papua; and (c) determine the dominance of major pests and diseases in their respective districts in Papua. Studies implemented starting in May to October 2015. The study used secondary data from technical implementing unit of Food and Horticultural Plant Protection, Department of Agricultural Papua Province, for five years, from 2009 to 2014. Secondary data were analyzed by destructive method to answer the purposes of the study. The dominance of pests can be set based on extensive data attacks, and most comprehensive attack showed the dominance of major pests and diseases. The results showed that: (a) major pests and diseases (<b>rice</b> <b>leafroller,</b> pest winches rod, rat, and the brown spot disease, and blasts) are always found in rice farming in Papua; (b) for five years (2009 to 2014) fake white and blasts wide attacks continued to rise, broad attack brown spots and winches obtaining always fluctuated, while the area of the attack to blast disease seen down; and (c) the average over five years (2009 to 2014), fake white predominant in 5 districts (96...|$|E
