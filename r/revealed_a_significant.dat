5|$|Implacable {{was laid}} down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. at their {{shipyard}} in Clydeside on 21 February 1939, as Yard Number 672. Her construction was temporarily suspended in 1940–41, in favour of higher-priority ships needed {{to fight in the}} Battle of the Atlantic, before she was launched on 10 December 1942 by Queen Elizabeth. Captain Lachlan Mackintosh was appointed to command the ship in November 1943. She was commissioned on 22 May 1944, and began sea trials which <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> number of problems that required rectification, so the ship was not formally completed until 28 August. Implacable was assigned to the Home Fleet and was working up {{over the next several months}} while the Fairey Fireflies of 1771 Squadron flew aboard on 10 September. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 828 and 841 Squadrons that made up No. 2 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing later that month.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E

25|$|Analysis <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{relationship}} {{between the number of}} extended-duration work shifts and the reported rates of fatigue-related noteworthy medical errors. Specifically, the number of reported fatigue-related medical errors increased as the number of extended-duration shifts per month increased. At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration work shifts and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration work shifts. Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration work shifts. Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration work shifts may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source of}} heterogeneity among study results is {{the variation in}} techniques used to assess vitamin concentrations in milk. HPLC {{was selected as the}} ‘‘gold standard’’ method for determination of fat-soluble vitamins by AOAC International. No gold standard has been identified for water-soluble vitamins; fluorescence spectroscopy, chromatography, and microbiological methods are all referenced in the AOAC official methods. Metaregression for vitamin B1 and folate studies <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> association between study and method used to quantify vitamins; however, this variable was not significant for other vitamins. Analytic methods must take into consideration separation of vitamers for each vitamin, the methodology used for calibration of external standards, retention of vitamer conformation, and successful recovery. The solvents, standards, execution of extraction procedures, and equipment used to carry out these analyses may differ among investigators and can introduce variation among studies. Hollman et al. investigated 18 laboratories that were asked to analyze water-soluble vitamin contents in selected foods. These authors reported that in contrast to the fat-soluble vitamins a wider range of methods was used for water-soluble vitamins and that results from different methods did not always agree for vitamins B2 and C.|$|E

A study of bloggers behavioral patterns {{during the first}} month of the film's release <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in public ire towards government and politicians for constantly being mired in corruption and bureaucracy and their inefficiency in providing basic amenities. Intense political discussions spurred on by the film's influence were observed in these patterns. While commenting on this, writer D'Silva said that the film [...] "has struck a chord somewhere". Besides instigating political thought and discussions, it evoked social awakening for many. Some discussions rallied on how citizens should support and contribute to non-governmental organizations and exercising simple citizen duties of paying taxes and voting, while the others contemplated on how to become more responsible towards the country. Unlike other Indian films with jingoistic overtones, many young Indians could relate well to the characters of this film.|$|E

It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group. McFarlane felt this album was [...] "more self-assured and textured [...] consolidated the band's {{position at the}} forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I, Spiderbait, Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed. [...] was full of accessible, spirited rock". Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted [...] " [...] <b>revealed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves. Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line". Four singles were released from the album – [...] "Pick You Up", [...] "D.A.F.", [...] "Living Type" [...] and [...] "Take Me In". [...] "Take Me In" [...] was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group. FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that [...] "when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade". In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it.|$|E
