5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the <b>reversionary</b> <b>right</b> to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E

Before {{the evening was}} over he {{thought that he had}} made up his mind that he would not, under any circumstances, give up his <b>reversionary</b> <b>right.</b> [...] "They couldn't make me do it, even though I went to prison," [...] he said to himself. Let him starve till he died, and then the property would go to Gregory! What did it matter? The thing that did matter was this,--that the estate {{should not be allowed to}} depart out of the true line of the Newton family. He sat thinking of it half the night, and before he left the club he wrote the following note to his brother;-- ...|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, Hungerford {{attacked}} Farleigh Castle, {{which was}} garrisoned {{for the king}} and {{under the command of}} Colonel John Hungerford, said to have been Sir Edward's half-brother. The castle surrendered to Sir Edward in September 1645. He had a <b>reversionary</b> <b>right</b> to the property under the will of Sir Edward Hungerford (died 1607), his maternal uncle, but the testator's widow had a life-interest, and remained there until 1653.|$|E

50|$|In 1787, a British court {{decided that}} the {{inheritance}} rights of heirs to property that was confiscated by the Americans during the American Revolution was recoverable. Under this decision, John Jacob Astor I purchased the <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> to the Philipse lands in 1809 from the heirs of Roger Morris (husband of Mary Philipse) for £20,000. After Mary Philipse Morris died in 1825, Astor attempted to collect rents on the lands, but the new “owners,” who had purchased from the lands from the NY Commission of Forfeiture, refused to pay, and Astor tried to evict them. A compromise was reached in 1828 when NY State compensated Astor for the <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> {{in the amount of}} $500,000.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{forms of}} tenure {{included}} samon, mengist, and maderia land. Samon was land {{the government had}} granted to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in perpetuity. Traditionally, the church had claimed about one-third of Ethiopia's land; however, actual ownership probably never reached this figure. Estimates of church holdings range from 10 - 20% of the country's cultivated land. Peasants who worked on church land paid tribute to the church (or monastery) {{rather than to the}} emperor. The state owned large tracts of agricultural land known as mengist and maderia. Mengist was land registered as government property, and maderia was land granted mainly to government officials, war veterans, and other patriots in lieu of a pension or salary. Although it granted maderia land for life, the state possessed a <b>reversionary</b> <b>right</b> over all land grants; this form of tenure comprised about 12% of the country's agricultural land. Maderia tenure became a far more common following the Second World War, as Emperor Haile Selassie used it to reward the arbegnoch (or [...] "Patriots") who had fought the Italian occupiers.|$|E

5000|$|The LFM {{introduced}} no [...] "new {{principles of}} feudal organization", {{but it does}} represent [...] "a more abstract notion of comital and royal power". It {{has been compared to}} the Usatges de Barcelona as a failure in [...] "practical or bureaucratic terms". It is essentially an expression of power, conceived territorially and principally with regards to Catalonia. The cartulary is not a record of the union of Catalonia with Aragon. Rather, it is a record of a vast new authority including Aragon, parts of Occitania (Carcassonne, Razès, Béziers, and the County of Provence), and all the Catalan counties, including Ausona, Barcelona, Besalú, Cerdanya, Girona, Roussillon, and Pallars Jussà, which were all possessed by Alfonso II, as well as the Empúries and Urgell, which were not. Bisson writes that in the LFM [...] "feudal principles, applied to serve administrative ... needs, remained subordinated to a conception of territorial sovereignty," [...] yet he also says that the LFM was [...] "exclusively a land book concerned with proprietary or <b>reversionary</b> <b>right</b> not concerned with any systematic effort to strengthen suzerain rights or vassalic obligations." [...] Kosto, to an extent, disagrees, arguing that the work is a combination of land book and case book, in which some charters are presented to explain the proper working of the feudal system. The rubrics and section headings are evidence of the ambiguity of Alfonso's position and that of the various regions. While Aragon is termed a regnum (kingdom, realm), Cerdanya and Roussillon are comitati (counties), Tarragona is listed as a civitas (city), and Provence and the County of Melgueil are not described. In other cases charters are named for the lord that issued them or confirmed them.|$|E

50|$|An {{addicted}} gambler, Leinster {{had already}} signed away his possible <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> to the family's ancestral seat, Carton House, near Maynooth in County Kildare, not expecting {{that he would}} inherit the property and the title.

40|$|As {{we enter}} a new period of {{wholesale}} copyright revision, this Note examines {{the interplay of}} copyright and technology through a brief exploration of In re Cellco Partnership. Part II of the Note explores the history of copyright reform, the music industry, and performance-rights organizations. Part III explores In re Cellco and reveals that the decision is symptomatic of both a Copyright Act and music industry in need of reform, and {{is at odds with}} the normative value of copyright as an incentive for creators. Part IV explores how we should restore this normative value by rebalancing the bargaining power of songwriters and the vertically integrated music industry. It further argues that the appropriate rebalancing can occur by amending the Copyright Act with two provisions inspired by German copyright law: First, our Copyright Act should have a contract-reformation provision for instances in which a copyright transferee benefits disproportionately from new technology. And second, our Copyright Act should offer a limited <b>reversionary</b> <b>right</b> to the creator when a copyright transferee opts not to exploit the work through new technology.

25|$|The lawsuit {{resulted}} in a settlement in 1919 whereby LC Page bought out all of Montgomery's rights to all of her novels published by them. The settlement excluded any <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> that might become due {{for the benefit of}} either her or her heirs if such rights were to become enacted. The settlement paid Montgomery a flat sum of $18,000; at the time an amount she would have expected to see earned from her works during her lifetime.|$|R

The Court {{determined that}} the AGGLA was the heirs' private profit-seeking enterprise as far as its activities were concerned.|$|R

However the State Government decided that it wanted to take ownership of the network and passing the Tramways Purchase Act 1912 cancelling the <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> held by the council. The Nedlands line transferred on 29 May 1913, followed by the other lines on 1 July 1913.

50|$|It was {{subsequently}} shown {{in court that}} by prenuptial agreement the Morris share of the Philipse Patent was vested in their children and had not been reached by the bill of attainder after all. In 1809, John Jacob Astor bought {{the interest of the}} heirs of Morris for this property for £20,000 sterling and brought suit against the State. After Mary Philipse Morris died in 1825 Astor attempted to collect rents on the lands, but the new owners, who had purchased from the lands from the NY Commission of Forfeiture, refused to pay and Astor tried to evict them. A compromise was reached in 1828 when NY State compensated Astor for the <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> in the amount of $500,000.|$|R
5000|$|Newtown was a burgage borough, {{meaning that}} the right to vote was vested solely in the owners of a {{specified}} number of properties or [...] "burgage tenements". At the time of the Great Reform Act of 1832 there were 39 burgage tenements, held by 23 burgesses; however, most of these held only life grants. It was common practice for life grants to be made to friends of the proprietors so as to ensure that the full voting power could be exercised; if these nominees failed to vote as expected, they could be ejected and replaced by somebody more reliable before the next election. These voters were often non-resident - and indeed, it could hardly be otherwise, for although there were 39 burgage tenements, there were only 14 houses. Unlike many rotten boroughs, no single landowner controlled a majority of the burgages: the <b>reversionary</b> <b>rights</b> in them belonged to three families (Barrington, Holmes and Anderson-Pelham), with none having an overall majority. Elections in the borough consequently required careful management and sometimes considerable expenditure to achieve the desired result. In the 1750s and 1760s, the arrangement was that one of the two seats was considered to be in the gift of the Barrington family, while Thomas Holmes negotiated the election of the government's nominee for the other, unless he wanted it for a member of the Holmes family.|$|R
40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis characterises {{the last}} will and testament {{in the event}} of death in Roman law. The first part of the thesis deals with the testament and alternative acquisitions in the event of death. The first chapter explains the concept of the testament, its types, its forms and the compulsory necessities. The conditions for appointing someone as a heritor, the testamentary capacity, the disinheritance of an offspring and also the invalidity of the testament and its nullification are also defined in this chapter. The second chapter describes the alternative acquisitions in the event of death where we can for instance include legaty, fideicommissum, codicils and donation in the event of death. The second part of the thesis consists of presumptions for the inheritance on the base of the last will, the fundamental principles of the right of the inheritance and the concept of the inheritance. The third chapter illustrates the legal status of the successor and analyse the <b>reversionary</b> heir, the <b>right</b> of acquisition and the legal protection of the heritor and furthermore it deals with the right for recalculation. The last chapter is dedicated to an acquisition of the inheritance by virtue of the testament and legacy and the alienation of the estate and inheritance...|$|R
