5|$|In early 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division {{was formed}} from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades. The {{division}} first saw service during the First Battle of Gaza, which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917. At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza {{from the north}} and east. At 6.00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the <b>ring</b> <b>closing</b> tightly around Gaza. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders decided to call off the attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences were even more formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult. This battle became known as the Second Battle of Gaza. The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5,917 suffered. The second battle of Gaza was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces.|$|E

25|$|Thiazoles {{can react}} in cycloadditions, {{but in general}} at high {{temperatures}} due to favorable aromatic stabilization of the reactant; Diels-Alder reactions with alkynes are followed by extrusion of sulfur, and the endproduct is a pyridine; in one study, a very mild reaction of a 2-(dimethylamino)thiazole with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) to a pyridine was found to proceed through a zwitterionic intermediate in a formal cycloaddition to a cyclobutene, then to a 1,3-thiazepine in an 4-electron electrocyclic ring openening {{and then to a}} 7-thia-2-azanorcaradiene in an 6-electron electrocyclic <b>ring,</b> <b>closing</b> before extruding the sulfur atom.|$|E
500|$|The {{migration}} of a divalent group, such as O, S, N R or C R2, {{which is part}} of a three-membered ring in a bicyclic molecule, is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement. This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward-Hofmann rules as being a (1, n) sigmatropic shift. An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes (1,3,5-cycloheptatrienes). When heated, the pi-system goes through an electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>closing</b> to form bicycleheptadiene (norcaradiene). Thereafter follows a [...] alkyl shift and an electrocyclic ring opening.|$|E
500|$|Stable carbenes are {{believed}} to behave {{in a similar fashion}} to organophosphines in their co-ordination properties to metals. These ligands are said to be good σ-donors through the carbenic lone pair, but poor π-acceptors due to internal ligand back-donation from the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carbene centre, and so are able to co-ordinate to even relatively electron deficient metals. Enders [...] and Hermann have shown that these carbenes are suitable replacements for phosphine ligands in several catalytic cycles. Whilst they have found that these ligands do not activate the metal catalyst as much as phosphine ligands they often result in more robust catalysts. Several catalytic systems have been looked into by Hermann and Enders, using catalysts containing imidazole and triazole carbene ligands, with moderate success. Grubbs [...] has reported replacing a phosphine ligand (PCy3) with an imidazol-2-ylidene in the olefin metathesis catalyst RuCl2(PCy3)2CHPh, and noted increased <b>ring</b> <b>closing</b> metathesis as well as exhibiting [...] "a remarkable air and water stability". Molecules containing two and three carbene moieties have been prepared as potential bidentate and tridentate carbene ligands.|$|E

The segments that are known {{are very different from}} the synthetic pathways tried thus far (Scheme 1). The starting compound is geranylgeranyl diphosphate 2 [...] which is a dimer of geraniol 1. [...] This compound already contains all the required 20 carbon atoms for the paclitaxel skeleton. More <b>ring</b> <b>closing</b> through intermediate 3 (taxadiene) leads to taxusin 4. The two main reasons why this type of synthesis is not feasible in the laboratory is that nature does a much better job controlling stereochemistry and a much better job activating a hydrocarbon skeleton with oxygen substituents for which cytochrome P450 is responsible in some of the oxygenations. Intermediate 5 is called 10-deacetylbaccatin III.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{inspired}} by Michael Artin's paper "On The Join of Hensel Rings". In his paper, Artin proves that in an absolutely integrally <b>closed</b> <b>ring</b> the sum of two prime ideals is either prime or the whole ring. A more elementary proof of the previous statement is given in M. Hochster and C. Huneke's "Infinite Integral Extensions and Big Cohen-Macaulay Algebras" for the larger class of quadratically <b>closed</b> <b>rings.</b> Motivated by Hochster and Huneke's proof, we give an elementary proof {{of the fact that}} an absolutely integrally <b>closed</b> <b>ring</b> has no polygons. We prove this for the larger class of 2 n-adically <b>closed</b> <b>rings,</b> after defining n-adically <b>closed</b> <b>rings.</b> The notion of irreducible intersection property is introduced, and a necessary and sufficient condition is proved for a ring to have this property. Other ring and scheme theoretic properties of absolutely integrally <b>closed</b> <b>rings</b> and n-adically <b>closed</b> <b>rings</b> are shown in detail.

50|$|While {{the ring}} closure in penams and cephems is between {{positions}} 1 and 4 of the β-lactam and is oxidative, the clavams and carbapenems have their <b>rings</b> <b>closed</b> by two-electron processes between positions 1 and 2 of the ring. β-lactam synthetases {{are responsible for}} these cyclizations, and the carboxylate of the open-ring substrates is activated by ATP.

Torquoselectivity is a discrimination between these possible enantiomers that requires asymmetric induction.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the effects}} of transannular strain is the {{difficulty}} of synthesizing medium-sized rings. Illuminati et al. have studied the kinetics of intramolecular <b>ring</b> <b>closing</b> using the simple nucleophilicsubstitution reaction of ortho-bromoalkoxyphenoxides. Specifically, they studied the <b>ring</b> <b>closing</b> of 5 to 10 carbon cyclic ethers. They found that as the number of carbons increased, so did the enthalpy of activation for the reaction. This indicates that strain within the cyclic transition states is higher if there are more carbons in the ring. Since transannular strain is the largest source of strain in rings this size, the larger enthalpies of activation result in much slower cyclizations due to transannular interactions in the cyclic ethers.|$|E
