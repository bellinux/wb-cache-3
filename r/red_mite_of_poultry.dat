Lethane A- 70, a powerful contact in-secticide, when used as a dust was found by Alicata et al. (1946) to destroy all mites and lice upon poultry within 48 hours. Slade (1945) first reported the gamma isomer (gammexane) of hexachlorocyclo-hexane to be effective against the <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> <b>of</b> <b>poultry.</b> Telford (1947) and Steward (1947) have confirmed the ob-servation.

50|$|Skin disease {{caused by}} sarcoptic mites is variably called scabies, {{or in some}} {{countries}} mange. (The adjectives 'mangy' and 'scabby' are used similarly to 'lousy', as both a description of animals probably infested with mites or lice, respectively, and as a general expression of disgust. When wild animals such as foxes and coyotes are sometimes found heavily infested with sarcoptic mites, the description 'mangy' is apt.) Sarcoptes scabiei is an example <b>of</b> a <b>mite</b> that burrows within the living layers of the epidermis of its host. It infests many species of mammals. (Infestations of humans may be zoonotic, that is: transmitted from a wild or domestic animal, for example to a farmer or veterinarian handling an infested pig.

40|$|To {{assess their}} {{potential}} to control poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> (Dermanyssus gallinae), we tested selected predaceous mites (Androlaelaps casalis and Stratiolaelaps scimitus) that occur naturally in wild bird nests or sometimes spontaneously invade poultry houses. This was done under laboratory conditions in cages, each with 2 – 3 laying hens, initially 300 poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> {{and later the}} release of 1, 000 predators. These small-scale tests were designed to prevent mite escape from the cages and they were carried out in three replicates at each of three temperature regimes: 26, 30 (constant day and night) and 33 – 25 °C (day-night cycle). After 6 weeks total population sizes <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> and predatory mites were assessed. For the temperature regimes of 26 and 33 / 25 °C S. scimitus reduced the poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> population relative to the control experiments by a factor 3 and 30, respectively, and A. casalis {{by a factor of}} 18 and 55, respectively. At 30 °C the predators had less effect on <b>red</b> <b>mites,</b> with a reduction of 1. 3 -fold for S. scimitus and 5. 6 -fold for A. casalis. This possibly reflected hen manure condition or an effect of other invertebrates in the hen feed. Poultry <b>red</b> <b>mite</b> control was not negatively affected by temperatures as high as 33 °C and was always better in trials with A. casalis than in those with S. scimitus. In none of the experiments predators managed to eradicate the population <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>red</b> <b>mites.</b> This may be due to a prey refuge effect since most predatory mites were found in and around the manure tray {{at the bottom of the}} cage, whereas most poultry <b>red</b> <b>mites</b> were found higher up in the cage (i. e. on the walls, the cover, the perch, the nest box and the food box).

Most research on mite pathogens concerns studies on fungal pathogens of eriophyoids and spider mites especially. These fungi often play an important role in the regulation <b>of</b> natural <b>mite</b> populations and are sometimes able to decimate populations <b>of</b> phytophagous <b>mites.</b> Studies are being conducted to develop some of these fungi as commercial acaricides.

A putative iridovirus has been observed in association with Varroa mites in moribund honeybee colonies.

Methods: After extracting the essential oil, different concentrations of the plant extract were prepared.
