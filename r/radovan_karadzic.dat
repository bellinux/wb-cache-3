5|$|In Serbia, Milošević {{condemned}} the Croatian attack, but the Milošević-influenced press also denounced {{the leadership of}} the RSK as being incompetent, while the most extreme politicians, including Vojislav Šešelj, demanded retaliation against Croatia. Bosnian Serb leader <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> begged for the Yugoslav Army to help while accusing Milošević of treason.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Vojislav Šešelj taught {{political}} science at the University of Michigan after being expelled by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1981. In June 1989, he traveled to the United States again to meet with Momčilo Đujić in San Marcos, California, where Đujić named him Chetnik Vojvoda (duke in Serbian). He went on to form the Serbian Radical Party in 1991 and was accused by the ICTY tribunal of leading the Beli Orlovi militants in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in war-state Republic of Serbian Krajina. <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> pursued post-graduate medical studies at Columbia University from 1974 to 1975, but did so without any specific political agenda at the time being; he later became the war-time president of the Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War and subsequently went into hiding in Serbia until his capture in 2008 for ICTY charges of war crimes and genocide.|$|E

5|$|On 20–22 September, the VRS 5th Kozara and 6th Sanska brigades {{managed to}} push OG Centre back {{approximately}} , while parts of OG North had {{to withdraw from}} some areas they had captured. OG North was able to continue its advance near Novi Grad and towards Ljubija against strong resistance. On 22 September, Colonel General Ratko Mladić cut short his medical treatment in Belgrade to return to Banja Luka and control the VRS more directly. The meeting between the top VRS commanders and Mladić produced a request for general mobilisation, establishment of corps-level drumhead court-martials, and a request for the SDG to leave the area—despite {{the fact that they}} had been invited by the Republika Srpska Ministry of the Interior and had been granted authority by <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić,</b> the president of Republika Srpska. Finally, a VRS counteroffensive was ordered to regain the lost territory.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} six Serbian nationalists, among them Boško Radonjić, placed a home-made bomb {{in the home of}} the Yugoslav {{consulate}} in Chicago in 1975. Radonjić later became the leader of the Westies gang in New York City, where he participated in organized crime and racketeering. He eventually {{became one of the most}} feared gangsters in the New York City underworld, and developed extensive friendships with Vojislav Stanimirović, John Gotti and the Gambino family. After Sammy Gravano turned John Gotti in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1990, Radonjić was highly suspected to have attempted to fix the trial on John Gotti's behalf. As a result of this, Radonjić was arrested on December 1999 during a spectacular rerouted plane going to Cuba to a lockdown at Miami International Airport when he was tracked down by the FBI. He was arrested in the United States again in January 2000 for further investigation of the 1992 Gotti trial. Upon release in 2001, he left the United States and moved back to Serbia where he lived until his death in 2011. He was also an admirer and long-time friend of <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> until the latter went into hiding in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle shocked the Croatian {{commander}} and later resulted in speculation about its cause. Stipetić blamed the 108th Infantry Brigade for {{the collapse of the}} Bosanski Brod bridgehead and the failure of the defence. He claimed the brigade had been pulled back from the battlefield by civilian authorities in Slavonski Brod and thought the {{outcome of the}} battle was predetermined by the Graz agreement of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders, <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and Mate Boban. General Karl Gorinšek, commander in charge of defending neighboring Slavonia during Posavina's fall, said that the Croatian administration showed no interest in defending Posavina and that he continuously got orders to not take any initiative in defending the territory. Stipetić's view regarding the Graz agreement is echoed by British historian Marko Attila Hoare, who claims that the area conceded by the Croats during Operation Corridor 92 was traded for western Herzegovina. On the other hand, Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich, among others, described that view as a conspiracy theory. While some sources have proposed that the area was traded for the JNA-held Prevlaka Peninsula near Dubrovnik, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić's</b> attempt to remove Ratko Mladić as {{commander of the}} Bosnian Serb military in early August 1995, then-General Gvero, detained Karadžić for {{a day in the}} last week of August and berated him for his hostility to Mladić and the army high command.|$|R
50|$|After {{conflict}} between Biljana Plavšić {{with the rest}} of the <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić's</b> Serb Democratic Party (SDS), she founded a new political party, the Serb National Alliance (SNS). Early elections in Republika Srpska were held in 1997, after which Plavšić and her SNS closely cooperated with the smaller Serbian socialist parties (Socialist Party and Dodik's SNSD). Dodik was nominated prime minister of Republika Srpska, even though his party had only two seats in the National Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Serbian Radical Party {{founder and}} {{paramilitary}} Vojislav Seselj publicly claimed Milošević personally {{asked him to}} send paramilitaries from Serbia into Bosnia and Herzegovina. After 1993, media reports of large-scale atrocities by the Bosnian Serb armed forces, such as the long siege of Sarajevo, resulted in increased pressure and sanctions by western governments against Serbia and Montenegro to persuade Milošević to withdraw his support of the Bosnian Serbs. After 1993, Milošević abandoned his alliance with the Serbian Radical Party and declared that his government advocated a peaceful settlement to the war. The new coalition government abandoned its support of <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić's</b> Bosnian Serb government and pressured the Bosnian Serbs to negotiate a peace treaty. During the Dayton Accord, Milošević sparred with Karadžić, who opposed the Dayton Accord, which Milošević supported as it gave Bosnian Serbs autonomy and self-governance {{over most of the}} territories they had claimed. In 1995, Milošević, President of Serbia, represented the Bosnian Serbs during the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement.|$|R
25|$|In 2016, <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> {{was found}} guilty by the ICTY for war crimes, crimes against {{humanity}} and genocide in the Srebrenica enclave, and sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{relies on}} {{evidence}} from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to argue that systematic ethnic violence occurred during the 1992 - 95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina because of the implementation of extreme ideological visions promoted by top political leaders. The first section demonstrates how Serb and Croat nationalist politicians in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia determined to create expanded monoethnic states as Yugoslavia collapsed in 1991 - 92. The second section illustrates how institutions dominated by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević and the Croatian government led by Franjo TuÄman sponsored the military campaigns conducted by Bosnian Serb and Croat forces, which attempted to realise the visions imagined in 1991 - 92. The final section reveals how in 1994 - 95, leaders from Croatia and Serbia shifted their short term strategies towards Bosnia for pragmatic reasons, and while the Croatian leadership succeeded in forcing Bosnian Croat nationalists to abate their separatist campaign, Milošević's efforts to pacify the Bosnian Serb leadership failed and <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić's</b> regime continued to pursue its state-building programme until its defeat in summer 1995. Although both Milošević and Tu&# 273;man yielded their pre-war ambitions {{in the face of}} battlefield outcomes and international pressure, this thesis argues that both leaders regarded the peace agreements they signed as temporary compromises on their long-term ambitions. The words of top political decision-makers reveal the ideas and reasoning that inspired programmes to homogenise multi-ethnic Bosnia and divide it between Serbia and Croatia. </p...|$|R

The agreement was denounced by Croat political parties. Although initially welcoming the initiative, Izetbegović later dismissed the agreement.|$|E
25|$|The Graz {{agreement}} was a proposed {{agreement made between}} the Bosnian Serb leader <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and the Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban on 6 May 1992 {{in the city of}} Graz, Austria. The agreement publicly declared the territorial division between Republika Srpska and the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and called for an end of conflicts between Serbs and Croats. The largest group in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosniaks, did not take part in the agreement and were not invited to the negotiations.|$|E
25|$|When {{the former}} Yugoslavia was {{breaking}} {{up in the}} 1990s, Reid considered it important to start {{a dialogue with the}} Bosnian Serbs. During the Bosnian War, Reid struck up a friendship with the Serb rebel leader, <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić,</b> later to be indicted as a war criminal. Reid admitted he spent three days at a luxury Geneva lakeside hotel as a guest of Karadžić in 1993. This was during the period (April 1992 – July 1995) in which the crimes for which Karadžić was indicted in 1995 were committed.|$|E
25|$|SIS {{has been}} active in the Balkans, playing a vital role in hunting down people wanted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. British {{intelligence}} operations in the Balkans are thought to have played a vital role in the handover of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević to The Hague; SIS has also been heavily involved in the hunt for <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and General Ratko Mladic, who are linked to a vast range of war crimes including the murder of Srebrenica's surrendering male population and organising the Siege of Sarajevo.|$|E
25|$|During the Bosnian War he {{advocated}} a Croat–Bosniak alliance, {{a view that}} ran counter {{to those of the}} Croatian government led by Croatian president Franjo Tuđman and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. He denounced attempts by Mate Boban, president of the self-proclaimed Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, and <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić,</b> president of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina and was appointed by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović as a member of Staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), shortly before his assassination by Croatian Defence Council (HVO) soldiers under the command of Mladen Naletilić.|$|E
25|$|In the ICTY {{case against}} Prlić et al., Herbert S. Okun {{was called to}} testify in April 2007. In this {{capacity}} as the deputy of Cyrus Vance, UN special envoy to the Balkans, he had attended a number of meetings where the division of Bosnia Herzegovina was discussed. As Okun described it, the aspirations of Croatia and Serbia for the annexation of parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina became evident after Tuđman and Milošević met in Karađorđevo in March 1991 and after the meeting of Mate Boban and <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> in May 1992 in Graz. Neither party kept their plans {{for the creation of}} separate states within Bosnia-Herzegovina and their annexation to Serbia and Croatia secret at their subsequent meetings with international diplomats. Herbert Okun testified that on May 6, 1992, <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and Mate Boban met in Graz in Austria to discuss the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina along the boundaries of the Croatian Banovina. Herbert Okun also testified that during the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, held between September 1992 and May 1993, Franjo Tuđman was the de facto president of the Bosnian Croat delegation, including, among others, Mate Boban and Milivoj Petković. During that conference, Herbert Okun heard Franjo Tuđman make statements about extending the borders of Croatia, either directly or by including Herceg-Bosna within Croatia. He also heard him make statements about his support for the government of Mate Boban.|$|E
25|$|In November 1990, {{months after}} Slovenia and Croatia {{declared}} their independence, the first free elections were held, putting nationalist parties into power with three parties. These were the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), led by Alija Izetbegović, the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), led by <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić,</b> and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), led by Stjepan Kljuić. Izetbegović was elected as the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Jure Pelivan, of the HDZ, was elected as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Momčilo Krajišnik, of the SDS, was elected as {{the speaker of}} Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 1992, {{all three}} sides signed the Lisbon Agreement: Alija Izetbegović for the Bosniaks, <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> for the Serbs and Mate Boban for the Croats. However, on 28 March 1992, Izetbegović, {{after meeting with}} the then-US {{ambassador}} to Yugoslavia Warren Zimmermann in Sarajevo, withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any type of ethnic division of Bosnia.What was said and by whom remains unclear. Zimmerman denies that he told Izetbegovic that if he withdrew his signature, the United States would grant recognition to Bosnia as an independent state. What is indisputable is that Izetbegovic, that same day, withdrew his signature and renounced the agreement.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his time}} in Sarajevo, Prazina collaborated with Republika Srpska {{officials}} {{in a variety of}} criminal activities. He often exchanged money, people, and prisoners of war with VRS authorities in the occupied territories around Sarajevo. With their support, Prazina was able to effectively run the black market during the siege. In his dealings with the VRS, Prazina even had written permission from the president of the Republika Srpska, <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić.</b> During the siege, Prazina was also in contact with Radovan's son, Saša. Post-war revelations of these activities have served to sour Prazina's legacy among the Bosniak citizens of Sarajevo, who once considered him among the most positive figures of the Bosnian war.|$|E
25|$|The former {{president}} of Republika Srpska <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> was held on trial {{and was sentenced to}} 40 years in prison in 2016 for various crimes, including crimes against humanity and genocide. Ratko Mladić is also on trial by the ICTY, charged with crimes in connection with the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre. Paramilitary leader Vojislav Šešelj has been on trial since 2007 accused of being a part of a joint criminal enterprise to ethnically cleanse large areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina of non-Serbs. The Serbian president Slobodan Milošević was charged with war crimes in connection with the war in Bosnia, including grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, crimes against humanity and genocide, but died in 2006 before the trial could finish.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{line with}} a {{majority}} of legal scholars, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have ruled that, in order for actions to be deemed genocide, there must be physical or biological destruction of a protected group and a specific intent to commit such destruction. To date, only the Srebrenica massacre {{has been found to}} be a genocide by the ICTY, a finding upheld by the ICJ. On 24 March 2016, former Bosnian Serb leader <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and the first president of the Republika Srpska, was found guilty of genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes, and crimes against humanity—10 of the 11 eleven charges in total—and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Keeping {{the peace}} in the former Yugoslavia {{continued}} to be both difficult and controversial. IFOR and SFOR had {{received a lot of}} criticism for their inability to capture the Bosnian Serb leaders <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and Ratko Mladić. In late 1998 the conflict in Kosovo, between the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovar Albanian guerilla Kosovo Liberation Army deteriorated, culminating in the Račak massacre on 15 January 1999, in which 45 Albanians were killed. NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a proper military peacekeeping force under their auspices, to forcibly restrain the two sides. On 30 January 1999, NATO announced that it was prepared to launch air strikes against Yugoslav targets. On 6 February, Solana met both sides for negotiations at the Château de Rambouillet, but they were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|The first {{occurred}} on 5 February 1994; 68 {{people were killed}} and 144 more were wounded. The second {{occurred on}} 28 August 1995 when five mortar shells killed 43 people and wounded 75 others. This latter attack was the stated reason for NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces that would eventually lead to the Dayton Peace Accords {{and the end of the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The responsibility of the Army of the Republika Srpska for the first shelling is contested, since investigations to establish the location from where the shells had been fired did not lead to unambiguous results. It was claimed that actually the Bosnian army had shelled its own people in order to provoke intervention of Western countries on their side. Even though ICTY in its appeal judgement of Stanislav Galić in 2006 summarized the evidence and ruled that the conclusion that the shells had been fired from a location occupied by Serbian forces was a reasonable one, still <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> during his trial before ICTY tried to use this rumour to his defense, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|This was {{rejected}} by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, who had boycotted the referendum. Following Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of independence (which gained international recognition), the Bosnian Serbs, led by <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić</b> and supported by the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), mobilised their forces inside Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure ethnic Serb territory, then war soon spread across the country, accompanied by ethnic cleansing. The conflict was initially between the Yugoslav Army units in Bosnia which later transformed into the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) on the one side, and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) which was largely composed of Bosniaks, and the Croat forces in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) on the other side. Tensions between Croats and Bosniaks increased throughout late 1992, resulting in the Croat–Bosniak War that fully escalated in early 1993. The Bosnian War was characterised by bitter fighting, indiscriminate shelling of cities and towns, ethnic cleansing and systematic mass rape, mainly perpetrated by Serb, and to a lesser extent, Croat and Bosniak forces. Events such as the Siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre later became iconic of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1992, the UN {{responded to}} Serbian offensives {{in the former}} Yugoslav {{republic}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a full embargo on trade with Serbia by all member nations. The sanctions placed Greece, which had recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly after its declaration in 1992, in a difficult position. Serbia was an important trading partner with strong religious and historical ties to Greece, and Serbia had initially supported the Greek position on the Macedonia naming dispute. Beginning in 1992, the Konstantinos Mitsotakis and Andreas Papandreou governments, fearing that the Bosnian war would spread {{in a direction that}} would involve Turkey, Albania and Greece, undertook long series of peace-negotiations with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milošević, Bosnian Serb leader <b>Radovan</b> <b>Karadžić,</b> and the Bosnian government without results. Meanwhile, food, oil, and arms were reported moving from Greece into Serbia in violation of the UN embargo. Before, during, and after its 1994 presidency of the EU, Greece was the only EU nation to back the Serbian position that Serbian forces had entered Bosnian territory. In early 1994, Greece incurred the displeasure of its European allies by voting against NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Greece also refused the use of its NATO air bases at Preveza on the Ionian Sea for such attacks and refused to supply Greek troops to the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In NATO, Greece's position was diametrically opposed to that of Turkey, which supported the Bosnian government.|$|E
