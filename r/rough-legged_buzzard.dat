50|$|Most {{predation}} {{recorded on}} this species {{is on the}} young at the nest. Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), brown bears (Ursus arctos) and wolverines (Gulo gulo) have all eaten eggs and young of this species if {{they are capable of}} accessing nests on foot. Avian scavengers, especially maurading groups of common ravens, will also readily predate eggs and nestlings, as will skuas (Stercorarius ssp.). Snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) are a potential predator at the nest as well.

25|$|Other raptors, {{large and}} small, are often {{outright}} dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the relative paucity of mid-sized Buteo species {{is thought to}} be due to the radiation of large Aquila eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no Aquila eagles other than the golden eagle, Buteo species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's (Buteo swainsoni) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis)) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three Buteos. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), black kite (Milvus migrans), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), Cooper's hawks (Accipter cooperii), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), common buzzards (Buteo buteo), long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus), upland <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo hemilasius), <b>rough-legged</b> <b>buzzards,</b> Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), American kestrels (Falco sparverius), merlins (Falco columbarius), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a red-shouldered hawk. It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like <b>rough-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitats there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.|$|R
40|$|In a {{short but}} intense field investigation, surface {{activity}} of common voles in a cropped lucerne field was assayed by live-trapping while, simultaneously, hunting activity and yield of three species of raptors were recorded by continuous observation. Pronounced short-­term rhythms in trappability of the vole population ran parallel with fluctuations in yield per hour of flight-hunt of hen harriers and kestrels. These raptors, {{as well as}} <b>Rough-legged</b> <b>buzzards,</b> hunted more at times of increased vole surface activity; hen harriers saved c. 1. 5 hours of flight-hunt per day by such temporal adjustment, corresponding to about 12 % of their daily energy intake. Voles suffered a predation rate of an estimated 0. 2 % per day; under such heavy predation and temporal concentration of raptor hunting at times of increased vole activity, surface feeding in synchrony with the vole majority was associated with increased risk of predation. ...|$|R
50|$|This avian {{predator}} hunts opportunistically, occasionally supplementing {{their diet}} with carrion, but focusing {{primarily on the}} most locally abundant small vertebrates. Rough-legged hawks will steal prey from other individuals {{of the same species}} as well as other species such as the red-tailed hawk, hen harrier (Circus cyaenus), American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and common raven (Corvus corax). Prey sizes typically range from 6.5 - 2587 g and adults require 80 - 120 g of food daily, around the body mass of the largest species of vole or lemming although most species weigh a bit less. These raptors hunt during the daytime. Like most Buteos, <b>rough-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> have been reported both still-hunting (watching for prey from a perch and then stooping) and watching for prey while in flight.

The chances of survival increase incrementally both when they reach the fledging stage and when they can start hunting for themselves. Death of flying immatures and adults are often the result of human activity, including collisions with power lines, buildings and vehicles, incidental ingestion of poison or lead from prey or illegal hunting and trapping.|$|R
