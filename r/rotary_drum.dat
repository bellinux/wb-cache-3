30|$|This step {{involves}} two connected <b>rotary</b> <b>drums</b> (Fig.  4) [44]. The first one, the dryer, {{is used to}} dry fertilizer granules by flowing crosscurrent {{heated air}} (between 300 and 800  °C at the drum entry, depending on the raw materials used to obtain the granule) to granules running inside the drum [44]. Temperatures at granule surface reach around 90  °C and granule humidity is reduced from 8 – 10  % to less than 1  % [44].

40|$|Abstract: Drying {{being one}} of the most {{energy-intensive}} operations is of great importance in the fertilizer industry. <b>Rotary</b> <b>drums</b> are often used for drying in fertilizer industry. This dryer consists basically of a cylindrical shell inclined at a small angle to the horizontal. Wet feed is introduced into {{the upper end of the}} dryer and the dried product withdrawn at the lower end. The inside of the shell is equipped with lifting flights. In the present work, the drying of granulated fertilizers (GTSP) using a concurrent rotary dryer was investigated experimentally. The fluid dynamics aspects and its influence on dryer performance were analyzed. The results obtained show that the concurrent dryer residence time and hold-up were lower than the ones of the counter-current dryer. The drying rate of the two dryer’s configurations was very similar, but the counter-current configuration removes a larger quantity of water from the particles of fertilizers...|$|R
50|$|Flights, also {{commonly}} referred to as “lifters,” are used in rotary dryers and rotary coolers to shower material through the process gas stream. Affixed to the interior of the <b>rotary</b> <b>drum,</b> these fin-like structures scoop up material from the bed and shower it through the gas stream as the drum rotates.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, the {{addition}} of an agglomeration drum has improved on the heap leaching process by allowing for a more efficient leach. The <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> agglomerator, such as the tyre driven Sepro Agglomeration Drum works by taking the crushed ore fines and agglomerating them into more uniform particles. This makes it much easier for the leaching solution to percolate through the pile, making {{its way through the}} channels between particles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{weapon is}} {{described}} as an [...] "air-cooled, electrically powered, rapid firing weapon." [...] All portions of the firing cycle are powered this way so the unit requires an external power source. Other important features are the reciprocating barrel and cam assembly that drive the other components of the system. All phases of the weapon cycle are positively controlled by the drum cam assembly in which a planetary gear train is enclosed, responsible for reducing the motor's high speed to the desired rate for the gun. The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the drum cam through a flexible shaft in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil. The weapon accepts linked ammunition, which was fed from <b>rotary</b> <b>drums</b> {{in the case of}} the M5 and M28 systems, and from boxes {{in the case of the}} XM9 systems. [...] The M5 could also use a box magazine.|$|R
50|$|The firearm is {{equipped}} with iron sights that consist of a <b>rotary</b> rear <b>drum</b> and hooded front post. The rear sight, mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation, has an open notch used to fire up to 100 m and three apertures used for: 200, 300 and 400 m. The receiver housing has recesses that work with HK clamp adapters used to mount day or night optics.|$|R
50|$|Roundabout {{interchanges}} {{are much}} less common in North America but have been built more frequently since 1995, to improve safety, and to reduce traffic delays and bridge widening costs. However, many of the older and more dangerous rotary-style overpass interchanges have been signalized to improve throughput and safety, such as the former <b>Drum</b> Hill <b>Rotary</b> (now <b>Drum</b> Hill Square) in Chelmsford, Massachusetts in New England, where such interchanges are unusually common.|$|R
50|$|The MP5K is {{produced}} (by Heckler & Koch and under license in Iran and Turkey) in four different versions: the MP5K, MP5KA4, MP5KA1, MP5KA5, {{where the first}} two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched <b>rotary</b> <b>drum),</b> and the two remaining variants - fixed open sights; however, the front sight post was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights {{through the use of}} an adapter.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991 {{a further}} {{variant of the}} MP5K was developed, {{designated}} the MP5K-PDW (PDW—Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the fire handling characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a [...] "Navy" [...] trigger group, a front sight post with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.|$|E
50|$|After Navy {{officials}} {{had been forced}} to explain to Congress why four production contracts had been signed before avionics testing had been completed, action was taken; Grumman and the US Navy scrambled to improve the design. The unreliable <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> computer was replaced by a Litton L-304 digital computer and various avionics systems were replaced - the upgraded aircraft were designated E-2Bs. In total, 49 of the 59 E-2As were upgraded to E-2B standard. These aircraft replaced the E-1B Tracers in the various US Navy AEW squadrons and it was the E-2B that was to set a new standard for carrier based AEW aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A {{successor}} {{variant of}} the AEK-971 line designated as the A-545 (official GRAU designation 6P67) which is chambered in 5.45×39mm. The rifle features numerous internal and external improvements over earlier AEK-971 models. It features iron sights that consist of a <b>rotary</b> rear <b>drum</b> aperture and a hooded front post creating a significantly longer sight line, an ambidextrous fire mode selectors/safety levers, retractable and adjustable shoulder stock. Also the Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket is omitted and replaced by a Picatinny Rail on a redesigned receiver top for mounting auxiliary equipment, such as optical red dot sights.|$|R
50|$|As the {{technology}} matured, most large printer installations were drum printers, {{a type of}} impact printer which could print an entire line of text at once {{through the use of}} a high speed <b>rotary</b> printing <b>drum.</b> It was thought that in the event of a severe jam, the friction of paper against the drum could ignite either the paper itself, or, in a dirty machine, the accumulated paper and ink dust in the mechanism. Whether this ever happened is not known; there are no reports of friction-related printer fires.|$|R
5000|$|Vat {{level and}} drum speed {{are the two}} basic {{operating}} parameters for any <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>drum</b> filter. These parameters are adjusted dependently to each other to optimize the filtration performance.Valve level determines the proportion filter cycle in the filter. The filter cycle consist of the filter drum rotation, release of cake formation from slurry and the drying period for the cake formation shown in figure 1. By default, operate the vat at its maximum level to maximise the rate of filtration. Reduce vat level if discharged solid {{is in the form}} of thin and slimy cake or if the discharged solid is very thick.589 ...|$|R
