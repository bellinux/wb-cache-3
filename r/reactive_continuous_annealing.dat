40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> of GaAs {{solar cells}} is {{compared}} with periodic annealing {{to determine their}} relative effectiveness in minimizing proton radiation damage. It is concluded that <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> of the cells in space at 150 C can effectively reduce the proton radiation damage to the GaAs solar cells. Periodic annealing is most effective {{if it can be}} initiated at relatively low fluences (approximating <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing),</b> especially if low temperatures of less than 200 C are to be used. If annealing is started only after the fluence of the damaging protons has accumulated to a high value 10 to the 11 th power sq/pcm), effective annealing is still possible at relatively high temperatures. Finally, since electron radiation damage anneals even more easily than proton radiation damage, substantial improvements in GaAs solar cell life can be achieved by incorporating the proper annealing capabilities in solar panels for practical space missions where both electron and proton radiation damage have to be minimized...|$|R

40|$|In this presentation, {{the effect}} of higher heating rate in <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> on {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of a cold-rolled 590 [*]MPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase steel were investigated by using microstructural observation and mechanical property measurement. The results show that compared with the conventional <b>continuous</b> <b>annealed</b> steels heated {{at a rate of}} 5 [*]∘C/s (CA), the average ferrite grain sizes heated at a higher rate (300 [*]∘C/s, HRA) was obviously refined from 15. 6 μm to 5. 3 μm. The morphology of martensite is observed to shift from network along ferrite grain boundaries to uniformly dispersed in the final DP 590 microstructure. Twinned substructure of martensite can be found when heated at a higher heating rate in <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing.</b> EBSD orientation maps show that the fraction of low angle grain boundary is increased in HRA sample compared to CA sample.

40|$|The {{strip steel}} surface {{condition}} after <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> of strip {{is extremely important}} {{to the quality of}} galvannealed coating (GA). The presence of oxides or precipitated can affect the reactions at the coating/substrate interface and decrease the zinc wettability on the steel surface, leading to various defects in the final product. To avoid oxidation of the material during <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing,</b> a protective atmosphere is used in the furnaces. Despite this atmosphere, it is possible the selective oxidation or precipitation of second phase particles, being the dew point of atmosphere one of the leading factors to reduce this occurrence. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the dew point on the quality of GA coatings applied to a bake hardenable steel. The <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> under dew points of – 60 °C, 30 °C and 0 °C, as well as hot dip galvanizing, were performed in a Hot Dip Process Simulator.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of electron flux and temperature on radiation damage in GaAs solar cells. The defect levels and the power ratio of the GaAs solar cells under various irradiation conditions are compared. In a 200 C <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> experiment, the GaAs solar cells which were irradiated at a flux of 2 x 10 to the 9 th e/sq cm s suffered less power degradation than the cells which were irradiated at the same temperature at a higher flux of 4 x 10 to the 10 th e/sq cm s. After the <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> experiment, a single-step post annealing at 200 C was performed for 40 hr on these irradiated cells. An additional improvement in power recovery was observed only on those cells irradiated at the high flux of 4 x 10 to the 10 th e/sq cm s. DLTS data indicate that the defect density decreases with lower electron flux. Both of these observations strongly suggest that the <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> in GaAs cells can be effective at temperatures as low as 150 C, or even less in a space environment such as geosynchronous orbit...|$|R
40|$|To {{compete in}} the current {{economic}} climate steel companies are striving to reduce costs and tighten process windows. It was {{with this in mind}} that a property prediction model for <b>continuous</b> <b>annealed</b> steels produced at Tata Steel’s plants in South Wales was developed. As <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> is one of the final processes that strip steel undergoes before being dispatched to the customer the final properties of the strip are dependent on many factors. These include the annealing conditions, previous thermo-­‐mechanical processing and the steel chemistry. Currently these properties, proof stress, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, strain ratio and strain hardening exponent, are found using a tensile test {{at the tail end of}} the coil. This thesis describes the development of a model to predict the final properties of <b>continuous</b> <b>annealed</b> steel. Actual process data along with mechanical properties derived using tensile testing were used to create the model. A generalised regression network was used as the main predictive mechanism. The non-­‐linear generalised regression approach was shown to exceed the predictive accuracy of multiple regression techniques. The use of a genetic algorithm to reduce the number of inputs was shown to increase the accuracy of the model when compared to those trained with all available inputs and those trained using correlation derived inputs. Further work is shown where the fully trained models were used to predict the relationships that exist between the processing conditions and mechanical properties. This was extended to predict the interaction between two process conditions varying at the same time. Using this approach produced predictions that mirrored known relationships within <b>continuous</b> <b>annealed</b> steels and gives predictions specific to the plant that could be used to optimise the process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of the boron concentration on phase transformation characteristics, microstructure and mechanical properties of multiphase steels was investigated using computational thermodynamics (Thermo-Calc®), dilatometry, quantitative metallography and tensile tests. Pilot scale 50 kg steel ingots were prepared in an induction furnace operating under an argon gas atmosphere with boron contents between 0 and 47 ppm. The ingots were cut into 35 mm thick blocks, which were reheated to 1250 °C for 1 h and hot rolled for seven passes to attain a thickness of 7. 0 mm. The hot-rolled sheets were machined and then cold rolled to a final thickness of 1. 2 mm. <b>Continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> cycles were performed in a Bähr dilatomer and in a Gleeble machine. <b>Continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> laboratory simulations showed that boron did not significantly influence the amount of austenite formed during heating and soaking steps. However, boron influenced austenite transformation during the cooling step, which reduced the amount of ferrite and increased the amount of bainite. Regarding the mechanical properties, adding boron increased strength and decreased ductility of the product. The steels with boron concentrations up to 27 ppm exhibited the greatest effect.

40|$|Interstitial Free (IF) steels have {{excellent}} deep drawing capabilities and non-ageing properties. These steel grades {{still have some}} disadvantages such as a generally weak mechanical strength and high reactivity in the grain boundaries during galvannealing, which produces brittle Fe-Zn-intermetallic compounds. Furthermore the resistance to secondary work embrittlement is rather low due {{to the absence of}} soluble interstitials in grain boundaries. A good remedy is the insertion of a defined amount of carbon into the surface after recrystallization started. The possibilities and limits of a change in surface properties of Ti-IF sheet steel by a short time annealing in reactive atmospheres (CO, H 2, N 2) were evaluated: The introduction of carbon interstitials during <b>continuous</b> <b>annealing</b> increases mechanical strength associated with bake hardening and moderate age hardening and a good formability.
