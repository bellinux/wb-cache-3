5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X <b>Reentry</b> Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} <b>reentry</b> measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical <b>reentry</b> vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E
5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar <b>reentry</b> was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital <b>reentry</b> speed.|$|E
5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger <b>reentry</b> module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged <b>reentry</b> module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew of the spacecraft which required rescuing.|$|E

5|$|The {{unmanned}} Progress cargo {{vehicles were}} only used to resupply the station, carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes including water, fuel, food and experimental equipment. The spacecraft were not equipped with <b>reentry</b> shielding and so, unlike their Soyuz counterparts, were incapable of surviving <b>reentry.</b> As a result, when its cargo had been unloaded, each Progress was refilled with rubbish, spent equipment and other waste which was destroyed, along with the Progress itself, on <b>reentry.</b> In order to facilitate cargo return, ten Progress flights carried Raduga capsules, which could return around 150kg of experimental results to Earth automatically. Mir was visited by three separate models of Progress; the original 7K-TG variant equipped with Igla (18 flights), the Progress-M model equipped with Kurs (43 flights), and the modified Progress-M1 version (3 flights), which together flew a total of 64 resupply missions. Whilst the Progress spacecraft usually docked automatically without incident, the station was equipped with a remote manual docking system, TORU, in case problems were encountered during the automatic approaches. With TORU cosmonauts could guide the spacecraft safely in to dock (with {{the exception of the}} catastrophic docking of Progress M-34, when the long-range use of the system resulted in the spacecraft's striking the station, damaging Spektr and causing decompression).|$|E

He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his <b>reentry</b> control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.|$|E

5|$|Some {{concerns}} were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield {{would not have}} been able to protect it during the higher speed ballistic <b>reentry</b> associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several solid rocket motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead <b>reentry</b> vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini <b>Reentry</b> Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to understanding the dynamical mechanisms underlying early afterdepolarization (EAD) -mediated arrhythmias. EADs are a richly mined area of research {{that has resulted in}} little therapeutic benefit at the bedside since their first description in the early 1980 's. In an effort to provide a fresh perspective on EADs, I take an experimental and computational non-linear dynamics approach to studying these arrhythmias that plague millions worldwide and are associated with significant cost burden and high mortality. Here, I show that the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation mechanism for generating EADs may be responsible for EAD-mediated arrhythmias in cardiac disease, providing new therapeutic targets and expanding the current concept of reduced repolarization reserve. Also, I provide evidence that certain pathological cardiac tissue substrates may exhibit the unique dynamical property of bistability (ie. switch-like behavior) in the form of biexcitability, the ability to switch between INa- and ICa-mediated propagation. This unique property of biexcitability may provide significant mechanistic insight into the seemingly paradoxical properties of certain EAD-mediated arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes (TdP), that is uniquely characterized by a slow rate and undulating QRS complexes on ECG. Lastly, I show that activation of KATP channels (inward rectifying K channels that open when cellular ATP levels fall) "flips the switch" from ICa- to INa-mediated propagation. Consistent with clinical observations of TdP and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), the majority of ICa-dependent <b>reentries</b> spontaneously terminate following KATP channel activation, with a minority of ICa-dependent <b>reentries</b> converting to INa-dependent <b>reentries.</b> These results suggest that in the clinical setting, KATP channels may serve as an "emergency repolarization reserve" to spontaneously terminate most episodes of ICa-dependent arrhythmias such as PVT and TdP, but may also facilitate the occasional degeneration of these arrhythmias to INa-dependent VT/VF. These findings provide a fresh perspective on EAD-mediated arrhtyhmias that may lead to novel therapeutics at the bedside...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the <b>reentry</b> through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched <b>reentry</b> module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
