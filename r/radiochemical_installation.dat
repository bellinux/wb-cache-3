40|$|Abstract – Numerous {{methods for}} {{processing}} of hydrogen chloride to chlorine are known. A traditional method is electrolysis of an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. Chemical methods include oxidation of hydrogen chloride by nitrogen oxides or air oxygen (with heating {{in the presence}} of catalysts). Physical methods are ultraviolet irradiation and the electrical pulse discharge. The present work deals with the possibility of converting HCl to molecular chlorine {{with the use of a}} nanosecond electron beam in liquid and gas phases and as an aerosol. The experiments were realized on a <b>radiochemical</b> <b>installation</b> based on a URT- 0. 5 accelerator (400 keV, 50 ns, 1 kW). It is shown that the highest conversion (up to 25 %) is achieved in aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid. The conversion in the irradiated gas phase is a maximum at the minimum pressure of the water vapor: not over 1 %. Irradiation of aerosols practically does not initiate the desired process. In the experiments, the adsorbed dose was 0. 16 to 1. 6 MGy. The use of hydrochloric acid more than 1 % strong does not increase the amount of chlorine and, therefore, for adaptation of this process to industrial requirements it is expedient to separate chlorine as crystalline hydrate. The process is realizable in a continuous regime and can be aimed at recycling of hydrochloric acid waste and production of chlorine-containing oxidizers and whiteners. The proposed process can also be used to disinfect water. The exposure of ~ 0. 02 % hydrochloric acid to an electron beam can provide a “chlorinating agent”. The addition of this “chlorinating agent ” to potable water will have an effect similar to chlorination. An advantage of this scheme is the elimination of poisonous molecular chlorine. Generally, the process can be referred to processes of “green chemistry ” as it does not require the use of high temperatures, dangerous reagents and solvents. The relevant equipment meets the same requirements. 1...|$|E
