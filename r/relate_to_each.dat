5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or {{an earlier version of}} that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language {{in terms of the}} concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

Shoaling groups can include fish of disparate sizes and can including mixed-species subgroups.|$|E
25|$|Particle {{physicists}} study matter {{made from}} fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles – gauge bosons – acting as force carriers. At {{the beginning of}} the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries, however, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known to be incomplete.|$|E

25|$|The {{gender of}} God {{may be viewed}} as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in {{classical}} western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and <b>relate</b> <b>to,</b> <b>each</b> other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.|$|E
25|$|During the articling period, the {{candidate}} will write {{a series of}} professional examinations and complete three field projects. The examinations are intended to demonstrate that {{the candidate}} has a strong knowledge of every aspect of professional land surveying. These include statutes, regulations, practice of land surveying, the General Survey Instruction Rules, and the Surveyor General Circular Letters as they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> component of their education. The three field projects are intended to demonstrate the candidates’ practical skills including field measurements, evidence evaluation, boundary resolution, interaction with clients, and project management. Professional examinations and field projects are intended to test the candidates’ required theoretical knowledge and practical skills required to succeed as a land surveyor.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{theories}} of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, {{it is reasonable}} to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional {{theories of}} grammar differ from formal theories of grammar, in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.|$|E

25|$|Social {{psychology}} {{is the study}} of how humans think about each other and how they <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. conformity, persuasion), and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes about other people. Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of group dynamics reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the microsocial level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social, and total institution.|$|E
500|$|Syntax is {{the rules}} and {{processes}} that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language, how words <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other within clauses or phrases and how those phrases <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other within a sentence to convey meaning. Khmer syntax is very analytic. Relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and, particularly in formal and literary registers, grammatical marking particles. Grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to English [...] "wh-words".|$|E
