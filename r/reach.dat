40|$|Abstract—Previous {{research}} suggests that <b>reaching</b> and walk-ing behaviors may be linked developmentally as <b>reaching</b> changes {{at the onset of}} walking. Here we report new evidence on an appar-ent loss of the distinction between the reachable and nonreachable distances as children start walking. The experiment compare non-walkers, walkers with help, and independent walkers in a <b>reaching</b> task to targets at varying distances including reachable and nonreachable ones. <b>Reaching</b> attempts, contact, leaning, and communication behaviors were recorded. Most of the children <b>reached</b> for the unreachable objects the first time. Non-walkers, however, <b>reached</b> less on the subsequent trials showing clear adjustment of their <b>reaching</b> decisions with the failures. On the contrary, walkers consistently attempted <b>reaches</b> to targets at unreachable distances. We suggest that these <b>reaching</b> errors may result from inappropriate integration of <b>reaching</b> and locomotor actions, attention control and near/far visual space. We propose a reward-mediated model implemented on a NAO humanoid robot that replicates the main results from our study showing an increase in <b>reaching</b> attempts to nonreachable distances after the onset of walking. Index Terms—infant <b>reaching,</b> perceived reachability, <b>reaching</b> and walking, near and far space integration...|$|R
