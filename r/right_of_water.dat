40|$|The {{increasing}} need {{to achieve}} the hydrological balance that assures the sufficient supply of water the population, will be achieved harmonizing the demand, by means the efficient use and responsible for this resource. Nowadays there are serious problems of availability, losses and water pollution, that in a shortage situation, the threat centers on three fundamental aspects of the human well-being: the food production, the health and {{the political and social}} stability. 	For these reasons, the present Thesis proposes to reach a sustainable management of the water resource in the processes of La Oroya Metallurgical Complex. Seeking to reduce the flows in the captation of sources, from 85. 40 m 3 /min (1, 423. 33 l/s) to 22. 97 m 3 /min (382. 83 l/s), in a period of 10 years, independently of the demands of future projects. 	The project is sustained in the implementation of a new operative culture by systems in closed circuit, re-circulating the water in the processes and using alone cold water for reinstatement for evaporation, losses and drainages. 	The objectives are the following ones: 	- Eliminate the capture of the water of the Rio Mantaro, 48 m 3 /min (800 l/s). 	- Reduce the flow of capture of the source of the Tishgo River, of 34 m 3 /min to 19. 57 m 3 /min, meaning an effective reduction of 42 % (14. 43 m 3 /min). 	- Reduce the costs for <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> consumption, of S/. 711, 000 / year to S/. 230, 000 / year. 	- Obtain a total benefit for the year 2012, of US$ 1, 309, 000. 	- Have reliable systems for the water supply in different epochs of the year, especially in epochs of low water. 	- Reduce costs of maintenance and operation; due to the water consumption of better quality. 	- Eliminate effluents, achieving zero negative impact to the basin of the Mantaro River. 	- Achieve major availability of water flow to attend to other priorities of the communities and La Oroya population. 	To achieve the indicated goals, there was investigated the availability and demand of the water sources, the geology of the hydrographic basins of the Tishgo river and Cuchimachay water source, the climatology, the physical and chemical characterization in different epochs of the year. Likewise, the update of the water balance sheets were elaborated in La Oroya Metallurgical Complex, depending on the optimization in the demand of the processes, progressive implementation of the PAMA projects and modernization projects. 	Finally, the economic analysis demonstrates the viability of the Thesis, achieving a Net Present Value (NPV) positive and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) bigger than the rate of interest of the financial market. La creciente necesidad de lograr el equilibrio hidrológico que asegure el suministro suficiente de agua a la población, se logrará armonizando su demanda, mediante el uso eficiente y responsable de este recurso. Actualmente existen graves problemas de disponibilidad, desperdicio y contaminación del agua, que frente a una situación de escasez, la amenaza se concentra sobre tres aspectos fundamentales del bienestar humano: la producción de alimentos, la salud y la estabilidad política y social. 	Por estas razones, la presente Tesis está empeñada en lograr una gestión sustentable del recurso hídrico en los procesos del Complejo Metalúrgico de La Oroya, buscando reducir los flujos en las fuentes de captación desde 85. 40 m 3 /min (1, 423. 33 l/s) a 22. 97 m 3 /min (382. 83 l/s), en un periodo de 10 años, independientemente de las demandas de los diversos proyectos a ejecutarse. 	El proyecto se sustenta en la implementación de una nueva cultura operativa con sistemas en circuito cerrado, recirculando el agua en los procesos y usando solo agua fresca para fines de reposición por evaporación, compensación por pérdidas y drenajes. 	Los objetivos son los siguientes: 	- Eliminar la captación del agua del Río Mantaro, 48 m 3 /min. (800 l/s). 	- Reducir el caudal de captación de la fuente del Río Tishgo, de 34 m 3 /min a 19. 57 m 3 /min, representado una reducción efectiva del 42 % (14. 43 m 3 /min) (240. 5 l/s). 	- Reducir los costos por derecho de consumo de agua, de S/. 711 000 /año a S/. 230 000 /año. 	- Obtener un beneficio total para el año 2012, de US$ 1 309 000. 00 	- Disponer de sistemas confiables para el suministro de agua en diferentes épocas del año, en especial en épocas de estiaje. 	- Reducir costos de mantenimiento y de operación; debido al consumo de agua de mejor calidad. 	- Eliminar efluentes, logrando a cero el impacto negativo a la cuenca del río Mantaro. 	- Lograr mayor disponibilidad de caudal de agua para atender otras prioridades del entorno comunitario. 	Para lograr las metas indicadas, se investigó la disponibilidad y demanda de las fuentes de agua, la geología de las cuencas hidrográficas del río Tishgo y del manantial Cuchimachay, la climatología, la caracterización físico - química en diferentes épocas del año. Asimismo, se elaboró la actualización de los balances de agua en el Complejo Metalúrgico de La Oroya, en función de la optimización en la demanda de los procesos, e implementación progresiva de los proyectos PAMA y proyectos de modernización. 	Finalmente, el análisis económico evidencia la viabilidad de la Tesis, logrando un Valor Actual Neto (VAN) positivo y una Tasa Interna de Rentabilidad (TIR) mayor a la tasa de interés del mercado financiero...|$|E

A convenience sample of 100 subjects who came to the Health Center 51 (under Bangkok Metropolitan Administration) regardless of their purpose was asked to participate the interview. The results showed that most subjects were female (79 %), with an average age of 40 years, having elementary school education (52 %), working as house keepers (32 %) and wage-based labors (30 %), and having a monthly income between 3, 001 and 5, 000 baht. In at least one of their diarrhea experiences, self-medication was the most popular means of management (73 %), where those with higher education were morel likely to be less self-medicated (P = 0. 01), and to leave the diarrhea untreated (P < 0. 001). It was found that 54 % of the subjects reported using ORS every time when having diarrhea. However, those with higher education seemed to use ORS less frequently (P < 0. 001). Most understood that dehydration or weakness was the consequence of diarrhea (92 %), and ORS could prevent such event (61 %). Yet, many thought that ORS could eradicate bacteria or germs (42 %).
