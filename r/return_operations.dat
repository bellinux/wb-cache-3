50|$|Eugene Meyer persuaded Orlando Weber to {{take charge}} of Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation. An inscrutable man, Weber {{initiated}} an autocratic regime (1920-1935) which was successful financially, but at the cost of reversing previously agreed policy about company autonomy. The family attempted to gain a controlling interest by quietly acquiring large amounts of stock in the corporation. They failed to <b>return</b> <b>operations</b> of the plant to local control, or to enable reemployment of personnel terminated by the new corporation, contrary to agreement with the Hazard family. Members of the family remained in Solvay and subsequently in Syracuse and Cazenovia, New York. The family has been notable for active participation in reform movements and for philanthropy, such major gifts to the Syracuse Hospital for Women and Children, which became Memorial Hospital, and later Crouse-Irving Hospital, and now Crouse Hospital.|$|E

5000|$|His first book, Security Analysis, with David Dodd, was {{published}} in 1934. Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, published in 1949 (4th revision, with Jason Zweig, 2003), are his two most widely acclaimed books. Warren Buffett describes The Intelligent Investor as [...] "the best book about investing ever written." [...] Graham exhorted the stock market participant to first draw a fundamental distinction between investment and speculation. In Security Analysis, he proposed a clear definition of investment that was distinguished from what he deemed speculation. It read, [...] "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate <b>return.</b> <b>Operations</b> not meeting these requirements are speculative."Graham wrote that the owner of equity stocks should regard them first and foremost as conferring part ownership of a business. With that perspective in mind, the stock owner should not be too concerned with erratic fluctuations in stock prices, since {{in the short term}} the stock market behaves like a voting machine, but in the long term it acts like a weighing machine (i.e. its true value will be reflected in its stock price in the long run). Graham distinguished between the passive and the active investor. The passive investor, often referred to as a defensive investor, invests cautiously, looks for value stocks, and buys for the long term. The active investor, on the other hand, is one who has more time, interest, and possibly more specialized knowledge to seek out exceptional buys in the market. Graham recommended that investors spend time and effort to analyze the financial state of companies. When a company is available on the market at a price which is at a discount to its intrinsic value, a [...] "margin of safety" [...] exists, which makes it suitable for investment.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} Memory with Memory Genetic Programming (MwM-GP), {{where we}} use soft assignments and soft <b>return</b> <b>operations.</b> Instead {{of having the}} new value completely overwrite the old value of registers or memory, soft assignments combine such values. Similarly, in soft <b>return</b> <b>operations</b> {{the value of a}} function node is a blend between the result of a calculation and previously returned results. In extensive empirical tests, MwM-GP almost always does as well as traditional GP, while significantly outperforming it in several cases. MwM-GP also tends to be far more consistent than traditional GP. The data suggest that MwM-GP works by successively refining an approximate solution to the target problem and that it is much less likely to have truly ineffective code. MwM-GP can continue to improve over time, but it is less likely to get the sort of exact solution that one might find with traditional GP. Copyright © 2009 Riccardo Poli et al.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{context-sensitive}} analysis of binaries {{that may have}} obfuscated procedure call and <b>return</b> <b>operations</b> is presented. Such binaries may use operators to directly manipulate stack instead of using native call and ret instructions to achieve equivalent behavior. Since definition of context-sensitivity and algorithms for contextsensitive analysis have thus far been based on the specific semantics associated to procedure call and <b>return</b> <b>operations,</b> classic interprocedural analyses cannot be used reliably for analyzing programs in which these operations cannot be discerned. A new notion of context-sensitivity is introduced {{that is based on}} the state of the stack at any instruction. While changes in ‘calling’-context are associated with transfer of control, and hence can be reasoned in terms of paths in an interprocedural control flow graph (ICFG), the same is not true of changes in ‘stack’-context. An abstract interpretation based framework is developed to reason about stackcontexts and to derive analogues of call-strings based methods for the context-sensitive analysis using stack-context. The method presented is used to create a context-sensitive version of Venable et al. ’s algorithm for detecting obfuscated calls. Experimental results show that the context-sensitive version of the algorithm generates more precise results and is also computationally more efficient than its context-insensitive counterpart...|$|E

40|$|A space based orbital {{transfer}} vehicle (SBOTV) {{and ground}} based OTV's (GBOTV) are compared for debris protection, space based OTV maintenance provisions, flight performance, onorbit refueling, and launch and <b>return</b> <b>operations.</b> Debris protection has a severe {{impact on the}} SBOTV, while the penalty for the GBOTV is much less severe. A key technology issue is the protection capability of composite materials. Onorbit maintenance is critical for SBOTV. Reduction of losses during the various transfers is th maine problem with refueling a SBOTV. Zero-g propellant storage and transfer is an important technology area for SBOTV. A reusable shroud must be developed to return GBOTV's if a Shuttle derivative vehicle is used. The advantage of space basing lies in more efficient use of the launch vehicle. Since most of the mass going to LEO is OTV propellant, and the launches to deliver the SBOTV propellant are generally mass limited, substantially fewer launches are required to support the SBOTV...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{e-commerce}} in recent time, management of returns is increasingly {{becoming one of the}} critical challenges for online retailers commonly known as e-tailers. Returns management literature has focused less attention on addressing the issues of customer service values. However, product returns to e-tailers require more logistics and customer effort and it is essential for organisations to consider returns positively and develop customer oriented returns management systems. With the aim of extending the returns management literature, our research objectives are to develop a conceptual <b>return</b> <b>operations</b> process model and identify critical determinants for product returns services. Through the critical case sampling method we identify 19 major e-tailersin Australia and analyse contents of their returns policies in terms of returns service processes. We develop a returns operations process model and identifycritical determinants for efficient product returns.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the fifth {{enlargement}} of the EU, the increasing securitisation of JHA policies and the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, the issue of integrated border management (IBM) has become crucial since 2001. Building upon the existing fragmented framework, the creation of the FRONTEX Agency brings an innovative and tailor-made institutional response designed by the Council Regulation No. 2007 / 2004 /EC in order to promote burden sharing, solidarity and mutual trust between the Member States in the operational management of the EU's external borders. Despite no direct operational powers, the FRONTEX Agency has been assigned a large array of competences in various sectors, including a pioneering mission of coordination of operational cooperation and the controversial task of assisting joint <b>return</b> <b>operations.</b> This paper addresses fundamental questions related to the issue of integrated border management. It seeks to assess the role and limits of the FRONTEX Agency in the operational management of the EU's external borders in order to examine in what way the creation of this 19 th European agency embodies a decisive step forward towards the construction of an EU common policy on external borders...|$|E
40|$|Future {{missions}} to Mars will place {{heavy emphasis on}} scientific sample and <b>return</b> <b>operations,</b> which will require a rover to revisit sites of interest. Visual Teach and Repeat (VT&R) {{has proven to be}} an effective method to enable autonomous repeating of any previously driven route without a global positioning system. However, one of the major challenges in recognizing previously visited locations is lighting change, as this can drastically change the appearance of the scene. In an effort to achieve lighting invariance, this thesis details the design of a VT&R system that uses a laser scanner as the primary sensor. The key novelty is to apply appearance-based vision techniques traditionally used with camera systems to laser intensity images for motion estimation. Field tests were conducted in an outdoor environment over an entire diurnal cycle, covering more than 11 km with an autonomy rate of 99. 7 % by distance. ii Acknowledgements I owe my entire academic career as a researcher to Professor Timothy Barfoot —my super-visor and mentor.

30|$|Another return {{processing}} {{location is}} a separate RC, operated by the retailer or a service provider. It is mainly used when return handling processes become too work-intensive and DC capacities are scarce. These centers are specialized in processing returns. Outsourcing <b>return</b> <b>operations</b> can offer potential cost savings if products are reworked in low-wage countries. This is why external RCs are used most often by fashion retailers with high return rates, because they can reduce their processing costs. However, in this case, a longer lead time for reprocessing {{has to be taken}} into consideration. This in turn is a challenge for fashion retailers with high return rates. In general, fashion items are only in demand for a limited period. Long lead times for reintegration into the sellable inventory may therefore lead to a loss of sales, if items are still being reworked and are unavailable. This illustrates the ambivalent nature of separate RCs, particularly for fashion retailers. A combination of processing returns at DCs and RCs is also possible. Goods that require more complex reprocessing are then shipped to the RC, whereas simpler reworking is carried out at the DC. Dedicated RCs are, however, only used by less than 20 % of the OC retailers surveyed. The items are shipped from the RC to the DC after return processing.|$|E
40|$|Beyond {{the current}} ExoMars programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) is {{investigating}} {{a range of}} technology developments and exploration mission opportunities leading to a future Mars Sample Return Mission (MSR), a critical next in the exploration of Mars. To fulfil their scientific objectives, all of these missions require an arm with a long reach capable of performing a variety of tasks in stringent environmental conditions, such as low gravity sampling and precise sample handling and insertion. As part of a CREST- 2 project supported by the UK Space Agency (UKSA), a consortium of UK companies have co-founded and developed LARAD, a new Lightweight Advanced Robotic Arm Demonstrator {{to address some of}} the underlying challenges related both to the design as well as operation of long arms to perform the payload deployment and sample <b>return</b> <b>operations</b> of future missions. The 15 kg terrestrial demonstrator is built as a 2 m long arm with 6 degrees of freedom. This arm is capable of deploying a payload with a mass up to 6 kgs or operating a 4 kg end-effector at 2 m. It is using cutting edge technologies on both the hardware and software levels. The mechanical structure of the arm has been manufactured using an array of new processes such as optimised 3 D printed titanium Additive Layer Manufactured (ALM) joints, Titanium/Silicon carbide metallic composites, and 3 D printed harness routing drums. A modular joint design has been produced, featuring three mechanical sizes of joints each with integrated low level communication and motor drive. The electronics, software and sensors used in the joints are common across all sizes, increasing modularity. To achieve precise positioning, very high resolution absolute position sensing is used on-board. The arm uses novel collision avoidance and path-planning strategies combined with classical control loops. The On-board Control System?s state machine combines different control strategies/modes (i. e. joint trajectory tracking, direct motor control, autonomous placement) depending on the high level user operation requirements. The high level On Board Computer (OBC) is Robot Operating System (ROS) based, enabling a flexible software approach. This project will provide a unique and representative platform to plan and rehearse science operations with full mass payload and instruments, unlike typical planetary arm developments that require scaled-mass end-effector. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art in planetary robotics and provides an overview of the top-level architecture, implementation and laboratory testing phases for the LARAD robotic arm.
