We evaluated the usefulness of entropy and mutual correlation concepts, as defined in information theory, for quantifying <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and redundancy in time series of the integrated water vapour (IWV) and water vapour mixing ratio profiles provided by five highly instrumented GRUAN (GCOS, Global Climate Observing System, Reference Upper-Air Network) stations in 2010 – 2012. Results show that the random uncertainties on the IWV measured with radiosondes, global positioning system, microwave and infrared radiometers, and Raman lidar measurements differed by less than 8 %. Comparisons of time series of IWV content from ground-based remote sensing instruments with in situ soundings showed that microwave radiometers have the highest redundancy with the IWV time series measured by radiosondes and therefore the highest potential to reduce the <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the radiosondes time series. Moreover, the <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of a time series from one instrument can be reduced by ~ 60 % by constraining the measurements with those from another instrument.

40|$|Detection {{of climate}} change {{requires}} a network of stable ground-based long-term measurements. Building upon earlier work, we first explore requirements of such measurements (such as maximum <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and sampling frequency) to ensure a minimum <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in monthly mean temperatures and to ensure effective detection of trends. In agreement with previous work we find that only for individual measurement random uncertainties > 0. 2 K does the measurement <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> start to contribute significantly to the <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the monthly mean. For trend analysis, {{we find that the}} quality of the trend determination is only compromised when the measurement <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> exceeds 2 K and measurements are made just once or twice a month. In {{the second part of the}} study we provide guidance on how to most effectively design a measurement network. To this end we developed a method to objectively identify the optimal location of sites for detecting projected trends in upper-air temperatures and total column ozone in the shortest possible time. This is done by first estimating the spatial distribution of the minimum length of time during which measurements have to be made in order to detect projected trends in temperature and ozone. This quantity is calculated from the unforced variance in the signal and the degree of autocorrelation, both estimated from historical data sets and assumed not to change in the future, and the projected trends as estimated from chemistry–climate models. The optimal site locations are then selected by an iterative procedure based on the minimum time required to detect a trend and a minimal distance between different measurement sites. While the optimal sites identified here result from our use of only one of a wide range of objective strategies, these results provide additional incentives for initiating measurement programmes at these sites or, if already in operation, to continue to be supported...|$|E

40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a {{powerful}} technique to measure the velocity at many points in a flow simultaneously by performing correlation analysis on images of particles being transported by the flow. These images are acquired by illuminating the flow with two light pulses so that each particle appears once on each image. The spatial resolution is an important parameter of this measuring system since it determines its ability to resolve features {{of interest in the}} flow. The super-resolution technique maximises the spatial resolution by augmenting the PIV analysis with a second pass that identifies specific particles and measures the distance between them. The accuracy of the procedure depends on both the success with which the proper pairings are identified and the accuracy with which their centre-to-centre distance can be measured. This study presents an analysis of both the systematic uncertainty and <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> associated with this process. The uncertainty is analysed as a function of several key parameters that define the quality of the image. The uncertainty analysis is performed by preparing 4000 member ensembles of simulated images with specific setpoints of each parameter. It is shown that the systematic uncertainty is negligible compared to the <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for all conditions tested. Also, the image contrast and the selection of a threshold for the particle search are the most critical parameters influencing both success rate and uncertainty.

By increasing the search radius, the success rate can be increased although this is accompanied by an increase in <b>random</b> <b>uncertainty...</b>|$|E

The method appeared insensitive to the integration period and the value 200  s sufficient to obtain the estimate without significant bias for variety of sites and wide range of observation conditions.
