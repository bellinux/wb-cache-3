50|$|Conducted {{along the}} length of the current, south of {{latitude}} 27°S, this 18-day project, from 6 to 24 March 1969, included three ships: the University of Cape Town's research vessel, the Thomas B. Davie, the CSIR's Meiring Naude, and the Department of Sea Fisheries' Africana II. Most of data gathered was obtained from systematically calibrated surface thermograph records from the ships: the Thomas B. Davie operated from west to east working the segment between Mossel Bay and the Great Fish River (as far as 500 miles south), while the Meiring Naude and the Africana II worked simultaneously from east to west, the former covering the Kosi Bay to East London segment and the latter the Mossel Bay to St Helena Bay segment. A CSIR aircraft—equipped with an infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer</b> for measuring ocean temperatures from a height of 1,000 feet—flew traverses across the current from Cape St Lucia to Cape Town. Some 10,000 sea water samples were taken and a similar number of temperature readings. An uncharted 9,500-foot seamount found in the course of the cruise was named the Davie Seamount.|$|E

Usually the output was corrected by one coefficient assuming the linear dependence. If the filter wavelength changes, the dependence is different at each target temperature. We measured the temperature coefficients of Topcon radiation thermometers at different target temperatures and found the target temperature dependence {{as well as the}} feed back resistance dependence.

40|$|Determining {{the size}} of source effect of a <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{is not an easy}} task and {{manufacturers}} of these thermometers usually do not indicate the deviation to the measured temperature due to this effect. It {{is one of the main}} uncertainty components when measuring with a <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer</b> and it may lead to erroneous estimation of the actual temperature of the measured target. We present an empiric model to estimate the magnitude of deviation of the measured temperature with a long-wavelength infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer</b> due to {{the size of}} source effect. The deviation is calculated as a function of the field of view of the thermometer and the diameter of the radiating source. For thermometers whose field of view size at 90 % power is approximately equal to the diameter of the radiating source, it was found that this effect may lead to deviations of the measured temperature of up to 6 % at 200 ºC and up to 14 % at 500 ºC. Calculations of the temperature deviation with the proposed model are performed as a function of temperature and as a function of the first order component of electrical signal...|$|E

40|$|For thermal {{analyzing}} on {{the grinding}} phenomenon, {{it is necessary}} to measure the temperature of microscopic area in very short time. There are two representative methods, one is the thermocouple method and another one is the infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The new type of infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer</b> with optical fiber was developed in the response time and the measurable area. The minimum response time was 3 × 10 ^ s and the diameter of measurable area was limited to just 110 × 10 ^ m. Consequently, this thermometer measured the exact grinding temperature that correlated with calibration curves of S 45 C, grinding wheel (WA 80) and compared with the results of thermocouple(alumel-S 45 C). The obtained temperature depended on the heat flow rate during the grinding operation and the oxidation of removed chips. The measured signal also indicated two parts, one was the base part and another was the impulse part. The heat energy generated by the oxidation was larger than the total amount of the energy supplied by the grinding operation...|$|E

Subjects kept their eyes open for 10 seconds without blinking and corneal temperature was measured every second with a recently improved infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer.</b> RESULTS: In the 20 patients with dry eye, corneal {{temperature change}} after keeping the eye open for 10 seconds was 0. 21 (SD 0. 06) degree C while it was 0. 61 (0. 28) degree C in the 20 normal patients (p = 0. 0001). In an exponential equation, the inclination of the slope of a patient with dry eye was smaller than the normal. The correlation coefficient was r = 0. 79 (0. 16) in patients with dry eye and r = 0. 90 (0. 07) in normal patients. The mean K value of patients with dry eye was 0. 20 (0. 13) /second and that of normal subjects was 0. 31 (0. 19) /second (p = 0. 03).

40|$|Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, May 18 - 19 2015; [URL] the {{dissemination}} of the kelvin, according to the International Temperature Scale (ITS- 90), at high temperatures is realised at the Centro Español de Metrología (CEM) by using the fixed points of Ag and Cu and a standard <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Recently, absolute radiometry has been proposed by the CCT Working Group 5 [1] {{to be included in}} future revisions of the Mise-en-Practique for the kelvin (MeP-K). The Centro Español de Metrologia (CEM) in collaboration with the Instituto de Óptica of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC) has been working in the following lines linked to this new alternative to disseminate the kelvin: ¿	Absolute calibration, i. e., calibration in terms of the thermodynamic temperature, of commercial radiation thermometers, by using a facility based on a monochromator and a high stability lamp [2]. At present, the uncertainties of these measurements, obtained with a KE-LP 2 <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer,</b> are about the ones obtained with the ITS- 90 method, i. e. from 0, 3 K to 1, 1 K (from 1084, 62 °C to 2474 °C, k = 2). Some improvements in the facilities described in [2] have been implemented in order to reduce uncertainty. ¿	Development of a filter radiometer to measure the thermodynamic temperature. It has been designed by CEM based in NPL previous work [3]. This filter radiometer can be calibrated with a laser based experimental setup, which improves the above measurement uncertainty [4]: from 0, 2 K to 0, 7 K (from 1084, 62 °C to 2474 °C, k = 2). Because of some problems with the radiometer stability at 2500 °C, some changes in the design have been done. The facilities used in [2] and [4] are currently been developed at CEM site as the transportation of the instruments for calibration has caused significant drifts.

40|$|In the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90), {{temperatures}} {{above the}} freezing temperature of silver are determined with <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometers</b> calibrated using spectral radiance ratios {{to one of}} the Ag-, Au- or Cu-freezing temperature blackbodies and the Planck radiance law. However, due to the use of spectral radiance rats, the temperature uncertainties of the ITS- 90 increase as the square of the temperature ratios. Recent acoustic-gas thermometry measurements have also shown that the underlying thermodynamic temperatures used in the radiance ratios in determining the Ag- and Au-fixed point temperatures could be in error. Since the establishment of ITS- 90, much {{progress has been made in}} the development of <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometers</b> and blackbody sources. Cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometry is widely used in detector and radiometer calibrations, and stable, high-temperature metal-carbon eutectic blackbodies are under development. <b>Radiation</b> <b>thermometers</b> can be calibrated for absolute radiance responsivity, and blackbody temperatures determined from measurement of optical power without the use of any fixed points thus making possible direct dissemination of thermodynamic temperatures.

30|$|The {{growth of}} {{tungsten}} oxide nanorods {{was conducted by}} heating a tungsten wire in an oxygen atmosphere inside an environmental TEM. The commercially obtained pure tungsten wire (wire diameter, 25 μm; purity, 99.99 %; The Nilaco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) {{was used as the}} primary material for the tungsten oxide nanorods, and the heater, for the wire-heated environmental TEM sample holder, which enabled the introduction of gas into the environmental TEM. The holder was equipped with electrodes and the gas-introducing nozzle; the tungsten wire was connected between the electrodes and heated by current being applied to the wire. The measurement of the temperature of the heated wire was attempted using both a thermocouple and <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer.</b> However, due to the small size of the wire, the thermocouple could not touch the wire. Furthermore, the measurement area of a <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer</b> is larger than the wire diameter; therefore, space and material other than the wire was included in the measurement area. As a result, the wire temperature could not be measured by either the thermocouple or the <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Consequently, the wire temperature was measured using the following method. First, a pure metal powder with a known melting point was set on the connected wire. Secondly, the holder was introduced into the environmental TEM and the wire was heated. Then, the current was recorded when the metal powder melted; the same procedure was repeated with other metal powders. Finally, the temperature at which each metal melted was plotted on a current-temperature graph. This graph allowed us to determine the wire temperature without a thermocouple or <b>radiation</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The sample-heating holder was inserted in the environmental TEM, and the pressure in the environmental TEM was regulated by flow-rate control of the injected oxygen gas through the nozzle. The tungsten oxide nanorods grew after the current flowed through the tungsten wire. The environmental TEM {{used in the present study}} was made by HITACHI (H- 9000 NAR, Tokyo, Japan) and was equipped with a Gatan imaging filter [GIF] (Tokyo, Japan), a CCD, and a camera. This machine was operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The GIF was used to determine the elemental maps and electron energy loss spectra of the samples, and the dynamic growth behavior of the samples was recorded by the camera. The growth conditions used were as follows: the wire temperature was 800 °C, and the oxygen pressure in the environmental TEM was 1.0 × 10 - 4 Pa. These growth conditions were applied for all the samples grown. Moreover, the existence and shape of the grown material on the wire were observed by scanning electron microscopy [SEM] (HITACHI, S- 4300). The wire was removed from the TEM holder for the SEM observations. In thick crystalline tungsten, it is difficult to observe the natural surface oxide layer on the wire and the behavior of the interface between the nanorods and wire due to the difficulty of the transmission of electrons for TEM analyses. In this case, a part of the tungsten wire was fabricated into a thin film, in which electrons can transmit through, by a focused ion beam [FIB] (JEM- 9320 FIB, JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). The FIB was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.|$|E
