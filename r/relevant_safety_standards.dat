In {{accordance}} with the <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> requirements for electrical equipment, this thesis proposes a residual voltage detection method with high accuracy and low power consumption. The power frequency synchronization signal is obtained by the measuring instrument with the zero-crossing detection circuit used.

40|$|The crowdedness {{of current}} {{cellular}} bands {{and the demand}} for higher transmission speed prompt the use of the millimeter-wave spectrum for the next-generation mobile communication. In the millimeter-wave frequencies, the dosimetric quantity for human exposure to electromagnetic fields changes from the specific absorption rate to incident power density. In this study, we used 28 GHz beam-steering patch arrays, a dipole antenna, and plane waves to investigate the temperature elevation in a multi-layer model of human head and its correlation with power density metrics. The power density averaged over one squarecentimeter in free space and the peak temperature elevation in tissue at 28 GHz have good correlation. The peak temperature elevation indicated by the power density averaged one square-centimeter also agrees well with the peak temperature elevation induced by the plane waves. The results show that the averaging area of a few square-centimeters may be a good candidate for the spatial-average power density.

Hence, switching towards green energy is a must to remove this imbalance conditions between the electricity supply and demand. At this particular point, there is a higher tendency of the electricity consumers for moving towards domestic solar power. The grid tie inverters are the main building. So, the proper operation of an inverter is highly important. Although there exists an already provided data sheet by the manufactures along with the inverters, sometimes we can identify mal-operation conditions of these inverters irrespective of the data sheet provided and therefore, many complaints are aroused by the solar consumers. The issue is that there does not exist proper equipment to engage with all types of inverter testing schemes that had been listed in the IEEE 1547 standard; which is the <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems.

40|$|The {{number and}} {{complexity}} of the systems realizing the functionality of the machines in the automotive domain are growing. In this arises the need for a systematic way to manage their development. As the technologies advance, the vehicles introduce an increasing range of capabilities. However, they have similar functions, which have the potential to be reused. One of the widely used approaches that manages the commonality and variability of the development artifacts in a systematic manner is Product Line Engineering (PLE). Consequently, PLE reduces the time to market and the development cost. The machines, realized in the automotive domain, interact with their operators and the surrounding environment. Possible malfunctions of the machines may introduce a risk of accidents with fatal consequences. Therefore, the products should be analyzed, developed and managed in a safe manner and certified according to different <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> like ISO 15998, ISO 61508 and ISO 26262. There is a diversity of functions in a Product Line (PL). Some of them are mandatory for all machines and others are optional for some models. This gives the opportunity to combine the functions in multiple configurations. However, not all combinations are possible due to dependencies among the functions. Furthermore, the configurations should be valid from a safety perspective, and the developed products should satisfy the requirements identified during the safety analysis. The above mentioned factors emphasize the need for explicit representation of the systems' characteristics, such as commonality and variability, functional dependencies and quality attributes. The purpose of the current work is to find an efficient way to satisfy this need. The scope of our research is limited to the automotive domain. In order to gain familiarity with the state of practice, we collaborated with Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) as an industrial partner. In particular, we: conducted an informal interview study with the practitioners, analyzed the requirements management tool used in Volvo CE and studied products typical for the domain in detail, examined the deliverables defined in the related domain specific safety standards. We gained knowledge on how variability is managed in an industrial context today, which safety aspects need to be considered and how functional safety artifacts are managed with regards to variability. We synthesized the characteristics that are explicitly represented during the development and safety certification of the products in a safety-critical product line. We identified the challenges that the practitioners meet today and the areas that need to be improved. As a result, we formulated evaluation criteria for search and assessment of possible solutions. Subsequently we searched in the literature for different modeling techniques, that are able to respond to the industrial needs, and found the following to be relevant in our context: Feature modeling techniques consider the different variability types and dependencies among the features. Model-based development techniques can represent different views of the system on each level of the development process. Orthogonal modeling techniques extract the variability and dependencies in a different view. Furthermore, we evaluated the methods found during the literature study, based on the proposed criteria. We concluded that the examined techniques alone cannot represent all characteristics needed to support the development of a safety-critical product line, especially the impact of the variability on the safety and vice versa. However, each of them focuses on the presentation of certain aspect of the product line, which can help in building a more complete representation. Thus we focused on the approaches that may be extended and integrated into a complete solution. As a result, we propose a model and graphical notation for variability management in safety-critical product lines, which takes the identified industrial needs into account. The concept is depicted graphically by several model-based diagrams, which represent the different aspects of the product line, on each development level. Special attention is paid to the representation of the safety and variability aspects of the systems. The method is exemplified on an industrial example, in order to show how it achieves the defined goals...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and validation of a methodology for estimating the consequences of accidental dust explosions in complex geometries. The approach adopted entails the use of results from standardized tests in 20 -litre explosion vessels as input to the combustion model in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, and the subsequent validation of the model system by comparing with results from laboratory and large-scale experiments. The PhD project includes dedicated laboratory experiments designed to explore selected aspects of flame propagation in dust clouds, and to reveal {{similarities and differences between}} flame propagation in gaseous mixtures and mechanical suspensions of combustible powder in air. The research project represents a continuation of numerous efforts by various research groups, where the key underlying problem has been the scaling of results obtained in laboratory tests for predicting the consequences of dust explosion scenarios in industry. The traditional approach to the scaling problem entails the use of empirical correlations, typically represented as nomographs or formulas in <b>relevant</b> <b>safety</b> <b>standards.</b> It is generally accepted that empirical correlations may work reasonably well for simple geometries, such as isolated process vessels and silos. The need for more sophisticated methods arises for accident scenarios that involve complex geometrical boundary conditions, such as flame propagation in connected vessel systems and secondary dust explosions inside buildings. The European Commission (EC) supported the Dust Explosion Simulation Code (DESC) project under the Fifth Framework Programme. The goal was to develop and validate a CFD code for simulating industrial dust explosions in complex geometries. To this end, GexCon created the CFD code DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code) by modifying the existing CFD code FLACS (FLame ACceleration Simulator), originally developed for simulating gas explosions in congested offshore geometries. The specific contributions from the candidate with respect {{to the development of the}} CFD software is limited to the methodology for estimating combustion parameters for a given dust sample from experimental results, the validation of the resulting model system against experimental data, and general participation in the R&D team during the development process. The modelling of particle-laden flow and heterogeneous combustion in the CFD code DESC involves several simplifying assumptions. The flow model assumes thermal and kinetic equilibrium between the dispersed particles and the continuous phase, and the k-ε turbulence model in FLACS remains unchanged for multiphase flows. The empirical correlation for the turbulent burning velocity in dust clouds originates from experiments with premixed combustion in gaseous mixtures. The fraction of dust that takes part in the combustion reactions, as function of the nominal dust concentration, is estimated from the explosion pressures measured in a constant volume explosion vessel. The thermodynamic data available in FLACS limit the application area to materials containing the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. The simplifications limit the application area of DESC to certain classes of materials, and flame propagation in dust clouds with relatively high reactivity. DESC do not contain models for simulating phenomena such as agglomeration, gravitational settling, and selective separation of particles in flow through cyclones or along other curved paths. In spite of the simplicity of the model system, the results from the validation work show that the CFD code DESC can describe the course of dust explosions in relatively complex geometries with reasonable accuracy relative to the inherent spread in the experimental results. The results obtained for silo explosions reproduce trends observed for variation in vent area and ignition position from various experiments. Results obtained for flame propagation sustained by dust dispersion from a layer indicate that the empirical model for dust lifting in DESC is suitable for the purpose. Results obtained for dust explosions vented through ducts reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Simulations of dust explosions in a system of two vented vessels connected by a pipe with a 90 ° bend indicate that the DESC can reproduce relatively complex chains of events, including dust lifting from a layer. The results for the connected vessel system also demonstrate how sensitive the results can be with respect to modest changes in the initial and boundary conditions. Finally, simulations of explosion experiments in elongated vessels with repeated obstacles reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Although the results from the validation work indicate that CFD simulations can become a valuable tool for consequence modelling and design of industrial facilities, the modelling in DESC requires further improvements. An essential improvement entails fundamental changes to the numerical solver to reduce in the influence of the grid resolution on the results from the simulations. In the current versions of FLACS and DESC, simulation of explosion scenarios is subject to strict grid guidelines. The current versions of both codes use a structured Cartesian grid, with limited possibilities for local grid refinement. This poses a particular challenge for DESC, since the grid resolution required to resolve complex internal geometries on a structured Cartesian grid varies significantly from case to case. The long-term solution to these challenges will presumably entail the use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and this is outside the scope of the present work. The model system may also benefit from various other improvements, such as turbulent burning velocity correlations specifically developed for dust explosions, an explicit model for turbulent flame thickness, radiation models, local grid refinement in the region where ignition occurs, reduced dependence on empirical input to the model system, and in general more realistic modelling of particleladen flow and heterogeneous combustion. There is, however, a fine balance between the level of detailed information that must be specified in the model, and the applicability and user-friendliness of the model system. For most industrial applications of a CFD tool for dust explosions, there are significant inherent uncertainties associated with initial and boundary conditions. Dust explosion experiments in transparent balloons show that the initial phase of flame propagation in turbulent dust clouds can progress in a distributed manner, with very limited energy output. This observation may explain some of the challenges associated with the analysis of pressure-time histories from 20 -litre explosion vessels for dust explosions when using a weak ignition source. Experiments in a 3. 6 -m flame acceleration tube demonstrate the importance of explosion-generated turbulence for dust explosions, and illustrate the challenge associated with poor repeatability in dust explosion experiments. The results obtained for propane-air mixtures in the same apparatus indicate that FLACS under-predicts the rate of combustion for turbulent flame propagation in fuel-rich propane-air mixtures. The CFD code DESC represents a significant step forward for process safety related to dust explosions in the process industry. There is, however, significant room for further improvements to the model system, and dedicated experiments will play an important role for the future development of the code. Improved safety in the process industry requires reliable and well-documented consequence models, and future development of DESC should include an integrated framework for model validation, including verification and testing. </p...|$|E

40|$|As {{the growth}} of {{reliability}} of PLCs {{and the amount of}} automation in various machinery has increased significantly, the substance of safety equipment reliability has grown in the absence of human control. These factors have led to an increase in the demand for safety-related PLCs. The complexity and size of the software-based control applications grows and so does the importance to be able to produce safe software code. The requirements for machine safety posed by the national and international laws are intricate and many industrial standards have been formed to facilitate designing machinery that meet these requirements. This thesis concentrates on these standards and the recommendation and requirements they pose on safety analysis, design process, operating systems, tools and programming languages. 	Through charting various safety-related requirements it becomes clear that compared to non-safety-related projects, safety-related projects require many times more documentation on made design choices, analysis and implementations. The requirements for this large amount of documentation are based on the {{need to be able to}} provide evidence on sufficient rigour and comprehensiveness of the made safety analyses and implementation quality. To be able to control all this information this thesis recommends forming information databases for companies designing such machinery.
