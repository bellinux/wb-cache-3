25|$|The Garnaut Climate Change Review, the Carbon Pollution <b>Reduction</b> <b>Scheme</b> and the Mandatory Renewable energy Target {{announced}} by the Australian Government involve a reduction in Australian greenhouse gas emissions. Australia is the highest emitter of greenhouse gases per capita {{in the developed world}} and wind power is well placed to grow and deliver greenhouse gas emission cuts on a cost competitive basis. A typical 50-megawatt (MW) wind farm in Australia can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 65,000 and 115,000tonnes a year.|$|E

2500|$|According to Colin James, National Party [...] "herded with" [...] {{the climate}} change skeptics up to 2006. Then in May 2007, National stopped {{opposing}} the Kyoto Protocol and adopted a policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050. For the 2008 election, National's policy was to honour New Zealand's Kyoto Protocol obligations and the 50% reduction by 2050 emissions target. The Labour Party's emissions trading scheme would be amended to better balance environmental and economic concerns, {{and to make it}} fiscally neutral, flexible, aligned with the Australian Carbon Pollution <b>Reduction</b> <b>Scheme</b> and not disadvantageous to consumers and small business.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{previous}} MAC-based models, point-to-point channels were assumed and the interference was considered as noise. In recent years, {{models have been}} developed to study more elaborate channels arising from the discipline of network information theory. More specifically, a model was developed for one of the simplest settings: a collection of transmitter-receiver pairs represented as a Poisson point process. In this model, the effects of an interference <b>reduction</b> <b>scheme</b> involving [...] "point-to-point codes" [...] were examined. These codes, consisting of randomly and independently generated codewords, give transmitters-receivers permission when to exchange information, thus acting as a MAC protocol. Furthermore, in this model a collection or [...] "party" [...] of channels was defined for each such pair. This party is a multiple access channel, namely the many-to-one situation for channels. The receiver of the party is {{the same as that of}} the pair, and the transmitter of the pair belongs to the set of transmitters of the party, together with other transmitters. Using stochastic geometry, the probability of coverage was derived as well as the geometric properties of the coverage cells. It was also shown [...] that when using the point-to-point codes and simultaneous decoding, the statistical gain obtained over a Poisson configuration is arbitrarily large compared to the scenario where interference is treated as noise.|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the conventional PAPR <b>reduction</b> <b>schemes</b> and the various different evolutionary algorithms based on conventional PAPR <b>reduction</b> <b>schemes</b> to achieve a low computational complexity. The simulations have been conducted and proven that IWO is an effective method to yield an enhanced trade-off between PAPR reduction and complexity. Since the computational complexity reduction ratio increases as the number of subcarriers increases, the proposed scheme becomes more suitable for the high data rate OFDM systems.|$|R

50|$|Nations {{which have}} failed to deliver their Kyoto {{emissions}} reductions obligations can enter Emissions Trading to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls. Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission <b>reduction</b> <b>schemes</b> which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries. If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities {{may be able to}} cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through Emissions Trading. While local emissions <b>reduction</b> <b>schemes</b> have no status under the Kyoto Protocol itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating Emissions Trading and setting a market price for emissions.|$|R
40|$|An {{economically}} viable and environmental-friendly method of generating PEM grade hydrogen {{has been proposed}} and is by the reaction of certain metals with steam, appropriately called ‘metal–steam reforming’—MSR. The drawbacks of conventional processes (hydrogen and carbothermic <b>reduction</b> <b>schemes)</b> are overcome by resorting to solution-based <b>reduction</b> <b>schemes</b> and are made economically feasible using iron oxides from steel industry’s mill-scale waste. A novel aqueous-based room temperature technique using sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) as the reducing agent has been developed that produces highly active nanoscale iron particles (40 nm). By using hydrazine as an inexpensive and, compared with NaBH 4, more stable reductant, body centered cubic iron particles with 5 nm edges were obtained via solvothermal process under mild conditions from acid digested mill-scale waste. The nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) powder showed improved kinetics and greater propensity for hydrogen generation than the coarser microscale iron.
