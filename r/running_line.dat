5|$|The Grayrigg {{derailment}} was a fatal railway {{accident that}} occurred at approximately 20:15 GMT on 23 February 2007, {{just to the}} south of Grayrigg, Cumbria, in the North West England region of the United Kingdom. The accident investigation concluded that the derailment was caused by a faulty set of points (number 2B) on the Down Main <b>running</b> <b>line,</b> controlled from Lambrigg ground frame. The scheduled inspection on 18 February 2007 had not taken place and the faults had gone undetected.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the bass part provides a motif for the continuo accompaniment, which is imitated in counterpoint by the two alto recorders {{until the end of}} the section, producing a <b>running</b> <b>line</b> of semiquavers. The accompanying oboes and upper strings respond to each other with fragmented quaver motifs derived from the vocal material of this section as well as the quaver motifs in the first section.|$|E
5|$|When {{the railway}} was privatised in 1997, local {{services}} were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, {{an arm of}} National Express, in 2001. The line through Filton closed for two weeks in June 2004 to enable {{the construction of a}} new platform and third <b>running</b> <b>line</b> on the west side of the station, separating trains towards Bristol Parkway from trains towards Wales before the station, and so allowing through-trains to pass stopping trains. The project cost £16,000,000, and caused the complete suspension of Severn Beach Line services to allow longer-distance services to use it as a diversion.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, {{the station}} {{employed}} 11 men, but {{the post of}} station master was abolished on 27 August 1909 as a cost-cutting measure, with responsibility passing to Clifton Down. There were six staff by 1938. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. Services to Fishponds ended on 31 March 1941. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, when it came {{under the aegis of}} the Western Region of British Railways. The signal box closed in 1950, and by 1958 there were only three staff members: a booking clerk and two porters. Through services to Pilning and Henbury ceased with the Beeching Axe in 1964, with services terminating at , and from December that year the station was unstaffed after 2pm. Staff were withdrawn completely on 17 July 1967, a fate shared by most of the other stations on the Severn Beach Line. The southern <b>running</b> <b>line</b> was lifted on 19 October 1970, and the adjacent platform abandoned and its shelter demolished. The ticket office and footbridge were also demolished, with a replacement entrance opened through the South Road garages.|$|E
25|$|The Estate Railway then {{consisted}} of 8 miles of <b>running</b> <b>line</b> and 18 miles of sidings. Although now entirely mineral lines, modern signalling systems were in {{use for the}} intensive traffic.|$|E
25|$|There is anecdotal {{evidence}} that passenger trains stopped unofficially on request at the private farm sidings at Ash, also that goods vans were left {{loose on the}} <b>running</b> <b>line</b> between stations overnight for farmers to load.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a short}} {{high-level}} siding {{within the}} Waterloo yard area; coal to fuel the boilers was brought in by ordinary LSWR wagons lowered to the <b>running</b> <b>line</b> by the carriage lift; the wagons were drawn through the northbound platform by an electric shunting locomotive, and another lift elevated them to the siding. Boiler ash was disposed of correspondingly.|$|E
25|$|All three passing loop {{tracks are}} on the {{southwest}} side of the main <b>running</b> <b>line</b> – this is in general the downhill side, where the mountain slopes away from the line. This means that, if required, the line could be easily be converted to double track without the need to cut into the rock face to widen the formation.|$|E
25|$|Oceanic was {{the first}} newbuilt ship ordered by Home Lines. She was ordered from the Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico {{shipyard}} at Monfalcone, Italy. She {{was designed as a}} combined two-class ocean liner and one-class cruise ship, <b>running</b> <b>line</b> voyages from Cuxhaven, Southampton, and Le Havre to Canada during the northern hemisphere summer and cruising during the winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{site and}} its {{buildings}} {{changed over the}} years. The initial station was built almost at a right angle to the <b>running</b> <b>lines,</b> with its tracks forming a very short branch adjacent to {{the north side of}} Church Street. In 1877 a new station building was erected northeast of the original, aligned with the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b> Changes were made to tracks in later years, but the station building remains today.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the down}} side were two bay platforms, one running through a goods shed. These joined the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> by a crossing, but also led back to longer sidings next to the down line. Next to the up line {{on the other side}} of the road bridge, was a short loop serving a cattle dock, and an unusual siding curving away from the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> to some small sheds.|$|R
50|$|The station's running layout {{has three}} tracks, with the centre track having {{platforms}} {{on each side}} meaning that it can handle trains running in either direction. A siding between the <b>running</b> <b>lines</b> {{to the north of}} the station allows trains from Central London to be reversed and run back eastwards. Trains going out of service can return to the below-ground White City depot to the south of the station via sidings between the <b>running</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Corris Station and the {{original}} Machynlleth Station had overall roofs, features which were rare on a British narrow gauge railway. At Corris, the roof was over the main <b>running</b> <b>line</b> and trains for Aberllefenni passed under it; at Machynlleth {{the rear of the}} train rested under the station roof while the front was in the open air. The original Machynlleth station was demolished and replaced in 1905 with the building that still stands alongside the A487 trunk road north of the main-line railway overbridge.|$|E
25|$|The four-track shed {{was about}} 150 {{feet long and}} 50 feet wide. It was located north of the <b>running</b> <b>line</b> {{and south of the}} Foss Dyke Navigation. By 1912 an {{additional}} siding was added. In 1914 50 men were recorded as working at the shed. During World War I the increased need for coal saw traffic on the GNGEJR rise, and the sidings and engine shed at Pyewipe Junction were extremely busy. Locomotive coaling was undertaken by hand and although a turntable is evident on plans of the site, it is not known whether it was installed when the shed opened.|$|E
25|$|The Essendine {{line was}} built single track with {{provision}} for double tracking, {{and at one}} time it was double tracked, but the signalling arrangements did not meet with Board of Trade approval. Rather than make the necessary alterations, it was single tracked again except for the section between Stamford East and the Martin's Cultivators works. This section was left as two tracks but was operated as two single track lines, with one a <b>running</b> <b>line</b> and the other an industrial siding. This siding, known as Priory Siding, also served Priory Lime Works and the Blackstone & Company Limited works.|$|E

25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} the rack rail. On sidings {{and around the}} yard at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, but on the <b>running</b> <b>line,</b> and through all the loops up the mountain, two rack bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their teeth staggered by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the pinions running along the rack. It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with the rack. The joints between rack bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports the rack rail as well as the running rails.|$|E
25|$|The modern symphony {{orchestra}} typically calls for two bassoons, {{often with a}} third playing the contrabassoon. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as Maurice Ravel's Boléro and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in Peter and the Wolf. Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous <b>running</b> <b>line</b> (doubled in the violas and cellos) in the overture to The Marriage of Figaro. In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and double basses, and harmonic support along with the French horns.|$|E
500|$|Lambrigg ground frame, [...] {{south-west}} of {{the accident}} site, controls two crossovers, each one comprising two sets of points allowing trains to cross from one <b>running</b> <b>line</b> to the other in emergencies or during track maintenance work. These points are used only occasionally, operated locally after a release is obtained from Carlisle power signal box. They are normally locked in the main line [...] "running" [...] position. Early statements by Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley of British Transport Police suggested that investigations would focus on these points.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} sidings {{on the line}} which were {{available}} for public use. Churn Siding was located between Paddock Wood and Horsmonden stations. The siding was on the up side of the line. It was accessed by a facing connection in each direction. A siding at the Horsmonden end served a brickworks. Although some sources state that Churn Siding was out of use by 1940, photographs show that {{it was still in}} use in 1951 and it was named in the closure notice. Towards the end of the line's existence, Churn Siding was used for storage of wagons. The siding was located {{at the start of the}} 1 in 78 climb to Horsmonden. If wagons had to be left on the <b>running</b> <b>line</b> while shunting took place, they had to be left on the Paddock Wood side of the level crossing, where there was level track. Pattenden Siding was located between Goudhurst and Cranbrook stations, just after milepost 42 and thus [...] from Paddock Wood. The siding was located on the down side of the line. was accessed by a trailing connection in the down direction (towards Hawkhurst). Its main use was to import shoddy which was used as fertiliser for hop gardens.|$|E
2500|$|East of the Town is the Railway Station, {{depicting}} a typical small passenger and goods facility {{operated by the}} main railway company in the region at the time, the North East Railway (NER). A short <b>running</b> <b>line</b> extends west in a cutting around {{the north side of}} the Town itself, with trains visible from the windows of the stables. [...] It runs for a distance of ¼ mile - the line used to connect to the colliery sidings until 1991 when it was lifted so that the tram line could be extended. During 2009 the <b>running</b> <b>line</b> was relaid so that passenger rides could recommence from the station during 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the NVR decided {{to extend its}} <b>running</b> <b>line,</b> which then {{terminated}} at Orton Mere station, along {{the route of the}} original Nene Valley Line to a new station west of the East Coast Main Line, adjacent to the new Railworld Museum. Peterborough Nene Valley opened, for the first time, on the Late Spring Bank Holiday weekend of 26 May 1986. This extended the NVR to its current length, [...]|$|E
