This method <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies.

By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> quantum theory, the definition of the metre <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
