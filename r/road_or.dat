5|$|Helicopter – Usually {{used for}} {{emergency}} care, either in places inaccessible by <b>road,</b> <b>or</b> {{in areas where}} speed is of the essence, as {{they are able to}} travel significantly faster than a road ambulance. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{was also}} subdivided into sections to allow transport by <b>road</b> <b>or</b> rail. The wings were of standard Junkers double-wing construction. This gave the Ju 87 considerable advantage on take-off; {{even at a}} shallow angle, large lift forces were created through the aerofoil, reducing take-off and landing runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport is}} {{accessible}} directly by taking exit number nine on Interstate 670 to International Gateway. Alternatively, drivers {{can also get}} to the airport from the east via Hamilton Road, just south of Interstate 270, and enter at Sawyer <b>Road</b> <b>or</b> from the west via Stelzer Road.|$|E

5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a <b>road</b> <b>or</b> field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
5|$|Control of roads. Regulate, restrict, {{control or}} {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} a <b>road</b> <b>or</b> waterway by any person or class of persons; or any vehicle or vessel, or type or description of vehicle or vessel. In addition, can issue permits to regulate, restrict, control or prohibit persons or classes of persons from travelling in any bus, car, train or other vehicle, or in a vessel.|$|E
5|$|For long-distance {{holiday traffic}} {{travelling}} through {{the county to}} and from Devon and Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey. North–south traffic moves through the county via the M5 Motorway. Traffic {{to and from the}} east travels either via the A303 <b>road,</b> <b>or</b> the M4 Motorway, which runs east–west, crossing the M5 just beyond the northern limits of the county.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people put}} up bat houses to attract bats. The 1991 University of Florida bat {{house is the}} largest {{occupied}} artificial roost in the world, with around 300,000 residents. In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground World War II pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats, and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from <b>road</b> <b>or</b> other developments.|$|E
5|$|State Route251 (SR251), {{now known}} as the Northport–Boundary <b>Road</b> <b>or</b> Boundary Highway, began in Northport at an {{at-grade}} intersection at Center Street, known as SR25. The highway turned north from SR25 and followed the Columbia River upstream as well a railroad owned by the Kettle Falls International Railway. The highway traveled northeast, then east through a series of hairpin turns before turning north to Boundary, an unincorporated community in Stevens County, where SR251 entered Canadian customs and continued into British Columbia as British Columbia Highway 22A (BC22A).|$|E
5|$|While {{allowing}} for easy travel across the city, the E.C. Row Expressway does not {{connect to the}} United States yet; drivers can access the Ambassador Bridge via Huron Church <b>Road,</b> <b>or</b> the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel via Dougall Parkway, which also provides the most direct access to Highway401. This situation will change as the expressway western terminus {{is located at the}} port of entry for the Gordie Howe International Bridge scheduled for completion in 2020.|$|E

In May 2008, the NYU Sustainability Task Force awarded $150,000 in grants to 23 projects that would focus research and efforts toward energy, food, landscape, outreach, procurement, transportation and waste.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on <b>road</b> <b>or</b> other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Architects and conservationists {{argued that}} the pier was architecturally {{significant}} to Hong Kong {{as one of the}} last remaining examples of a Streamline Moderne public building (along with the Central Market and Wan Chai Market which have been earmarked for demolition); culturally the pier was widely recognised as a part of local collective memory. The Hong Kong Institute of Architects warned against the destruction of Hong Kong's heritage, saying it would be an irreversible mistake. Public opinion has resulted in alternatives put forward to preserve the clock tower, including moving the proposed six-lane <b>road</b> <b>or</b> relocating the clock tower {{to the front of the}} new pier as a memorial.|$|E

5|$|As castles {{were not}} simply {{military}} buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, {{they had a}} significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently-used <b>road</b> <b>or</b> river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a <b>road</b> <b>or</b> runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{virtually}} all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in {{use for the}} storage of goods transported by barge, <b>road</b> <b>or</b> rail. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By {{the end of the}} war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the effects}} of Hudah, the cyclone was {{considered}} the worst to strike the Antalaha region in 20years. The towns of Maroantsetra and Andapa were also hit hard, with 60–70percent of homes in the latter destroyed. Maroantsetra, a coastal town, was flooded by the storm surge, and as a result seven people died. The commune of Mananara Nord was completely flooded by the storm. Other isolated villages could not be reached via <b>road</b> <b>or</b> telecommunications due to the storm. One of these cities was Sambava, which suffered from a lack of available telephone links since late on April2. One person died in Sambava. A resort in the town of Cap Est was flattened. Initial estimates indicated that Hudah caused at least 100,000people to become homeless.|$|E
5|$|Grove Church Cemetery {{is located}} at 1132 46th Street in North Bergen, New Jersey. The {{cemetery}} also fronts Kennedy Boulevard which in the 19thcentury was known as Dallytown <b>Road,</b> <b>or</b> Bergenwood Road. Overlooking into the Secaucus, it starts {{at the top and}} extends onto the middle of the western face of the Hudson Palisades. Grove Church Cemetery is one of several burial sites on the western slope, along with Machpelah Cemetery, Hoboken Cemetery and Weehawken Cemetery, which is only a few blocks away from Grove Church along with Palisades Cemetery. These grounds constitute a string of green open spaces in North Hudson County. The gated entrance is across the street, east of the Bergenline Avenue station of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Union City, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|M-102 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey of the state, and the roadway is also called Base Line Road in places. As a county <b>road</b> <b>or</b> city street, 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow Vernier Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at Vernier Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile Road name extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E
