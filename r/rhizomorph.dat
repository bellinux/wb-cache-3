5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the <b>rhizomorph</b> networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the <b>rhizomorph</b> core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
25|$|The extramatrical mycelia of ectomycorrhizas {{function}} {{largely as}} transport structures. As such, {{they are often}} able to spread considerable distances to maintain a large contact area with the soil. Some studies have even shown a relationship between nutrient transport rates {{and the degree of}} <b>rhizomorph</b> organization. Often, the rhizomorphs of different EcM associations fall under different classifications of organization types and exploration strategies based on structure and growth within the soil. These are capable of serving as useful diagnostic tools in identification, as well.|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was performed to}} estimate the elemental composition of <b>rhizomorphs</b> of an ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungus growing in a patchy environment. Successive samples of Rhizopogon <b>rhizomorphs,</b> located adjacent to patches with organic matter or patches with acid-washed sand, were taken {{over a period of}} 45 d. The mass per unit area was analyzed with scanning transmission ion microscopy (STIM), and the elemental content of elements heavier than Mg were analyzed with particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE). <b>Rhizomorphs</b> associated with the organic matter on average were three times heavier per unit area than <b>rhizomorphs</b> associated with sand. The Ca concentration (mg g(- 1)) increased in <b>rhizomorphs</b> adjacent to patches with sand, while it decreased in <b>rhizomorphs</b> adjacent to patches with organic matter. Fe concentration was higher in <b>rhizomorphs</b> adjacent to patches with sand. We concluded that the EM fungus responded to the organic matter by producing larger <b>rhizomorphs,</b> rather than increasing the concentration of elements in the <b>rhizomorphs,</b> to improve the transport of elements to the roots. The elemental composition of <b>rhizomorphs</b> varied considerably over time, and the accumulation of Ca in <b>rhizomorphs</b> in the sand-filled compartments could be the effect of acropetal flow of solutes from the plant roots toward the mycelial front...|$|R
50|$|Contact {{exploration}} types {{possess a}} predominantly smooth mantle and lack <b>rhizomorphs</b> with ectomycorrhizas {{in close contact}} with the surrounding substrate. Short-distance exploration types also lack <b>rhizomorphs</b> but the mantle is surrounded by frequent projections of hyphae, which emanate a short distance into the surrounding substrate. Most ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes are included in this group. Medium-distance exploration types are further divided into three subtypes defined by the growth range and differentiation of its <b>rhizomorphs.</b> Medium-distance Fringe form interconnected hyphal networks with <b>rhizomorphs</b> that divide and fuse repeatedly. Medium-distance Mat types form dense hyphal mats which aggregate into a homogeneous mass. Finally, the Medium-distance Smooth sub-type has <b>rhizomorphs</b> with smooth mantles and margins. Long-distance exploration types are highly differentiated, forming <b>rhizomorphs</b> that contain hollow vessel-like transport tubes. Long distance types are associated with increased levels of organic nitrogen uptake compared to other exploration types and are thought to be less competitive in disturbed systems in contrast to short distance types which are able to regenerate more efficiently after a disturbance event.|$|R
25|$|Extraradical hyphae, and <b>rhizomorphs</b> in particular, {{also offer}} {{invaluable}} {{transport of water}} in many species. Often these develop into specialized runner hyphae and <b>rhizomorphs</b> capable of extending quite far from the host roots, thereby increasing the functional water access area.|$|R
25|$|Extraradical hyphae extend {{outward from}} the mantle into the soil, {{fulfilling}} {{the role of the}} suppressed root hairs by increasing the surface area of the colonized root. These hyphae can spread out singly, or in an aggregate arrangement known collectively as a <b>rhizomorph.</b> Much as the Hartig net and mantle, composite hyphal organs can display a wide range of structural difference. Some rhizomorphs are simply parallel, linear collections of hyphae. Others yield more complex organization such as aggregates where the central hyphae possess enlarged diameters, or exhibiting apically extending hyphae that superficially resemble meristematic activity.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Calvatia craniiformis grow to {{dimensions}} of [...] tall by [...] wide, {{and have a}} form ranging from pear-shaped, to flattened-spherical, to obovate (roughly egg-shaped), to tunicate (like an inverted cone). At the bottom is a thick, often crumpled base attached to a cord-like <b>rhizomorph,</b> which is often encrusted with surrounding soil. The rhizomorphs are well developed, and when cut into longitudinal section, reveal three distinct tissues: an outer cortex, a subcortical layer, and a central core. The thin and fragile exoperidium (the outer layer of [...] "skin") is whitish-gray to gray, and initially smooth before becoming areolate (divided by cracks into discrete areas). The base extends up one-third to one-half way into the puffball (where it becomes the columnella) tapering to a point. The gleba is initially whitish, and then yellow-green, and finally brownish-green in older specimens with mature spores.|$|E
500|$|B.pila has an egg-shaped {{to roughly}} spherical fruit body {{measuring}} up to [...] in diameter. The thin (0.25millimeter) outer tissue layer (exoperidium) is white to slightly pink. Its surface texture, initially appearing as if covered with minute flakes of bran (furfuraceous), becomes marked with irregular, crooked lines (rivulose). The exoperidium flakes off in maturity {{to reveal a}} thin, inner peridium (endoperidium). The color of this shiny inner skin, splotched with darker areas, resembles the metallic colors of bronze and copper. Bovista pila puffballs {{are attached to the}} ground by a small cord (a <b>rhizomorph)</b> that typically breaks off when the puffball is mature. The interior flesh, or gleba, comprises spores and surrounding capillitial tissue. Initially white and firm with tiny, irregularly shaped chambers (visible with a magnifying glass), the gleba later becomes greenish and then brown and powdery as the spores mature. In age, the upper surface of the puffball cracks and tears open. The resilient texture of the inner peridium enables the puffball to maintain its ball-like shape after it has detached from the ground. As the old puffballs get blown around, spores get shaken out of the tears.|$|E
40|$|The ectomycorrhizae of Ramaria flavo-saponarea display most {{features}} of Ramaria mycorrhizae described so far: dense, nest-like clusters of silvery-white mycorrhizae {{surrounded by a}} veil of emanating hyphae and abundant slightly differentiated <b>rhizomorphs,</b> commonly also with short, blunt-ending <b>rhizomorphs</b> formed as obtuse mycorrhiza-like outgrowths, a plectenchymatous mantle in all layers, outer mantle and <b>rhizomorphs</b> with ampullate hyphae, acanthocystidia (or acanthohyphae) and globular cells containing yellowish to brownish droplets.

500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, {{sophisticated}} aeration system" [...] {{that enables}} it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere {{with the central}} canal of the <b>rhizomorph,</b> to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system {{is thought to be}} an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A.luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.|$|E
500|$|Like all puffballs, Handkea utriformis has a gasteroid basidiocarp, {{meaning the}} spores are {{produced}} internally, and are only released as the mature fruiting body ages and dries, or is broken.Young puffballs are typically [...] across, white, or pale grey-brown; in maturity it may attain dimensions of [...] broad by [...] tall. The exoperidum is tomentosedesely {{covered with a}} layer of fine matted hairs. The species derives its common name [...] "mosiac puffball" [...] from the [...] pattern across the top and sides that develops as the fruiting body matures and the outer wall (exoperidium) breaks up into polygonal patches. The underside of the puffball is attached to the ground by a root-like assemblage of hyphae called [...] a <b>rhizomorph.</b> It is squat in appearance and roughly pear-shaped, not usually taller than it is wide. The flesh (gleba, or spore bearing mass) is white when young, but becomes brown and powdery upon maturity. The upper skin eventually disintegrates weeks or even months after the puffball's appearance, and the brown spores are released into the air; this process is often hastened by rain, or by being trodden on by cattle. Eventually, all that remains is the sterile cup-shaped base, which can sometimes hold water. This feature may have been the source of the specific epithet, as utrarius is Latin for ‘water carrier’.|$|E
500|$|The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been}} the subject of {{considerable}} research. Ectomycorrhizae of Tricholoma species can vary considerably among species in the genus, and differences in the structure of [...] rhizomorphs (a cordlike fusions of hyphae resembling a root) have been used to key out species. Mycorrhizae formed with Norway spruce (Picea abies) are conspicuously hairy with numerous hyphae. The hyphae are partly densely interconnected to rhizomorphs that have a pigment in their outer membrane. The emanating hyphae mostly lack [...] "contact septae" [...] (fully developed simple septae) and contact clamps, and the <b>rhizomorph</b> hyphae vary markedly in diameter. The Hartig net (a network of hyphae that extend into the root) formed by T.vaccinum grows more deeply towards the epidermis, is composed of more rows of hyphae and has more tannin cells in close proximity to the epidermis, and consequently, fewer cortical cells in this position. It is here that the rhizomorphs make the closest contact with the rootlets. The mantle is prosenchymatous, meaning that the constituent hyphae are loosely organized with spaces between them. A combination of techniques including freeze fracturing and scanning electron microscopy has been used to probe the microstructure of the ectomycorrhizae, including inner mantle thickness and the nature of the interface between the Hartig net and host cells. Several fungal genes specifically expressed during ectomycorrhizal interaction between T.vaccinum and Picea abies have been identified, including some involved in a plant pathogen response, nutrient exchange and growth in the plant, signal transduction, and stress response. The first characterized fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, ALD1, helps circumvent ethanol stress—a critical function in mycorrhizal habitats.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} ectomycorrhizal species with a potential to release elements from apatite and wood ash and accumulate them in the mycelia. Fungal <b>rhizomorphs</b> and mycelia were sampled from sand-filled mesh bags with or without amendment of apatite or wood ash. The mesh bags were buried in forest soil in the field for 13 or 24 months. Elemental composition of the samples was analyzed with particle-induced X-ray emission and the fungus was identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ITS-region of ribosomal DNA. The majority of <b>rhizomorphs</b> and mycelia collected from the mesh bags were of mycorrhizal origin with Paxillus involutus being the most common species (31 %). Other identified species were Thelephora terrestris, Suillus granulatus and Tylospora fibillosa. S. granulatus contained 3 - 15 times more K (3 mg g(- 1)) than the other species and had large calcium-rich crystals deposited on the surface of <b>rhizomorphs</b> when grown in contact with apatite. P. involutus contained the largest amount of Ca (2 - 7 mg g(- 1)). Wood ash addition increased the amount of Ti, Mn and Pb in the <b>rhizomorphs</b> while apatite addition increased the amount of Ca in the <b>rhizomorphs.</b> The high concentration of K in S. granulatus <b>rhizomorphs</b> suggests that this fungus is a good accumulator of K while P. involutus appeared to accumulate heavy metals originating from wood ash...|$|R
50|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of Armillaria ostoyae {{appears to}} be more common in interior stands, but its virulence is seen to be greater in coastal conifers. Although conifers along the coastal regions show a lower rate of mortality against the root disease, infections can be much worse. Despite differences in how infections occur between these two regions, infections are generally established by <b>rhizomorph</b> strands, and pathogenicity is correlated to <b>rhizomorph</b> production.|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the fungus is {{underground}} where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. The rhizomorphs of A. mellea are initiated from mycelium into multicellular apices of rhizomorphs, which are multicellular vegetative organs that exclude soil from the interior of the <b>rhizomorph</b> tissues. The rhizomorphs spread through far greater distances through the ground than the mycelium. The rhizomorphs are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia and rhizomorphs are luminous when in active growth. A. mellea producing rhizomorphs is parasitic on woody plants of many species, including especially shrubs, hardwood and evergreen trees. In one example, spread by rhizomorphs from an initially infected tree killed 600 trees in a prune orchard in 6 years. Each infected tree was immediately adjacent to an already infected one, the spread by rhizomorphs through the tree roots and soil. (Piper and Fletcher, 1903, Wash. Age. Exp. Sat.

50|$|The fungus forms many white, {{somewhat}} flattened mycelia strands 1-2 mm {{thick that}} grow on and adhere strongly {{to the surface}} of the root bark. These <b>rhizomorphs</b> grow rapidly and may extend several meters through the soil in the absence of any woody substrate. Thus, healthy rubber trees can be infected by free <b>rhizomorphs</b> growing from stumps or infected woody debris buried in the ground as well as by roots contacting those of a diseased neighboring tree. Internal progression of the fungus in root tissues lags well behind the front of epiphytic growth of the mycelium on the root. In this respect, the mode of development of R. lignosus is characteristic of an ectotrophic growth habit. After <b>rhizomorphs</b> infect the roots, the fungus preferentially penetrates the taproot, deep in the soil. First, however, the <b>rhizomorphs</b> must change morphogenetically into infectious hyphae, characterized by degrading extracellular enzymes able to decay the wood.
