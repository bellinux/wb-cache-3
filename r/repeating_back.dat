500|$|Atherton, aged 22, was {{dismissed}} by the CNR before the Edmonton hearings. He testified {{that there was}} a lengthy gap in transmission, and that he did not hear the words [...] "at Cedarside". Although railway regulations called for him to listen to a repeat of the order by the telegrapher at Blue River, he did not do so and instead continued with his other duties, passing the message to the troop train without the vital two words. He denied <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> the order to dispatcher Tisdale with the two words included.|$|E
60|$|Let it {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} {{existing}} cartes-de-visite are almost certain to be useless. Among dozens of them {{it is hard to}} find three that fulfil the conditions of similarity of aspect and of shade. The negatives have to be made on purpose. I use a <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> and a quarter plate, and get two good-sized heads on each plate, and of a scale that never gives less than four-tenths of an inch between the pupils of the eyes and the mouth. It is only the head that can be used, as more distant parts, even the ears, become blurred hopelessly.|$|E

50|$|The drive {{mechanism}} is backward {{compared to the}} HERO 1, with the drive and steering wheel {{in the back of}} the robot. The head section featured an indentation to allow the robot to transport up to 10 lb. The robot could speak several phrases from various films that either involved robots or computers. It was also capable of remembering and <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> its masters name, as well as singing songs, reciting poems, acting as an alarm clock, and making its own combinations of phonemes to create a robotic gibberish.|$|E

5000|$|They {{were signed}} to Island Records {{and went on}} to release their second studio album Every Six Seconds. Saliva later {{released}} their third studio album titled Back into Your System on November 12, 2002 which reached No. 19 on the Billboard 200. Back into Your System launched one of Salivas most successful songs, [...] "Always", reaching No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Modern Rock Chart. Three years after Survival of the Sickest, Saliva released Blood Stained Love Story on January 23, 2007, <b>repeating</b> <b>Back</b> into Your Systems chart performance at No. 19 on the Billboard 200. Its first single, [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen", peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Chart.|$|E

50|$|The second type, known {{variously}} as {{a multiple}} back, <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> or drop back camera, still exposed the images {{one at a}} time but used a sliding holder for the filters and plates which allowed each filter and the corresponding unexposed area of emulsion to be quickly shifted into place. German photochemistry professor Adolf Miethe designed a high-quality camera of this type which was commercially introduced by Bermpohl in 1903. It was probably this Miethe-Bermpohl camera which was used by Miethe's pupil Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii to make his now-celebrated color photographic surveys of Russia before the 1917 revolution. One sophisticated variant, patented by Frederic Eugene Ives in 1897, was driven by clockwork and could be adjusted to automatically make each of the exposures for a different length of time according to the particular color sensitivities of the emulsion being used.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to improve your listening skills. Begin by observing your conversations, and pay special notice to the times you begin to get distracted or ignore the other person {{and see how it}} affects your relationships. Once you understand your patterns in conversations, it's easier to change the negative aspects of your conversations. There are three main guidelines everyone should follow if they want to become effective listeners. The most important guideline is being mindful, that is, being disciplined and committed when trying to listen. The next guideline is adapting to listening appropriately because it is beneficial to be skilled in many listening behaviors and to know when each is important. The final guideline to becoming an effective listener is listening actively. [...] To listen actively, keep eye contact with the speaker, nod when a message is understood, etc. Paraphrasing what was said in order to communicate to the speaker that you understood their message correctly will also improve listening skills. A good tag phrase for paraphrasing is [...] "What I'm hearing you say is...", followed by the question, [...] "Is that right?" [...] This combination of <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> and asking for confirmation of accuracy frees the speaker to correct any previous ineffective communication.|$|E
40|$|Everyday {{communication}} frequently comprises situations {{with more}} than one talker speaking at a time. These situations are challenging since they pose high attentional and memory demands placing cognitive load on the listener. Hearing impairment additionally exacerbates communication problems under these circumstances. We examined the effects of hearing loss and attention tasks on speech recognition with competing talkers in older adults with and without hearing impairment. We hypothesized that hearing loss would affect word identification, talker separation and word recall and that the difficulties experienced by the hearing impaired listeners would be especially pronounced in a task with high attentional and memory demands. Two listener groups closely matched regarding their age and neuropsychological profile but differing in hearing acuity were examined regarding their speech recognition with competing talkers in two different tasks. One task required <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> words from one target talker (1 TT) while ignoring the competing talker whereas the other required <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> words from both talkers (2 TT). The competing talkers differed with respect to their voice characteristics. Moreover, sentences either with low or high context were used in order to consider linguistic properties. Compared to their normal hearing peers, listeners with hearing loss revealed limited speech recognition in both tasks. Their difficulties were especially pronounced in the more demanding 2 TT task. In order to shed light on the underlying mechanisms, different error sources, namely having misunderstood, confused, or omitted words were investigated. Misunderstanding and omitting words were more frequently observed in the hearing impaired than in the normal hearing listeners. In line with common speech perception models it is suggested that these effects are related to impaired object formation and taxed working memory capacity (WMC). In a post hoc analysis the listeners were further separated with respect to their WMC. It appeared that higher capacity could be used {{in the sense of a}} compensatory mechanism with respect to the adverse effects of hearing loss, especially with low context speech...|$|E
50|$|Active {{listening}} is {{a communication}} technique used in counseling, training, and conflict resolution. It {{requires that the}} listener fully concentrate, understand, respond and then remember what is being said. This is opposed to reflective listening where the listener <b>repeats</b> <b>back</b> to the speaker what they have just heard to confirm understanding of both parties.|$|R
5000|$|A blab {{school was}} where the school {{children}} <b>repeated</b> <b>back</b> their teacher's oral lesson {{at the top of}} their voices. The school children vocalized out their lesson in [...] "Chinese fashion" [...] as harmonized voices in unison. In more elegant terms, instead of saying they were blab schools they were referred to as vocal schools.|$|R
40|$|Subjects {{were shown}} {{navigation}} instructions varying in length directing {{them to move}} in a space represented by grids on a computer screen. They followed the instructions by clicking on the grids in the locations specified. Some subjects <b>repeated</b> <b>back</b> the instructions before following them, some did not, and others <b>repeated</b> <b>back</b> the instructions in reduced form, including only the critical words. The commands in each message were presented simultaneously for half of the subjects and sequentially for the others. For the longest messages, performance was better on the initial commands and worse on the final commands with simultaneous than with sequential presentation. Instruction repetition depressed performance, but reduced repetition removed this disadvantage. Effects of presentation format were attributed to visual scanning strategies. The advantage for reduced repetition was attributable either to enhanced visual scanning or to reduced output interference. A follow-up study with auditory presentation supported the visual scanning explanation...|$|R
40|$|This fMRI {{study used}} a single, multi-factorial, within-subjects design to dissociate {{multiple}} linguistic and non-linguistic processing {{areas that are}} all involved in <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> heard words. The study compared: (1) auditory to visual inputs; (2) phonological to non-phonological inputs; (3) semantic to non-semantic inputs; and (4) speech production to finger-press responses. The stimuli included words (semantic and phonological inputs), pseudowords (phonological input), pictures and sounds of animals or objects (semantic input), and colored patterns and hums (non-semantic and non-phonological). The speech production tasks involved auditory repetition, reading, and naming while the finger press tasks involved one-back matching. The results from the main effects and interactions were compared to predictions from a previously reported functional anatomical model of language based on a meta-analysis of many different neuroimaging experiments. Although many findings from the current experiment replicated many of those predicted, our within-subject design also revealed novel results by providing sufficient anatomical precision to dissect several different regions within the anterior insula, pars orbitalis, anterior cingulate, SMA, and cerebellum. For example, we found {{one part of the}} pars orbitalis was involved in phonological processing and another in semantic processing. We also dissociated four different types of phonological effects in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS), left putamen, left ventral premotor cortex, and left pars orbitalis. Our findings challenge some of the commonly-held opinions on the functional anatomy of language, and resolve some previously conflicting findings about specific brain regions—and our experimental design reveals details of the word repetition process that are not well captured by current models...|$|E
40|$|Auditory word {{repetition}} involves many different brain regions, whose functions are {{still far from}} fully understood. Here, we use a single, multi-factorial, within-subjects fMRI design to identify those regions, and to functionally distinguish the multiple linguistic and non-linguistic processing areas that are all involved in <b>repeating</b> <b>back</b> heard words. The study compared: (1) auditory to visual inputs; (2) phonological to non-phonological inputs; (3) semantic to non-semantic inputs; and (4) speech production to finger-press responses.

We also dissociated four different types of phonological effects in, respectively, the left superior temporal sulcus, left putamen, left ventral premot...|$|E

5000|$|The scale {{consisted}} of thirty tasks of increasing difficulty. The easier ones {{could be done}} by everyone. Some of the simplest test items assessed {{whether or not a}} child could follow a beam of light or talk back to the examiner. Slightly harder tasks required children to point to various named body parts, <b>repeat</b> <b>back</b> a series of 2 digits, repeat simple sentences, and define words like house, fork or mama. More difficult test items required children to state the difference between pairs of things, reproduce drawings from memory or to construct sentences from three given words such as [...] "Paris, river and fortune." [...] The hardest test items included asking children to <b>repeat</b> <b>back</b> 7 random digits, find three rhymes for the French word [...] "obéisance" [...] and to answer questions such as [...] "My neighbor has been receiving strange visitors. He has received in turn a doctor, a lawyer, and then a priest. What is taking place?" [...] (Fancher, 1985).|$|R
50|$|The {{second section}} (65-164) {{contains}} {{the next three}} themes. Theme 3 (65-73) {{is very different from}} the previous ones, due largely to its minor setting and its distinctive, Hungarian rhythm. Theme 4 (81-88) is still in a minor and theme 5 (97-104) is in F major. These three themes are each <b>repeated</b> <b>back</b> and forth several times, which gives the section the character of a development.|$|R

The Ghanapatha or the [...] "Bell" [...] mode of chanting is so called because the words are <b>repeated</b> <b>back</b> and forth in a bell shape. The sonority natural to Vedic chanting is enhanced in Ghana. In Jatapatha, the words are braided together, so to speak, and recited back and forth.|$|R

50|$|In {{psychology}} and neuroscience, memory span {{is the longest}} list of items that a person can <b>repeat</b> <b>back</b> in correct order immediately after presentation on 50% of all trials. Items may include words, numbers, or letters. The task is known as digit span when numbers are used. Memory span is a common measure of short-term memory. It is also a component of cognitive ability tests such as the WAIS. Backward memory span is a more challenging variation which involves recalling items in reverse order.|$|R

25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots. The Gambian griot {{turned out not}} to be a real griot, and the story of Kunta Kinte appears to have been a case of circular reporting, in which Haley's own words were <b>repeated</b> <b>back</b> to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in Roots.|$|R
50|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{increases the}} number of errors made on working memory tasks. In one study, the working memory task involved illuminating a sequence of 3 or 4 coloured lights, then asking both sleep deprived and non-sleep deprived individuals to memorize and <b>repeat</b> <b>back</b> the sequence. The sleep deprived performed the task much faster {{than those in the}} control condition (i.e., not sleep deprived), which initially appeared to be a positive effect. However, {{there was a significant difference}} in {{the number of}} errors made, with the fatigued group performing much worse.|$|R
