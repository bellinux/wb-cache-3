5|$|As one of {{the largest}} open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army {{manoeuvres}} and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Euchambersia was {{assigned}} to the newly named family Euchambersiidae by Lieuwe Dirk Boonstra. Boonstra initially misspelt the name as Euchambersidae (which is improper Latin), and was subsequently corrected by Friedrich von Huene in 1940. Euchambersiidae was initially considered to be separate from the families Moschorhinidae and Annatherapsididae; in 1974, Christiane Mendez recognized these groups as closely related subfamilies (renamed Annatherapsidinae, Moschorhininae and Euchambersiinae) within the wider group of her redefined Moschorhinidae (although she also <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Annatherapsididae).|$|E

This {{resulted in the}} WCW United States Heavyweight Championship becoming a championship for the WWF, who <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the WCW United States Championship. At Survivor Series in November 2001, the WCW United States and WWF Intercontinental Championships were unified, resulting in the United States Championship being deactivated. In July 2003, the title was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship. Since the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, it is exclusively contested on the SmackDown brand.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} writing mentioning this site is from William Worcester in about 1480 when he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, {{belonging to the}} Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed a sanctuary for royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil War, and a detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 {{during the course of}} the Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{made three}} casts in 1894, each in {{partially}} glazed stoneware. Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze. His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange and cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened {{to withdraw from}} the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E

Speakers of the language <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> (the) Cant, Gammon or Tarri. Amongst linguists, the name Shelta is the most commonly used term.|$|R
5|$|In {{a feature}} {{on the five}} best Fire Emblem titles up until 2013, Chris Carter of Destructoid {{included}} Genealogy of the Holy War among them due to the many lasting features it introduced to the series. In a retrospective feature about games not released in the United Kingdom, Digital Spy's Damian McFerren <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the best game in the series, decrying its exclusivity to Japan. In a different feature for RPGamer, writer Cassandra Ramos called the game the entry she most wished to see released overseas due to its scale and quality {{when compared to other}} entries from the period. Both noted that Genealogy of the Holy War was a suitable subject for a remake {{in the wake of the}} international success of more recent titles in the series.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} written {{mention of}} the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, Købmannahavn. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress {{was in response to}} attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.|$|E

5|$|The sketch {{became an}} instant cult classic hit among Star Trek and science fiction fans. The 1977 book Saturday Night Live edited by Anne Beatts and John Head {{included}} {{a copy of}} a note from Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry praising the comedic bit. The sketch was released on a 1985 Saturday Night Live compilation VHS that featured The Best of John Belushi, and re-released with the same title in DVD format in 2011. In his book Metapop author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit among the most well-known of all Saturday Night Live routines. The Chicago Sun-Times <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an intelligent satire of Star Trek. The Los Angeles Times placed the parody among the program's top ten sketches of all-time. On the series' 40th anniversary, Tulsa World listed the sketch as one of the television show's most iconic.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with male circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the sexual mutilation of women, {{following the lead}} of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E
5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona in the fifteenth century AD who <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
