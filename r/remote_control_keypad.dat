40|$|Abstract: This study {{explored}} {{the applicability of}} gesture commands in a PDA to the operation of DVD players, video tape players and TVs. Firstly, 58 {{subjects were asked to}} write the appropriate gesture commands for each of the 11 pre-selected commonly used operations in controlling video equipments. From this set of written gesture commands as well as the gesture commands used in the PalmRemote for Palm OS, five commands were screened for each operation by experts with the consideration on frequency been written, compliance with the one stroke writing rule and ease of writing. Another 50 subjects then were recruited to select the most appropriate command from the set of five commands for each of operation. With minor adjustment, a most appropriate set of gesture commands for the 11 operations was summarized. In the second phase of this study, three tasks were designed to simulated the commonly operations on video equipments. Eighteen subjects were asked to execute the three tasks by using conventional <b>remote</b> controller, <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>keypads</b> on Sony CLIE PDA, and the devised gesture commands on Sony CLIE PDA in random sequence. Time and error rate on execution these tasks with three different operation approaches were compared and analyzed. Due to our familiarity with conventional remote controllers, it can be most effectively used to operate video devises. However, gesture commands can be performed more effective than <b>control</b> <b>keypads,</b> if we want to use a PDA to replace a remote controller in operating video equipments...|$|R
50|$|Such {{developments}} could literally {{change the}} face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk's surface. Television <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> and <b>keypads</b> on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.|$|R

25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
