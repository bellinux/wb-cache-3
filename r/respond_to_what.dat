For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.|$|E
500|$|According to Clash and Gikow, Elmo's pet {{goldfish}} Dorothy and {{the members}} of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they saw on the screen. [...] Dorothy's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and her curiosity, which was created and enhanced by Elmo's imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up {{with the}} concept of [...] "Elmo's World", and writer Tony Geiss and {{executive}} producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. Instead of the realism {{of the rest of the}} show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like [...] "a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life" [...] created by the host, and with [...] "a stream-of-consciousness feel to it".

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, after George Zimmerman's {{acquittal}} for {{the shooting death of}} Trayvon Martin, the movement began with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. The movement was co-founded by three black community organizers: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. Garza, Cullors and Tometi met through [...] "Black Organizing for Leadership & Dignity" [...] (BOLD), a national organization that trains community organizers. They began to question how they were going to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they saw as the devaluation of black lives after Zimmerman's acquittal. Garza wrote a Facebook post titled [...] "A Love Note to Black People" [...] in which she said: [...] "Our Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter". Cullors replied: [...] "#BlackLivesMatter". Tometi then added her support, and Black Lives Matter was born as an online campaign.|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} able to speak to demons instead of {{fighting}} them, and can try to form an alliance with them; these negotiations involve the player trying to increase the demon's mood, and start with the player picking an attitude – friendly or intimidating – after which they get to choose how to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the demon says or does, and whether to give the demon items or money it asks for. Demons act differently depending on their personality, {{as well as the}} in-game phase of the moon; it is impossible to converse with demons during full moon, forcing the player to fight or flee. Depending on choices the player makes throughout the game, their moral alignment changes; the different alignments are [...] "law", [...] "chaos", and [...] "neutrality". These affect how the plot progresses, and how easy or difficult it is to form alliances with certain demon types, depending on how compatible the player's and the demon's alignments are.|$|E
500|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church {{encourages}} meditation {{as a form}} of prayer: [...] "Meditation {{is above}} all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the Lord is asking" [...] (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing union with God, it states: [...] "Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him" [...] (#2708). Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).|$|E

500|$|In {{testimony}} before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1989, Schwarzkopf maintained that the Soviet Union {{was a threat to}} the region, but when giving an overview of the countries in the region, noted that Iraq posed a threat to its weaker neighbors. He implored that the U.S. [...] "seek to assert a moderating influence in Iraq." [...] With regional turmoil growing, Schwarzkopf became concerned about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, focusing the attention of his command to prepare to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he thought was a [...] "more realistic scenario." [...] That year, his command began planning to counter an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, seeing it as a likely conflict which would threaten the interests of the United States. In early 1990 he testified again before the Senate Armed Services Committee in threat-assessment hearings that the Cold War was ending and it was less likely the Soviet Union would exert military force in the region. Though he declined to identify Iraq specifically as a threat, he noted a regional conflict was the most likely event to destabilize the region, and noted Iraq's ceasefire with Iran meant it was continuing to grow and modernize its military. In early 1990, he drafted a war plan, Operations Plan 1002-90, titled [...] "Defense of the Arabian Peninsula," [...] which envisioned an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia through Kuwait.|$|E

2500|$|In 1861 Governor Thomas Gore Browne {{had promised}} to {{investigate}} {{the legitimacy of the}} sale of the Waitara land, but as delays continued, Taranaki and Ngāti Ruanui Māori became increasingly impatient. During the earlier war they had driven settlers off farmland at Omata and Tataraimaka, 20km south of New Plymouth, and occupied it, claiming it by right of conquest and vowing to hold it until the Waitara land was returned to them. On 12 March 1863, 300 men from the 57th Regiment, led by Colonel Sir Henry James Warre, marched out to Omata to retake the land and a month later, on 4 April, Browne's successor, Governor Sir George Grey, marched to Tataraimaka with troops and built a redoubt and re-occupied the land in what the Waitangi Tribunal described as a hostile act.
