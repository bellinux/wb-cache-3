5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A <b>recent</b> <b>example</b> showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the {{older and more}} widely distributed techniques. A <b>recent</b> <b>example,</b> TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align {{has been reported to}} improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} {{for some of}} the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most <b>recent</b> <b>example</b> of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E

5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one <b>recent</b> <b>example</b> being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A <b>recent</b> <b>example</b> of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 {{performance}} of the suite by Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recorded on 78rpm discs, provided the only commercially available recording until {{the advent of the}} LP era in the 1950s; a performance by the Cleveland Orchestra under Fritz Reiner in December 1945 was not issued until many years later. In 1951 Capitol issued Hermann Scherchen's recording of the suite with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, since which many recordings of the work have been issued under a variety of labels. A 2008 edition of the Muze survey of recordings lists 19 available versions by orchestras from Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and the US. The version with baritone voice has rarely found its way on to disc; Vladimir Ashkenazy with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Andrei Laptev (2010) provide a <b>recent</b> <b>example.</b> A DVD of the Bolshoi Ballet production, featuring Raisa Struchkova and Vladimir Vasiliev, was released in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates {{that it must be}} solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74TBq (20Curie) of radioactive activity. In a <b>recent</b> <b>example,</b> the ships Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331kg (730lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Mesozoic to present, {{the region}} went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left behind one of the most {{complete}} non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene (10million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most <b>recent</b> <b>example</b> of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{aspiration}} {{to control}} the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. A <b>recent</b> <b>example</b> of weather control was China's preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites {{in the city of}} Beijing {{in an effort to keep}} rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing's Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.|$|E
