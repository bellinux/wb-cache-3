40|$|Abstract—The {{long history}} of deer overabundance in Pennsylvania is {{associated}} with very high <b>reforestation</b> <b>costs</b> and substantial threats to diversity and sustain-ability. In response to this legacy, several landowners and agency personnel formed the Kinzua Quality Deer Cooperative (KQDC) {{in partnership with the}} Sand County Foundation. This Cooperative focuses on about 74, 000 acres in the northeast corner of the Allegheny National Forest (ANF), the setting for the Sugar Run Project under planning by the ANF at present. The goals of the KQDC are to develop a quality deer herd in quality habitat through cooperation with local sportsmen and sports-women. In this paper, we discuss the actions proposed in the Sugar Run project to use improved hunter access and hunter success as silvicultural tools, given a defi ni-tion of silviculture as “controlling the establishment, growth, competition, health, and quality of forests. ” These include the scheduling of regeneration activities to provide a stable level of forage production, increases in road quality, layout and development of skid trails as hunter access trails, creation of viewing pull-outs to stimulate hunter interest, and development of a demonstration of the use of silvicul-ture and the interaction of deer and silviculture in shaping habitat...|$|E

The aim was to reduce <b>reforestation</b> <b>costs</b> while still achieving sufficient regeneration. A key result for management was that non-irrigated seed planting of stone pine and possibly of Lebanon cedar showed promise for cost-effective reforestation and could be competitive with seedlings, given correct seed source and planting conditions. Stone pine seeds collected from nearby mother trees and planted without irrigation on sandy soil showed 35 % survival for < 600 USD/ha; seedlings planted without irrigation cost about 2500 USD/ha and achieved 50 – 70 % survival (costs based on 800 seedlings/ha).

40|$|In forest engineering, time {{prediction}} {{models are}} common tools for evaluating production study of different forest machineries depending on stand and terrain parameters. Usually these models are developed using multiple regression method {{based on the}} statistical data collected by different time study methods. Regarding to multiple regression, there are two assumptions; (1) the depended variables are nonstochastic and (2) the x’s are measured without error. The assumptions cannot be validated, so they do not play a major in the analysis. However, they do influence interpretation of the regression results. In this paper, firstly the confidence interval curves of the parameters used in the yarding and installation time prediction models of tower yarder in Austria are presented.

40|$|The {{impact of}} carbon {{sequestration}} {{on the financial}} profitability of four tree plantation cases in Finland and the Philippines were examined. On the basis of stem wood growth; the accumulation of carbon in forest biomass, the formation and decomposition of litter, and the carbon flows in wood-based products were assessed for each reforestation case representing boreal (Finland) and moist tropical conditions (the Philippines). Using different unit values for carbon sequestration the profitability of reforestation was estimated for a fixed 100 year period on a per hectare basis. The financial profitability of reforestation increased notably when the sequestered carbon had high positive values. For example, when the value of carbon sequestration was set to be Twenty-five United States Dollars per megagram of carbon (25 USD/Mg C), the {{internal rate of return}} (IRR) of a reforestation investment with spruce (Picea abies) in Finland increased from 3. 2 % to 4. 1 %. Equally, the IRR of reforestation with mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) in the Philippines increased from 12. 8 % to 15. 5 %. The present value of carbon sequestration ranged from 39 – 48 % and from 77 – 101 % of the present value of the <b>reforestation</b> <b>costs</b> in Finland and the Philippines, respectively, when a 25 USD/Mg C shadow price and a 5 % discount rate were applied.

40|$|California Polytechnic State University 2 ̆ 7 s School Ranch and Forest, called Swanton Pacific Ranch, {{is located}} {{just north of}} Santa Cruz, California and {{encompasses}} approximately 3, 800 acres of crop, range, and forested areas. Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. ] Franco var. menziesii) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus [Hook. 2 ̆ 6 Arn. ] Rehd.) occur on approciximately 1, 900 acres of the Swanton Pacific Ranch and at Valencia. Because of its high stumpage value, coast redwood is the preferred management species. In addition to economic reality, California Forest Practice laws severely limit the extent of stand manipulation that can occur on any one harvest entry in Santa Cruz County. In our opinion, the only suitable silvicultural system given these currently limiting circumstances is uneven-aged forest management. However, implementing uneven-aged forest management in coast redwood stands involves a number of choices on residual stand density, preferred tree species composition, maximum tree size, q-factor, stand structure, inventory design, tolerable residual stand damage, logging systems, logging <b>costs,</b> <b>reforestation</b> strategies, extent and size of group selection cuts, growth rates, monitoring criteria, ecosystem management, and much more.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Existing forest site maps {{have been}} {{described}} as "invaluable tools" in forest management. Their, economic value potentially materializes as the summed advantage from better decisions in all phases of forestry. Via Bayesian decision analysis, this study establishes optimal use and economic value of site information for one facet of management only: The choice of an optimal planting density in Douglas-fir reforestation. Two case studies were undertaken in extremely different environments of Southwestern and Northwestern Oregon. The prior analysis is based on a review of existing ref 3 restation records and a simulation model. Optimal prior acts differ substantially from present policies. Their implementation may reduce expected costs by approximately 50 per acre. Based on ecological variables observed an 350 survival plots, prediction aids for first-year survival arid site class, the main sources of uncertainty,are established. Plant water relations, and particularly the available water capacity of soils, emerge as prime determinants of survival and productivity. During preposterior analysis, Bayes' strategy translates ecological knowledge directly into optimal managerial choices for specific site units. Site information is evaluated economically, based on prospective reduction of <b>reforestation</b> <b>costs.</b> Expected values of site information are relatively low and almost identical in both ownerships. In the Northwestern Oregon study, it is a rather uniform environment for reforestation which limits the value of information. In the very diverse environment of the Southwestern Oregon ownership, lower marginal costs for plantation establishment, and smaller opportunity losses set these limits. A larger potential value of site information is likely for activities with high marginal costs in Southwestern Oregon. Bayesian decision analysis emphasizes the duality of ecology and economics in forest management. Combined with a system of collecting and analyzing operational records, it resembles a traditional forestry approach to uncertainty: Biolley's control method. As an extended, economically, statistically and computationally refined equivalent of the control method, Bayesian decision analysis deserves a place in the theory of forestry and in practical management of our forests...|$|E
40|$|Some of the world's most {{productive}} timberland {{lies on the}} slopes of the coastal range in Oregon and Washington. More than one-half of the commercial forest land in that area is estimated as high site quality for Douglas-fir, with a site index of 140 or better. But much of this land is not so well forested as it could be. A study of costs of reforestation was made with partial support by the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station. Background An analysis of survey data and interviews of the U. S. Forest Service with forest land managers in 1972 revealed that about one-fourth of the high-site-quality land needs major reforestation or rehabilitation work, or both, to establish commercial softwoods (Beuter and Handy, Unpublished. 1972). The major problems to overcome in reforestation are brush, undesirable hardwood species, and animal damage to softwood seedlings. These interviews also revealed a variety of practices undertaken by forest land managers to reforest high-site-quality lands. Chemical and mechanical means, as well as fire, are used to rid sites of undesirable species. Chemical repellents and protective barriers are used to protect seedlings from animal damage. These practices are successful in varying degrees, but they are consistent in one aspect: they are expensive compared to <b>reforestation</b> <b>costs</b> on sites without problems. Costs for site preparation, planting, and seedling protection ranged from about 100 to over 400 per acre. These costs were based on one attempt at reforestation. Often, first efforts failed, and the land managers had to decide whether to abandon the reforestation effort or try again and face the same uncertainty as before. Many of them had no guidelines of how much they could or would be willing to spend to reforest their lands. Responses ranged from, "We'll spend whatever it takes," to some specific dollar limit the land manager had determined, either analytically or arbitrarily. That some economic guidelines for reforestation would be useful was evident. Objectives in Developing the Guidelines The primary audience for these guidelines is the forest land manager. Results, however, also should be useful for others in timber business analysis and forest economics research. The objective sought in developing guidelines is to answer the question: "Given a particular forest land ownership situation, what can the forest manager afford to spend to reforest the land?" Results are not prescriptions of what a land manager should do. They are only guidelines of what he can do if he identifies with the situation described. The key to usefulness of the guidelines is the ownership situation. A representative range of several variables is used to define ownership situations...|$|E
