5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of fishing boats, one of a <b>rural</b> <b>road,</b> and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133). Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes, the largest in its class. The exact location of the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown. Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in Honfleur.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route16 (NY16) is a {{state highway}} in western New York, in the United States. It runs from the Pennsylvania state line, where {{it is one of}} the highest {{highways}} in the state in elevation, to downtown Buffalo. NY16 is a major route through Erie County, despite the construction of the paralleling NY400 expressway from East Aurora. In Cattaraugus County it also plays an important role, serving as the major connection from Olean to the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate86 or I-86 and NY17). Between those two areas, and indeed for much of its length, it is a two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|The roadway runs north {{through town}} passing the Grayling Army Airfield, and BLI-75/M-93 becomes Grayling Highway. Together {{they make a}} right turn onto Hartwick Pines Road when they {{intersect}} Old 27 Road, turning back towards I-75; this area {{is part of the}} Grayling State Forest. The BLI-75 designation ends at I-75 while M-93 continues along Hartwick Pines Road. The M-93 designation ends at the park's former main gate. The roadway continues further into Hartwick Pines State Park as White Road, a <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> that intersects unsigned route County Road 612 north of the park boundaries.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
5|$|Past Cullen, NY167 makes {{a gradual}} bend to the northeast, passing {{by a series}} of farms {{on its way to the}} hamlet of Jordanville. Here, the highway intersects with Jordanville Road (CR18), an east–west two-lane road that NY167 briefly follows as it runs through the community. A short {{distance}} east of Jordanville, NY167 splits from Jordanville Road to head northeast as a two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>road.</b> It intersects with country roads, such as Rock Hill Road (CR 135) and Robinson Road (CR 46) For the next , the route meanders across Warren, following an erratic northeasterly course across largely undeveloped areas to reach the rural hamlet of Paines Hollow, located at the junction of NY167 and NY168.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> {{bends to}} the {{southeast}} gradually, entering the town of Lapeer, turning east again until it meets CR133 (Clarks Corner Road). The highway soon reverts to a southeast direction, passing {{to the north of}} Beaver Pond and the county line, while NY221 enters the hamlet of Hunts Corners and intersects with CR136 (Jennings Creek Road). Here, NY221 changes direction again, following a northeasterly path out of the hamlet. It bypasses the nearby hamlet of Clarks Corner and soon intersects with the eastern terminus of CR133, which gives way to NY221 as the state road merges with the east–west county highway. NY221 continues on an eastward track into the town of Marathon, where it descends into the Tioughnioga River valley and enters the village of Marathon.|$|E

Through Sharon, NY145 proceeds northwest as a two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>road,</b> soon entering the hamlet of Sharon, where it intersects with US20. At this intersection, the NY145 designation terminates, while the right-of-way continues north as CR5A (Augusville Road) north to the Montgomery County line.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a divided}} highway to Fajardo, {{and the only}} main highway {{connecting}} Fajardo to Río Grande. In Fajardo, PR-53 begins and PR-3 becomes a one-lane per direction <b>rural</b> <b>road,</b> and keeps that way {{for the rest of}} its length, though there are some minor divided segments in Humacao near Junquito, a very small segment near Patagonia (close to its intersection with PR-30 and another segment in Arroyo and Guayama for about nearly 10 kilometers.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 Federal Highway Administration study {{evaluated}} {{the application of}} shoulder rumble strips and centerline rumble strips in combination by analyzing geometric, traffic, and crash data obtained at treated two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>road</b> locations in Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania. The results suggested {{that the effect of}} combining centerline and shoulder rumble strips further reduces run-off-road crashes compared to shoulder rumble strips alone and both total and fatal+injury crashes compared to centerline rumble strips alone. However, it appeared that shoulder rumble strips do not further reduce head-on+sideswipe-opposite-direction crashes than applying centerline rumble strips in isolation.|$|E
30|$|Rumble strips in {{the centre}} of two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>roads</b> are a {{countermeasure}} to help drivers who are unintentionally about to leave the lane, for example, due to sleepiness or inattention.

25|$|The highway {{continues}} northwest through Carlisle before {{crossing the}} line into Montgomery County from Schoharie County. After crossing into Montgomery County, NY162 crosses into the town of Charleston, bending northwest through the town. The scenery in Charlestown does not change from where it was in Carlisle, as NY162 remains a two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>road.</b> A short distance later, NY162 enters the hamlet of Charleston Four Corners, where it intersects with Corbin Hill Road (CR104), East Lykers Road (CR103) and Charleston Street (CR134). NY162 continues northwest out of Charleston Four Corners, remaining a two-lane road as it crosses into the town of Root.|$|E
25|$|NY145 {{continues}} north through Broome on {{a parallel}} with CR50, soon crossing {{into the town}} of Middleburgh.

The route winds northeast, intersecting with Jamestown Road, where it turns eastward. At Manley Hill Road, NY242 bends northeast into a junction with County Route10 (Allegany Road). The surroundings along NY242 do not change much as it continues northeast, and after several miles and one large hill, residences become more sporadic. Just south of the intersection of Kyler Hill Road, the route leaves Napoli and crosses into the town of Little Valley.|$|E
25|$|The United States Numbered Highways are a {{nationwide}} grid of highways, {{but unlike the}} Interstate Highway System, there is no minimum design standard for these highways. This is clearly evident as some stretches of the U.S. Highways in Texas {{are nothing more than}} a two-lane <b>rural</b> <b>road,</b> while others are urban freeways. Although the U.S. Highways have been replaced for the most part by Interstate Highways for through traffic, the U.S. Highways still serve as important regional connectors.
