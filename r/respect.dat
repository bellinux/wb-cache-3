They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might say, is that a and b [...] "stand in" [...] the relation of <b>respecting.</b> But now {{we seem to have}} another state of affairs: the state of affairs of a and b standing in the relation of <b>respecting.</b> This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: a, b, the relation of <b>respecting,</b> and the relation of standing in. Again, however, for it to be the case that a and b stand in the relation of <b>respecting,</b> it doesn't suffice that these four items exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might now say, is that a, b, and the relation of <b>respecting</b> stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, ad infinitum.|$|R
