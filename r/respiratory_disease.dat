40|$|<b>Respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{the leading}} cause of {{hospital}}izations in Brazil (excluding hospital admissions related to childbirth, pregnancy, and postpartum). To analyze the trend and seasonality of hospitalizations for <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> in Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil, 1998 - 2009, a time trend study was performed using simple linear regression. Hospitalization rates for all <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> and specifically for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia were calculated by year and age group. Hospitalizations for all <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> decreased by 45. 6 % (&# 946; = - 2. 2; p < 0. 001); those due to asthma showed the largest decline (annual average 1. 2 / 10, 000), pneumonia showed the largest reduction until 2002, subsequently tending to stabilize, and COPD remained unchanged. The under- 5 -year age group showed the largest decline in hospitalizations for all <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases.</b> There was no seasonality in hospitalizations for COPD. There was a reduction in the burden of hospitalizations due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> in Salvador, mainly due to the drop in asthma and pneumonia in children < 5 years. However, the city still has hospitalization rates for <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> that are higher than in other large Brazilian cities...|$|R
5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics.

However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

Aim: To analyze the distribution of consultations due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> among adults living in Metropolitan Santiago. Material and Methods: A daily registry of all consultations of patients older than 15 years old in seven public primary care centers, was carried out between January 2003 and December 2008. Consultations were classified as having non-respiratory or respiratory causes. The latter were broke down in upper or lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> pneumonia, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma. Results: A total of 1, 170, 941 consultations were registered and 19 % were due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Of these, 46 % were due to upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> 31 % due to lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases,</b> 8 % due to COPD, 6 % due to pneumonia, 5 % due to asthma and 4 % due to other respiratory causes. Pneumonia and COPD were more frequent among consultants older than 65 years. Conclusions: Consultations due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> are approximately one fifth of all primary care consultations. Older people often have more chronic and severe diseases.

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between cough and sputum production and health-related quality of life in COPD. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the French Initiatives COPD cohort and assessed cough and sputum production within the past 7 days using the cough and sputum assessment questionnaire (CASA-Q), health-related quality of life, spirometry, smoking status, dyspnea, exacerbations, anxiety and depression, and comorbidities. Results: One hundred and seventy-eight stable COPD patients were included (age, 62 [56 – 69] years, 128 male, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1]: 57 [37 – 72] % predicted) (median [Q 1 –Q 3]). In univariate analyses, health-related quality of life (Saint George’s respiratory questionnaire total score) was associated with each CASA-Q domain and with chronic bronchitis, exacerbations, dyspnea, FEV 1, depression, and anxiety. All four domains introduced separately were independently associated with health-related quality of life. When introduced together in multivariate analyses, only the cough impact domain remained independently associated with health-related quality of life (R 2 = 0. 60). With chronic bronchitis (standard definition) instead of the CASA-Q, the R 2 was lower (R 2 = 0. 54). Conclusion: This study provides evidence that current cough in the previous 7 days is an important determinant of health-related quality of life impairment in stable COPD patients.
