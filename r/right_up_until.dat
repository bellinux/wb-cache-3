Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia, the rejection of the proposal to introduce conscription and the granting of home leave to men who been serving since 1914 meant {{that by the end of}} the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit. Consequently, during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions—the 36th, 47th and 52nd—in order to reinforce other units.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Tønnies (1825–1903) {{remains to}} date {{one of the}} premier CDV photographers of Denmark. In June 1856 he began his {{photographic}} career as a partner under C. Fritsche in Aalborg and by December of the same year he bought his partner's share of the business and struck out with a studio under his own name. By 1861, Tönnies' business boomed requiring a larger studio and the hiring of assistants, and by 1870 he became a Danish citizen. Ultimately, his family business spanned three-generations and 75 years. The breadth of his photographic products included: Daguerreotypes, calotypes, pannotypes, photo-lithography, stereoscopy, ambrotypes, CDVs, and medallions. It is believed that he produced no less than 75,000 CDVs, many ordered in relation to a large wave of emigration from Nordjylland to North America. Owing to the poverty of Denmark's Vendsyssel region, local demands for inexpensive CDVs persisted in Aalborg <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> World War I, making Tönnies' studio one of the last to produce CDVs in Denmark.|$|E

Tasmania imposed the harshest penalties in the Western world for homosexual activity until 1997, when it was the last Australian jurisdiction to decriminalise homosexuality after a United Nations Human Rights Committee ruling, the passage of federal sexual privacy legislation and a High Court challenge to the state's anti-homosexuality laws.

Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent.

The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856.

Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E

This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas.

This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

40|$|With {{the entry}} into force of the Treaty of Lisbon {{at the end of}} 2009, {{fundamental}} rights have taken on a more prominent constitutional role in the European Union (EU), marking the culmination of decades of rights-based developments. Most notably, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a charter which contains both civil and social rights side-by-side, was ostensibly granted legal value equal to that of the treaties. Yet historically EU integration has been premised on an economic constitution based around liberal economic principles. Furthermore, across Europe there is a variety of different approaches to rights issues. The question must be asked, then, what role do fundamental rights actually play in the EU today? This analysis is informed by a critical constructivist framework which emphasises that it {{is the way in which}} fundamental rights have been constructed that affects the role of rights and how this process of construction is influenced by the institutional framework and presence of dominant economic paradigms in the EU. It is argued that fundamental rights are primarily understood as civil rights of equal value to liberal economic principles and applicable only where the ECJ has jurisdiction. Social rights have been afforded a secondary status and the scope of rights has not extended to the political institutions of the EU when acting outside of the jurisdiction of the ECJ, namely in the context of the governance of the Eurozone. This has constrained the ability of rights developments to contribute towards a European constitutional order that adequately balances competing civil, social, and economic concerns. The argument is developed in two stages. First, the historical development of <b>rights</b> <b>up</b> <b>until</b> the watershed moment of the Charter of Fundamental Rights gaining legal value is analysed. Second, three case studies analysing the political application of civil, social, and equality rights are examined to draw out the implications of how rights are understood...|$|R
