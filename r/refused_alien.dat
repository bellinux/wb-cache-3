5000|$|The novel Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, {{which was}} written in 1972, was the source for the film Stalker (1979) by Andrei Tarkovsky. The novel is about a mysterious [...] "zone" [...] filled with strange and often deadly {{extraterrestrial}} artifacts, which are theorized by some scientists to be the <b>refuse</b> from an <b>alien</b> [...] "picnic" [...] on Earth.|$|R
40|$|Here {{is a view}} {{of some of the}} Japanese {{taken into}} custody by FBI {{officers}} when a ferry from Terminal Island docked at San Pedro. They were herded into a wire enclosure for questioning and were guarded by soldiers from Fort McArthur. Not one of the guards at left. Terminal Island, with a Japanese colony of 6000, has become huge concentration camp with <b>aliens</b> <b>refused</b> right to leave confines and citizens ordered to stay home.

50|$|In {{the last}} episode, when Shrans former {{associates}} track down Enterprise and board the ship, they demand that Archer {{take them to}} Shran, but the captain <b>refuses.</b> The <b>aliens</b> are about to kill Archer, so Trip, thinking fast, tells them that he will take them to Shran. When Archer protests, the aliens knock him out. Trip leads the aliens into {{what appears to be}} a harmless utility closet — he tells them it is simply a com station and he is going to get Shran to come to them. Trip tells them he just needs to connect a couple of things, but when he brings a pair of conduits together, a massive explosion erupts, taking out both Trip and the aliens. Trip is fatally wounded. In a July 2005 interview, Berman revealed that had the series been renewed, Trip would have survived; and TPol and he would be back together.|$|R
50|$|Worf {{goes back}} to DS9 and hunts down the alien. He demands the alien {{to take him to}} the Romulan prison camp. The <b>alien</b> <b>refuses.</b> Worf grabs him and dangles over a high bridge. The alien doesn't wish to go because the camp is on a planet on the fringe of Romulan space. Worf threatens the alien. After getting a leave of absence from the Enterprise, he sets off with the alien to the planet in question. On arrival the alien takes him to a clifftop from where they can see the camp.|$|R
40|$|A first {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to verify whether a goat may label her kid through licking and nursing in order to discriminate between her own and two alien kids. Furthermore, it was assessed how long after birth a kid needs to be along with its mother {{in order to be}} rejected by another goat and to be recognized by its own dam. All the 18 goats tested at 2 h accepted their own kid, whereas ten of them rejected both aliens; all the 20 goats tested at 4 h accepted their own young, whereas 17 rejected the alien isolated kid and 18 <b>refused</b> the <b>alien</b> labelled kid. In a second experiment physical contact, licking and nursing were prevented. All the 25 maternal goats accepted their own kids, whereas 11 of them rejected the alien. These two studies indicate that when the goat is left undisturbed with her kid after kidding, maternal selectivity is developed within 4 h...|$|R
50|$|Allan and {{the female}} alien arrive on Oceano, joining Laura, Paul and Anders. The alien regains {{consciousness}} and smiles at the three men, but not Laura. The <b>alien</b> <b>refuses</b> to eat all food offered and will not let Anders take a blood sample. That night, as Paul is guarding the alien, she attacks and kills him, draining his blood after first hypnotizing him. The surviving astronauts decide to keep her alive by feeding her blood from the ship's plasma supply. When this supply runs out, she kills Anders and feeds on him, leaving Laura and Allan the only humans aboard.|$|R
50|$|Although the CCPCs are gone, Drake arrives, {{and they}} decide {{to hide in the}} wardrobe. Darius refuses because of his earlier experience. They realise his fears when he once again holds on to the bar and nearly falls. They try to hold on him but they can't hold on much longer. K-9 manages to save him, and Drake is with K-9. He asks them if they saw the alien. As they leave Drake shouts out to the <b>alien,</b> <b>refusing</b> to {{acknowledge}} his fear. Back at the mansion Gryffen demonstrates to the team events concerning the spread of fear. Gryffen reveals to the team that Darius is claustrophobic.|$|R
5|$|Back on Enterprise, Commander Tucker {{arranges}} a movie {{night for}} the crew featuring the Frankenstein film trilogy, and invites Sub-Commander T'Pol. She eventually consents, and finally finds in the film an insightful view into historical Human-Vulcan relations. Meanwhile, Mayweather makes his intended modifications without permission, resulting in a confrontation when Paul finds out. The ship comes under further attack from an alien vessel, and Paul offers up the cargo as planned. The <b>aliens</b> <b>refuse</b> and demand the vessel as well. Left without any other option, Paul tells Mayweather to re-initiate the modifications, and to detach the command module from the cargo section. They soon disable the alien ship. The brothers reconcile, and Mayweather leaves, promising to visit again soon.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is set in}} 2035, 20 {{years after}} the events of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its expansion, in a {{scenario}} in which humanity was defeated by aliens. XCOM proved incapable of attenuating the alien threat and was quickly betrayed by the council nations, who surrendered to the aliens shortly after the invasion began. XCOM became {{nothing more than a}} resistance force, and went off the radar to avoid persecution {{at the hands of the}} aliens. Most of its members either submitted to alien rule and left behind their past or, some, like Central Officer Bradford <b>refused</b> the <b>alien</b> administration and went into hiding. Earth is now controlled by the aliens through the puppet ADVENT Administration, and XCOM has been long-forgotten, members silenced and records erased. ADVENT has done much to gradually improve public opinion of the aliens, most notably by the propagation of the belief that the aliens came in peace, and that the forces of Earth retaliated aggressively and with prejudice. (This is presumed to have happened right after the player researches MECs, as stated by the autopsy of an ADVENT MEC.) ...|$|R
5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the <b>alien</b> <b>refuses</b> to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|R
50|$|The {{deadlock}} persists. Neither ship {{dares to}} leave for fear that the other {{will be able to}} track it home. Neither captain is ready to gamble by attacking the other ship. Then Tommy realizes {{the way out of the}} impasse. He and his Captain arrange an exchange of personnel between the ships. Tommy and the Captain go aboard the alien ship even as two aliens board the Llanvabon. Then they present an ultimatum: they will detonate the atomic power packs in their suits if the <b>aliens</b> <b>refuse</b> to go along with their plan, which is for each crew to take the other's ship back to their home planet. Each will disable all the tracking equipment on their own ship before the exchange, and indeed they will have to be thorough to prevent the new crew from tracking them.|$|R
5000|$|Wrixon showed sincerity, tactfulness, good {{judgment}} and persuasiveness {{in dealing with}} opposition, and was always ready to accept amendments which would improve bills. In 1890 Wrixon went to London to represent the Victorian government in the Ah Toy case, which turned {{on the power of}} the colonies to <b>refuse</b> to admit <b>aliens.</b> He had argued the case before the Victorian full court when five judges decided against the government, with Higinbotham and Kerford dissenting. Wrixon succeeded in getting the judgment reversed by the privy council. In 1890 he became a Q.C., and in November of that year resigned with his colleagues in the Gillies government. In 1891 {{he was one of the}} Victorian representatives at the federal convention held at Sydney. There his speech on the Commonwealth bill was [...] "specially remarkable for the almost prophetic insight into the modifications that would be necessary before the bill could be wholly acceptable" [...] (Quick and Garran, The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, p. 136).|$|R
50|$|This {{proves to}} be the tipping point of the war, though when a ground {{invasion}} of the Pitar’s homeworld was begun, the arrogant <b>aliens</b> <b>refuse</b> to surrender, fighting even when the obvious result would be death. None would willingly be taken alive, {{and those who were}} trapped either fought to the death or retreated into a voluntary, terminal madness. This results in the eventual extinction of the Pitar. Only after the Pitar are exterminated is it discovered why they had eviscerated the women on Treetrunk: they were an incredibly narcissistic people, and couldn't stand the thought of other life forms. They wished to exterminate humanity {{and all of the other}} races, who they viewed as inferior and undeserving of life. However, they were unable to produce enough offspring to mount such an attack. Their birth rate being the lowest of any sentient species in that area of the galaxy, they decided to use genetically modified human embryos to create Pitar fetuses. These would be gestated in the stolen uteri until they could be transplanted to suitable Pitar women. This would give them the strength needed to bring their genocidal plans to fruition.|$|R
50|$|After {{recovering}} from the severe malnutrition he suffered aboard Challenger, Seafort was promoted back to Captain and given command of his old ship Hibernia to sail back to Hope Nation to reinforce the colony. Carrying out his oath of vengeance he killed Tremaine, already stripped of his position for his actions in abandoning Portias and Challengers passengers, in a duel. Seafort himself was seriously injured, losing a lung. Appointed to various make-work positions Seafort narrowly survived an assassination attempt by a Hope Nation separatist terrorist group that left his friend and aide Alexi Tamarov first in a coma and then with amnesia, and was reunited with Edgar Tolliver when Tolliver was appointed as Tamarovs replacement. He also married Annie Wells, a transpop whom he had met aboard Portia and later grown close to during the ordeal on Challenger.Seafort found himself stranded groundside without a ship as wave after wave of aliens attacked Hope Nation, destroying Centraltown with a meteor strike and as the UN fleet retreated from the system having lost {{a third of its}} strength. Seafort was left alone with a small band of loyal friends to fight off first a revolution, and then continuing alien attacks. His troubles were compounded by a more personal crisis as his new wife was suffering a serious mental breakdown after being raped by looters in the ruins of Centraltown. While driving off an alien assault on a surface base in the Venturas mountains Seafort decided to violate the UNs Nuclear Resolution, a capital crime, to save the planet. Luring over a thousand aliens to the planets orbiting station, nearly five hundred of the Fish were killed by the stations defenses while the remainder were destroyed in the nuclear fireball of its destruction. Seafort had originally intended to die aboard the station, but his life was saved by his old friend Vax Holser, now Commander of the fastship UNS Victoria, at the cost of Holsers own life. Sailing home on Victoria to face trial and execution, he was stunned to learn that, several months before his destruction of the station, the Nuclear Resolution had been amended to allow the use of nuclear weapons outside the solar system against the <b>aliens.</b> <b>Refusing</b> the offer of a ship, Seafort grudgingly allowed the new Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Duhaney, to appoint him Commandant of the UN Naval Academy.|$|R
