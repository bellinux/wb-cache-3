5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as the World Wide Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for a <b>resource</b> from a string that merely named a <b>resource</b> emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform <b>Resource</b> Locator came to represent the former, and the more contentious Uniform <b>Resource</b> Name came to represent the latter.|$|E
5|$|A Uniform <b>Resource</b> Name (URN) may be {{compared}} to a person's name, while a Uniform <b>Resource</b> Locator (URL) may {{be compared}} to their street address. In other words, a URN identifies an item and a URL provides a method for finding it.|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{relationships}} between spiritual <b>resources,</b> job <b>resources,</b> and work engagement among 496 Australian religious workers at three time points {{over a period}} of 18 months. Drawing on the Conservation of <b>Resources</b> theory and Job Demands-Resources model, spiritual <b>resources</b> are conceptualized as a distinct category of personal <b>resources</b> significant for this occupational cohort. Results of structural equation modelling analysis did not support the hypothesis of reciprocal {{relationships between}} spiritual and job <b>resources</b> and work engagement. Instead, spiritual <b>resources</b> had a positive cross-lagged effect on work engagement, and work engagement had a positive cross-lagged effect on job <b>resources.</b> When the high stability of spiritual <b>resources</b> over time was accounted for, work engagement had a negative indirect effect on spiritual <b>resources</b> over time mediated by a negative effect of job <b>resources</b> on spiritual <b>resources</b> (suppression effect). Spiritual <b>resources</b> emerge as an important category of antecedent <b>resources</b> for work engagement among religious workers. However, it appears that motivated religious workers may prioritize energy investments into increasing job <b>resources</b> at the expense of maintaining and developing spiritual <b>resources.</b> Practically, this research provides evidence for the promotion of initiatives to foster spiritual <b>resources</b> that enhance resilience and well-being among religious workers. Practitioner points: Spiritual <b>resources</b> are an under-researched category of personal <b>resources</b> that positively predict work engagement among religious workers. Religious organizations and individual religious workers need to invest energy in the ongoing development of spiritual <b>resources</b> to maintain motivation for this unique type of work. Managers need to be aware that a focus on enhancing job <b>resources</b> and work engagement can have deleterious effects on religious workers' spiritual <b>resources</b> and so threaten their ongoing work engagement. 22 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} <b>resource</b> over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform <b>Resource</b> Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform <b>Resource</b> Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E
2500|$|Organizational {{support systems}} affect the team {{effectiveness}} and provide <b>resources</b> for teams {{operating in the}} multi-team environment. During the chartering of new teams, organizational enabling <b>resources</b> are first identified. Examples of enabling <b>resources</b> include facilities, equipment, information, training, and leadership. Team-specific <b>resources</b> (e.g., budgetary <b>resources,</b> human <b>resources)</b> are typically made available. Team-specific human <b>resources</b> represent the individual contributors who are selected to be [...] team members. Intra-team processes (e.g., task design, task assignment) involve these team-specific <b>resources.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} these {{fine-tuned}} distinctions are several. First, {{people may not}} allocate all of the available <b>resources</b> to a task at hand because they are cognitive misers. Unless highly motivated, people tend to use as few <b>resources</b> as necessary. Thus, a distinction is made between total <b>resources</b> and allocated <b>resources.</b> Second, people will allocate <b>resources</b> only {{as required by the}} task. If people are watching a program they have seen before, fewer <b>resources</b> may be required because of the familiarity of the program. Conversely, if the production is such that the visual elements of the programming are important, then more <b>resources</b> may be required. In both cases, the same amount of <b>resources</b> may have been allocated to the TV program, but different amounts were actually used, leaving some allocated <b>resources</b> available in one case but not in another. Third, some elements in the environment will automatically draw <b>resources.</b> For example, formal features automatically attract attention (e.g., unrelated cuts), drawing required <b>resources</b> from the total pool of <b>resources</b> without conscious allocation of <b>resources.</b> In this case, the difference between the automatic attraction (i.e., required) of <b>resources</b> and the total <b>resources</b> leaves some remaining <b>resources</b> for allocation to other tasks.|$|R

The price {{evolution of}} sold <b>resources</b> varies with time according to the relation between the price increase factor, PIF, of sold and extracted <b>resources.</b> The price evolutions of sold <b>resources</b> and price difference are investigated according to the relation between extraction rate and interest rate of extracted and sold <b>resources.</b> The price of sold <b>resources</b> and the price difference increase with time if the PIF of sold <b>resources</b> is greater than the PIF of extracted <b>resources</b> and the initial price is greater than the critical price of sold <b>resources,</b> which depends on the initial price of extracted <b>resources</b> and the interest rate of non-extracted and extracted <b>resources.</b> The price of sold <b>resources</b> and the price difference decrease with time if the PIF of sold <b>resources</b> is greater than the PIF of extracted <b>resources</b> and the initial price is smaller than the critical price of sold <b>resources.</b> The other cases are discussed extensively in the paper.

5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew <b>resource</b> management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew <b>Resource</b> Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew <b>Resource</b> Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew <b>Resource</b> Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the <b>resource</b> demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates <b>resource</b> use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied <b>resource</b> use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), <b>resource</b> intensity, and <b>resource</b> productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key <b>resource</b> categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption.

50|$|Within this model, media {{messages}} {{may receive}} insufficient or limited processing for two basic reasons (i.e., cognitive overload). First, {{there may not}} be enough <b>resources</b> available to process the message fully (i.e., the required <b>resources</b> exceed the total <b>resources).</b> For example, a message on a topic that a person does not understand may require so many <b>resources</b> - perhaps trying to retrieve information from long-term memory - that, even though all <b>resources</b> may have been allocated to the task, the required <b>resources</b> for retrieval leave neither remaining nor available <b>resources</b> for attending to and encoding the message. Second, there may be enough <b>resources</b> available to process the message but those <b>resources</b> are not allocated to the task for reasons such as insufficient motivation or because the person is multitasking (e.g., <b>resources</b> required exceeds <b>resources</b> allocated).

30|$|To {{address the}} {{aforementioned}} problems, we propose a verification algorithm (Algorithm 3). Our solution motivates the VM to declare its current application metrics by granting <b>resources</b> to the VM whose calculated <b>resources</b> load (obtained from the VM’s declared metrics) falls within a close {{range of the}} VM’s actual <b>resources</b> load (line 4 - 5). On the other hand, the hypervisor revokes <b>resources</b> from the VM whose calculated <b>resources</b> load and actual <b>resources</b> load do not match (line 6 - 7). This dissimilarity, in most cases, is either because the VM has lied about its declared metrics, or because the VM has been compromised. The amount of <b>resources</b> revoked from the VM can {{be decided by the}} system administrator, who clearly knows the real impact of adjusting the VM’s <b>resources</b> on their performance. However, we suggest that the amount be proportional to the magnitude of the difference between the calculated <b>resources</b> load and the current <b>resources</b> load. In other words, the larger the difference between the calculated <b>resources</b> load and current <b>resources</b> load is, the more <b>resources</b> should be revoked from the VM. This encourages VMs to truthfully declare their metrics used to calculate the <b>resources</b> load.|$|R
