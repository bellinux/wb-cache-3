30|$|We {{identified}} 75 patients admitted {{with severe}} sepsis, {{with an average}} age of 75.7 ± 13 years, and an overall hospital mortality of 47 %. The patients included had in average 3 severity criteria, mainly acute kidney injury (67 %), altered state of consciousness (51 %), hypotension (56 %), and lactate above 36 mg/dL (34 %). Only 31 % of the patients received antibiotic treatment in the first 3 hours (mean time since hospital admission until antibiotic administration: 8.0 ± 7.9 hours). The only factor associated with timely antibiotic administration was patient direct reference to <b>reanimation</b> <b>room</b> (Odds ratio: 5.0; p < 0.01). Importantly, age, gender, and the presence of comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, cancer or dementia was not related with time until first antibiotic prescription. Moreover, the presence of classic signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome was also not related with rapid antibiotic prescription.|$|E
30|$|Patients {{and methods}} The present study compares {{a series of}} 63 {{patients}} with tetanus, who were treated by magnesium sulfate versus a historical serioes of 67 patients with tetanus, who were conventionally treated with diazepam. It took place within the <b>reanimation</b> multiservice <b>room</b> of the provincial general referral hospital of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (August 2013 through September 2015). All the consecutive patients, of over 15  years of age, admitted for tetanus management {{during the study period}} were included, without any selection. Patients with kidney failure, shock or well known as allergic to magnesium sulfate were all excluded. Apart from the treatment of muscular spasm, all the patients in both groups were identically managed in accordance with their usual treatment as provided by the unit. The collected data were performed retrospectively from the medical forms of all the control patients and prospectively for the study group. The decisional main criterion was the total end of muscular spasm for effectiveness delay and the occurring frequency of adverse reactions for tolerance. The statistical data were obtained via SPSS software 21.0. This study was recorded at the Ethical Office of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa, approval date: ESP/CE/ 043 / 2014.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{index case}} was a female patient aged 60 years. She {{had a history of}} ischemic stroke in 2004 (no {{subsisting}} defi cit) and convulsive seizures in 2005. She was receiving long-term treatment by acetylsalicylic acid and valproate and did not receive antacids. The patient and her husband participated in a tour to Rajasthan with a group of 25 other persons (12 other couples + 1 solo traveler) in May 2006. All came from Saint-Brieuc, a city of 47, 000 inhabitants in Brittany (France). The group left Saint-Brieuc on May 14, 2006, and took off from Paris the following day, arriving in Delhi, India on the evening of May 15. The patient presented the fi rst signs on May 18, on her third day in India: vomiting and fi ve to six stools per day. The stools were mixed neither with blood nor with mucus. She self-treated with loperamide and metronidazole. The group returned on May 24, 2006, by direct fl ight from Delhi to Paris. The patient had no diarrhea and no vomiting during the fl ight to Paris or the ensuing bus trip to Saint-Brieuc. The patient consulted her family physician who referred her to the emergency room at Saint-Brieuc, a secondary care hospital, on the evening of May 25. She presented very liquid stools and vomiting with no abdominal pain. Her temperature was normal. There was marked dehydration with a loss of 6 kg compared to her usual weight. Her arterial blood pressure was 105 / 60 mm Hg, and pulse rate was 90 bpm. Her blood chemistry showed hypokalemia (1. 6 mmol/L) and dehydration (urea = 19 mmol/L, serum creatinine = 99 ␮ mol/L, blood protein = 95 g/L, and C-reactive protein < 4 mg/ml). The patient was admitted to the cardiology intensive care unit on May 25 (single room) and was transferred the following day to the <b>reanimation</b> ward (single <b>room).</b> The attending physician there BRIEF COMMUNICATION...|$|R
