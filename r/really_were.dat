5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones <b>really</b> <b>were.</b> The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they <b>really</b> <b>were,</b> Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E

5|$|The group {{traveled}} to Italy in early 1818. They first surrendered Allegra to Byron in April, much to Claire's distress. In August, Percy Shelley took Claire to see Allegra, at her request. Percy arrived in Venice, telling Byron {{he had the}} entire family. Mary was thus summoned to Venice to substantiate Percy's story. However, baby Clara Shelley was sick and traveling made her even more ill. She died shortly after arriving in Venice. In the winter of 1818, Percy registered a child in Naples to himself and Mary: Elena Adelaide. However, it is unclear who this child's parents <b>really</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Typhoon Tingting {{approached}} the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas {{produced by the}} storm in Saipan. On June28, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82km/h (51mph) with gusts to 106km/h (66mph); a pressure of 994.6hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they <b>really</b> <b>were.</b> Winds of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); a pressure of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded. The highest winds during Typhoon Tingting throughout the Mariana Islands were measured on Pagan Island where 106km/h (66mph) sustained winds were recorded along with a gust of 212km/h (132mph).|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that <b>really</b> <b>were</b> formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes {{a closer}} look at really in order to account for its various interpretations. Stenstrm's (1986) work on really forms the starting-point for the investigation. The {{following}} examples are from Stenstrm (1986 : 151), where she claims that the different readings of <b>really</b> <b>are</b> due to position and syntactic function: (1) this question <b>is</b> <b>really</b> surprising (2) this <b>is</b> a <b>really</b> surprising question (3) this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a surprising question (4) this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a surprising question (5) <b>really</b> this <b>is</b> a surprising question Stenstrm states that when <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed next to the adjective, as in (1) and (2), it is a degree modifier which serves as an intensifier of surprising. But, the further <b>really</b> <b>is</b> moved to the left, the less is the emphasis on surprising and the more it is on the whole a surprising question. When <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed in initial position, as in (5), it no longer intensifies a single clause element but is a comment on the whole proposition. Stenstrm remains vague about the intermediate positions and about the more exact interaction between syntactic position and interpretation. She concludes that what finally decides the function of <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the combined effect of position, prosody and the wider context. In contrast to Stenstrm, I propose that the motivating factors for the readings are semantic/pragmatic in nature rather than syntactic/positiona...|$|R
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants <b>really</b> <b>were</b> dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Other dinosaurs {{from these}} {{formations}} include the genasaur Lesothosaurus, the basal sauropodomorph Massospondylus, and the theropod Megapnosaurus. The Lower Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides Heterodontosaurus, it contained Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, and Pegomastax. Yet {{another member of}} the family, Geranosaurus, is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species might have fed on separate food sources in order to avoid competition (niche partitioning). With its highly specialised dentition, Heterodontosaurus might have been specialised for tough plant material, while the less specialised Abrictosaurus might have predominantly consumed softer vegetation. The position of the individual heterodontosaurid specimens within the rock succession is poorly known, making it difficult to determine how many of these species <b>really</b> <b>were</b> conspecific, and which species existed at separate times.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they <b>really</b> <b>were,</b> including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E

5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they <b>really</b> <b>were.</b> Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E
