50|$|In 1989 the Royal Netherlands Army {{acquired}} 30 Flycatcher systems. Each Flycatcher was fielded {{with two}} modified Bofors 40L70G guns. The 'G' stands for 'Gemodificeerd', {{which is the}} Dutch word meaning 'modified'. In the 40L70G version the loading mechanism was further improved and could be recognized by open <b>rear</b> <b>guides.</b> The 40L70G guns were also provided with muzzle velocity radars.|$|R
50|$|The weapon {{consists}} of a rocket within a launcher consisting of two tubes, one inside the other. While closed, the outer assembly serves as a watertight container for the rocket and the percussion-cap firing mechanism that activates the rocket. The outer tube contains the trigger, the arming handle, front and rear sights, and the rear cover. The inner tube contains the channel assembly, which houses the firing pin assembly, including the detent lever. When extended, the inner tube telescopes outward toward the <b>rear,</b> <b>guided</b> by the channel assembly, which rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube's trigger housing assembly. This causes the detent lever to move under the trigger assembly in the outer tube, both locking the inner tube in the extended position and cocking the weapon. Once armed, the weapon is no longer watertight, even if the launcher is collapsed into its original configuration.|$|R
50|$|The gun was, {{for ease}} of use in trenches, single shot; the gunner had to extract the empty case of a fired {{cartridge}} manually and reload the gun after firing each round, which gave it a low rate of fire. It had a simple block breech with percussion gear, and was mounted on a non-recoiling frame consisting of a hydraulic buffer, trunnion block, and <b>rear</b> <b>guide</b> tube. Hand grips were mounted on the guide tube. The gun had a large muzzle brake to reduce recoil.|$|E

50|$|Reloading {{the weapon}} {{involves}} charging the folding vertical forward grip, which is simultaneously the cocking handle. The grip is deployed and locked {{forward with a}} spring latch and then charged to the <b>rear</b> and <b>guided</b> back forward in order to chamber a round. The forward grip does not reciprocate with the bolt during firing and also acts as a safety mechanism in the stowed (folded) position, immobilizing the bolt in either its forward or rear positions by using a lug on the grip to engage and recess into a notch in the bolt. This allows the weapon to be carried safely either loaded or unloaded and provides a drop safety feature.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of mathematical modelling {{in the field of}} directional behaviour of a vehicle. A model of a bus has been created in the simulation system environment. Its steady state and transient directional behaviour has been compared with experimental results. The structure of the model contains parametrical substructures of the front wheel suspension and rear axle. The ride of the vehicle model along the general track is performed by an approximate model of the driver behaviour. The influence of vehicle load on its directional properties has been shown. The control strategy for all wheel steering, that is able to ensure vehicle neutral behaviour independent on lateral acceleration level, has been formulaed. The steady state as well as transient response of the vehicle with active elements in the <b>rear</b> axle <b>guide</b> has been analysed. The results of the simulations show, that the achieved neutral vehicle behaviour is not dependent on the vehicle load.

50|$|The {{receiver}} of the M70 is 1.5 mm thick, {{compared to}} the 1 mm thick receiver of the AKM, making it more rigid. The receiver has a bulge at the front to accommodate an enlarged trunnion similar to a RPK receiver, with the front trunnion rivet configuration likewise resembling a RPK and not an AKM. Likewise, the barrel is hammer forged and not chrome-lined, making {{it a little more}} accurate than a standard AKM, but at the cost of increased susceptibility to corrosion and shorter barrel life. The lack of chrome lining is unique for an AK and consistent with other Zastava built rifles of Soviet design (such as the Yugoslavian M59 or M59/66). Unlike other AK variants, a lock button must be depressed {{on the left side of}} the receiver as the first step for field stripping, to enable depressing the <b>rear</b> spring <b>guide</b> to remove the receiver dust cover. It is probable this feature is intended to prevent the loss of the top cover due to recoil when firing rifle grenades.|$|R
5000|$|The RPK {{also has}} a {{slightly}} longer receiver, by about 20 mm or less. This was done to decrease the fire rate slightly, but not significantly enough to lower it any less than 600 rounds per minute (RPM). The U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel (compared to the 1.0 mm sheet metal receiver used on the standard AKM rifles. It uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly, that consists of a <b>rear</b> spring <b>guide</b> rod from the AK and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring. It features a thick laminated wood foregrip, and a fixed laminated wood [...] "club-foot" [...] buttstock, similar to the stock used on the RPD, {{which is designed to}} allow the user to fire from the prone position more comfortably. It uses a standard AKM pistol grip and can also use standard AKM detachable box magazines, but it is most commonly used with a 40-round box magazine or a 75-round drum magazine. Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM are moderate.|$|R
50|$|The LANTIRN pod did {{not require}} changes to the F-14's own system software, but the pod was {{designed}} to operate on a MIL-STD-1553B bus not present on the F-14A or B. Consequently, Martin Marietta specially developed an interface card for LANTIRN. The Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) would receive pod imagery on a 10-inch Programmable Tactical Information Display (PTID) or another Multi-Function Display in the F-14 <b>rear</b> cockpit and <b>guided</b> LGBs using a new hand controller installed {{on the right side}} console. Initially, the hand controller replaced the RIO's TARPS control panel, meaning a Tomcat configured for LANTIRN could not carry TARPS and the reverse, but eventually a workaround was later developed to allow a Tomcat to carry LANTIRN or TARPS as needed.|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{measurements}} of anterior-posterior leg position recorded from stick insects {{walking on a}} wheel were tested for relationships among spatial and temporal parameters of leg coordination. This analysis revealed that the protraction of middle and <b>rear</b> legs is <b>guided</b> by the ipsilateral front and middle legs respectively. Protraction endpoint for each rear leg shows a significant positive correlation with the simultaneous position of the ipsi-lateral middle leg (Figs 1, 2; Table 1). An analogous, but somewhat weaker, correlation exists between the protraction endpoint of each middle leg and {{the position of the}} ipsilateral front leg. This coordination of spatial parameters was tested experimentally by manipulating the position of the forward leg. When a middle leg is restrained in various positions, the ipsilateral rear leg adjusts its protraction endpoint accordingly (Fig. 3). However, its retraction endpoint does not undergo parallel shifts; consequently, step amplitude, protraction duration, and step frequency all change as a function of middle leg position.

50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the <b>rear</b> together <b>guided</b> by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
40|$|This article {{comes up}} with a new concept of {{applying}} the difference between traction forces on front and <b>rear</b> wheelsets to <b>guiding</b> control, as well as the design of a new type of structurally simple asymmetrical radial bogies, which lead to the proposition of traction forces difference-steering asymmetric radial bogies. The traction forces difference-steering asymmetric radial bogies are referred to as TFDA-bogies, in which the difference of longitudinal creep forces between front and rear wheels produces radial steering of both wheelsets. The concept of traction difference is incorporated into guiding control and bogie structure is also simplified in the form of asymmetrical radial bogies. Angle sensors are mounted to facilitate the change of electric currents of the front and rear traction motors to control the guiding mechanism so that wheelsets can adopt the radial position. With SIMPACK, the multibody dynamics analysis software, three whole vehicle models of TFDA-bogies, radial bogies, and conventional bogies are set up and comparative analyses are made on the lead wheel angle of attack, lead wheel lateral force, lead wheel friction power, and total vehicle friction power under idle running condition and traction condition, respectively. Results show that TFDA-bogies are radial bogies with simplified structure...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the manufacture of}} thin shells for the deformable secondary mirrors of the LBT adaptive optics system. The secondary mirrors are thin shells, 910 mm in diameter and 1. 6 mm thick. Each mirror will have its shape controlled by 672 voice-coil actuators. The main requirement for manufacture of the shell is smoothness on scales {{too small to be}} adjusted by the actuators. An additional requirement is that the rear surface match the reference body within 30 µm peak-to-valley. A technique was developed for producing smooth surfaces on the very aspheric surfaces of the shells. We figure the optical surfaces on a thick disk of Zerodur, then turn the disk over and thin it to 1. 6 mm from the rear surface. Figuring is done primarily with a 30 cm diameter stressed lap, which bends actively to match the local curvature of the aspheric surface. For the thinning operation, the mirror is blocked with pitch, optical surface down, onto a granite disk with a matching convex surface. Because the shell may bend during the blocking operation and as its thickness is reduced to 1. 6 mm, figuring of the <b>rear</b> surface is <b>guided</b> by precise thickness measurements over the surface of the shell. This method guarantees that both surfaces of the finished shell will satisfy their requirements when corrected with small actuator forces. Following the thinning operation, we edge the shell to its final dimensions, remove it from the blocking body, and coat the rear surface with aluminum to provide a set of conductive plates for capacitive sensors...|$|R

The quality of a PCT provides information regarding a person’s readiness for career decision making and the intensity and duration of career interventions that might be effective in solving career problems. Implications for research, counselor training, and service delivery with theory-based career assessment using Holland’s theory are discussed. © 1999 Academic Press In responding to the editor’s invitation to write about Holland’s theory and career assessment, we confronted a daunting task. Holland has been working on assessment matters for over 40 years and we had 12 pages to devote to this work. We decided to focus {{on the use of the}} Self-Directed Search (SDS; Holland, 1994) in career assessment, recognizing that this topic is central to Holland’s contri-butions and a focal part of this celebratory issue of the journal. As we have talked with hundreds of workshop participants over the years about making more effective use of the SDS, we have frequently encountered resistance to spending time learning about RIASEC theory. Practitioners some-times view theory as the antithesis of good practice. At the end of the workshop, however, participants often express appreciation for the time spent on Holland’s theory because it has high utility in practice. The SDS is the principal embodi-ment of Holland’s theory with respect to career assessment. We write as practitioners, having used the SDS Form R in our career services since 1972. Many of our views are discussed more fully in The Self-Directed Search and other Holland-based career materials: A practitioner’s <b>guide</b> (<b>Rear...</b>|$|R
