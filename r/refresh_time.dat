5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time.

40|$|Given the {{convenient}} sealing of fiber-shaped dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (FDSSCs), the electrolyte refreshing effect on the photo-electrochemical performance of FDSSCs was studied. The electron transport and interfacial recombination kinetics were also systematically investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. With increased electrolyte <b>refreshing</b> <b>times</b> from 0 to 10, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) increased, whereas the photocurrent density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) significantly decreased. The increased Voc was mainly ascribed to the electron recombination resistance (Rct, WE) at the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface and electron lifetime. The decreased Jsc and PCE were due to dye desorption and the increase of series resistance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Hayashi-Yoshida type estimator for the covariation matrix of continuous Itˆo semimartingales observed with noise. The coordinates of the multivariate process {{are assumed to}} be observed at highly frequent nonsynchronous points. The estimator of the covariation matrix is designed via a certain combination of the local averages and the Hayashi-Yoshida estimator. Our method does not require any synchronization of the observation scheme (as e. g. previous tick method or <b>refreshing</b> <b>time</b> method) and it is robust to some dependence structure of the noise process. We show the associated central limit theorem for the proposed estimator and provide a feasible asymptotic result.

5000|$|The maximum time {{interval}} between refresh operations is standardized by JEDEC for each DRAM technology, and is {{specified in the}} manufacturer's chip specifications. It is usually {{in the range of}} milliseconds for DRAM and microseconds for eDRAM. For current (2012) DDR2 SDRAM chips it is 64 ms. [...] It depends on the ratio of charge stored in the memory cell capacitors to leakage currents. Despite the fact that the geometry of the capacitors has been shrinking with each new generation of memory chips, refresh times for DRAM have been improving; from 8 ms for 1M chips, 32 ms for 16M chips, to 64 ms for 256M chips. This improvement is achieved partly by developing transistors that leak significantly less. Longer <b>refresh</b> <b>time</b> means a smaller fraction of the device's time is occupied with refresh, leaving more time for memory accesses. Although refresh overhead occupied up to 10% of chip time in earlier DRAMs, in modern chips this fraction is less than 1%. Because the leakage currents in semiconductors increase with temperature, refresh times must be decreased at high temperature. The current generation of DDR2 SDRAM chips has a temperature-compensated refresh structure; refresh cycle time must be halved when chip case temperature exceeds 85 C.|$|E

Thus when the pilots were instructed to turn right to a heading of 046 maintaining 2,000 ft, to capture the Localizer for the ILS to runway 5, out of habit or possibly due to the approach chart the captain initiated a left turn to a heading of 046. The First officer was distracted during the turn and did not notice for a while that the aircraft was turning left, when he did notice, he told the captain he was turning the wrong way, and the captain questioned the controller over which way they needed to turn, to which the controller confirmed they were to turn right, a confusing conversation took place over which way to turn, with the controller not having a clear picture over what the flight was doing due the Medan radar system having a <b>refresh</b> <b>time</b> of 12 seconds.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the patrolling of an {{environment}} {{with the aid of a}} team of autonomous agents.

As performance criteria, the <b>refresh</b> <b>time</b> and the latency are considered, i. e., respectively, time gap between any two visits of the same region and the time necessary to inform every agent about an event occurred in the environment. We associate a graph with the environment, and we study separately the case of a chain, tree, and cyclic graph. For the case of chain graph, we first describe a minimum <b>refresh</b> <b>time</b> and latency team trajectory and propose a polynomial time algorithm for its computation. Then, we describe a distributed procedure that steers the robots toward an optimal trajectory. For the case of tree graph, a polynomial time algorithm is developed for the minimum <b>refresh</b> <b>time</b> problem, under the technical assumption of a constant number of robots involved in the patrolling task. Finally, we show that the design of a minimum <b>refresh</b> <b>time</b> trajectory for a cyclic graph is NP-hard, and we develop a constant factor approximation algorithm...|$|E
