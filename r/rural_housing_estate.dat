40|$|Human-induced {{land use}} changes, {{including}} deforestation, agricultural encroachment and urbanisation, have caused widespread {{change in the}} global distribution of organisms and caused considerable declines in biodiversity through loss of habitat. Oil palm {{is one of the}} most rapidly expanding crops in Southeast Asia, but the impact of this crop on mosquito distribution, behaviour and exposure potential has been poorly explored. Understanding these factors is essential for developing, optimising and evaluating novel control measures aimed at reducing disease-transmission. This thesis explored the effect of land use change along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (primary forest, disturbed forest, highly disturbed forest, oil palm plantations and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates)</b> in Sabah, Malaysia. The community composition of anthropogenic mosquitoes was separated across land use, with the biggest difference seen between primary forest and oil palm plantations. This was largely driven by medically important mosquitoes attracted to oil palm plantations. Differences in community composition were also seen in areas of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in comparison to primary and disturbed forest sites, due to a high presence of the dengue vector, Stegomyia albopicta, in housing areas. A higher abundance of anopheline vectors were found landing on humans in the disturbed forest and oil palm plantations then primary forest. This thesis found no difference between highly disturbed forest and oil palm plantation sites. This thesis also investigated the host-seeking behaviour of simian malaria vectors, by carrying out human landing catches at ground and canopy level across land use. Results demonstrated the potential ability of one of the vectors, Anopheles balabacensis, to transmit the simian malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi) between canopy-dwelling simian hosts and ground-dwelling humans, and that anthropogenic disturbance increases the abundance of the disease vector. Finally, this thesis investigated the use of different marking methods and the need for an improved dispersal experiment to be carried out. Open Acces...|$|R

Waste biodegradability can be improved prior to microbial treatment. Wastewater flow is distributed into environmental multimedia, avoiding excessive load on single medium.

Phytoremediation can be conducted for polluted environment, preferably an integrated remediation – greening – compost use by which solid waste problems is partly solved. <b>Rural</b> area and <b>housing</b> <b>estate</b> of high income level in urban area are prioritized in phyto-assisted sanitation provision.

5|$|There was {{a lull in}} {{building}} after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of <b>rural</b> <b>estate</b> <b>houses.</b> Isolated examples included the houses designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937–39), which combined modern and traditional elements. The Second World War disrupted the occupation of <b>estate</b> <b>houses,</b> as they were used as wartime schools, barracks, evacuee housing and hospitals. After the war many were outdated, {{with a lack of}} electricity and modern plumbing. There was a shortage of live-in servants and the heavily taxed aristocracy were also unable to find the money to modernise and maintain large houses. The shortage of building materials in the post-war period also made <b>estate</b> <b>houses</b> valuable resources of stone. As a result, 200 of the 378 architecturally important <b>estate</b> <b>houses</b> have been demolished, were destroyed in the period after 1945, a higher proportion of the total than in England. Included in the destruction were works by Robert Adam, including Balbardie House and Hamilton Palace. One firm, Charles Brand of Dundee, demolished at least 56 country houses in Scotland in the 20 years between 1945 and 1965. The shortage of building materials further reduced the number of new large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for the earl of Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore. This period also saw considerable restoration of existing houses.|$|R

40|$|The thesis aims to {{introduce}} the problem of panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in the Czech Republic, to evaluate the development policy of these areas and to suggest the possibilities of transformation of Prague panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> {{in order to enhance}} quality of residential environment. In the Czech Republic lives a substantial part of the population in the panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> and their degradation is a real threat that could lead to the decline of entire cities. About 40 % of Prague's residents live in <b>housing</b> <b>estates,</b> which are an indispensable part of urban structure of the capital city, and therefore the thesis focuses on Prague's <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> Through a literature research the theoretical part deals in major with the circumstances of creation and specifics of Czech panel housing with focus on the Prague <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> The theoretical part concludes that the future of <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> will depend on the attitude of public authorities and its residents as we cannot rely on the fact that leaving <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> their own development will not lead to their degradation.

40|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>housing</b> land {{accounted}} for 67. 3 % of China's total construction land in 2000. While {{there are numerous}} studies analyzing the loss of arable land due to urban sprawl, less {{attention has been paid}} to the study of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land in China. This paper develops a theoretical framework for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China. It introduces a research method, which is using the spatial differentiation in regional development for compensating the deficiencies in time-series data, to analyze the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in the Transect of the Yangtse River (TYR). Detailed land-use data and socio-economic data from both research institutes and government departments were used to test the following hypothesis on <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition. We assume that <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in every region will undergo specific stages the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land will decline gradually with the development of the local economy, and the end of the transition corresponds to a new equilibrium between <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> and other construction activities. Five regional types of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change were defined according to an aggregation index used to reflect landscape patterns. The outcomes indicated that the share of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land declines gradually from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Yangtse River, i. e. from Ganzi-Yushu to Luzhou-Diqing, Enshi-Chongqing, Tongling-Yichang and to Shanghai-Chaohu. Each region is in a different phase of the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition, which corresponds to a particular socio-economic developmental level. Finally, some policy implications were discussed by applying this research to land management issues. The authors argue that there are problems in the current <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land managerial system in China, and that the Central Government needs to define uniform regulations for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> according to regional socio-economic developmental level, physical conditions and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition phase...|$|R
