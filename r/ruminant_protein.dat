5000|$|Prions {{appear to}} be most {{infectious}} when {{in direct contact with}} affected tissues. For example, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been transmitted to patients taking injections of growth hormone harvested from human pituitary glands, from cadaver dura allografts and from instruments used for brain surgery (Brown, 2000) (prions can survive the [...] "autoclave" [...] sterilization process used for most surgical instruments). It is also believed that dietary consumption of affected animals can cause prions to accumulate slowly, especially when cannibalism or similar practices allow the proteins to accumulate over more than one generation. An example is kuru, which reached epidemic proportions in the mid-20th century in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea, who used to consume their dead as a funerary ritual.

40|$|Due to {{the widely}} {{supported}} theory of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) spread in cattle by contaminated animal feeds, screening of feed products has become essential. For many years, manufacturers have used blood and plasma proteins as high quality ingredients of foods for both pets and farm animals. However, in Europe, the Commission Regulation 1234 / 2003 /EC temporally bans the use of processed animal proteins, including blood-derivative products, in feedstuffs for all farm animals which are fattened or bred {{for the production of}} food. This regulation has some exceptions, {{such as the use of}} non ruminant blood products into the feed of farm fish. Authorization of the re-introduction of these proteins into animal feed formulations, especially non <b>ruminant</b> <b>proteins</b> into the feed for non ruminant farm animals, is expected when adequate control methods to discriminate <b>ruminant</b> <b>proteins</b> exist. Currently, the number of validated methods to differentiate the species of origin for most of the animal by-products is limited. Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay, which allows detection of bovine or porcine specific mitochondrial DNAfrom spray-dried blood derivate products (plasma, whole blood and red cells), as a marker for bovine contamination in porcine products. Sample extracts, suitable for PCR, were easily and quickly obtained with the commercial PrepManTM Ultra reagent (Applied Biosystems). To confirm the porcine origin of the samples, primers targeting a specific region of 134 bp of the porcine cytochrome b coding sequence were designed (cytbporc 1 -F and cytbporc 2 -R). Previously published PCR primers (L 8129 and H 8357), specific for a 271 bp fragment of the bovine mitochondrial ATPase 8 -ATPase 6 genes, were chosen to accomplish amplification of bovine DNA. The limit of detection (LOD) of the bovine PCR assay was at least of 0. 05 % (v/v) of bovine inclusion in spray-dried porcine plasma or red cells fraction. In dried whole blood samples, sensitivity of the method was found to be at least of 0. 1 % (v/v). Since the method described here exhibits high specificity and sensitivity and it is rapid, simple and consistent, it could be successfully utilized as a routine control assay to evaluate the presence of bovine materials in spray-dried blood products...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{are discussing}} {{the possibility that}} ruminants are able to absorb peptides across the forestomach epithelia into the blood. As a possible transport-model a proton-coupled peptide transport-mechanism, {{as it is known}} in enterocytes in the intestine was adopted. Peptide absorption across forestomach epithelia would have considerable consequences for the understanding of <b>ruminant</b> <b>protein</b> supply, which is so far based on the availability of protein in the small intestine. In this work, ruminal and omasal epithelia of sheep were examined using the Ussing-chamber technique and measuring the intracellular pH on isolated rumen cells. The following results were obtained: 1. The transepithelial active transport of peptides in the intestine is connected to a transfer of electric charges and therefore induces in vitro an increase in the shortcircuit-current. No increase could be noticed after adding peptides and peptidomimetics. 2. The determination of net transport from unidirectional transport rates of radiolabled Peptides yielded in negative value for the rumen according to a secretory process. 3. A tertiary active transport process would be inhibited by the addition of Ouabain on the serosal side. No decrease of the transport rates of peptide was detected. 4. Addition of Mannitol (rises paracellular conductivity) to the mucosal side clearly increased transport of peptides in both directions. 5. In enterocytes proton-peptide co-transport leads to a deacrease of the intracellular pH when peptides are absorbed. However, measurements in isolated cells of rumen, did not result in a decrease of the intracellular pH after adding peptides to the surrounding media. On the basis of these results an active mechanism for luminal peptide absoption can be excluded. The peptide movements are very likely of passive, paracellular nature. Extrapolations of the transport rates to the whole forestomach surface led to the conclusion that (passive) transport of peptides is of no physiological relevance. <br...|$|E
40|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, {{caused by a}} prion, that mainly affects cattle. Other ruminant species, cats and humans are occasionally affected; this disease is called feline {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (FSE) in cats, and variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. BSE {{is a relatively new}} disease that was first reported in the United Kingdom in the 1980 s. It is spread by ingestion; animals or humans become infected when they eat prion-containing tissues from an infected animal. Cooking and standard disinfection procedures do not destroy this agent. Infected animals or people do not become ill for years; however, the disease is always progressive and fatal once the symptoms develop. The origins of BSE are unknown; however, the recycling of <b>ruminant</b> <b>proteins</b> in <b>ruminant</b> feed amplified this prion and caused an explosive epidemic in the U. K in the 1980 s and 1990 s. This epidemic peaked in 1992, with almost 1, 000 new cases diagnosed each week, but has subsided as the result of control measures. BSE also spread to many European countries, North America, parts of Asia and possibly other areas of the world. The prevalence of disease varies widely between nations. As o...|$|R

40|$|BSE is a fatal {{disease in}} cattle that {{involves}} spongiform {{changes to the}} brain. The disease is caused by infectious proteins, prions. The administration of feed containing proteins manufactured from infected cattle can infect more cattle. For that reason the administration of feed containing animal <b>proteins</b> to <b>ruminants</b> and other livestock has been banned within the European Union (EU) since 2001. In its statutory provisions Germany went even further. Besides the feed ban for animal proteins under EU law, the administration of fat from the tissue of warm-blooded land animals and of fish {{as well as of}} mixed feed containing individual feed of this kind, to horses and other food-producing livestock is likewise prohibited in national law. This ban does not apply to the administration of fats from fish tissue to non-ruminants. What prompted this special path of the Germans are the results of studies which show that animal fats may also be involved in the onset of BSE. Furthermore, with the current customary slaughter techniques {{it is not possible to}} obtain fats that are free of nerve tissue. Under certain circumstances, this nerve tissue may contain infectious prions that are not detected by the BSE rapid test. FLI and BfR urgently recommend the consistent prevention of the intra-species recycling of certain processed fats in order to rule out as far as possible the risk of recirculation of the BSE pathogen in animal stocks.

40|$|Genomics {{experiments}} are widely acknowledged {{to produce a}} huge amount of data to be analysed. The challenge is to extract meaningful biological context for proteins or genes which is currently difficult {{because of the lack of}} an integrative workflow that hinders the efficiency and the robustness of data mining performed by biologists working on ruminants. Thus, we designed ProteINSIDE, a free web service (www. proteinside. org) that (I) provides an overview of the biological information stored in public databases or provided by annotations according to the Gene Ontology, (II) predicts proteins that are secreted to search for proteins that mediate signalisation between cells or tissues, and (III) analyses protein-protein interactions to identify proteins contributing to a process or to visualize functional pathways. Using lists of proteins or genes as a unique input, ProteINSIDE is an original all-in-one tool that merges data from these searches to present a fast overview and integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic data from Bovine, Ovine, Caprine, Human, Rat, and Murine species. ProteINSIDE was bench tested with 1000 proteins identifiers from each species by comparison with DAVID, BioMyn, AgBase, PrediSi, and Phobius. Compared to DAVID or BioMyn, identifications and annotations provided by ProteINSIDE were similar from monogastric proteins but more numerous and relevant for <b>ruminants</b> <b>proteins.</b> ProteINSIDE, thanks to SignalP, listed less proteins potentially secreted with a signal peptide than PrediSi and Phobius, in agreement with the low false positive rate of SignalP. In addition ProteINSIDE is the only resource that predicts proteins secreted by cellular processes that do not involve a signal peptide. Lastly, we reported the usefulness of ProteINSIDE to bring new biological hypotheses of research from proteomics data: the biological meaning of the uptake of adiponectin by the foetal muscle and a role for autophagy during ontogenesis of adipose and muscle tissues...|$|R

The rationale is that transamination and deamination enzymes, involved inamino acid metabolism are likely to preferentially convert amino groups containing 14 N over 15 N. However, in ruminants thecontribution of rumen bacterial metabolism relative to animal tissues metabolism to naturally enrich animal proteins in terms of 15 N has been not assessed yet. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the impact of rumen and digestion processes on therelationship between Δ 15 Nanimal-diet and efficiency of N utilization for milk protein yield (milk N efficiency (MNE); milk N yield/Nintake) as well as the relationship between the 15 N natural abundance of rumen bacteria and the efficiency of N use at the rumenlevel. Solid- and liquid-associated rumen bacteria, duodenal digesta, feces and plasma proteins were obtained (n = 16) from fourlactating Holstein cows fed four different diets formulated at two metabolizable protein supplies (80 % v. 110 % of proteinrequirements) crossed by two different dietary energy source (diets rich in starch v. fiber). We measured the isotopic N fractionationbetween animal and diet (Δ 15 Nanimal-diet) in these different body pools. The Δ 15 Nanimal-diet was negatively correlated with MNEwhen measured in solid-associated rumen bacteria, duodenal digesta, feces and plasma proteins, with the strongest correlationfound for the latter. However, our results showed a very weak 15 N enrichment of duodenal digesta (Δ 15 Nduodenal digesta-diet meanvalue = 0. 42) compared with that observed in plasma proteins (Δ 15 Nplasma protein-diet mean value = 2. 41). These data support theidea that most of the isotopic N fractionation observed in <b>ruminant</b> <b>proteins</b> (Δ 15 Nplasma protein-diet) has a metabolic origin with verylittle direct impact of the overall digestion process on the existing relationship between Δ 15 Nplasma protein-diet and MNE. The 15 Nnatural abundance of rumen bacteria was not related to either rumen N efficiency (microbial N/available N) or digestive Nefficiency (metabolizable protein supply/CP intake), but showing a modest positive correlation with rumen ammonia concentration. When using diets not exceeding recommended protein levels, the contribution of rumen bacteria and digestion to the isotopic Nfractionation between animal proteins and diet is low. In our conditions, most of the isotopic N fractionation (Δ 15 Nplasma protein-diet) could have a metabolic origin, but more studies are warranted to confirm this point with different diets and approaches...|$|R

RESULTS Protein type (PT) influenced solubility after addition of condensed tannins (P < 0. 001) in the order: Rubisco < rapeseed < BSA (P < 0. 05). The type of condensed tannin (CT) affected protein solubility (P = 0. 001) with a CT × PT interaction (P = 0. 001). Mean degree of polymerisation, proportions of cis- versus trans-flavanol subunits or prodelphinidins versus procyanidins among CTs could not explain precipitation capacities. Increasing tannin concentration decreased protein solubility (P < 0. 001) with a PT × CT concentration interaction. The proportion of low-molecular weight rapeseed proteins remaining in solution increased with CT concentration but not with Rubisco. CONCLUSIONS Results {{of this study suggest that}} PT and CT type are both of importance for protein precipitation but that the CT structures investigated did not allow identification of parameters that contribute most to precipitation.

The acid and neutral detergent insoluble in nitrogen ranged from 1 to 2 % and 4 to 5 %, respectively. The lipid content of canola meal samples ranged from 2 % (CMBN, CMBJ) to 14 % (CPCM). In vitro, dry matter disappearance of CMBJ was higher than that of other types of CM at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h. Gas production from CMBJ was greater than that of CPCM and CMBN at 24 h and 48 h of incubation. CPCM produced lower methane than CMBJ at 48 h of incubation. CPCM produced a higher (p < 0. 05) molar proportion of propionate from 12 h to 48 h of incubation. In conclusion, this study found that CPCM could be a good source of protein (mainly PB 2) and lipids in the feed of ruminants; it will decrease methane production and enhance propionate production. There was correlation between less methane production, and the content of lipids and PB 2 in the three types of CM studied...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>ruminant</b> {{acute phase}} <b>proteins</b> (APPs), {{haptoglobin}} (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA), were evaluated as serum biomarkers (BMs) for sheep scab–a highly contagious ectoparasitic disease {{caused by the}} mite Psoroptes ovis, which is a major welfare and production threat worldwide. The levels of both APPs increased in serum following experimental infestation of sheep with P. ovis, becoming statistically significantly elevated from pre-infestation levels at 4 weeks post-infestation. Following successful treatment of infested sheep with an endectocide, Hp and SAA serum levels declined rapidly, with half lives of less than 3 days. In contrast, serum IgG levels which specifically bound the P. ovis-derived diagnostic antigen Pso o 2 had a half-life of 56 days. Taking into account pre-infestation serum levels, rapidity of response to infestation and test sensitivity at the estimated optimum cut-off values, SAA was the more discriminatory marker. These studies illustrated the potential of SAA and Hp to indicate current sheep scab infestation status and to augment the existing Pso o 2 serological assay to give disease-specific indications of both infestation and successful treatment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this review is to give an {{overview}} of our current knowledge on the polymorphisms occurring in genes coding for milk proteins and responsible for quantitative variability in their expression, thus influencing the protein composition of livestock ruminant milk. The overall genomic organisation of the 6 main <b>ruminant</b> milk <b>protein</b> genes: α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and the four caseins (α_ s 1, α_ s 2, β and κ), their chromosomal location and their expression pattern are first summarised before presenting general mechanisms controlling gene expression both at the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels. Polymorphisms found in cis-regulatory elements, mainly within the 5 '-flanking region of the genes encoding β-lactoglobulin and α_ s 1 - and α_ s 2 -caseins, have been found, in cattle, to influence their transcription rate. In addition, polymorphisms found in the transcription unit, within intron as well as exon sequences, {{have been shown to}} be responsible for defects in the processing of primary transcripts and/or the export of messenger RNA to the cytoplasm. Mutations responsible for the occurrence of premature stop codons in α_ s 1 - and β-casein mRNAs {{have been shown to be}} associated both with a decrease in the level of the relevant transcripts and the existence of multiple forms of messengers due to alternative splicing (exon skipping, usage of cryptic splice sites). Such a situation, well-exemplified by the gene encoding α_ s 1 -casein in the goat, may have dramatic biological consequences (secretion pathway, casein micelle structure, fat content, etc.) by modifying the message and accordingly the primary structure of the protein as well as its expression. Since some of these polymorphisms dramatically affect technological properties of milk, including cheese yields and organoleptic characteristics, methods mainly based on the PCR technique have been designed and applied in selection and breeding programmes to improve milk protein quality...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSheep milk is an {{excellent}} raw material for the milk processing industry especially in cheese production. The protein content and composition of sheep milk are important in the cheese manufacturing. The casein fraction of <b>ruminant</b> milk <b>proteins</b> consists of four caseins, namely αs 1, αs 2, β and κ-Casein. Casein genetic polymorphisms are important due to their effects on quantitative traits and technological properties of milk. This study aimed to detect the genetic polymorphism of αs 1 - and αs 2 -Casein genes in three native Egyptian sheep breeds; Rahmani, Barki and Ossimi. PCR-SSCP and PCR-RFLP were used to detect the genetic polymorphism of αs 1 -CN and αs 2 -CN genes, respectively. A 223 -bp fragment of αs 1 -CN gene was amplified by PCR and SSCP results recorded the presence of three different patterns; TT, TC and CC; in 87 tested sheep animals. The sequence analysis of two homologous patterns showed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (T→C) at position 170. The frequencies of three patterns in the tested sheep breeds were 43. 33 %, 50. 00 %, and 6. 67 % in Rahmani; 83. 33 %, 13. 33 %, and 3. 33 % in Ossimi and 74. 07 %, 22. 22 %, and 3. 70 % in Barki, respectively. Our nucleotide sequences of αs 1 -CN T and C alleles were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers KF 018339 and KF 018340, respectively. The restriction digestion of αs 2 -CN PCR product (1300 -bp) by Tru 1 I endonuclease revealed three different genotypes; AA, AG and GG with frequencies of 66. 67 %, 30. 00 %, and 3. 33 % in Rahmani; 96. 67 %, 3. 33 %, and 0. 00 % in Ossimi and 96. 15 %, 3. 85 %, and 0. 00 % in Barki, respectively. The sequence analysis revealed {{the presence of a}} single nucleotide polymorphism (A→G) in intron 6 of αs 2 -CN gene. Our nucleotide sequence of αs 2 -CN gene was submitted to GenBank with the accession number JX 080380...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the demand}} on {{agriculture}} to produce food could double by 2050, changing diets will expand the global demand for protein even faster. Canadian livestock producers will likely expand {{in response to}} this market opportunity. Because of the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from animal protein production, the portion of this protein demand that can be met by pulse crops must be considered. The protein basis for GHG emission intensity was assessed for 2006 using a multi-commodity GHG emissions inventory model. Because arable land is required for other agricultural products, protein production and GHG emissions were also assessed {{on the basis of the}} land use. GHG emissions per unit of protein are one or two orders of magnitude higher for protein from livestock, particularly <b>ruminants,</b> than for <b>protein</b> from pulses. The protein production from pulses was moderately higher per unit of land than the protein from livestock. This difference was greater when soybeans were the only pulse in the comparison. Protein from livestock, especially ruminants, resulted in much higher GHG emissions per unit of land than the protein from pulses. A shift towards more protein from pulses could assure a better global protein supply and reduce GHG emissions associated with that supply...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMonoclonal {{antibodies}} (mAbs) against secreted hemagglutinin (H) protein of {{rinderpest virus}} (RPV) expressed by a recombinant baculovirus were generated {{to characterize the}} antigenic sites on H protein and regions of functional significance. Three of the mAbs displayed hemagglutination inhibition activity and these mAbs were unable to neutralize virus infectivity. Western immunoblot analysis of overlapping deletion mutants indicated that three mAbs recognize antigenic regions at the extreme carboxy terminus (between amino acids 569 and 609) and the fourth mAb between amino acids 512 and 568. Using synthetic peptides, aa 569 – 577 and 575 – 583 were identified as the epitopes for E 2 G 4 and D 2 F 4, respectively. The epitopic domains of A 12 A 9 and E 2 B 6 mAbs were mapped to regions encompassing aa 527 – 554 and 588 – 609. Two epitopes spanning the extreme carboxy terminal region of aa 573 to 587 and 588 to 609 were shown to be immunodominant employing a competitive ELISA with polyclonal sera form vaccinated cattle.

40|$|BBS/E/EW/ 10964 A- 01 (Rumen Systems Biology ISPG) Increasing the rumen-stable {{protein content}} of feed {{would lead to}} {{improved}} nitrogen utilisation in cattle, and less nitrogenous waste. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a high <b>protein</b> <b>ruminant</b> feed containing high polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. PPO mediated protein-quinone binding {{has been linked to}} protecting plant proteins from proteolysis. To explore the mechanism underlying the effect of PPO on protein protection in fresh forage feeds, proteomic components of feed down-boli produced from wild-type red clover and a low PPO mutant, at point of ingestion and after 4 h in vitro incubation with rumen inoculum were analysed. Significant differences in proteomic profiles between wild-type and mutant red clover were determined after 4 h incubation, with over 50 % less spots in mutant than wild-type proteomes, indicating decreased proteolysis in the latter. Protein identifications revealed preferentially retained proteins localised within the chloroplast, suggesting that PPO mediated protection in the wild-type operates due to the proximity of target proteins to the enzyme and substrates, either diffusing into this compartment from the vacuole or are present in the chloroplast. This increased understanding of protein targets of PPO indicates that wider exploitation of the trait could contribute to increased protein use efficiency in grazing cattle. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the {{extraction}} {{process of the}} vegetable soy oils and sun-flower oils results in large quantities a waste that contains approximately 45 % fat from which 58 % is lecithin. This waste called “dreg” creates problems of environment pollution because we didn’t find a use for it. We tested this waste in the food of small ruminants, at sheep and goat, watching the ruminant effect and the apparent digestibility of the nutritive substances in the food. The tested doses of “dregs” were of 100 g and 200 g per day. The food supplementation in sheep and goats with dregs up to 7 % fat in the dry substance of the ration has favourable and proportional effects with the dose of fat on the digestibility of the nutritive substances from the food. The growth of ruminant bacteria is favoured at the 100 g dose of dregs but is depressed at the 200 g dose of dregs. On the ruminant protozoa the supplementation with fat from dregs leads to the reducing {{of the number of}} protozoa and even at defaunation.

40|$|Silage {{quality is}} {{typically}} {{assessed by the}} measurement of several individual parameters, including pH, lactic acid, acetic acid, bacterial numbers, and protein content. The objective {{of this study was}} to use a holistic metabolic fingerprinting approach, combining a high-throughput microtiter plate-based fermentation system with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, to obtain a snapshot of the sample metabolome (typically low-molecular-weight compounds) at a given time. The aim was to study the dynamics of red clover or grass silage fermentations in response to various inoculants incorporating lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The hyperspectral multivariate datasets generated by FT-IR spectroscopy are difficult to interpret visually, so chemometrics methods were used to deconvolute the data. Two-phase principal component-discriminant function analysis allowed discrimination between herbage types and different LAB inoculants and modeling of fermentation dynamics over time. Further analysis of FT-IR spectra by the use of genetic algorithms to identify the underlying biochemical differences between treatments revealed that the amide I and amide II regions (wavenumbers of 1, 550 to 1, 750 cm � 1) of the spectra were most frequently selected (reflecting changes in proteins and free amino acids) in comparisons between control and inoculant-treated fermentations. This corresponds to the known importance of rapid fermentation for the efficient conservation of forage <b>proteins.</b> <b>Ruminant</b> animal production in the United Kingdom relie...|$|R
