25|$|The United Kingdom and New Zealand until {{recently}} shared an FM broadcasting allocation of 88.0 – 105.0MHz. This smaller allocation (less than 20MHz , typical of FM {{in the rest}} of the world) can be traced to the 405 line system's VHF allocation block. The UK adopted the 405 line system but NZ did not. NZ's allocation for FM remained smaller as if NZ had adopted the 405 line system. New Zealand considered adopting the 405 line system in the late 1950s to early 1960s but adopted PAL instead. This impacted the frequency allocation block for FM broadcasting making it smaller. New Zealand's FM frequency allocation issue was not fixed until the late 1990s, when the band was expanded to the full 20MHz. Both New Zealand and the United Kingdom have the standard global allocation of 88.0 – 108.0 for FM now. NZ permits <b>Radio</b> <b>Data</b> <b>System</b> subcarriers, but their adoption is not universal. Radio NZ uses RDS for its FM network, but commercial radio's adoption of the technology is not universal.|$|E
25|$|The device {{featured}} a small 1.55inch multi-touch screen {{with a lower}} resolution of 240×240 pixels but a higher pixel density of 220 pixels per inch, as opposed to the larger 2.2inch screen on the fifth-generation iPod Nano. The device had a 0.39 watt-hour battery rated at 3.7 volts, giving a capacity of 105 mAh, and specified to give 24 hours of music playback on a single full charge. The device took about three hours for one full charge. The device retained the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. This Nano lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder microphone (although plugging in headphones with a built in microphone revealed a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It also lost support for video playback, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) could be synced onto the device, and the audio from them would play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen. It still included the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an FM radio tuner with RDS (<b>Radio</b> <b>Data</b> <b>System).</b> It had a black on white screen contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod Nano had the same price point as the 5th generation device.|$|E

In the music section, users can add songs to a quick playlist without reconnecting to the desktop software.

In the radio section, users can receive and play FM radio internally, with North American, Japanese, and European tuning ranges, and display <b>Radio</b> <b>Data</b> <b>System</b> information (usually artist and song) when available. When artist/song information are available, the device can search for the song in the Zune Marketplace for download or purchase.

40|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Systems</b> was {{development}} started 20 {{years ago}} in the European Broadcast Union, EBU. The developers aimed to ease the process of tuning in to a station, especially as the number of broadcasters was increasing and use of alternative frequencies to avoid interference would make it difficult to keep tuned to a certain station. The use of RDS would overcome this problem and will also enable the transmission of the Programme Service name (PS), traffic information and other useful features which will make the FM receivers more userfriendly. University College London has got its own radio station, RARE FM, which requires an RDS encoder to enable them to transmit the name of the station. Commercial RDS encoders are relatively expensive and complex and they need a dedicated PC and network connection to enable the other features such as traffic information, which is not required by Rare FM. The purpose of this project is to build an isolated RDS encoder which will not need a PC and is simple enough to be used by a non-technical person in the station. Some work has already been done last year to develop the encoder using analogue techniques. However any changes to the station name will require modification of components and switches and valid data has not been prepared for encoding and modulation alongside the F...|$|R
