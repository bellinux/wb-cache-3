Despite pledging to stay at Leicester during pre-season, Izzet handed in a transfer request in autumn of 2001, prior to the club's relegation, but he rejected a move to Middlesbrough as {{he did not want}} to be seen to be [...] "jumping ship". He did issue a plea to O'Neill, who was now manager of Scottish Premier League side Celtic, to sign him in May 2002, remarking that [...] "only an idiot wouldn't consider joining Celtic." [...] Following their relegation at the end of the 2001-02 season, Izzet was again strongly touted for a move to Boro. However, Leicester insisted they would not accept a <b>reduced</b> <b>offer</b> from Middlesbrough for Izzet, who was priced at £6 million, and no deal came to fruition. He withdrew his transfer request in March 2003, after the club achieved automatic promotion by finishing in second place. In January 2004, Leicester rejected £500,000 bids from Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers for Izzet. At the end of the 2003-04 season, Leicester were again relegated. Unable to afford Izzet's £30,000 per week wages, the club admitted he was leaving.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), a legal framework intended to increase transparency and accountability of listed companies, on the cost of going public in the US. We expect SOX to increase the direct cost of going public, but decrease the underpricing because of reduced asymmetric information. Our main results corroborate these hypotheses. First, we find an increase in the cost of going public of 90 bp of gross proceeds. Second, we record a reduction in underpricing of 6 pp, which is related to a <b>reduced</b> <b>offer</b> price adjustment. This supports our hypothesis that SOX represents a mechanism to reduce asymmetric information.|$|E

At the present time, digital entertainment industry renewal has fostered the development of low cost devices for virtual reality.

40|$|The new {{interest}} in density displayed by professional town planners and town-planning researchers {{is related to the}} present densification of the urban environment in many towns and cities. Research on densification is primarily concerned with the link between urban form and sustainable development. The point of departure of this thesis is to consider what a denser housing environment will mean to people in their everyday lives and the main purpose is to discuss the significance of spaciousness to open space quality in multi-family housing. The empirical investigation was performed as a case-study with six cases. Three cases involve housing of low to medium density built during the urban building explosion of the 1960 s known as “the Swedish million-program era”. They are typical of post-war multi-family housing with three-storey slab blocks. The other three cases are of higher density and were completed during the early 1990 s. These housing developments have a more traditional block structure. The significance of density is discussed in relation to the four different functions or “roles” of open space that appeared in interviews with tenants : the yard as open space close to the house and the home; the yard as a meeting place; the yard as a place for children’s play; and the yard as a place to get aesthetic experiences and contact with nature. These four roles constitute four different contexts for the significance of spaciousness. The significance of spaciousness stands out mainly in connection with the so-called active use of the courtyards. The scope of space becomes important in the on–site use, when the inhabitants are in the yards, especially when the yards are used for children’s play. The importance of space is more complex in relation to other aspects of outdoor pleasure. I maintain that the smaller courtyards from the 1990 s offer their residents a lesser degree of potential use than the more spacious ones do. The less spacious courtyards I will call a <b>reduced</b> <b>offer</b> in comparison to the model of “folkhemsgården” (a green yard as a self-evident aspect of housing {{in the construction of the}} welfare society), that is introduced in the discussion. The planners, architects and landscape architects of the housing developments of the 1990 s had no common image of how to handle the spatial demands of outdoor environments close to home. When considering the small courtyard as a design assignment, it becomes clear that models that contains a vision about everyday life are needed...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} reinforcement contingencies on {{the rates of}} offers to share and their corresponding rates of acceptance by two small groups of preschool children were investigated in two experiments. In the first experiment, food and praise were given after a 5 -min play period to any subject who had made one or more offers to share during the play period. This procedure increased the rate of share-offers by all subjects. However, as share-offers increased, the percentage of offers accepted decreased. In the second experiment, reinforcement was made contingent on a subject <b>reducing</b> <b>offers</b> to share to {{only one or two}} per 5 -min period.

40|$|Pre-offer {{target stock}} price runups are {{traditionally}} {{viewed as a}} consequence of market an-ticipation of the pending bid. Under this view, the runup should not impact the bid process. However, based on linear cross-sectional projections of offer premiums on runups, Schwert (1996) concludes that a dollar increase in the runup is followed by a dollar markup of the premium (dubbed ”markup pricing”). Since markup pricing means ”paying twice ” if the target runup is in fact driven by rational market anticipation, his conclusion is puzzling. We resolve the puzzle by first proving that market anticipation implies a highly non-linear relation between expected premiums, markups and runups. We then present strong evidence of this non-linearity, which rejects markup pricing. Rational market anticipation further implies that bidder takeover gains will be increasing in the target runup, which our evidence also supports. Finally, we study bid-der open market purchases of target shares during the runup period. Such ”toehold ” purchases <b>reduce</b> <b>offer</b> premiums, further contradicting the existence of markup pricing...|$|R
