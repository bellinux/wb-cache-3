40|$|Asymmetric binary nanocrystals (BNCs), {{comprising}} one c-axis elongated anatase TiO 2 {{section and}} one gamma-Fe 2 O 3 spherical domain attached together, are synthesized by heterogeneous nucleation of iron oxide onto the longitudinal facets of TiO 2 nanorods in a ternary surfactant mixture. The topologically controlled {{composition of the}} BNCs is ascertained {{by a combination of}} powder X-ray diffraction, Raman and Mossbauer spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark-field imaging, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy lattice fringe mapping, while their size-dependent magnetic behavior is demonstrated by ac susceptibility measurements. The heteroepitaxial growth proceeds through a mechanism never observed before for colloidal nanoheterostructures: the two domains share a restricted and locally curved junction region, which accommodates efficiently the interfacial strain and retards the formation of misfit dislocations. It is believed that these BNCs, which combine the properties of two technologically relevant oxide materials, can pave the way to <b>reinforced</b> applications in <b>several</b> <b>fields</b> of nanoscience, such as in photocatalysis, in malignant cell treatments, and in nanocrystal assembly...|$|R
