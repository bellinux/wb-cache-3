[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Dönel hareket yapan sistemler, dengesiz yük olması durumunda dönmenin etkisi altında merkezkaç kuvvetine maruz kalırlar. Dengesizlik hali merkezkaç kuvvetlerinin etkisi ile çoğu zaman istenmeyen titreşimlere neden olur. Bu titreşimler ve merkezkaç kuvveti, gürültü ve enerji kaybı olarak kendini gösterirken, dönen sistemlerin yataklarının aşınmasına neden olmakta, sistemin çalışma ömrünü ve performansını azaltmaktadır. Tüm bunları kontrol etmek, düşük enerji tüketimi sağlayıp ürün kalitesini arttırmak ve dengesizliğin kabul edilebilir sınırları aşmamasını sağlamak için titreşim seviyelerinin kontrol altında tutulması için şarttır. Titreşimleri oluşturan en önemli parametrelerden biri olan dönel sistemlerdeki dengesizlik etkisi, turbo makinalarda, çamaşır makinalarında, makina tezgâhlarında ve elektrik motorlarında büyük önem taşır. Bu tez çalışmasında, makinalarda dengesizlik problemi ele alınmış, genel olarak dengeleme yöntemleri hakkında bilgi toplanmış ve tez konusu olan sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme hakkında kapsamlı bir literatür araştırması yapılmış, sıvı dengeleme halkaları ile dengeleme yapan sistemlerin çalışma prensibi incelenmiştir. Ardından, klasik dengeleme yöntemleri ve sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme konularında teorik bilgiler derlenmiş ve sunulmuştur. Söz konusu sıvı halkalı sistemlerin bir modelinin ortaya konması, analiz yönteminin geliştirilmesi ve sistemin {{optimize}} edilebilmesi için gerekli araçların geliştirilmesi amaçlanmıştır. Sıvılı dengeleme sistemleri, dönel bir sistemin üzerine yerleştirilen, ona bağlı olarak hareket eden, içi belli bir hacimsel oranda sıvı ile doldurulmuş olan halkanın içerisindeki sıvının, merkezkaç kuvveti etkisiyle dengesizliğin aksi yönünde konumlanması prensibi ile çalışan sistemlerdir. Halka içerisinde yer alan sıvı, sistemin dönme merkezini referans alarak konumlanır ve dengesizliğin karşı tarafında konumlanan sıvının meydana getirdiği merkezkaç kuvveti, dengesizliğin sebep olduğu merkezkaç kuvvetinin bir kısmını kompanse eder. Sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme, genellikle ilgilenilen frekans aralığında rijid olarak davranan, ancak izolasyon veya askı sistemleri nedeni ile makinanın çalışma hızının sistemin ilk doğal frekansının üzerinde olduğu durumlarda etkin olmaktadır. Bir başka deyişle, dengesizlikten kaynaklanan kuvvet ile deplasman cinsinden oluşan titreşimler arasında 180 o’lik bir faz farkı oluştuğu durumlarda sıvı halkalı dengeleme sistemleri kullanılabilmektedir. Belirtilen bu kısıta bağlı kalınmak üzere bu tez kapsamında sıvı dengeleme halkalarının tek ve çok katmanlı modelleri MATLAB ortamında oluşturulmuş ve bu modeller doğrultusunda bir analiz yöntemi geliştirilmiştir. Bu modellerde kullanılan temel yaklaşım, verilen bir dengesizlik ortamında halka veya halkalar içerisinde bulunan sıvının halka veya halkalar içinde nasıl konumlanacağının ve sıvının ters yönde yaratacağı dengeleme kuvvetlerinin belirlenmesidir. Bu prensibe dayanarak sistemin dengeleme kapasitesini belirlemek xiv mümkündür ve verilen bir dengesizlik durumu için sistemi optimize edecek araçlar bu tez kapsamında geliştirilmiştir. Dengeleme halkası tasarımında etkin olan parametreler ortaya konmuş, oluşturulan modeller kullanılarak sayısal simülasyonlar gerçekleştirilmiş, yapılan analizler ve optimizasyonlar çerçevesinde sonuçlar karşılaştırılmıştır. Sıvı halkalı dengeleme sistemi dengesizliği azaltmak için kullanılabilir ve bu sistemin görevini yapabilmesi için makinada net olarak bir miktar dengesizlik veya eksentrisite olması şarttır. Verilen bir titreşim seviyesi (eksantrisite) durumunda sıvının halka veya halkalar içindeki konumu iteratif bir yöntemle belirlenmiştir. Ancak, gerçek uygulamalarda titreşim seviyesi değil, sistemdeki olası dengesizlik miktarı bilinmekte ve pasif dengeleme sisteminin de bu koşulda analiz edilmesi gerekmektedir. Bu durum, analizler sırasında iterasyon döngüsü içinde başka bir iterasyon döngüsünü gerektirmektedir. Geliştirilen analiz yöntemi bu koşulda da sıvının konumunu ve pasif dengeleme sonucu titreşim seviyesinin ne kadar azaltılabileceğini belirleyebilmektedir. Rotating {{systems are}} exposed to centrifugal forces {{in the presence of}} an unbalance mass. This unbalanced state of machines often results in undesirable due to unbalanced centrifugal forces. Vibrations and unbalanced centrifugal forces usually lead to noise and energy loss, also causing bearings to wear down, and reducing the operating life and performance of the system. In order to ensure low energy consumption and high product quality, it is necessary to control the vibration levels and this in turn requires keeping the level of unbalance within an acceptable range. Unbalance in rotating systems, which appears to be the root cause of vibration, is of vital importance in turbomachinery, washing machines, machining tools, and electric motors. This thesis addresses the problem of vibration in rotating machinery and the use of liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems to reduce vibrations by passive means, aiming to provide a model for liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems, and to develop analysis methods in addition to tools for optimization of the liquid ring systems. General information has been gathered on balancing methods and an extensive literature survey has been conducted on passive balancing with emphasis on the use of liquid ring systems, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis. These are followed by theoretical information about conventional balancing methods and passive balancing systems using liquid rings. The operation of the liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems is based on the fact that liquid in a partially-filled tube mounted on a rotating system, is self-aligned in a direction opposite to the unbalance under the effect of centrifugal forces. As such, the system behaves like a counter mass and in order for the system to function properly, it is required that the ratio of the volume of the liquid to that of the tube must be smaller than one. Furthermore, the liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems are effective at frequencies higher than the natural frequency of the system. The liquid inside the balancing tube is positioned relative to the centre of rotation of the system. Thus, the centrifugal force caused by the liquid positioned on the opposite side of the unbalance compensates some of the centrifugal force caused by the unbalance itself. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the inner surface of the liquid to be vertically aligned and for the liquid to self-position itself. As its name implies, a liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> system has a hollow ring partially filled with fluid which can be fresh water, salty water, oil, glycerine and liquid mercury etc. Although, liquid mercury may appear to be the best candidate due to its high density, liquid mercury is known to be extremely hazardous and should not be used if there is a risk of leakage. Another candidate, oil, is not preferred either in some applications as it may cause contamination. Salty water is usually the preferred option because of the relatively higher density. The liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> system acts as a counter mass, positions the centre of mass of the liquid to the opposite side of the unbalance, thus reducing the net unbalance in the rotating system. The amount and distribution of the liquid is determined by rotating speed and the internal structure of the balancer. Passive <b>balancing</b> using liquid <b>ring</b> systems are efficient when the rotational speed of the machine is greater than the first natural frequency of the system. In other words, liquid ring balancers can be used in cases where there is a phase difference of 180 o between the forces caused by the unbalance and vibrations expressed in terms of displacement. Adhering to this constraint a model has been created for liquid ring balancers and an analysis method has been developed in accordance with this model. The basic approach adopted in this model is to determine the orientation of the liquid within the layer(s) and the balancing forces created by the liquid on the opposite side of the unbalance. It is then possible to estimate the balancing capacity of the system based on this principle and tools that will make it possible to optimize the system for a specific unbalance condition have been developed within the context of this thesis. The orientation(s) of the liquid within the layer(s) for a given vibration level (eccentricity) is/are determined using an iterative approach. However, in practice, it is the amount of unbalance in the system that is known, and not the vibration level, hence the passive balancing system should be analysed accordingly. This requires that another iteration to be used within the main iteration loop. The analysis method developed in this thesis is capable of estimating the orientation of the liquid and the amount of possible reduction in vibration levels when a passive balancing system is used. This allows estimating the balancing capacity of a given liquid balancing system. The tools developed in this thesis can also be used to optimize the balancing system for a specific unbalance condition. A computer code is developed in MATLAB to analyse the performance of singlelayer and multi-layer liquid/hydraulic balancers. The method and the tools developed in this thesis are then used to investigate the performance of a liquid balancing system installed on a sample machine, i. e. a washing machine. The effects of various parameters on the balancing capability of the liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems are investigated. From optimisation point of view, the parameters considered in this investigation are the number of layers, the volumetric ratio, density of the liquid, geometric properties of the ring section and the mass of the liquid inside the balancer. The results obtained from the analyses presented in this thesis suggest that (i) the volumetric ratio of a <b>balancing</b> <b>ring</b> is one of the most important parameter in passive balancing. Neither a very low nor a very high value of volumetric ratio can yield efficient balancing. Volumetric ratio being about 50 % appears to be optimum (ii) A liquid ring balancer with a single layer cannot yield high balancing efficiency, (iii) Multi-layered <b>balancing</b> <b>rings</b> provide better <b>balancing</b> capacity when the same amount of balancing liquid is used, (iv) Using more number of layers in liquid balancing increases the balancing efficiency, (v) Using more liquid mass can yield better balancing, but doing so brings its own disadvantages. Results also confirm that it is not possible to remove unbalance completely by using liquid <b>balancing</b> <b>rings.</b> In other words, for the liquid balancing system to function, it is necessary that there must be some unbalance or eccentricity in the machine. This means that the unbalance can be reduced, but it cannot be eliminated by using liquid <b>balancing</b> <b>rings.</b> It should also be stated here that the analysis method developed within the scope of this thesis can be used for preliminary design of single-layer or multi-layer passive <b>balancing</b> <b>rings</b> for rotating mechanical systems. Although the liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems are very effective in reducing the centrifugal force of the unbalance mass in steady state, it may increase the unbalance in transient state. Provisions such as orifices and obstructions can be made inside the tube for preventing unfavourable motions that may be caused by the liquid <b>ring</b> <b>balancing</b> systems. There are balancing systems comprising liquid <b>balancing</b> <b>rings</b> and spherical balls inside the liquid. It is recommended that the method developed within this thesis can be extended for such systems. Similarly, as a future work, a model can be developed for a system which consists of liquid <b>balancing</b> <b>ring</b> and a rotating mass inside the balancing liquid. In this thesis, it is assumed that during the steady state operation of a machine, the rotational speed of the system is high enough so that the acceleration experienced by the liquid is large compared to the gravitational acceleration. As a result, gravitation acceleration is ignored in the analyses here. However, it recommended that gravitational acceleration should be included in the analyses if the rotational speed is low or if the transient behaviour of the balancer is of interest during run-up. Finally, as another future work, it is recommended that to test a test rig should be developed for experimental investigation of liquid balancers as well as for validation of theoretical/numerical predictions.

The bristle flowmeter and the electromag-netic flowmeter are two such methods which are satisfactory in some circumstances; however, both require an open chest preparation and isolation of the aorta. More recently {{it has been suggested}} that if suitable restrictions are imposed on the Navier-Stokes equations, the axial aortic pressure gradient, Op/Ox, can be related approximately to the instantaneous blood velocity, u, by the equa-tion: Op du Ox P+dt+ 1) lumen and to present data that lend support to the validity of this assumption. THEORY If a pressure wave travels undistorted and without re-flection down an elastic tube, then the instantaneous pres-sure gradient, ap/lx, is related to the time derivative of pressure, Op/dt, at a point by 49 P 1 capOp _ lO Ox s t 2) where s is the pressure pulse wave velocity down the tube. Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1 gives: ap du = ps dt + asu. 3) where x is the axial coordinate of the tube, t is time, p is the blood density, and "a " is a "blood fric-tion " constant. This equation can be instantane-ously and continuously solved for u, the blood velocity, by simple analog computer technics if the pressure gradient, Op/Ox, is known (6, 7). The pressure gradient can be estimated by measuring the difference in lateral pressure between two points several centimeters apart along the aorta. This pressure difference may be obtained with a suitable double lumen catheter. Consequently, this method has a great advantage over previously described technics since it may be used in the intact animal or man. This method has the great disadvantage, how-ever, of requiring a large catheter (usually neces-sitating the sacrifice of an artery) and two exactly <b>balanced</b> <b>manometers.</b> Therefore, a modification permitting the use of a single catheter and a single manometer would be advantageous.

A further advantage of the vortex theory is that lift and induced drag coefficients are not required; estimated instantaneous values of these coefficients are generally too large for steady state aerodynamic theory to be appropriate to natural flapping flight. The vortex theory is applied to hovering of insects and to avian forward flight. A simple expression for induced power in hovering is found. Induced power is always greater than simple momentum jet estimates, and the dis-crepancy becomes substantial as body mass increases. In hovering the wake is composed of a stack of horizontal, coaxial, circular vortex rings. In forward flight of birds the rings are elliptic; they are neither horizontal nor coaxial because the momentum of each <b>ring</b> <b>balances</b> the vector sum of parasite and profile drag and the bird's weight. Total power consumption as a function of flight velocity is calculated and compared for several species. Power reduction {{is one of the major}} factors influencing the choice of flight style. A large body of data is used to obtain an approximate scaling between stroke period and the body mass for birds. Together with relations between other morphological parameters, this is used to estimate the variation of flight speed and power with body mass for birds, and on this basis deviations from allometric scaling can be related to flight proficiency and to the use of such strategies as the bounding flight of small passerines.
