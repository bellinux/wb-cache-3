500|$|Following the {{completion}} of principal photography, Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that Jordi Mollà {{was included in the}} cast and the names of several supporting characters. However, Mollà subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed and cut in the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a James Bond film, where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Mollà's character, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost [...] "like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn’t just connect to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts , which as a standalone thing was really cool." [...] Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as film editors. In March 2015, Hayley Atwell confirmed that she would reprise her role as Peggy Carter in the film.

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died.

[...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation.

500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations.

In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial.

40|$|Abstract — Given {{a subset}} of data that differs from the rest, a user often wants an {{explanation}} as to why this is the case. For instance, in a database of flights, a user may want to understand why certain flights were very late. This paper presents ESCAPE, a sequential covering algorithm designed to generate explanations of subsets that {{take the form of}} disjunctive normal rules describing the characteristics ({attribute, value} pairs) that differentiates the subsets from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the data. <b>Our</b> experiments demonstrate that ESCAPE discovers explanations that are both compact, in that just a few rules cover the subset, and specific, in that the rules cover the subset but not the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the data. <b>Our</b> experiments compare ESCAPE to RIPPER, a popular, traditional rule learning algorithm and show that ESCAPE’s rules yield better covering explanations. Further, ESCAPE was designed to be efficient, and we formally demonstrate that ESCAPE runs in loglinear time...|$|R

40|$|Because of its {{specific}} landscape and its vulnerable ecosystem, the Swiss Alpine region suffers {{a lot from}} transport-related pollution which is much higher per transport unit than in the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland. The intro-duction of a regionally differentiated transport pricing would reduce neg-ative impacts of transportation in the Alps. Applying SwissTRANS, a multi-sectoral general equilibrium model of Switzerland introducing both the Alpine region and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland, <b>our</b> results suggest that a change from the current pricing regime in transport towards a marginal social cost pricing scheme is beneficial for both the Alpine region and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland. However, concerns about regional environmental ef-ficiency provide little justification in terms of aggregate welfare for tax differentiation across Switzerland. Nevertheless tax differentiation does matter at the regional level suggesting that regional policies in terms of compensation policy instruments play a critical role...|$|R
