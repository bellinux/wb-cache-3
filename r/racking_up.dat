5|$|Forster had a {{successful}} 2011–12 season with Celtic, winning the Scottish Premier League and helping his team beat the previous season's record of 23 clean sheets. He and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster <b>racking</b> <b>up</b> 21 of them. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty {{in the final minute}} of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, pulled off an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick to secure three important points for Celtic. In total, he kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{had come}} to regret his trade of Urban Shocker to the Browns. In St. Louis, the spitballer Shocker had come into his own as a starter, <b>racking</b> <b>up</b> four {{straight}} 20-win seasons in the years 1920-23 and leading the American League with 27 wins in 1921 and strikeouts the following year, when he won 24 games. Shocker was reacquired for Bullet Joe Bush, Milt Gaston and Joe Giard in December 1924.|$|E
5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for a new coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, <b>racking</b> <b>up</b> 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E

5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion <b>racking</b> <b>up</b> a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E

25|$|One month later, Schottenheimer {{was fired}} by San Diego, ending his 21-year {{coaching}} career. His 14–2 season with the Chargers was his best regular season record ever, {{and he is the}} only coach in NFL history to be fired after <b>racking</b> <b>up</b> 14 wins.|$|E

25|$|Before the game, Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson famously {{guaranteed}} {{that his team}} would win, and his team did not disappoint.

25|$|The strong {{participation}} by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved {{on a shoestring}} budget with the automaker <b>racking</b> <b>up</b> a respectable number of points against its giant competitors.
