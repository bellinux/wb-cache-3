Requests for tender for studies on major sub-components were also issued in 1970, and these were completed by mid-1971.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1982season (with Debby), the Hurricane Hunter Aircraft (also {{known as}} P-3s) began running a new mission for NOAA's Hurricane <b>Research</b> <b>Division.</b> The {{mission was to}} drop dropwindsondes that {{deployed}} very-low Omega frequency signals.

5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational <b>research</b> <b>division</b> attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E

5|$|On September6, ships {{reported}} a tropical depression developing {{just off the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal. The next day, a ship reported winds of 60mph (95km/h), or tropical storm status; on this basis, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on September6. However, lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On September10, the S.S. Commack first observed the storm about 900miles (1450km) to the east of Guadeloupe, which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio. Later that day, two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm, and the Hurricane <b>Research</b> <b>Division</b> estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00UTC on September10.|$|E
5|$|When Oppenheimer reorganized the {{laboratory}} in August 1944 {{to focus on}} the development of an implosion-type nuclear weapon, Wilson became head of R (<b>Research)</b> <b>Division.</b> As such he had four groups reporting to him: the Cyclotron Group (R-1), still headed by himself; the Electrostatic Group (R-2), headed by John H. Williams; the D-D (Deuterium-Deuterium) Group (R-3), headed by John H. Manley; and the Radioactivity Group (R-4), headed by Emilio G. Segrè. In March 1945, R Division acquired the additional responsibility of developing instrumentation for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Wilson helped stack boxes of explosives for the 100-ton test that preceded it. At Los Alamos, he was also active in community affairs, serving on the town council.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Florida, {{the storm}} {{continued}} rapidly northeastward and transitioned into a tropical cyclone. Late on February3 it {{reached its peak}} strength with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h). On February4 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. Around that time, gale force winds extended 100miles (160km) to the east of the center. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February5 it moved into eastern Maine. The Hurricane <b>Research</b> <b>Division</b> assessed the storm as losing its identity shortly thereafter, over New Brunswick. However, a map produced by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicated that the storm continued northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and later crossed eastern Quebec and Labrador. By February6, it reached the ocean again, deepening to a minimum pressure of 988mbar (29.18inHg). At that point, the Weather Bureau track ended, and as such the ultimate fate of the storm is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Based upon {{scientific}} {{research conducted by}} the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane <b>Research</b> <b>Division</b> in 2003, the cyclone is estimated to have first begun as a 60mph (100km/h) tropical storm south of Mayaguana in the Bahamas early on September9. However, due to scarce observations, its genesis likely occurred earlier than this time but was undetected operationally. Moving slowly northwest, the cyclone quickly strengthened into a hurricane with winds of 75mph (120km/h), equivalent to Category1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, early the next day. By 00:00UTC on September11, it reached sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) while centered about 15miles (25km) west of New Providence Island. Turning to the west-northwest, the cyclone maintained its intensity while passing {{just north of the}} Bimini Islands. Around 23:00UTC on September12, the cyclone struck South Florida near Fort Lauderdale with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Thereafter, the hurricane weakened upon crossing the Everglades, weakening to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|The methods {{through which}} {{tropical}} cyclones are forecast have {{changed with the}} passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. Before the early 1900s, though, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph. It wasn’t until the advent of radio {{in the early twentieth century}} that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. The 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting. The next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military, starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943, and the establishment of the Hurricane Hunters in 1944. In the 1950s, coastal weather radars began to be used in the United States, and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the Hurricane <b>Research</b> <b>Division</b> began in 1954.|$|E
