5000|$|The diet of L. sikapusi is {{characterized}} by insects such as ants, reptiles, seeds, palms, fibre, soft-bodied invertebrates, and vegetable materials that are abundant in the tropical land environments. [...] Their food resources are limited by dry habitat. The dry habitat may also expose these rodents to predators by depriving them of the shelter they need. On the other hand, the wet season increases disease rate while increasing the abundance of food sources. Approximately 98% of food consumed is used toward maintaining a steady body temperature. Only 2% is used toward building new tissue. The energy dynamic of this animal is characteristic of rodents and mammals that are constantly losing energy through <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss. Therefore, they need a high energy source to maintain a stable body temperature.|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} changes in total <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss during use of a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) in tracheotomized patients. Methods. Tracheal humidity and temperature were meas-ured before the application and during use of the HME (plastic foam impregnated with CaCl 2), and total <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss was calculated. Results. No significant difference was found between the convective heat exchange before and after use of the HME for a 10 -minute period. When the HME was placed on the tracheal opening, the evaporative heat exchange and the total <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss decreased significantly. Conclusions. The results indicate that passive airway humid-ification is effective in tracheotomized patients even after a 10 -minute period. However, the positive effect on the energy balance of the tracheal mucosa after prolonged use of the HM...|$|E

40|$|We studied {{ventilation}} in kangaroos from mesic and arid environments, {{the eastern}} grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), respectively, {{within the range of}} ambient temperatures (Tₐ) from − 5 ° to 45 °C. At thermoneutral temperatures (Tₐ= 25 °C), there were no differences between the species in respiratory frequency, tidal volume, total ventilation, or oxygen extraction. The ventilatory patterns of the kangaroos were markedly different from those predicted from the allometric equation derived for placentals. The kangaroos had low respiratory frequencies and higher tidal volumes, even when adjustment was made for their lower basal metabolism. At Tₐ> 25 °C, ventilation was increased in the kangaroos to facilitate respiratory water loss, with percent oxygen extraction being markedly lowered. Ventilation was via the nares; the mouth was closed. Differences in ventilation between the two species occurred at higher temperatures, and at 45 °C were associated with differences in <b>respiratory</b> evaporative <b>heat</b> loss, with that of M. giganteus being higher. Panting in kangaroos occurred as a graded increase in respiratory frequency, during which tidal volume was lowered. When panting, the desert red kangaroo had larger tidal volumes and lower respiratory frequencies at equivalent Tₐ than the {{eastern grey kangaroo}}, which generally inhabits mesic forests. The inference made from this pattern is that the red kangaroo has the potential to increase <b>respiratory</b> evaporative <b>heat</b> loss to a greater level...|$|R

The experimental birds consisted of four matured strains. A total number of 120 healthy matured birds consist of 30 each of Naked Neck, Normal Feather, Fulani and Frizzle feather. Each bird was monitored and measured {{for the number of}} comb cups, comb length, comb height, wattle height and width {{at the beginning of the}} experiment and recorded for each strain.

The heat tolerance attributes considered were the rectal temperature, pulse rate and respiratory rate. Chicken strain and sex had significant effect (P 0. 05) effect was shown in rectal temperature. Comb cups also affected (P < 0. 05) pulse and respiratory rates. The lowest pulse rates were obtained in chicken with measuring 5 cm high and 4 cm long. Regarding <b>respiratory</b> rate and <b>heat</b> stress index, the lowest values were recorded in chicken having combs that measured 8 cm high 7 cm long.

50|$|Living in the {{equatorial}} {{region of the}} world, the American flamingo has little variation in seasonal temperature changes. However, as a homeothermic endotherm it is still {{faced with the challenge}} of maintaining a constant body temperature while being exposed to both the day (light period) and night (dark period) temperatures of its environments. Phoenicopterus ruber have evolved a number of thermoregulatory mechanisms to keep itself cool during the light period and warm during the dark period without expending too much energy. The American flamingo has been observed in a temperature niche between 17.8 - 35.2 C. In order to prevent water loss through evaporation when temperatures are elevated the flamingo will employ hyperthermia as a nonevaporative heat loss method keeping its body temperature between 40 - 42 C. This allows heat to leave the body by moving from an area of high body temperature to an area of a lower ambient temperature. Flamingos are also able to use evaporative heat loss methods such as, cutaneous evaporative <b>heat</b> loss and <b>respiratory</b> evaporative <b>heat</b> loss. During cutaneous heat loss, Phoenicopterus ruber relies on evaporation off of the skin to reduce its body temperature. This method is not very efficient as it requires evaporation to pass through the plumage. A more efficient way to reduce its body temperature is through <b>respiratory</b> evaporative <b>heat</b> loss, where the flamingo engages in panting to expel excessive body heat. During the dark period the flamingos tend to tuck their heads beneath their wing to conserve body heat. They may also elicit shivering as a means of muscular energy consumption to produce heat as needed.|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{temperature}} and body heat were measured in 30 patients. Despite the warming of most fluids given intravenously, all the patients ventilated with dry anaesthetic gases became cooler, {{with an average}} heat loss of 12. 4 kilocalories per hour. In a group to whom the gases were delivered saturated at body temperature, the average hourly loss was 1. 5 kilocalories. This difference is {{in agreement with the}} effects calculated from <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> exchange, and indicates that heated humidifi-cation can help to limit or prevent the development of hypothermia in anaesthetized adults. The anaesthetized patient has a reduced metabolic rate, and his thermoregulation is impaired. Body temperatures decrease more rapidly when skin and visceral surfaces are extensively exposed to cool air (Lunn, 1969; Morris, 1971). Cold intravenous infusions, irrigating solutions and wet packs further enhance the tendency to body cooling. The com-bination of these effects can cause the deep body temperature to become less than 32 CC (Newman, 1971). This can happen even with blood-warming and a heated water-mattress (Searle, 1971). The role of <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> exchange has been discounted in anaesthesia for adults (Sato, 1961), yet many of the studies in which temperature reductions were reported appear to involve ventila-tion with dry gases (Lunn, 1969; Lewis and Mac-kenzie, 1972). In infants and children, Rashad and Benson (1967) showed that heated humidification was able to limit or prevent temperature reductions. Moreover, the humidifier has been used effectively in "core " rewarming of adults with accidental hypothermia (Ledingham and Mone, 1972; Lloyd, 1973).

40|$|To {{determine}} whether mediators of immediate hypersensitivity {{played a role}} in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced asthma, we measured the concentration of histamine and neutrophil-chemotactic activity present in systemic arterial blood during thermal challenges in five asymptomatic asthmatics. Because exercise-induced asthma has been shown to be a result of <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss and because <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss during isocapnic hyperventilation has been shown to give identical responses, we chose the latter provocational method in order to minimize increases in cardiac output that might interfere with the interpretation of mediator concentrations in arterial blood. Multiple aspects of pulmonary mechanics were also recorded before and after provocation. The results of these studies were then compared with the effects observed when the same subjects inhaled aerosols of specific antigens on the same day. Each challenge produced identical alterations in lung function, and neither was associated with consistent changes in arterial histamine. However, antigen provocation evoked a sustained and prolonged release of neutrophil chemotactic activity in each subject, whereas isocapnic hyperventilation with cold air was without effect. These data strongly suggest that mast-cell derived mediators are not involved in the development or maintenance of the bronchial obstruction that follows exercise in asthmatics...|$|E

It was hypothesised that this {{would lead to a}} detectable increase in <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> {{and moisture}} loss (RHML), which would reflect the degree of airway inflammation present. A total of 23 subjects with asthma and 18 healthy controls had RHML measured in a cross-sectional study.

The subjects with asthma underwent parallel measurements of exhaled nitric oxide, sputum eosinophil percentage and exhaled breath condensate pH. Mean¡SD RHML was elevated in patients with asthma (98. 1 ¡ 7. 3 J?L- 1) compared with control subjects (91. 9 ¡ 4. 5 J?L- 1). RHML measurement in asthma correlated with sputum eosinophil percentage.

40|$|Recent data {{demonstrate}} that {{the magnitude of the}} heat loss that occurs from the respiratory tract during exercise correlates with the degree of post-exertional obstruction that develops in asthmatics. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss relates directly to the minute ventilation and heat capacity of the inspired gas and inversely to its water content and temperature. Because {{it has been shown that}} inhaling 100 % oxygen during exercise blunts the obstructive response, we wondered if this effect could be accounted for by differing values of heat exchange with air and oxygen breathing. To examine this question, we studied 10 asthmatics by measuring multiple aspects of pulmonary mechanics before and after four bouts of exhausting leg work during which the subjects inhaled either air or oxygen conditioned to provide widely differing thermal burdens on their airways. Under all inspired gas conditions, oxygen breathing produced significantly less obstruction than air. Minute ventilation was also significantly less with oxygen as was the total heat lost. As the latter fell, so did the magnitude of the postexercise obstruction. When the differences in ventilation and <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss between air and oxygen were eliminated by eucapnic hyperventilation, the differences in the obstructive responses also disappeared.

40|$|<b>Respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> loss {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a mechanism of exercise induced asthma. Whether the predominant stimulus is airway drying or cooling remains unclear. We have measured changes in FEV 1 after isocapnic cold air hyperventilation (CAH) (- 23. 4 degrees (SD 0. 43 degrees) C) and dry ambient air hyperventilation (AAH) (18. 7 degrees (0. 52 degrees) C) in seven asthmatic patients (mean age 31 (SD 9) years and baseline FEV 1 3. 2 (0. 9) 1) and in seven normal subjects (age 28 (6) years and FEV 1 3. 6 (0. 7) 1). The inspired water content in both cases was 0. 3 mg/l air. The rate of <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> exchange per breath was calculated in watts (W) with microcomputer based equipment. Cold air hyperventilation caused a fall in FEV 1 almost twice that of ambient air hyperventilation at each level of ventilation: CAH v AAH (% fall) 8. 0 (5. 1) v 3. 9 (4. 0) at 15 l/min, 11. 6 (7. 8) v 7. 0 (4. 4) at 30 l/min, and 20. 7 (10. 9) v 12. 4 (6. 3) at 60 l/min. Identical latent heat loss (evaporative drying) was imposed on the airway during the two challenges. Sensible heat loss (convective cooling) in cold air hyperventilation was 41 W at 15 l/min, 63 W at 30 l/min, and 114 W at 60 l/min; whereas in ambient air hyperventilation the loss was 6, 13, and 23 W respectively.

The mean baseline spirometric indices exceeded 85 % of predicted normal values on each test day; both placebo treatments reduced the baseline FEV 1 by comparison with all active treatments (p less than 0. 0001). Comparison of the PD 15 on the two placebo days confirmed excellent reproducibility.

Calorespirometric measurement of <b>respiratory</b> <b>heat</b> and CO 2 rates, from which both efficiency and growth rate can be calculated, is a well established method for determining the effects of rapid temperature changes on the respiratory and growth properties of plant tissues. The effect of the alternative oxidase/cytochrome oxidase activity ratio on efficiency is calculated from first principles. Data on the temperature dependence of the substrate carbon conversion efficiency are tabulated. These data show that ε is maximum and approximately constant through the optimum growth temperature range and decreases rapidly as temperatures approach temperature limits to growth. The width of the maximum and the slopes of decreasing ε at high and low temperatures vary greatly with species, cultivars and accessions...|$|E
40|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control, from 1979 - 2003, {{excessive}} heat exposure {{resulted in}} 8, 015 {{deaths in the}} United States. During this period, more {{people in this country}} died from extreme heat than from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined. The mortality rates from heat related illness are likely an underestimate as heat exposure is often a contributing factor in deaths attributed to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and <b>respiratory</b> disorders during <b>heat</b> waves. Participants of behavioral health services are especially susceptible to the danger of heat-related illness as a result of psychotropic medications; substance use; agitation and a greater frequency of medical conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Medications and substances can interfere with the body’s ability to regulate heat and an individual’s awareness that their body temperature is rising.

40|$|Abstract Cannabis smoking {{can create}} <b>respiratory</b> problems. Vaporizers <b>heat</b> {{cannabis}} to release active cannabinoids, but remain {{cool enough to}} avoid the smoke and toxins associated with combustion. Vaporized cannabis should create fewer respiratory symptoms than smoked cannabis. We examined self-reported respiratory symptoms in participants who ranged in cigarette and cannabis use. Data from a large Internet sample revealed {{that the use of}} a vaporizer predicted fewer respiratory symptoms even when age, sex, cigarette smoking, and amount of cannabis used were taken into account. Age, sex, cigarettes, and amount of cannabis also had significant effects. The number of cigarettes smoked and amount of cannabis used interacted to create worse respiratory problems. A significant interaction revealed that the impact of a vaporizer was larger as the amount of cannabis used increased. These data suggest that the safety of cannabis can increase {{with the use of a}} vaporizer. Regular users of joints, blunts, pipes, and water pipes might decrease respiratory symptoms by switching to a vaporizer</p...|$|R
40|$|The {{nasal cavity}} {{is a vital}} {{component}} of the <b>respiratory</b> system that <b>heats</b> and humidifies inhaled air in all vertebrates. Despite this common function, the shapes of nasal cavities vary widely across animals. To understand this variability, we here connect nasal geometry to its function by theoretically studying the airflow and the associated scalar exchange that describes heating and humidification. We find that optimal geometries, which have minimal resistance for a given exchange efficiency, have a constant gap width between their side walls, but their overall shape is restricted only by the geometry of the head. Our theory explains the geometric variations of natural nasal cavities quantitatively and we hypothesize that the trade-off between high exchange efficiency and low resistance to airflow is the main driving force shaping the nasal cavity. Our model further explains why humans, whose nasal cavities evolved to be smaller than expected for their size, become obligate oral breathers in aerobically challenging situations.
