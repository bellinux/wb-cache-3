The interpreted equation, also named nonlinear wave equation in frequency domain, includes both quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, delayed <b>Raman</b> <b>effects</b> and anisotropic nonlinearities. The full potential of this wave equation is demonstrated by investigating simulations of solitons generated {{in the process of}} ultrafast cascaded second-harmonic generation. We show that a balance in the soliton delay can be achieved due to competition between self-steepening, <b>Raman</b> <b>effects</b> and self-steepening-like effects from cascading originating in the group-velocity mismatch between the pump and second harmonic. We analyze the first-order contributions, and show that this balance can be broken to create fast or slow pulses. Through further simulations we demonstrate few-cycle compressed solitons in extremely short crystals, where spectral phenomena such as blue/red shifting, non-stationary radiation in accordance with the non-local phase matching condition and dispersive-wave generation are observed and marked, which help improving the experimental knowledge of cascading nonlinear soliton pulse compression...|$|R
