All rights reserved. Recycling waste rubber has gained importance in recent years. Ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) is used to manufacture various automotive parts. Reclaiming EPDM rubber waste is a major problem. Waste powder from discarded EPDM automotive parts was devulcanized using an industrial autoclave which provided both heating and high pressure steam. To aid the devulcanization process, 2 -mercaptobenzothiazoledisulfide (MBTS) and tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD) devulcanizing agents, and aromatic and aliphatic oils were also used. A portion of the virgin EPDM rubber in a common formulation for the automotive <b>rubber</b> <b>strips</b> was replaced with the devulcanized product to produce blends, which were revulcanized using a semi-efficient (SEV) vulcanization system. The viscosity, cure and mechanical properties of the blends were subsequently determined. This study showed that the oils had different effects on the devulcanization of the waste powder and MBTS was more efficient than TMTD. Replacing 60 wt% of the virgin rubber in the automotive <b>rubber</b> <b>strips</b> with the devulcanized powder had no adverse effect on the scorch and optimum cure times, crosslink density, rate of cure, and viscosity. Also, when 20 wt% of the virgin rubber was replaced, the hardness, compression set, and modulus at 20 % elongation were unaffected. It was concluded that the reclaimed rubber {{could be used in}} low percentage in order not to extremely deteriorate the mechanical properties of the virgin rubber. This provided a new effective recycling route for the waste EPDM powder in the automotive <b>rubber</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R

The grille design was cleaned up, and the tail lights were changed to match the new aerodynamic look of the grille. Side marker lights changed from the flush mounted side markers to the surface-mounted units that were adopted across the entire Chrysler line-up for the 1972 model year. The optional bumper guards for 1972 included a <b>rubber</b> <b>strip</b> surrounding the tail lights and a <b>rubber</b> <b>strip</b> below the grille. The big differences came in the cutting back of performance options for the car. The suspension, rear axle ratios (a 3:55 ratio was the tallest available), and most noticeably the engines changed, with the big-block 383 being replaced by a larger-bore (and lower performance) 400 CID version as the standard engine. The small-block 340 CID {{as well as the}} performance version of the 440 CID engine (with a 4-barrel carburetor, performance camshaft, and dual exhausts) were also available, and for the last time a 4-speed manual transmission could be paired with any of the three engines. All of the engines suffered a drop in compression ratios to allow use of low-lead/no-lead gas and to meet the first round of emissions regulations. The [...] 440 engine was the basis for the Road Runner GTX (the GTX was no longer a separate model) and was available on Road Runners from 1972 to 1974. The 1971-72 Road Runner sheetmetal was used by several NASCAR racing teams for their racecars and ran well on the circuit during the 1971-74 seasons. Richard Petty won the championship both in 1971 and 1972 using the Road Runner-based cars, winning 30 races over the two seasons.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 {{the third}} series arrived. The insides {{in the rear}} were recontoured, so that the car now became a five-seater (instead of four). The easiest way to spot a third series is that it {{received}} new, much larger vents on the C-pillars, as well as redesigned taillights - with integrated reversing lights on the Elegant and Abarth. The Abarth also received a new larger 1050 cc engine ("70HP"), while the Normale's output dropped to [...] in July 1975. All engines were still pushrod units, derived from the old tipo 100 engine first introduced in the Fiat 600. In 1976, due to new emissions standards, the Elegant lost two horsepower, now down to [...] Third series Normales still received metal bumpers, but from now on they were painted black (instead of being chromed) and {{no longer had a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>strip.</b> This was the last model to have the diamond shaped turn signals on the front fenders, with later models receiving more orthodox rectangular ones.|$|E

It is made of flexible slats and has a transparent and strong structure. The notorious TC museum stool from 1990 was made for Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and is named after Trees Coenders, who was looking for a lightweight stool that was easy to carry and also easy to stack. It is now serving in several other museums and is collected by the MoMa New York under the title “Wander” Stacking Stool. Four years later, in 1992, Kokke designed the Kokkestok, a walking stick which is easy to use because of the long curl, the stiff end and the <b>rubber</b> <b>strip</b> on the side. Several other furniture designs followed, often in commission, such as the chairs for the restaurant of the Province House in Groningen in 1991, the Next bed for Auping (1996) and the Ahrend Run sofa (2009).

50|$|The main {{drawback}} of the Mono/Poly is {{that the}} 4 VCOs share one common VCA and VCF envelope, but there are triggering and auto-dampering switches {{to compensate for the}} envelope sharing. This synth wasn't so much designed to be a polysynth like its sister the Polysix (which was manufactured at the same time), but more of an experimental synth with different footages and waveshapes per oscillator. The Mono/Poly also did not include a digital memory like its sister the Polysix, because its focus was again on experimentation. Other drawbacks are the chipboard construction on the base and sides of the unit, which tend to get damaged easily or allow screws to come out, and the rubber contacts under the keyboard, which tend to wear over time resulting in dead keys; fortunately this may be fixed with a little cleaning and/or obtaining a new <b>rubber</b> <b>strip,</b> as Mono/Polys are fairly easy to disassemble. As far as circuit reliability, they tend to fare well by the standard of most analog synths. The most likely component to fail is generally one of the 4 VCOs (making its uselessness variable in POLY mode, depending on which oscillators have burned out); next to go is usually the filter. The VCOs and VCF are Solid State Micro Technology for Music(SSM) chips: (4 SSM2033 VCOs and 1 SSM2044 VCF, for replacement purposes).|$|E

The [...] "horns", or over-riders, on the bumpers were removed and replaced with a <b>rubber</b> <b>strip</b> running the whole length of the bumper. The rear lights were also smoothed {{in a similar manner}} to the indicator lenses and the passive reflector (previously a separate part underneath the main rear lights) was incorporated as a small, square-shaped part in the rear light cluster itself. The windshield pump was moved down and was operated by foot (rather than by rubber button on the dashboard VAZ 2101, which was operated with the push of a finger). The dashboard had a wood-effect plastic trim; the horn was placed on the steering wheel cover. The front and rear seats became more comfortable. Material and colouring of the instrument panel was changed from the original black on light grey to white on black, the instrument panel lighting was altered as well. On the rear pillars there were rectangular ventilation holes with grille, which were not present on the VAZ-2101. Four decorative horizontal oval holes appeared on the front panel just above the front bumper. The export series were designated the Lada 1300.|$|E
