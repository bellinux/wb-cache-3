40|$|In this paper, we {{model the}} <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> of private used cars in Fiji. We {{consider}} Toyota and Nissan cars {{which are the}} two relatively prominent brands in Fiji. Drawing on a sample of 175 Toyota used cars and 108 Nissan used cars over the period January 2012 to December 2012 from Car 4 Sale. com. fj website, and using ordinary least squares method, we explore the elasticity coefficients of key determinants of the <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> of private used cars. Our results show that for Toyota cars, the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> is positively affected by model year and transmission type (manual or automatic) and negatively affected by mileage. For Nissan cars, the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> is positively influenced by the engine capacity and model year and negatively affected by the mileage. Subsequently, both brands of used cars <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> behave similar {{with respect to the}} model year and mileage, and somewhat differs with engine capacity and transmission types...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{explanation}} for the prominent role of manufacturers in the financing of their own product sales — so called “captive finance. ” By lending against their own product as collateral, durable goods manufacturers with market power can commit to restrict production and maintain <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> in future periods, preserving rents today. Using data on captive financing support by the manufacturers of heavy equipment, we find evidence that captive financed models retain higher <b>resale</b> <b>values,</b> especially when the manufacturer has pricing power. The higher <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> enjoyed by captive financed models also convey higher pledgeability and thus allow lower downpayments, even when machines are financed by banks. We find that models with a history of captive support are preferred by buyers when financing constraints are binding. Although motivated as a rent-seeking device, captive financing may generate positive spillovers if credit constraints are important...|$|R

The Finnish police estimated the total value of the forgeries of his and some of his peers' designs reached millions of euros and expected it to grow. Occasional, partly tongue-in-cheek, criticism of some of the designs - that the versatile teak handle with the cast-iron pot would get lost, that white Suomi showed tea stains unlike classic British brown tea pots - did not undermine their appreciation. Historically, Christie's executives commented on growth in <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> especially with Sarpaneva's glass creations for the Italian Venini company.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) determine how energy efficiency affects the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> of homes; (2) use this information concerning the 2 ̆ 2 implicit price 2 ̆ 2 of energy efficiency to estimate the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> of fuel saving investments; and (3) incorporate these <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> into the investment decision process and determine the efficient investment mix for a household which plans to own a given home for three alternative time periods;Two models were used to accomplish these objectives. A hedonic price model was used to determine the impact of energy efficiency on housing prices. The hedonic technique is a method used to attach implicit prices to characteristics which are not themselves bought and sold in markets, but are components of market goods. The hedonic model constructed in this study provided an estimate of the implicit price which is paid for an increase in energy efficiency in homes on the Des Moines housing market. Given this implicit price, and the efficiency of fuel saving investments (such as insulation, passive solar applications, and high energy efficiency furnaces), the <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> of fuel saving investments were estimated;In order to determine how the length of time the home is to be owned affects the 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 investment mix, a linear programming model was used to determine the cost minimizing investment mix for a baseline house under the assumption that it would be owned for 6, 20, and 50 years, alternatively. The <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> which were estimated based on the implicit price of energy efficiency were used in obtaining the 6 and 20 year solutions;The results of the hedonic technique revealed that a premium is paid for energy efficient homes in Des Moines. The implicit price of energy efficiency indicates that, on average, a 1 decrease in annual fuel expenditures (due to an increase in efficiency) increases the expected selling price of the house by 11. 63;The results of the linear programming model reveal that the optimal fuel saving investment mix for a home is sensitive to the time which the home is to be owned. Solutions which are based on the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> of fuel saving investments exhibit an underinvestment in conservation relative to the long-run cost minimization solution. Further information is required, however, before it can be determined whether or not the housing market is pricing fuel saving investments efficiently...|$|R
