25|$|The {{issue in}} these {{developed}} countries is choosing the <b>right</b> <b>kind</b> of food. More fast food is consumed {{per capita in}} the United States {{than in any other}} country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.|$|E

25|$|For {{the subtle}} {{observations}} on phase transitions {{it is important}} that the disorder is of the <b>right</b> <b>kind.</b> The random nature of the potential landscape should be apparent on a scale sufficiently smaller than the sample size in order to clearly distinguish the different phases of the system. These phases are only observable by the principle of emergence, so the difference between self-similar scales has to be multiple orders of magnitude for the critical exponent to be well-defined. On the opposite side, when the disorder correlation length is too small, the states are not sufficiently localized to observe them delocalize.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this the <b>right</b> <b>kind</b> {{of character for}} Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it {{and you could see}} all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in his {{discussion}} of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the <b>right</b> <b>kind</b> of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E

In this paper, we argue that low-cost robots have been a useful first step, but are now becoming a dead-end because they do not allow our students to explore more sophisticated robotics methods. We suggest {{that it is time to}} shift our focus from low-cost robots to creating software tools with the <b>right</b> <b>kinds</b> of abstractions that will make it easier for our students to learn the fundamental issues relevant to robot programming. We describe a programming framework called Pyro which provides a set of abstractions that allows students to write platform-independent robot programs...|$|R

500|$|The dissent argued that, for {{a section}} 1983 {{claim to be}} valid, [...] "harm alone is not enough; {{it has to be}} the <b>right</b> <b>kind</b> of harm." [...] Thomas {{provided}} an example of a law allowing police to pull over any driver without cause. This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|E

In contrast, Andrew Unterberger of the same publication enjoyed the track, claiming that [...] "it might not be your favorite Madonna, but it's unquestionably her, and it's far more compelling than the anonymous EDM enthusiast she played on MDNA (2012)". Unterberger also praised the addition of PC Music [...] "ping-ponging oddball freneticism" [...] and [...] "Diplo's block-dropping beats". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone was also positive, calling it [...] "frenetic", and praised Minaj's verse for being [...] "pure fire", while Anna Zelaski of The A.V.

500|$|By the 1950s Hordern {{had come}} to the notice of many {{influential}} directors. In his autobiography, the actor recognised the decade as being an important era of his career. It started with a major role in Anton Chekhov's Ivanov in 1950. The production took place at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer T. C. Worsley was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: [...] "Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the <b>right</b> <b>kind</b> of support." [...] The title character in Macbeth, directed by Alec Clunes, was Hordern's next engagement. Critics wrote of their dislike of Clunes's version, but the theatre reviewer Audrey Williamson singled out Hordern's performance as being [...] "deeply moving".|$|E

[...] Mark Hirsh The Boston Globe, which {{was one of}} the few reviewers that gave the album a mixed analysis, said that [...] "Love Me" [...] was the essential song on the set. Washington Post also cited the song as one of the album's best, referring to it as a [...] "modest club track." [...] The New York Times said the track is [...] "probably the only release in recent memory that owes debts to both the Cardigans." [...] Mike Diver of BBC Music called the song an [...] "electro-infused reinterpretation of The Cardigans' Lovefool, where Bieber exhibits the <b>right</b> <b>kind</b> of attitude, playful and endearing." [...] Diver preferred Bieber in the song and wanted more of [...] "the cheeky chap rightfully having the time of his young life", rather than the [...] "adolescent playboy". [...] "Love Me" [...] had debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 and Billboard Hot 100 at twelve and thirty-seven. It spent twelve non-consecutive weeks on the Canadian chart and four in the United States. On the week ending January 10, 2010, [...] "Love Me" [...] entered the UK Singles Chart at eighty-two, and later peaked at seventy-one. It also debuted and peaked on the UK R chart at twenty-three, remaining on the chart for three weeks. It debuted and peaked in Australia at 100.|$|E
