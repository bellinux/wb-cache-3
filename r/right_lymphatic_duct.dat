25|$|The {{lymphatic system}} does {{eventually}} drain from the thoracic duct and <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> into the systemic venous {{system at the}} venous angle and into the brachiocephalic veins, and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route.|$|E
25|$|The lymphatic vessels, {{also called}} lymph vessels, conduct lymph between {{different}} parts of the body. They include the tubular vessels of the lymph capillaries, and the larger collecting vessels–the <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> and the thoracic duct (the left lymphatic duct). The lymph capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues, while lymph vessels propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger collecting ducts, where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via one of the subclavian veins. These vessels are also called the lymphatic channels or simply lymphatics.|$|E
25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct,</b> which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION:　 Lymphaticovenular {{anastomosis}} (LVA) {{has become}} an important procedure for the surgical treatment of lymphedema. In the past, the anatomy of the lymphatic system of animal models has been reported. However, to our knowledge, {{there have been few}} reports of animal models of LVA including training model. In this study, we report on a relatively simple and ideal animal LVA model based on peritoneal lymph ducts and veins. 　 PATIENTS AND METHODS:　 For 10 rats, diameters of lumbar <b>lymphatic</b> <b>ducts</b> and iliolumbar veins in the peritoneal cavity on both sides were measured, and LVA was performed. In addition, we measured the diameters of 28 <b>lymphatic</b> <b>ducts</b> and veins in 8 patients who had previously undergone LVA and compared the results with those obtained in this rat model. 　 RESULTS:　 The mean diameter of the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>ducts</b> was 0. 61 mm, and the iliolumbar veins were 0. 81 mm. On the other hand, the mean diameters of the 28 <b>lymphatic</b> <b>ducts</b> and veins of the 8 patients in whom we performed LVA were 0. 58 and 0. 76 mm, respectively. The differences in the diameters of the lymph vessels and veins between the rats and patients were not statistically significant. 　 CONCLUSIONS:　 We report on an LVA model involving the use of the lumbar <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> and iliolumbar veins of rats. The diameter, nature, and placement of the anastomosis using this model are very similar to that noted during real human surgery. We believe that our rat model will be useful as a practical training model for LVA and in studies on postoperative changes in LVA...|$|R

30|$|Plasma ANP levels {{correlated}} with the lung comet tail score in both exercise sessions (Fig.  3). The elevated levels of ANP during exercise may have exacerbated EVLW accumulation by increasing capillary permeability [27] or by impeding the lymphatic collection of interstitial fluid [46] consequently limiting the removal of interstitial fluid. Finally, the high pressures in vena cava may also limit pulmonary lymphatic flow from the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> [47].|$|R
50|$|A lymph duct {{is a great}} {{lymphatic vessel}} that empties lymph {{into one of the}} subclavian veins. There are two lymph ducts in the body - the <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> and the {{thoracic}} duct. The <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> drains lymph from the right upper limb, right side of thorax and right halves of head and neck. The thoracic duct drains lymph into the circulatory system at the left brachiocephalic vein between the left subclavian and left internal jugular veins.|$|E

50|$|Generally, lymph flows {{away from}} the tissues to lymph nodes and {{eventually}} to either the <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> or the largest lymph vessel in the body, the thoracic duct. These vessels drain into {{the right and left}} subclavian veins respectively.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspensory}} ligaments of Cooper play {{an important}} role in the change in appearance of the breast that often accompanies the development of inflammatory carcinoma of the breast in which blockage of the local <b>lymphatic</b> <b>ducts</b> causes swelling of the breast.

50|$|In human anatomy, the {{thoracic}} duct {{is the largest}} of the two lymph ducts of the lymphatic system. It is also known as the left lymphatic duct, alimentary duct, chyliferous duct, and Van Hoorne's canal. The other duct is the <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct.</b> It carries chyle, a liquid containing both lymph and emulsified fats, rather than pure lymph. Thus when it ruptures, the resulting flood of liquid into the pleural cavity is known as chylothorax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sirtuin 1 (Sirt 1) is a {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucle-otide-dependent class III histone deacetylase. It reportedly can repress cellular apoptosis and senescence {{to affect}} DNA repair, stress response and aging. Notably, previous data {{have indicated that}} Sirt 1 is both a tumor promoter and a tumor suppressor in tumorigenesis. However, Sirt 1 expression in primary lung adenocarcinoma remains unknown. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate Sirt 1 expression in cancer cells in 125 consecutive resected cases of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Sirt 1 expression {{was found to be}} increased in 26 (20. 8 %) of the 125 cases, which correlated significantly with five clinicopathological factors: Ki 67 index, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF 1) molecule expression, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, pulmonary vein invasion and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> invasion. In the Sirt 1 -positive expression group, Sirt 1 expression correlated with a higher Ki 67 index and higher TNM classification, particularly for lymph node invasion and metastasis, and with a higher number of pulmonary vein invasion and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> invasion. Additionally, a negative correlation was identified between HIF 1 ‑positive expression and Sirt 1 -negative expression. These results indicate that Sirt 1 overexpression plays a promotional role in tumorigenesis and is closely associated with invasion and metastasis and, thus, it may be associated with prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Brugia pahangi {{infection}} in the canine rear limb results in marked <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> and popliteal lymph node pathologic changes. Limb edema is variably associated with infection and does not correlate well with duct or node lesions. To understand the mechanisms of limb edema, lymph node cells were collected by sequential biopsy following infection and examined for production of inflammatory mediators. Lymph node cells from a litter of dogs selectively bred with {{a high incidence of}} edema formation (82 %) demonstrated spontaneously released histamine and prostaglandin E 2 levels higher than those of closely related nonedema-forming dogs (0 – 20 %) and/or control dogs. These edema-forming dogs also showed elevated release of tumor necrosis factor-a when cells were cultured with Brugia antigen. Toluidine blue staining of infected lymph node sections revealed that the edema-forming dogs had higher numbers of mast cells than infected lymph nodes of nonedema-forming dogs. Our earlier studies of dogs infected in lymph ducts affer-ent to the popliteal lymph node and in the capsule of the node itself with Brugia pahangi showed marked changes in <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> structure that included dilation and rechan-nelization, as well as variable loss of function as indicated by dye leakage from ducts.

50|$|Rhythmic {{contraction}} {{of the vessel}} walls through movements may also help draw fluid into the smallest lymphatic vessels, capillaries. If tissue fluid builds up the tissue will swell; this is called edema. As the circular path through the body's system continues, the fluid is then transported to progressively larger lymphatic vessels culminating in the <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> (for lymph from the right upper body) and the thoracic duct (for {{the rest of the}} body); both ducts drain into the circulatory system at the right and left subclavian veins. The system collaborates with white blood cells in lymph nodes to protect the body from being infected by cancer cells, fungi, viruses or bacteria. This is known as a secondary circulatory system.|$|E
5000|$|Lymphatic spread {{allows the}} {{transport}} of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately, {{to other parts of}} the body. This is called nodal involvement, positive nodes, or regional disease. [...] "Positive nodes" [...] is a term that would be used by medical specialists to describe regional lymph nodes that tested positive for malignancy. It is common medical practice to test by biopsy at least one lymph node near a tumor site when carrying out surgery to examine or remove a tumor. This lymph node is then called a sentinel lymph node.Lymphatic spread is the most common route of initial metastasis for carcinomas. [...] In contrast, it is uncommon for a sarcoma to metastasize via this route. Localized spread to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor is not normally counted as a metastasis, although this is a sign of a worse outcome. The lymphatic system does eventually drain from the thoracic duct and <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> into the systemic venous system at the venous angle and into the brachiocephalic veins, and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route.|$|E
5000|$|These {{processes}} begin {{forming the}} lymph sacs during the 5th week of fetal development. At this time, the jugular lymph sacs develop. [...] These are {{a pair of}} enlargements that function in collecting fluid from the lymphatics of the upper limbs, upper trunk, head, and neck. The lymph nodes eventually develop at {{the place of the}} jugular lymphatic sacs. [...] From the left jugular lymphatic sac, the cervical part of the thoracic duct forms. From the right jugular lymphatic sac, the <b>right</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>duct</b> and the jugular and the subclavicular lymphatic trunks form.One week later, during the 6th week of fetal development, four more lymph sacs form. These are the retroperitoneal lymph sac, the cysterna chyli, and paired posterior lymph sacs. [...] The posterior lymph sacs are associated with the junctions of the external and internal iliac veins. These four new lymph sacs function in the collection of lymph from the trunk and lower extremities of the body. The cysterna chyli drains into a pair of thoracic lymphatic ducts initially. [...] These ducts drain into the venous junctions of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. [...] However, these ducts eventually become one thoracic duct that is derived from the caudal portion of the right duct, the cranial portion of the left duct, and median anastomosis.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} the pulmonary lymph flow in dogs with mild congestive failure {{before and after}} acute elevation of the left atrial pressure to 40 cm of water. The creation of an aorticocaval fistula and the administration of desoxycorti-costerone trimethylacetate and a salt enriched diet in 6 dogs produced mild pulmonary edema and partial expansion of the pulmonary lymphatics 10 to 12 days postoperatively. Elevation of the left atrial pressure to 40 cm of water under pentobarbital anesthesia led to an immediate increase in right duct flow in the "mild failure " dogs, {{in contrast to a}} delayed flow in normal dogs. The average peak flows in the 10 - to 12 -day dogs after increasing the left atrial pressure were higher than the peak flows observed in normal dogs. In addition, the mild failure dogs survived twice as long as normal dogs after acute elevation of the left atrial pressure. These results suggest that an animal with an expanded pulmonary lymph system is better able to withstand the stress of acute elevation of left atrial pressure than a normal animal. The pulmonary lymph system may serve as an important compensatory mechanism in the prevention of fulminating pulmonary edema.
