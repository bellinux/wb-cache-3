40|$|Three {{experimental}} diets {{were prepared}} from a standard formula plus pure oleic, linoleic, or eicosapentaenoic acid (2 % by weight). Mucosal <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acid</b> was tested in anaesthetised rats fed the experimental diets {{for at least}} four weeks (60 rats per diet) by duodenal infusion of HCl (200 to 700 mumol) 30 minutes after pretreatment with either saline or 100 mumol HCl (used as a mild irritant). Rats were killed one hour after the test and the duodenal damage was assessed 'blindly' using a combined macroscopic and histological score. Differences were tested by analysis of covariance of the dose-response curves. Mucosal resistance was similar in the three groups when the acid challenge was given after saline pretreatment. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acid</b> in all three groups was significantly increased by previous exposure to 100 mumol HCl (p < 0. 01). Interestingly, rats fed a linoleic or eicosapentaenoic supplemented diet after pretreatment with HCl developed significantly higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acid</b> than those fed the diet with oleic acid (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence and mechanisms of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> fusidic <b>acid</b> in clinical iso-lates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Methods: MICs of fusidic acid were determined for S. epidermidis isolates {{collected from the}} Leeds General Infirmary and from around Europe. Fusidic acid-resistant isolates were probed for the pre-sence of the horizontally acquired resistance determinants fusB and fusC by a novel multiplex PCR assay. Mutations in the gene encoding the drug target (fusA) were detected by PCR and DNA sequen-cing. Resistant isolates were subjected to typing using the repeat region of the aap gene. Results: Of 50 S. epidermidis isolates screened, 23 (46 %) exhibited <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> fusidic <b>acid.</b> The most common resistance determinant was fusB, found in 18 of the 23 isolates. Of the remaining isolates, two harboured fusC and three carried an identical mutation in fusA, leading to the substitution L 461 K in the target protein, elongation factor G. Molecular typing showed that this collection of isolates was genetically diverse. Conclusions: This study suggests a high prevalence of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> fusidic <b>acid</b> in clinical isolates of S. epidermidis.
