The {{development}} of a database management system for the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment becomes a high priority, {{in order to provide}} an efficient and reliable way to manage the information needs of the office. Therefore, the specification of a database server for the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment becomes a key area of concern. In addition to providing traditional database support, the database server must also provide new database support, so as to meet the unique and many needs of <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environments. This paper focuses on the characterization and specification of a database server for the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment. It also considers how such a database server can be effectively integrated into the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment. The authors use both intuitive comparisons and queing-theory analyses to evaluate the various integration approaches. Further, they examine an experimental database system, known as the multibackend database system, as a candidate for the database server in the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> environment.

With the emphasis of a modern office being placed on efficiency and ease of communication, <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> systems have become the backbone of successful businesses. COSNET is a prototype <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> system designed and implemented at the Department of the University of Cape Town and runs on Personal Computers that are linked to a NCR UNIX TOWER, which acts as the host. This dissertation investigates the different facilities supported by some of the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> systems compared in this thesis, and describes the COSNET features. This prototype <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> system supports many of the facilities that are supported by large <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> systems. COSNET allows the user to define any MS-DOS based editor or word processor, and uses a simple editor for the creation of mail. The electronic filing facility allows documents to be created, filed, retrieved and deleted, and thus provides the users with the necessary features for document exchange. A user may set access permissions to each of his documents and may grant other users either read or write access to a specific document. The mail facility lets the user read, file, forward, delete and print a message, and supports classification of mail. A calendar facility is used as an electronic diary and stores all the user's schedules. These schedules may be viewed in either daily, weekly and monthly display modes. Read and write access to the calendar can be set by the user, in order to allow other users to manipulate his schedules. Any MS-DOS based application software can be added to COSNET. This facility allows the COSNET user to configure the <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> system to simulate the office environment. COSNET thus supports most of the necessary features required by an <b>office</b> <b>automation</b> system...|$|R
