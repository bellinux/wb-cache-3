50|$|Since air {{has a lower}} heat {{capacity}} and density than liquid coolants, a fairly large volume flow rate (relative to the coolant's) must be blown through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> to capture {{the heat from the}} coolant. Radiators often have one or more fans that blow air through the radiator. To save fan power consumption in vehicles, radiators are often behind the grille at the front end of a vehicle. Ram air can give a portion or all of the necessary cooling air flow when the coolant temperature remains below the system's designed maximum temperature, and the fan remains disengaged.|$|E

50|$|To {{cool down}} the engine, a coolant is {{passed through the}} engine block, where it absorbs heat from the engine. The hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the {{radiator}} (located either {{on the top of}} the radiator, or along one side), from which it is distributed across the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator. As the coolant passes through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank, it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which, in turn, transfer the heat to the fins that are lodged between each row of tubes. The fins then release the heat to the ambient air. Fins are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air, thus increasing the exchange efficiency. The cooled coolant is fed back to the engine, and the cycle repeats. Normally, the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature, but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating.|$|E

The air intake grills at the lower rear of the locomotives' long hoods were intended to bring cool and clean air into the radiator section.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the air flow through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core.</b> The flow through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> in turn depends on other panels {{that are in the}} vicinity of the radiator and these include the radiator cover, grille, front inner panel, cowl, floor, etc. A clear understanding of the flow pattern inside the radiator cover is essential for optimizing the radiator cover shape to increase the flow through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core,</b> thereby increasing the thermal {{efficiency of}} the radiator. In this paper, CFD enabled optimization of airflow distribution inside the radiator cover is discussed. Starting from a CFD solution of the baseline design that was validated against indoor test data, a series of optimization cases were executed to arrive at the optimum configuration of the radiator cover. The airflow distribution inside the radiator cover and the flow through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> was monitored to provide a quantitative basis for the optimization process. The CFD analysis was conducted using the commercial software FLUENT™, while the surface and volume mesh were generated using ANSA ™ and TGRID™, respectively. Use of ANSA ™ for surface meshing was instrumental in reducing the CFD cycle time. CFD analysis of the baseline design that was validated against test data showed that significant regions of re-circulating flow existed inside the radiator cover. This recirculation reduced the flow through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core,</b> leading to a build-up of hot air pockets close to the radiator surface and subsequent degradation of radiator thermal efficiency. The CFD enabled optimization led to radiator cover configuration that eliminated these recirculation regions and increased the flow through the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> by 34 %. It is anticipated that this increase in <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> flow would significantly increase the radiator thermal efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The high {{complexity}} of vehicle front-end design, arising from considerations of aerodynamics, safety and styling, causes the airflow velocity profile at the radiator face {{to be highly}} distorted, leading to potentially reduced airflow volume for heat dissipation. A review of the existing experimental techniques for quantifying radiator airflow indicates that currently {{the most commonly used}} methods in the automotive industry are propeller based, {{despite the fact that the}} accuracy is in doubt, especially when documenting detailed airflow distributions. Two relatively new techniques, including a four-hole dynamic pressure (Cobra) probe and a new pressure-based technique, are presented in this paper. The Cobra probe featured a head size of 1. 2 mm and was used to document flow fields in proximity to a section of <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> in a wind tunnel. The results show that the flow field at the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> exit was extremely complex, consisting of jets and wakes.

40|$|As {{the target}} figures for CO 2 {{emissions}} are reduced every year, vehicle manufacturers seek to exploit all possible {{gains in the}} different vehicle attributes. Aerodynamic drag {{is an important factor}} that affects the vehicle’s fuel consumption, and its importance rises with the shift from the New European Driving Cycle to the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle which has a higher average speed. In order to reduce vehicle drag, car manufacturers employ the use of grill/spoiler shutters which reduces the amount of air going through the vehicle’s cooling system, also known as cooling flow, thus reducing both its cooling capability and the resultant cooling drag. This paper investigates the influence of different grill blockages on the cooling flow through the radiator of a Volvo S 60. By modifying the engine bay and radiator, load cells are used to measure the force acting on the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> while the velocity distribution across the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> is measured using pressure probes. These values are analyzed and compared to different vehicle configurations and grill inlet designs. A number of test configurations are reproduced in Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations and compared to the test results. For some grill configurations, the simulations provide a good prediction of mass flow and velocity distribution; however a clear discrepancy is present as the grill blockages increase. On the other hand, the force acting on the <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> was well predicted for all configurations. This paper discusses the different parameters affecting cooling flow predictions such as wind tunnel blockage and measurement grid discretization by comparing radiator forces and mass flows. In addition, the changes on overall vehicle forces are discussed with the radiator force put in context with cooling drag...|$|E

40|$|The high {{complexity}} of vehicle front-end design, arising from considerations of aerodynamics, safety and styling, causes the airflow velocity profile at the radiator face {{to be highly}} distorted, leading to potentially reduced airflow volume for heat dissipation. A flow visualisation study showed that the bumper bar significantly influenced the cooling airflow, leading to three-dimensional vortices in its wake and generating an area of relatively low velocity across at least {{one third of the}} <b>radiator</b> <b>core.</b> Since repeatability and accuracy of on-road testing are prejudiced by weather conditions, wind-tunnel testing is often preferred to solve cooling airflow problems. However, there are constraints that limit the accuracy of reproducing on-road cooling performance from wind-tunnel simulations. These constraints included inability to simulate atmospheric conditions, limited tunnel test section sizes (blockage effects) and lack of ground effect simulations. The work presented in this thesis involved use of on-road and wind-tunnel tests to investigate the effects of most common constraints present in wind tunnels on accuracy of the simulations of engine cooling performance and radiator airflow profiles. To aid this investigation, an experimental technique for quantifying radiator airflow velocity distribution and an analytical model for predicting the heat dissipation rate of a radiator were developed. A four-hole dynamic pressure probe (TFI Cobra probe) was also used to document flow fields in proximity to a section of <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> in a wind tunnel in order to investigate the effect of airflow maldistribution on radiator heat-transfer performance. In order to cope with the inability to simulate ambient temperature, the technique of Specific Dissipation (SD) was used, which had previously been shown to overcome this problem...|$|E

50|$|Up to the 1980s, <b>radiator</b> <b>cores</b> {{were often}} made of copper (for fins) and brass (for tubes, headers, and side-plates, while tanks {{could also be}} made of brass or of plastic, often a polyamide).

However, the superior cooling properties of Copper-Brass over Aluminium makes it preferential for high performance vehicles or stationary applications. In particular MW-class installations, copper-brass constructions are still dominant (See: Copper in heat exchangers). CuproBraze is a copper-alloy heat exchanger technology for harsh temperature and pressure environments such as those in the latest generations of cleaner diesel engines mandated by environmental regulations. Its performance advantages over radiators made with other materials include better thermal performance, heat transfer, size, strength, durability, emissions, corrosion resistance, repairability, and antimicrobial benefits.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} {{to those who have}} loved and inspired me over the past years. i Summary Increased engine power output and efficiency, whilst still satisfying environmental requirements, have been major objectives for vehicle manufacturers in recent years. Vehicle performance enhancement by providing greater engine power coupled with style-driven desires has reduced the size of the engine compartment and the intake areas for internal (underhood) airflow. These changes tend to add extra heat to the engine cooling system and reduce the volume of air passing through the radiator. As a consequence, the cooling airflow through the radiator tends to be reduced and highly distorted. In this study, radiator airflow in a modern passenger vehicle was investigated and it was shown that the bumper bar significantly influenced the cooling airflow, leading to three-dimensional vortices in its wake and generating an area of relatively low velocity across at least one third of the <b>radiator</b> <b>core.</b> Ineffective use o...|$|E

50|$|A {{system of}} valves or baffles, or both, is usually {{incorporated}} to simultaneously operate a small radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, {{and the associated}} blower fan, is called the heater core, and serves to warm the cabin interior.

In order to develop their products further, Volvo 3 p issued a Master Thesis Project to study the general behavior and performance of one of their current fan shrouds in a truck installation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{scalable}} transmitter architecture for power generation and beam-steering at THz frequencies using a centralized frequency reference, sub-harmonic signal distribution, and local phase control. The power generation and <b>radiator</b> <b>core</b> {{is based on a}} novel method called distributed active radiation, which enables high conversion efficiency from DC to radiated terahertz power above f_(max) of a technology. The design evolution of the distributed active radiator (DAR) follows from an inverse design approach, where metal surface currents at different harmonics are formulated in the silicon chip for the desired electromagnetic field profiles. Circuits and passives are then designed conjointly to synthesize and control the surface currents. The DAR consists of a self-oscillating active electromagnetic structure, comprising of two loops which sustain out-of-phase currents at the fundamental frequency and in-phase currents at the second harmonic. The fundamental signal, thus gets, spatially filtered, while the second harmonic is radiated selectively, thereby consolidating signal generation, frequency multiplication, radiation of desired harmonic and filtration of undesired harmonics simultaneously in a small silicon footprint. A two-dimensional 4 × 4 radiating array implemented in 45 nm SOI CMOS (without high-resistivity substrate) radiates with an EIRP of + 9. 4 dBm at 0. 28 THz and beam-steers in 2 D over 80 ° in both azimuth and elevation.

40|$|Upcoming {{emissions}} regulations (Tiers 3, 4 a and 4 b) are imposing {{significantly higher}} heat loads on the cooling system than lesser regulated machines. This work was {{a suite of}} tasks aimed at reducing the parasitic losses of the cooling system, or improving the design process through six distinct tasks: 1. Develop an axial fan that will provide more airflow, with less input power and less noise. The initial plan was to use Genetic Algorithms to do an automated fan design, incorporating forward sweep for low noise. First and second generation concepts could not meet either performance or sound goals. An experienced turbomachinery designer, using a specialized CFD analysis program {{has taken over the}} design and has been able to demonstrate a 5 % flow improvement (vs 10 % goal) and 10 % efficiency improvement (vs 10 % goal) using blade twist only. 2. Fan shroud developments, using an 'aeroshroud' concept developed at Michigan State University. Performance testing at Michigan State University showed the design is capable of meeting the goal of a 10 % increase in flow, but over a very narrow operating range of fan performance. The goal of 10 % increase in fan efficiency was not met. Fan noise was reduced from 0 to 2 dB, vs. a goal of 5 dB at constant airflow. The narrow range of fan operating conditions affected by the aeroshroud makes this concept unattractive for further development at this time 3. Improved axial fan system modeling is needed to accommodate the numbers of cooling systems to be redesigned to meet lower emissions requirements. A CFD fan system modeling guide has been completed and transferred to design engineers. Current, uncontrolled modeling practices produce flow estimates in some cases within 5 % of measured values, and in some cases within 25 % of measured values. The techniques in the modeling guide reduced variability to the goal of + 5 % for the case under study. 4. Demonstrate the performance and design versatility of a high performance fan. A 'swept blade mixed flow' fan was rapid prototyped from cast aluminum for a performance demonstration on a small construction machine. The fan was mounted directly in place of the conventional fan (relatively close to the engine). The goal was to provide equal airflow at constant fan speed, with 75 % of the input power and 5 dB quieter than the conventional fan. The result was a significant loss in flow with the prototype due to its sensitivity to downstream blockage. This sensitivity to downstream blockage affects flow, efficiency, and noise all negatively, and further development was terminated. 5. Develop a high efficiency variable speed fan drive to replace existing slipping clutch style fan drives. The goal for this task was to provide a continuously variable speed fan drive with an efficiency of 95 %+ at max speed, and losses no greater than at max speed as the fan speed would vary throughout its entire speed range. The process developed to quantify the fuel savings potential of a variable speed fan drive has produced a simple tool to predict the fuel savings of a variable speed drive, and has sparked significant interest in the use of variable speed fan drive for Tier 3 emissions compliant machines. The proposed dual ratio slipping clutch variable speed fan drive can provide a more efficient system than a conventional single ratio slipping clutch fan drive, but could not meet the established performance goals of this task, so this task was halted in a gate review {{prior to the start of}} detailed design. 6. Develop a cooling system air filtration device to allow the use of automotive style high performance heat exchangers currently in off road machines. The goal of this task was to provide a radiator air filtration system that could allow high fin density, louvered radiators to operate in a find dust application with the same resistance to fouling as a current production off-road radiator design. Initial sensitivity testing demonstrated that fan speed has a significant impact on the fouling of <b>radiator</b> <b>cores</b> due to fine dusts, so machines equipped with continuously variable speed fan drives would be expected to have more radiator debris fouling problems than a machine with a constant speed fan. Filtration concepts looked at a wide range of filtration technologies, but the combination of pressure drop constraints and the small size of the debris to be filtered made this a futile exercise. The most successful technologies evaluated all incorporate some way to increase the Reynolds number inside the heat exchanger air flow path. A form of an 'air knife' concept has emerged as the most promising technology to pursue...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented research {{is to develop a}} novel, ink-jet printed, chipless, passive, wireless sensor topology, which can radiate in a near isotropic pattern without interference from embedded devices, for use in dispersed sensor networks. This objective includes the development of a hardware based, uniquely identifiable, collision avoidance communication method, and an integrated sensor system that is easily integrated into the topology. Wireless sensor networks can be and are used in military, medical and industrial applications; and the demand for them is ever growing. However, current sensor networks have various trade-offs and limitations, including cost, number of distinguishable nodes, and ease of manufacturing. These trade-offs lead to unique sensors needing to be designed for each situation. To develop a widely used module, a topology must be developed that can meet as many demands as possible with fair tradeoffs. Many of the above proposed criteria for the topology are already integrated into RFID technology. Therefore, much of the research is the application and advancement of current RFID technology for the purpose of designing the topology. The research begins with the theory and design of conformal artificial magnetic conductors, which is used in the design of a near isotropic <b>radiator</b> and isolated <b>core</b> for device embedding. Then, novel fabrication techniques will be investigated and deployed in the fabrication of the topology. Next, a novel "smart skin" sensor is developed which is easily integrated into the desired fabrication technique. Finally, an anti-collision RFID circuit for on-tag placement, which is based on frequency-doubling transceivers, is designed, which can also be easily integrated into the final topology. This module is designed for use with a variety of different sensors. This versatility gives it ruggedness for use in many different environments. For proof of concept, this topology is fabricated and tested against current commercially sold tags. Through the design and testing of the radiator, circuitry, and embedded sensors, it is shown that this design is a suitable topology for use in many different environments and applications. Ph.

40|$|The {{research}} on millimeter-wave (mm-wave) silicon-based integrated 3 D imaging radar has gained tremendous attention in academia {{over the past}} decade. Compared with conventional 2 D imaging, 3 D imaging captures both 1 D depth information and 2 D intensity maps. Impulse-based 3 D imaging radar can also obtains more constitutional information of objects, like spectroscopy, so as to potentially have material identification functionality with 3 D imaging simultaneously. The main objectives in the roadmapping of silicon integrated 3 D imaging radar are higher image resolution, a larger image range and shorter acquisition time. With the dramatically improved performance of silicon transistors, mm-wave circuits using CMOS and BiCMOS technologies can generate picosecond-level impulses but with small RF power. Shorter impulses provide higher image resolution, but small RF power limits image range. Spatially coherent impulse combining from multiple silicon circuits is {{the solution to this}} problem. Compared with narrow-band phased-arrays that perform only 2 D spatial filtering and have range-ambiguity problems, impulse-radiating arrays are capable of performing 3 D spatial filtering that enhances the imaging sensitivity of a certain point in 3 D space without sacrificing image resolution. Therefore, impulse-based MIMO imaging radar can achieve both high resolution and a large image range simultaneously. In this present work, a 60 ps impulse radiator with an on-chip antenna is implemented in the IBM 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS process technology. The impulse <b>radiator</b> is the <b>core</b> element of the synthetic arrays that are used to perform 3 D imaging in this thesis. A pulsed-VCO-based architecture is designed based on an asymmetric cross-coupled pulsed VCO to convert a digital input signal to radiated impulses. The deliberate asymmetry in the pulsed VCO is introduced to minimize the timing jitter of the radiated impulses in order to achieve spatially coherent impulse combining with high efficiency. The radiated impulses have a record RMS jitter of 178 fs with 64 averaging when the input trigger signal has a RMS jitter of 150 fs. Two widely spaced impulse radiators are used to perform spatially coherent impulse combining with an efficiency of 98. 7 %. As the first step in demonstrating impulse-based MIMO 3 D imaging radar, in this work, custom synthetic array imaging systems were built based on the proposed silicon-based integrated impulse radiator. 3 D imaging of metallic and dielectric objects (rocks immersed in oil) have been performed successfully. A depth accuracy of 27 um, a depth resolution of 9 mm and a lateral resolution of 8 mm at 10 cm distance in the air have been achieved. To the author’s knowledge, this work demonstrates the first high-resolution 3 D images that are generated by using synthetic array imaging systems based on a fully-integrated impulse radiator in silicon. Future work includes implementing fully integrated impulse transceivers and fully integrated impulse-based MIMO 3 D imaging radar with independent time-delay controls...|$|R
