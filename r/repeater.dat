5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple <b>repeater,</b> broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E

Both TCN-9 and ATN-7 began purchasing several hours of first-run American television programming from WIN-4, following contractual arrangements signed by Murdoch. Throughout this period WIN-4 expanded its <b>repeater</b> transmissions to include Moruya, Batemans Bay, Narooma, Bega and Eden. Local programming and the station's near-monopoly in the area meant that by 1973, viewership had increased to occupy 63 percent of the audience.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line <b>repeater</b> was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma <b>repeater</b> flares, are associated with magnetars within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E

5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma <b>repeater</b> (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E

25|$|An amateur radio <b>repeater</b> is a {{specialty}} amateur radio station that extends {{the range of}} communications for other stations.

If a <b>repeater</b> station is in a favorable location, such as on a tall tower, {{the top of a}} tall building, or on a mountaintop, stations that otherwise {{would not be able to}} communicate with each other can each use the <b>repeater</b> and establish two-way communications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Very high {{frequency}} (VHF) {{is widely used}} in radio and television broadcasting. In order {{to improve the quality}} of service (QoS) and signal transmission distance, the <b>repeaters</b> be applied to lengthen the transmitting distance of VHF and expand the coverage of radio stations. Under ensuring the QoS, the reduction cost is very important. In this paper, focusing on the different coverage of <b>repeaters,</b> we discuss the minimum number of <b>repeaters</b> to cover a whole circular area, and the square model and cellular model are proposed. Then we analyze the case in view of the simplex communication and duplex communication. Furthermore, the influence of the location of the radio station to the minimum number of <b>repeaters</b> needed is discussed. Finally, we discuss how the minimum number of <b>repeaters</b> changes with the change of the numbers of radio stations. The minimum number of <b>repeaters</b> to cover the circle area will increase as the radius of the <b>repeaters</b> coverage decreases. The radio station in the center of the circle flat can broadcast to the farthest area and the radio station in the fringe area can’t broadcast to farther area. In simplex communication, the minimum number of <b>repeaters</b> with n radio stations in the circle are is n- 1 times greater than that with only one radio station...|$|R
