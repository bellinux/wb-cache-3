Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to interfere in the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through {{the table with a}} Splash. Near the end of the match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E
5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room and no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.|$|E

While their backs were turned, a crew member (either a stoker or trimmer) snuck in and attempted to steal Phillips's lifebelt. Bride saw and grabbed the man as Phillips stood up and knocked the crew member out. The water was beginning to flood the wireless room as they both <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wireless room, leaving the unconscious crewman where he fell.

25|$|On {{the first}} play of the third quarter, Jets linebacker Kevin McArthur {{increased}} his team's lead to 28-6 by returning an interception 21 yards for a touchdown, {{which would be the}} only score of the quarter. Most of it would be taken up by the Chiefs' ensuing drive, which ended with a failed fourth and 1 conversion attempt. In the fourth quarter, they finally managed to score when defensive back Albert Lewis recovered a blocked punt in the end zone for a touchdown. However, this was quickly countered on the Jets next possession as Ryan completed a 38-yard pass to Wesley Walker before finishing it with a 6-yard touchdown throw to tight end Billy Griggs (his first NFL reception). The only other score of the game would be a safety when Jets punter Dave Jennings <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end zone in the game's closing minutes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{successful}} action of NVA armor in Vietnam {{was against the}} Lang Vei Special Forces camp on 6/7 February 1968 (they had already {{been used in the}} preceding Battle of Ban Houei Sane, which was just across the border in Laos however). Thirteen PT-76s, of the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment spearheaded an assault against approximately 24 Green Berets, 500 ARVN irregulars and 350 Laotian Royal soldiers. The defenders fought back with their 106mm M40 recoilless rifle (one at the entrance took out three PT-76s until it was knocked out), and ineffectively with M72 LAWs (one-shot disposable 66mm Light Anti-Tank Weapon). They requested support from nearby Khe Sanh, which was unable to help, as it too was under siege. The Lang Vei camp was overrun, with the PT-76s using their turret-mounted spotlight to machine gun any irregulars who panicked and <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underground bunkers. A few survivors broke out and were airlifted to safety.|$|E

25|$|In his 1998 {{documentary}} Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows, Hart {{said that}} his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children {{that he would never}} double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his job than participate in a screwjob. However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence. This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of WWE Confidential, claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring, through the crowd and remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.|$|E
25|$|A {{traveler}} going {{west from}} China must go either {{north of the}} Tian Shan through Dzungaria or south of the Tian Shan through the Tarim Basin. Trade usually took the southern route and migrations the northern. This is most likely because the Tarim leads to the Ferghana Valley and Iran, while Dzungaria leads only to the open steppe. The difficulty with the southern route was the high mountains between the Tarim and Ferghana. There is also another reason. The Taklamakan Desert of the Tarim is too dry to support much grass, and therefore lacked nomads likely to rob caravans. Its inhabitants lived mostly in oases formed where rivers <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains into the desert. These were inhabited by peasants who were unwarlike and merchants who {{had an interest in}} keeping trade running smoothly. On the other hand, Dzungaria had a fair amount of grass, few towns to base soldiers in and no significant mountain barriers to the west. Therefore, trade went south and migrations north.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} rivalry scripted into Armageddon on the SmackDown brand {{was between}} Batista, Edge, and The Undertaker, over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Survivor Series, Batista and Undertaker fought in a Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship. Edge (who was disguised as a cameraman at ringside) interfered and cost Undertaker the match. He was then given a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship on the November 30, 2007 episode of SmackDown by SmackDown! general manager Vickie Guerrero, who was his storyline love interest. The same night Batista faced Edge for the World title. Batista looked set to retain his title once again, but Undertaker interfered and chokeslammed Batista, but Edge <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring to escape similar treatment. Theodore Long returned as Assistant general manager and booked Batista to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Edge and the Undertaker in a Triple Threat match at Armageddon.|$|E

Major Hughes-Onslow rushed to the sentry box and raised the alarm. Hearing it, Hakim and Bet-Zuri turned onto a side street. They had very nearly gotten away when an Egyptian motorcycle policeman, El-Amin Mahomed Abdullah, caught up to them. Hakim and Bet-Zuri were determined not to injure any Egyptians in their operation, and so {{did not attempt to}} shoot him off his motorcycle. Rather, Bet-Zuri fired a volley of warning shots in his direction, which he ignored. Abdullah then dismounted and ordered him to drop his weapon. Bet-Zuri attempted to shoot out the motorcycle's tires, but found that his pistol had run out of ammunition, and as he attempted to reload it, Abdullah fired, hitting Bet-Zuri in the chest. Hearing the commotion, Hakim turned back to help Bet-Zuri, and within minutes, another policeman appeared, and the two were placed under arrest.|$|E
25|$|Following a punt {{from each}} team, Brooks' 7-yard punt return gave the Packers {{the ball on}} their 49-yard line, where they {{proceeded}} to drive to a Jacke 28-yard field goal at the 5:35 mark to make it 16–10. Once again the Lions got a big boost from their special teams unit, this time a 27-yard return by Eric Lynch that gave them a first down on the Packers 49. Detroit subsequently drove to the Green Bay 11, including a 3-yard sneak by Krieg on fourth down and 1. But {{over the next three}} plays, Sanders gained two yards, Krieg threw an incomplete pass, and then he was sacked by linebacker Bryce Paup for a 6-yard loss. On fourth down and 14 from the 17-yard line, Detroit wide receiver Herman Moore caught Krieg's pass {{at the back of the}} end zone, but came out of bounds past the end line, causing a turnover on downs. Afterwards, Green Bay ran out the rest of the clock, giving up an intentional safety when punter Craig Hentrich <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end zone on the last play of the contest.|$|E
