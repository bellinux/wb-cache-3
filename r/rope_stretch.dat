5000|$|Consider a {{variation}} {{in which the}} rope stretches suddenly and instantaneously before each second, so that the target-point moves from [...] to [...] at time , and from [...] to [...] at time , etc. Many versions of the problem have the <b>rope</b> <b>stretch</b> {{at the end of}} each second, but by having the <b>rope</b> <b>stretch</b> before each second we have disadvantaged the ant in its goal, so we can be sure that if the ant can reach the target-point in this variation then it certainly can in the original problem or indeed in variants where the rope stretches {{at the end of each}} second.|$|E
50|$|The lead climber {{typically}} {{connects the}} rope {{to the protection}} with carabiners or quickdraws. If the lead climber falls, they will fall twice {{the length of the}} rope from the last protection point, plus <b>rope</b> <b>stretch</b> (typically 5% to 8% of the rope out), plus slack. If any of the gear breaks or pulls out of the rock or if the belayer fails to lock off the belay device immediately, the fall will be significantly longer. Thus if a climber is 2 meters above the last protection they will fall 2 meters to the protection, 2 meters below the protection, plus <b>rope</b> <b>stretch</b> (typ., 0.10-0.16 m) and slack, for a total fall of over 4 meters.|$|E
5000|$|Whippers {{can be very}} {{dramatic}} falls, often for quite a distance. The distance of a whipper is determined {{by a number of}} factors, including <b>rope</b> <b>stretch,</b> any slack in the rope before the climber is ejected, and discrepancies in the relative weights between the climber and the belayer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{mechanics}} behind {{the interaction of}} a flexible fibre rope wound around a typical sailing yacht winch are investigated. Relevant research is discussed {{and the effect of}} coil-to-coil contact is researched. The capstan friction equation is investigated and the results found during testing tend to agree with the theory when there is no coil-to-coil contact. The coefficient of friction is found to be 0. 1765 ± 3. 5 % for the no-contact configuration. Coil-to-coil contact is investigated for wrap angles of greater than 360 ˚, this contact is found to be detrimental to the efficiency of the winch to rope interface. Various theoretical models are proposed to explain and understand the results. The most feasible being relative movement between the coil due to <b>rope</b> <b>stretch.</b> Future areas of research are discussed, as are improvements to the testing apparatus...|$|E
5000|$|Ropes {{used for}} {{climbing}} {{can be divided}} into two classes: dynamic ropes and low elongation ropes (sometimes called [...] "static" [...] ropes). Dynamic ropes are designed to absorb the energy of a falling climber, and are usually used as Belaying ropes. When a climber falls, the <b>rope</b> <b>stretches,</b> reducing the maximum force experienced by the climber, their belayer, and equipment. Low elongation <b>ropes</b> <b>stretch</b> much less, and are usually used in anchoring systems. They are also used for abseiling (rappelling) and as fixed ropes climbed with ascenders.|$|R

50|$|The first {{surveyors}} to use {{ropes and}} plumbs {{may have been}} Egyptian. <b>Rope</b> <b>stretching</b> technology spread to ancient Greece and India, where it stimulated the development of geometry and mathematics. Some {{think that it was}} India that influenced Greece.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, the Japanese {{improved}} {{this method}} by placing nets of synthetic material tied to bamboo poles. This effectively doubled the production. A cheaper variant {{of this method}} is called the hibi method — simple <b>ropes</b> <b>stretched</b> between bamboo poles.|$|R

60|$|A rock {{it proved}} to be, to the discomfiture of Slagg and Stumps; but the rock was not without interest, for it was soon seen that a rope was {{attached}} to it, and that the <b>rope,</b> <b>stretching</b> across {{the entrance to a}} creek, was lost in the foliage on the side opposite to the rock.|$|R
60|$|The cargo-lighter, {{relieved}} of its precious burden, rocked feebly, half-afloat, with her fore-foot on the sand.

50|$|Although {{solving the}} problem appears to require {{analytical}} techniques, it can actually be answered by a combinatorial argument by considering a variation in which the <b>rope</b> <b>stretches</b> suddenly and instantaneously each second rather than stretching continuously. Indeed, the problem is sometimes stated in these terms, and the following argument is a generalisation of one set out by Martin Gardner, originally in Scientific American and later reprinted.|$|R
50|$|The twigs {{are first}} tied {{together}} loosely. They are then {{hung on a}} pole or a <b>rope</b> <b>stretched</b> under a canopy so they avoid direct sunlight.

The brooms are then densely stacked on shelves in a dry, well-ventilated place.|$|R

50|$|The rope is the {{defining}} characteristic of an elevated passenger ropeway. The <b>rope</b> <b>stretches</b> and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it bends and flexes as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The fibre core contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly lubricated to ensure safe operation and long life.|$|R

25|$|On January 8, 1864, David O. Dodd {{was brought}} to the grounds of his former school, St. John's, just east of the Little Rock Arsenal, for his hanging. A crowd of 5,000-6,000 {{gathered}} to watch. Dodd stood on the tailgate of a wagon under the noose. The executioner, named Dekay, fixed the rope around David's neck and the prop was knocked from under the tailgate. The <b>rope</b> <b>stretched</b> and the boy dangled, strangling to death over a full five minutes. Onlookers and Union soldiers became ill.|$|R
50|$|In 1880 {{the ferry}} was still using chains, {{replaced}} by cables between 1878 and 1887. They are first seen in pictures of Floating Bridge No. 7, built in 1892 by Day, Summers and Co. Each rope weighed nearly 2 tons {{and had an}} average life of nine months in normal use. Each end was attached to a short length of chain that was connected to counterbalance weights housed in chain wells to maintain tension. As the <b>ropes</b> <b>stretched</b> with use, chain links were removed to compensate.|$|R
