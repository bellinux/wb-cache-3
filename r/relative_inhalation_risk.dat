40|$|Diesel {{vehicles}} {{are an important}} source of emission of air pollutants, particularly toxic compounds with potential health impacts. Current developments in engine design and fuel quality are expected to reduce these emissions, but many older vehicles will make a major contribution to urban pollutant concentrations and related health impacts for many years. In this study the <b>relative</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk</b> of emissions of a range of toxic compounds are reported using data from a study of in-service vehicles driven through urban drive cycles using a range of diesel fuel formulations. The fuels ranged in sulfur content from 24 to 1700 ppm, and in total aromatics from 7. 7 to 33 mass%. Effects of vehicle type and fuel composition on the risk of emissions of a range of toxic species are reported. The results show that the inhalation cancer risk is dominated for most of the vehicles and the testing modes by emissions of the combustion derived products, particularly benzene, naphthalene, and formaldehyde, and not by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a) pyrene. Based on the relative risk represented by these toxic species, improved fuel quality does not result in significant reductions in the relative inhalation cancer risk. However, this conclusion may be affected by additional toxic species and fine particles present in diesel exhaust, which were not included in this study. 8 page(s...|$|E

Eleven of 19 types of samples (58 %) demonstrated formaldehyde concentrations higher than the World Health Organization exposure limit (a 30 -min average of 100 μg m− 3). Different positive significant correlations between glyoxal/methylglyoxal and formaldehyde/acetaldehyde concentrations were observed, suggesting possible different characteristics in emissions between two pairs of carbonyl compounds.

Re s u l t s: We estimated the number of lifetime excess cancer cases due to exposure to the 17 carcinogenic PAHs [12 priority pollutant PAHs and five high-molecular-weight (302 Da) PAHs (MW 302 PAHs) ] to range from 6. 5 to 518 per million people for the source control period concentrations and from 12. 2 to 964 per million people for the nonsource control period concentrations.

40|$|Each {{year more}} people die from work-related {{diseases}} than are killed in industrial accidents. Therefore {{it is essential}} to evaluate occupational health aspect during the process design. Early evaluation of safety, health, and environmental (SHE) performance is advantageous, since the opportunities to make the process inherently benign are greater and the cost therefore lower. The methods for occupational health assessments need to be tailored to speci?c design stages, since the data availability is changing as the design proceeds. In this paper, an index-based method called the Occupational Health Index (OHI) is presented for the basic engineering stage. The OHI is the ?nal of the three methods in series proposed for health assessment in development and design stages. The OHI is based on the information available in piping and instrumentation diagrams (PIDs) and the plot plan. Four health aspects are considered; chronic <b>inhalation</b> <b>risks</b> to noncarcinogens and carcinogens, acute <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk,</b> and dermal/eye risk.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the significance of}} meteorology and postspray volatilization of methamidophos (an organophosphorus insecticide) in assessing potential <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk</b> to children in an agricultural community. We combined fluxes from sources and dispersion modeling {{with a range of}} possible local meteorology to create output to study the variability in potential community exposure as a result of changing temperature, wind speeds and wind directions. This work is based on an aerial spray drift study where air sampling measurements of methamidophos were made before, during and after a spray event were used to examine acute <b>inhalation</b> <b>risk</b> for children living in an Eastern Washington State community in close proximity (between 15 and 200 [*]m) to sprayed potato fields. We compared the measured average air concentrations of methamidophos in the community to a “no observed adverse effect level” for subchronic inhalation to characterize acute and subchronic <b>inhalation</b> <b>risks.</b> The baseline estimates of inhalation exposure were below Environment Protection Agency 2 ̆ 7 s (EPA) level of concern based on a target margin of exposure of 300. As meteorological conditions during and after spraying influence the amount of material moving into areas where children reside we used historical meteorological data to drive model simulations that predicted likely air residue concentrations under different wind and temperature conditions. We also added variability to the decay constant and initial emission fluxes to create a 2 -D simulation of estimated air concentrations in the community near the fields. This work provides a methodological framework for the assessment of air concentrations of pesticides from agricultural sprays in the absence of extended measurements, although including variability from meteorological conditions. The deterministic as well as the probabilistic risk analyses in this study indicated that postspray volatilization in the specific spray situation analyzed (methamidophos applied on potato fields in Eastern Washington) did not pose acute or subchronic risks as defined by the EPA. However, this study did not consider any pathway of exposure other than inhalation (e. g. diet, dermal, etc.) and the risk assessment should be evaluated in that context...|$|R

The mass concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PBDD/Fs is 818 - 5748 fg m(- 3) {{with an average of}} 2490 fg m(- 3). The highest concentration was observed at site XS in February, 2011 and the lowest was at site BS in July 2011. The TEQ concentrations of PBDD/Fs ranged from 73. 3 to 640 fg I-TEQ m(- 3), with an average of 190 fg I-TEQ m(- 3). The dominant contributor to total I-TEQ value is 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeBDF, with an average contribution of 35 %. The PBDD/Fs at six sampling sites did not show obvious spatial variation. The concentration exhibits obvious seasonal variation, so atmospheric PBDD/F concentrations at six sample sites were much higher in winter than in summer. Residents in Beijing were exposed to PBDD/Fs with the daily inhalation doses being 39 - 138 fg I-TEQ kg(- 1) day(- 1) for adult and 69 - 245 fg TEQ kg(- 1) day(- 1) for children in winter, but in summer, the values were 10 - 33 for adult and 18 - 59 for children.
