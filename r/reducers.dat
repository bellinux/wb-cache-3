5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility <b>reducers</b> and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility <b>reducers</b> that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility <b>reducers),</b> while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E
50|$|Transitivity holds {{because it}} is {{possible}} to feed the output tape of one <b>reducer</b> (A&rarr;B) to another (B&rarr;C). At first glance, this seems incorrect because the A&rarr;C <b>reducer</b> needs to store the output tape from the A&rarr;B <b>reducer</b> onto the work tape in order to feed it into the B&rarr;C <b>reducer,</b> but this is not true. Each time the B&rarr;C <b>reducer</b> needs to access its input tape, the A&rarr;C <b>reducer</b> can re-run the A&rarr;B <b>reducer,</b> and so the output of the A&rarr;B <b>reducer</b> never needs to be stored entirely at once.|$|R

40|$|Actual Quantifiability is {{a concept}} in MapReduce {{that is based on}} two assumptions: (1) every mapper is cautious, i. e., does not exclude any <b>reducer’s</b> {{key-value}} split pattern choice from consideration, and (2) every mapper respects the <b>reducer’s</b> key-value split pattern preferences, i. e., deems one <b>reducer’s</b> key-value split pattern choice to be infinitely more likely than another whenever it premises the <b>reducer</b> to prefer the one to the other. In this paper we provide a new approach for actual quantifiability, by assuming that mappers have asymmetric key-value split pattern about the <b>reducer’s</b> key-value utilities. We show that, if the uncertainty of each mapper about the <b>reducer’s</b> key-value utilities vanishes gradually in some regular manner, then the key-value split pattern choices it can quantifiably make under common conjecture in quantifiability are all actually quantifiable in the original MapReduce with no uncertainty about the <b>reducer’s</b> utilities...|$|R

2500|$|Some herbivores use feeding {{behaviors}} {{that are capable of}} disarming the defenses of their host plants. [...] One such plant defensive strategy is the use of latex and resin canals that contain sticky toxins and digestibility <b>reducers.</b> [...] These canal systems store fluids under pressure, and when ruptured (i.e. from herbivory) secondary metabolic products flow to the release point. [...] Herbivores can evade this defense, however, by damaging the leaf veins. [...] This technique minimizes the outflow of latex or resin beyond the cut and allows herbivores to freely feed above the damaged section. [...] Several strategies are employed by herbivores to relieve canal pressure, including vein cutting and trenching. The technique used by the herbivore corresponds to the architecture of the canal system. Dussourd and Denno examined the behavior of 33 species of insect herbivores on 10 families of plants with canals and found that herbivores on plants with branching canal systems used vein cutting, while herbivores found on plants with net-like canal systems employed trenching to evade plant defenses.|$|E

The viscoelasticity and drag reduction performance of the drag <b>reducer</b> with different microstructures were then investigated. Further, the effects of the microstructure of the drag <b>reducer</b> on the viscoelasticity and drag reduction performance of slick-water were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the viscoelasticity of slick-water is governed by the microstructure of the drag <b>reducer,</b> which exhibits a network structure. In addition, the drag reduction performance is related to the viscoelasticity. At low flow rates, the drag reduction performance is dominantly influenced by viscosity, whereas, at high flow rates, it is governed mainly by elasticity.
