The stability limit of the rotor speed is obtained for a system consisting of a single rotor disc {{in the middle of}} a flexible shaft having identical plain cylindrical journal bearings at the ends. The threshold speed of instability for a <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> on powder lubricated journal bearing is compared with that of oil lubricated journal bearing.

40|$|Whirl flutter and {{the effect}} of pitch-flap {{coupling}} on teetering motion of a wind turbine were investigated. The equations of motion are derived for an idealized five-degree-of-freedom mathematical model of a horizontal-axis wind turbine with a two-bladed teetering rotor.

40|$|In {{a number}} of {{technological}} applications the <b>rotors</b> <b>supported</b> by fluid film bearings have the discs submerged in various liquids. Lateral vibration of such rotors is significantly influenced by their interaction with the medium in the surrounding space. A computer modelling method represents an important tool for investigation of their behaviour. The approach to analysis of vibration of small amplitudes of structures submerged in liquids is based on modification of the Navier Stokes equations leading to the Laplace one. The fluid film bearings are usually implemented into the computational models by means of nonlinear force couplings. The pressure distribution in the full oil film is governed by a Reynolds equation and in cavitated areas the pressure remains constant.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an investigation which {{was carried out}} under the Interdisciplinary Higher Degres (IHD) Scheme of The University of Aston in Birmingham. The investigation, which involved joint collaboration between the IHD scheme, the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and G. E. C. Turbine Generators Limited, was concerned with hydrostatic bearing characteristics and of how hydrostatic bearings {{could be used to}} enable turbine generator <b>rotor</b> <b>support</b> impedances to be controlled to give an improved rotor dynamic response. Turbine generator rotor critical speeds are determined not only by the mass and flexibility of the rotor itself, which are relatively easily predicted, but also by the dynamic characteristics of the bearing oil film, pedestal, and foundations. It is because of the difficulty in accurately predicting the <b>rotor</b> <b>support</b> characteristics that the designer has a problem in ensuring that a rotor's normal running speed is not close to one of its critical speeds. The consequence of this situation is that some rotors do have critical speeds close to their normal running speed and the resulting high levels of vibration cause noise, high rotor stresses, and a shortening of bearing life. A combined theoretical and experimental investigation of the effects of mounting the normal rotor journal bearing in a hydrostatic bearing was carried out. The purpose of the work was to show that by changing the oil flow resistance offered by capillaries connecting accumulators to the hydrostatic bearing, the overall <b>rotor</b> <b>support</b> characteristics could be tuned to enable rotor critical speeds to be moved at will. Testing of a combined journal and hydrostatic bearing has confirmed the theory of its operation and a theoretical study of a full size machine showed that its critical speed could be moved by over 350 rpm and that its rotor vibration at running speed could be reduced by 80 %...|$|E
40|$|Most {{high speed}} {{cryogenic}} turbopumps for liquid propulsion rocket engines currently use ball or roller contact bearings for <b>rotor</b> <b>support.</b> The operating speeds, loads, clearances, and environments of these pumps combine to make bearing wear a limiting factor on turbopump life. An {{example is the}} high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) used in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Although the HPOTP design life is 27, 000 seconds at 30, 000 rpms, or approximately 50 missions, bearings must currently be replaced after 2 missions. One solution to the bearing wear problem in the HPOTP, {{as well as in}} future turbopump designs, is the utilization of fluid film bearings in lieu of continuous contact bearings. Hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, and damping seal bearings are all replacement candidates for contact bearings in rocket engine high speed turbomachinery. These three types of fluid film bearings have different operating characteristics, but they share a common set of mechanical design opportunities and difficulties. Results of research to define some of the mechanical design issues are given. Problems considered include transient strat/stop rub, non-operational <b>rotor</b> <b>support,</b> bearing wear inspection and measurement, and bearing fluid supply route.

The first study concerns the measurement by means of dynamic models of the forces and moments at the hubs of various rotor configurations. study show that the periodic components of the forces and moments are highly dependent on both the rotor configuration and the flight condition. The results of this The second study treats the problem of resonance amplifications of rotor-blade stress and shows that by using multiple flapping hinges or flex-joints {{it is possible to}} control the natural frequencies of the rotor blade so that conditions of resonance between the frequencies of the aerodynamic input forces and the natural frequencies of the lower blade modes are avoided for all rotor speeds. Two studies of the stability of rotor aircraft axe also discussed.

The consideration of the <b>rotor</b> <b>support</b> system as a two-degree-of-freedom system predicts additional unstable ranges of rotor speed not predicted by former analyses.

40|$|The {{stability}} of a <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> in journal bearings is highly concerned in the practice. The change in oil temperature {{or some other}} disturbances, e. g. earthquake, fluctuations in the net voltage, can bring the rotor in unstable motion. The in{{stability of}} a <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> in journal bearings, however may not completely be avoided by a bearing design or choice. Hence, it is desirable to suppress the instability of a rotor at any time, when some disturbances occur. The vibration of a rotor excited by imbalance is stationary and periodic. It should be suppressed by balancing the rotor, but not by a control system. To this end, an active control method is applied to a rotor running in journal bearings, which only activates when {{the motion of the}} rotor tends to be unstable, but doesn't interfere with the stationary periodic motion resulting from imbalance. In this way both the vibration of the rotor and the forces transmitted to foundation will be reduced. In this work, at first the dynamic behaviour of the rotor running in journal bearings is summarized, so that one can easily understand the background of the problem. Then the so-called Phase-Locked Delayed Feedback control method is introduced, using a one-degree of freedom system as object. The control method is applied to a Jeffcott <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> in journal bearings and the control parameters are acquired according to the characteristic equation or to an optimal process. The control system will enlarge the stability boundary of the rotor, when it activates. (orig.)
