50|$|The fibula is a {{multilayered}} structure. Its face {{consists of}} a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of 58 mm. This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, 3 mm thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, 78 mm in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate {{was filled with a}} now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration {{consists of a}} quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another <b>ribbed</b> <b>band.</b> Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.|$|E

This complicated matters, as both treaty groups had land boundaries that overlapped each other. Self-governance seemed to be the issue between the two groups, as both wanted to have their say in the agreement. This halted the negotiations in 1994 while the Canadian government explored the boundary and self-government issue. A new mandate in April 1997 allowed negotiation of a [...] "joint land claims and self-government agreement with the Dogrib Treaty 11 Council" [...] (Treaty No. 11 Dogrib).

The diagnosis centers upon a thorough history and the exclusion of other causes of arm and shoulder pain utilizing a strict flow pattern of differential diagnosis. Angiography and electromyography are of limited value and are only performed in selected cases. Operation should be reserved for the thoroughly evaluated patient who continues to have pain despite adequate conservative therapy.

40|$|The {{thoracic}} outlet syndromes {{encompass the}} diverse clinical entities affecting the brachial plexus or subclavian artery including cervical <b>ribs</b> or <b>bands.</b> Thoracic outlet syndrome are {{often difficult to}} diagnose on existing clinical and electrophysiological criteria and new diagnostic methods are necessary. This study reports our experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brachial plexus in 20 patients with suspected thoracic outlet syndrome. The distribution of pain and sensory disturbance varied widely, weakness and wasting usually affected C 8 /T 1 innervated muscles, and electrophysiology showed combinations of reduced sensory nerve action potentials from {{the fourth and fifth}} digits, and prolonged F-responses or tendon reflex latencies. The MRI study was interpreted blind. Deviation of the brachial plexus was recorded in 19 out of the 24 symptomatic sides (sensitivity 79 %). Absence of distortion was correctly identified in 14 out of 16 asymptomatic sides (specificity 87. 5 %). The false positive rate was 9. 5 %. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated all seven cervical ribs visible on plain cervical spine radiographs. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed a band-like structure extending from the C 7 transverse process in 25 out of 33 sides; similar structures were detected in three out of 18 sides in control subjects. These MRI bands often underlay the brachial plexus distortion observed in our patients. We also observed instances of plexus distortion by post-traumatic callus of the first rib, and by a hypertrophied serratus anterior muscle. If they did not demonstrate a cervical rib, plain cervical spine radiographs had no value in predicting brachial plexus distortion. We believe MRI to be of potential value in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome by (i) demonstrating deviation or distortion of nerves or blood vessels; (ii) suggesting the presence of radiographically invisible bands; (iii) disclosing other causes of thoracic outlet syndrome apart from <b>ribs</b> or <b>bands...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{high status}} four ton slab, forty {{centimetres}} thick and measuring two metres by two metres, was unearthed by archaeologists excavating {{at the site}} of a major Pictish Royal centre. Using a giant crane to remove the slab, known as a capstone, a burial chamber was revealed containing what little remained of a Bronze Age body and grave goods. The underside of the capstone had been engraved with a spiral and axe shape. The cist, built using large sandstone slabs in a rectangular shape, had several axes and other weapon engravings where the head of the deceased would have been positioned. Such carvings in that part of Scotland are very rare although there are similar carvings at Kilmartin Glen, in Argyll. Thought to be of high social standing, the body had been laid on a bed of white quartz pebbles and an interwoven lattice of birch bark. Amongst the grave goods were a dozen personal possessions which included a leather bag, wooden objects and a bronze dagger with a <b>ribbed</b> gold <b>band</b> around the hilt. The discovery of plant matter among the remains were later found to be flowers, possibly meadowsweet, and is the first evidence that Bronze Age people placed flowers with their dead. Radiocarbon tests and the style of metalwork found in the grave suggest that the tomb dates from between 1950 BC and 2100 BC. Prehistorian Dr. Noble has said of the find: [...] "The sheer size of the stone slabs used to construct the tomb, the extremely rare rock engravings, the rare preservation of the leather, wood, and bark items and the high status location make this a find of both national and international importance".|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{thoracic}} outlet syndrome. {{can present}} neurogenic, venous, and/o arterialsymptoms due to compression of the neurovascular structures by the scalene muscle, first <b>rib,</b> or fibrous <b>bands.</b> METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent decompressive surgery of the thoracic outlet via the supraclavicular approach. The indication for operation was compression of the subclavian artery in 7 instances (5 females and 2 males, aged 44 Â± 9), axillo-subclavian venous thrombosis in 6 instances (5 females and 1 male, aged 22 Â± 4), and brachial plexus irritation in 13 instances (9 females and 4 males, aged 35 Â± 6). Operation consisted of resection of the anterior scalene and medial {{aspect of the}} middle scalene muscles and brachial plexus neurolysis for neurogenic indication, with first rib resection reserved for vascular complications. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation including a history and physical examination followed by catheter-based venography to confirm or exclude the diagnosis and allowing for immediate treatment using thrombolysis. After thrombolysis, to prevent early recurrent thrombosis, patients should be maintained with systemic anticoagulation and surgery should be performed earlier in patients with severe residual SCV stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and thrombolytic therapy followed by operative first-rib resection produces the most favorable long-term outcome for the patients...|$|R
