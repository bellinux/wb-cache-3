40|$|Abstract. Root {{growth and}} saponin {{production}} in the <b>root</b> <b>culture</b> of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer were investigated under various pH values, concentrations of sucrose, nitrogen and phosphate and elicitors. The pH of a medium {{did not have a}} significant effect on root growth, but apparently affected the saponin content. The maximum saponin content of 0. 26 % was obtained at pH 6. 0. The optimal concentrations of sucrose, nitrogen and phosphate on root growth and saponin production were 30 g/l, 382. 7 mg/l and 40. 40 mg/l, respectively. Saponin biosynthesis was stimulated by the addition of panaxatriol saponin (PTS) and total saponin (TS). However, fresh weight in PTS was so low that the theoretical total saponin in TS treatment was higher than that in PTS treatment. Thus, it appears that TS is a better elicitor than PTS in the ginseng <b>root</b> <b>culture.</b> The saponin content in TS treated ginseng root was 0. 38 % and approximately 1. 5 -fold higher than the control.

We have recently demonstrated that Hypericum perforatum <b>root</b> <b>cultures</b> constitutively produce xanthones at higher levels than the root of the plant and that they respond to chitosan (CHIT) elicitation with a noteworthy increase in xanthone production. In the present study, CHIT was administered to H. perforatum <b>root</b> <b>cultures</b> using three different elicitation protocols, and the increase in xanthone production was evaluated. The best results (550 % xanthone increase) were obtained by subjecting the roots to a single elicitation with 200 mg l- 1 CHIT and maintaining the elicitor in the culture medium for 7 days. To discriminate the effect of CHIT from that of the solvent, control experiments were performed by administering AcOH alone at the same concentration used for CHIT solubilization. Unexpectedly, AcOH caused an increase in xanthone production comparable to that observed in response to CHIT. Feeding experiments with 13 C-labeled AcOH demonstrated that this compound was not incorporated into the xanthone skeleton. Other short-chain monocarboxylic acids (i. e., propionic and butyric acid) have little or no effect on the production of xanthones.

The effect of different physical factors can change root biomass and silymarin production which has been investigated in the present study. Methods: The effect of different physical factors of temperature (30 ºC/ 25 ºC, 25 ºC/ 25 ºC and 15 ºC/ 20 ºC in 16 h/ 8 h cycle) and pH (5, 5. 7, 6 and 7) were evaluated {{with respect to the}} root biomass and silymarin production in hairy <b>root</b> <b>cultures</b> of the plant. Results: Incubation temperature, 25 ºC / 25 ºC promoted the silymarin production in 4 -week old hairy roots (0. 18 mg/g DW) as compared with the cultures treated with 15 ºC/ 20 ºC and 30 ºC/ 25 ºC (0. 13 and 0. 12 mg/g DW, respectively). Maximal increases in biomass and silymarin accumulation occurred in the <b>root</b> <b>cultures</b> grown in pH 5 and 25 ºC/ 25 ºC (0. 45 g and 0. 26 mg/g DW). The content of silybin, isosilybin, silychristin, silydianin were 0. 025, 0. 024, 0. 061 and 0. 095 mg/g DW, respectively which were higher than those grown in higher pH. Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} suggest that 25 ºC/ 25 ºC and acidic environment of medium are beneficial for silymarin production using hairy <b>root</b> <b>cultures.</b> Furthermore, lipoxygenase (LOX) activity was strongly affected by pH which suggested that acidic environment may act as inducing signal for LOX activity and subsequently greater silymarin production...|$|R
