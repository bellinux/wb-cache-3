5000|$|Both hills {{were once}} crowned with castles {{in the time}} of Henry the Lion. They were built around 1100 by the Counts of Reinhausen, who had turned their ancestral seat in Reinhausen into an Augustinian monastery. Thereafter the castles changed hands several times. Finally around 1270, the Gleichen went to the Lords of Uslar. Soon {{afterwards}} the House of Uslar divided the assets between the two lines of Altengleichen and Neuengleichen. Neuengleichen fell in 1451 to the Landgraves of Hesse, whilst Altengleichen remained under Guelph rule. Not until the wake of the course of the Vienna Congress was ownership of Neuengleichen relinquished to the Kingdom of Hanover and from then <b>on</b> <b>re-transferred</b> back to the House of Uslar (at Altengleichen), which since 1825 had been called Uslar-Gleichen.The Gleichen castles were never captured in the numerous feuds, but had been abandoned in the 16th century.

40|$|Abstract. A {{replicated}} {{data object}} is a typed object that is stored redundantly at multiple locations in a distributed system. Each of the object’s operations has {{a set of}} quorums, which are sets of sites whose cooperation is needed to execute that operation. A quorum assignment associates each operation with its set of quorums. An operation’s quorums determine its availability, and the constraints governing an object’s quorum assignments determine the range of availability properties realizable by replication. In this paper, the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> quorum assignment imposed by three kinds of atomicity mechanisms {{found in the literature}} are analyzed: (1) serial schemes, in which replication and atomicity are implemented independently at different levels in the system, (2) static schemes, in which the transaction serialization order is predetermined, and (3) hybrid schemes in which the serialization order emerges dynamically. The following results are derived: (1) Although serial schemes place the strongest <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> concurrency, they place the weakest <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> availability. (2) Although hybrid and static mecha-nisms place incomparable <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> concurrency, hybrid mechanisms place weaker <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> availability. (3) Bounding the maximum depth of transaction nesting strengthens <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> concurrency for all classes, but weakens <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> availability for hybrid schemes only. Concurrency and availability are best considered as dual properties: A complete analysis of an atomicity mechanism should take both into account...|$|R

30|$|For EC, the {{threshold}} limit of 3  dS/m is selected because according to Table  1, for EC above 3  dS/m, there is severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use {{of water for}} irrigation while for EC values below 3  dS/m, there is no (where EC is below 0.7  dS/m) and a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. SAR of irrigation water {{except for a few}} locations is below 6, so under this situation according to Ayers and Westcot (1994) if EC is below 0.3  dS/m, there is a severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. As EC of groundwater is above 0.5  dS/m, there is no severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. Also for SAR between 0 and 3, in about 90  % of study area, EC of groundwater is above 0.7  dS/m and therefore there is no <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use. For SAR between 3 and 6, where EC is above 1.2  dS/m, there is no restriction and where EC is between 0.3 and 1.2  dS/m, there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use (Ayers and Westcot 1994). Therefore, we used a threshold limit of 3 for SAR. For both Na+ and Cl−, a critical limit of 3  meq/L is considered for producing probability maps. According to Ayers and Westcot (1994) there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> use of irrigation water with Na+ and Cl− above 3  meq/L for sprinkler irrigation. So the probability maps of exceeding 3 dS/m, 3, 3  meq/L and 3 are produced for EC, Cl−, Na + and SAR, respectively.|$|R
