The machine must simulate a person jumping on the trampoline to test the life of JumpSport’s fitness trampolines and kids’ trampolines. Partway through the design process, the objectives were altered and this senior project team was tasked with merging with another Cal Poly senior project group to create an all-inclusive test machine to accommodate both full-trampoline testing and individual bungee cord testing. The final design is centered on a <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> linkage driven by a servomotor. A load cell is bolted {{to the end of}} the <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> for force measurements. An impactor subassembly is in turn bolted to the load cell. The impactor acts as the interface between the power system and the trampoline mat and is designed with running shoes attached to more closely mimic a person jumping. The linkage is supported by a gantry spanning the width of the supporting base plate. The base is mounted on leveling casters for transportation purposes. Some linkage and structure components are adjustable to account for varying strokes.

The <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism is simulated in ADAMS software {{to observe the}} response of the slider block and the reaction forces at joint R 2 (joint between crank shaft and connecting rod). The dynamic analysis has been performed by applying moment of 4. 2 Nm at joint R 1 (the revolute joint between connecting shaft and connecting plate). The applied moment is removed by imposing rotational motion at joint R 1 with angular velocity of 6 rad/sec to perform dynamic analysis. These simulations were performed with different time steps and durations. The friction was assumed to be negligible during these simulations.

40|$|The {{premise of}} this work is the {{observation}} that real-life mechanical systems limit the use of high order integration formulas due to the presence in the associated models of friction and contact/impact elements. High-order numerical integration methods are impractical in these cases, and producing a numerical solution relies {{on the use of}} low order integration formulas. The latter methods are generally robust and expeditious; their major drawback is the fact that they usually require small integration step-sizes in order to meet a user prescribed accuracy. This paper looks at several low order numerical integration methods that draw on both the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) formulas and Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) method, in an effort to assess their behavior. The first objective is to briefly indicate the theoretical results available in the literature regarding the stability and convergence properties of these low order methods when applied in the context of multibody dynamics simulation (MBS). The second objective is to perform a set of numerical experiments to compare these integration formulas in terms of several metrics: (a) efficiency, (b) energy preservation, and (c) velocity constraint drift.

In the sequel of this process the formulation of the rigid multibody systems is reviewed. The generalized Cartesian coordinates are selected as the variables to describe the bodies’ degrees of freedom. The formulation of the equations of motion uses the Newton-Euler approach, augmented with the constraint equations that lead to a set of differential algebraic equations. Furthermore, the main issues related to the stabilization of the violation of constraints based on the Baumgarte approach are revised.

After considering a number of possible designs and conducting an in-depth analysis into two of them, the final design chosen was a <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism that <b>rotates</b> the trough about its focus. This mechanism uses a lead screw to drive the base of two passively extensible arms in a lateral direction and translates that force into a rotational motion.

40|$|As a {{parachute}} descends, its {{axis of symmetry}} oscillates about a vertical axis. This oscillation implies angular acceleration, with consequential linear acceleration developing. The significance of the acceleration terms in evaluating parachute performance has been long appreciated and commonly allowed for in dynamic stability analysis through introduction of appropriate apparent mass and apparent moment and inertia terms. This research, while dealing specifically with the aerodynamic performance of the parachute, considers the experimental technique to measure the total fluid resistance and apparent mass components of the parachute canopy which {{are related to the}} behaviour of any bluff body moving unsteadily through a fluid. Total fluid resistance and apparent mass components were evaluated by measuring forces and moments with strain gauges during the relative motion of parachute models submerged in water in a ship tank. While being towed by the motion of the carriage, a <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism caused the sting-mounted canopies to be harmonically oscillated at a low frequency along any required line which was parallel to the tank bed. Results show that the apparent mass components depend on the shape of the canopy, its angle of attack and the acceleration modulus (the product of the acceleration of the canopy and its diameter divided by velocity squared) and, except at high values of the latter, can be considerably in excess of potential flow evaluations. A set of differential equations which describe the three-dimensional motion of the parachute canopy-store system during descent were developed. The non-linear equation of motions were solved numerically. The effect on dynamic stability due to the variation of system parameters was studied and appropriate stability criteria were developed.

The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of crank mechanism components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the crank mechanism and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a four stroke engine is based on simple <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism. The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The crank mechanism comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a smooth rotary output which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a crank mechanism particularly crank shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The crank mechanism durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of crank mechanism combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the crank mechanism was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the crank-pin bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the crank mechanism considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components.

The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into useful torque available at the flywheel.

Also joints clearance and the increase of driver speed lead to lower positional accuracy, worse stability and reliability, which has very important theoretical significance and practical value on {{the analysis of the}} performance of internal combustion engine...|$|R
50|$|The Corrector {{consisted}} of a second map pointer on a second horizontal <b>slider,</b> with a <b>crank</b> that moved the horizontal slider fore and aft. A second arm suspended from the main sight tube was pushed {{up and down as}} the horizontal portion slid. This arm was measured against a short vertical bar marked with altitude corrections. The system indicated only corrections, not the actual altitude. Two or more posts had to work in concert to use the system, using two measured angles and simple trigonometry to solve the altitude.|$|R
