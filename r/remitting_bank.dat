40|$|The {{de facto}} {{arrangement}} whereby six places of the EB {{go to the}} six largest countries in Euroland and the remaining two rotate among the smaller nations may conflict with the request that they be “appointed from among persons of recognized standing and professional competence in monetary or banking matters”. Additionally, the Treaties determine that no member of the ESCB may take instructions from any outside institution or from national Governments or Parliaments. Given this clash between custom and prescription, whenever a new member of the Council has to be chosen, the discussion flares up between those who would see {{at least one of}} their nationals on the Board and those who incline for a purely professional choice regardless of nationality. The demand for central bank independence is now well established in economic theory and in political practice. Further, the conviction that inflation does not contribute to keener growth or larger employment has resulted in the <b>remit</b> to central <b>banks</b> generally and the ECB in particular to maintain price stability. These elements of central bank organisation seem to clash with the need for democratic accountability of Bank officials and with the need of Bank directors to exert an authority over matters monetary, often seen as part of political sovereignty. Hence the selection of members of the EB of the ECB should balance technical expertise and independence with democratic accountability and political weight. A reform of the mentod of EB mebers selection should be considered carefully...|$|R
60|$|These {{banks in}} their {{respective}} counties should be a general staple and factory for the manufactures of the said county, where every man that had goods made, might have money at a small interest for advance, the goods in the meantime being sent forward to market, to a warehouse for that purpose erected in London, {{where they should be}} disposed of to all the advantages the owner could expect, paying only 1 per cent. commission. Or if the maker wanted credit in London either for Spanish wool, cotton, oil, or any goods, while his goods were in the warehouse of the said bank, his bill should be paid by the bank to the full value of his goods, or at least within a small matter. These banks, either by correspondence with each other, or an order to their cashier in London, might with ease so pass each other's bills that a man who has cash at Plymouth, and wants money at Berwick, may transfer his cash at Plymouth to Newcastle in half-an-hour's time, without either hazard, or charge, or time, allowing only 0.5 per cent. exchange; and so of all the most distant parts of the kingdom.

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the First World War {{policies}} of the National City Bankof New York, drawing attention to the internal disputes within the bank over war financing. Some historians have suggested that during the First World War New York banks associated with the National City Bank favored fierce competition with the Allied powers for markets and overseas investment opportunities, whereas those linked to J. P Morgan and Company preferred cooperation with the Allied powers, concentrating upon handling the massive war financing the Allied war effort required. In reality the picture was more complex. The National City Bank participated substantially in Allied war loans and, with the First National Bank and Morgan’s, {{was one of the}} “Trio” of leading New York banks that handled such financing. Simultaneously, Frank A. Vanderlip, the National City president and a long-time advocate of the expansion of American foreign trade and investment, launched a major initiative to expand the National City’s overseas activities, through the establishment of foreign branches around the world and the creation of the American International Corporation, a foreign investment trust. Although Vanderlip suggested that he wished to cooperate with British financial interests in these activities, they generated conflict between the National City and the fiercely pro-Allied Morgan firm. Within the bank, they also created substantial tension between the broadly neutral Vanderlip and his staunchly pro-Allied patron, the bank’s chairman, James Stillman, who diedin 1918, and other strongly pro-Allied National City officers. Shortly afterthe war, Vanderlip proposed a massive and visionary scheme to provide American financing for European economic regeneration, causing the National City’s directors, who considered it impractical and outside their <b>bank’s</b> <b>remit</b> of maximizing profits, to dismiss him...|$|R
