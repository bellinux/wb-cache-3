(2) In view of the experience of closing the operational programmes and Cohesion Fund projects of the 2000 - 2006 programming period, the guidelines should propose simplified procedures aiming to avoid the bottlenecks identified during the closure of the previous period.

On the attendance of Larkin Brothers Ltd to take photographs, magnesium powder was ignited {{in order to create a}} flash light, to better illuminate the cinema interior. It was argued that such practice was common in photographing the insides of buildings, despite creating intense heat and being hazardous if ignited near fabrics. The photographers were found guilty of negligence in igniting the flash just four foot from a cinema curtain, setting fire to it and causing damage of £261.4s.3d. However, Honeywill and Stein Ltd, under threat of litigation from the cinema company chose to pay this balance in full.

40|$|Suppose two finite {{signals are}} related {{by an unknown}} cyclic shift. Fast {{algorithms}} for finding such a shift or variants thereof are of great importance {{in a number of}} applications, e. g., localization and target tracking using acoustic sensors. The standard solution, solving shift finding by maximizing the cross-correlation between the two signals, may be rather efficiently computed using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Inspired by compressive sensing, faster algorithms have been recently proposed based on sparse FFTs. In this paper, we transform the shift finding problem into the spectral domain as well. As a first contribution, by combining the Fourier Shift Theorem with the Bézout Identity from elementary number theory, we obtain explicit formulas for the unknown shift parameter. This leads to linear time algorithms for shift finding in the noise-free setting. As a second contribution, we extend this result to the fast <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> weighted <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> two shifts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel iterative algorithm for estimation of the unknown shift parameter for the case of noisy signals and provide a sufficient criterion for exact shift recovery. A slightly relaxed criterion leads to a linear time median algorithm in the noisy setting with high recovery rates even for low SNRs...|$|R
40|$|Returns from radar {{transmitters}} are filtered {{to concentrate}} target power and improve SNR prior to detection. An ideal “thumbtack ” filter response in delay and Doppler {{is impossible to}} achieve. In practice target power is distributed over the delay–Doppler plane either in a broad main lobe or in sidelobes with inherent limitations given by Moyal’s identity. Many authors have considered the use of pairs or sets of complementary codes {{as the basis of}} radar waveforms. The set of filter outputs when combined reduces output to a thumbtack shape, at least on part of the delay–Doppler domain. This paper shows firstly that a pair of complementary codes cannot be multiplexed in frequency because of a phase difference which depends on the unknown range to any targets, thereby preventing the individual filter outputs from being combined coherently. It is shown that the phase term can be removed by multiplexing the second code twice, at offsets equally spaced above and below carrier, enabling the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> squared ambiguity functions. A proposed modification to the Golay pair results in codes whose squared ambiguities cancel upon addition. This enables complementary behaviour to be achieved by codes which are separated in frequency at the expense of introducing cross–terms when multiple closely separated returns are present. The modified Golay codes are shown to successfully reveal low power returns which are hidden in sidelobes when other waveforms are used...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2013. Major: Music. Advisor: Alex Lubet. 2 PDF files (x, 68 pages; 126 pages). I AM Meditation is {{a musical}} drama in seven tableaus, which, to borrow John Milton's language, {{represents}} {{the loss of}} paradise and its reattainment. The meditation revolves around a central fulcrum (Tableau IV), where the story of origin, rebellion, the fall, and the plan for restoration is stated. While Tableaus I, II & III are about loss and misery, Tableau V, VI & VII are about restoration and glorification. The three fundamental ideas of metaphysics (God, {{in terms of whether}} or not he was responsible for the singularity that gave birth to being; the Soul, in regard to its resurrection and immortality; and the Cosmos vis-à-vis teleology) are examined in Tableaus IV & V. Here still, theodicy, soteriology, and eschatology are examined through accompanied monologues, interspersed with choral interjections. Misery is represented through the loss of the mythic paradise, the first murder and the misery of the multitudes while hope and restoration are articulated in the I AM sayings from the Gospel of John, the resurrection of the I AM, the proclamation of the good news of this resurrection, and the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> paradise. In <b>sum,</b> this is a meditation on hope. But in one sense, I AM Meditation is a communal ritual of reenactment: the reenactment of a loss and a signification of how this loss is mitigated and restoration achieved...|$|R
40|$|Where a party repudiating a {{contract}} refuses {{to cooperate with}} further performance by the innocent party, is the contract automatically terminated, or is the innocent party merely prevented from earning the agreed sum? The recent decision in Société Générale v Geys has renewed this old controversy. 1 In a forceful dissenting judgment, Lord Sumption argued in favour of automatic termination, relying on Lord Reid’s comments in the famous case of White & Carter v McGregor. 2 The majority of the Supreme Court instead treated cooperation as a practical limit on <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the agreed <b>sum.</b> This essay sides against Lord Sumption’s automatic termination approach, but acknowledges that the majority’s view leaves one difficult problem unresolved. The first section of this essay describes the cooperation limitation in outline, starting with the dictum of Lord Reid in White & Carter and considering its application in Geys. The second section assesses and rejects the arguments for regarding cooperation as a limitation on the innocent party’s right to affirm the contract. The third section puts forward the argument that cooperation instead provides a practical limitation on {{the capacity of the}} innocent party to earn the agreed sum, and shows why this means that the limitation is not universally applicable. The final section acknowledges that the approach of the majority in Geys leaves a difficult problem concerning the content of the wage-work bargain in contracts of employment...|$|R
