5|$|The British {{were eager}} {{not to lose}} any useful {{inhabitants}} and promised <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 {{as a result of}} the new British rule and <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.|$|E
5|$|Historians (List of Historians {{till now}} not found, hence cannot be trusted) claim that Hyder was {{extremely}} tolerant towards the Christians. According to historian Severine Silva, {{he followed the}} same policy of <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> towards Christians as he had from the beginning, even though the Christians had revolted against him. The Second Anglo-Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder's death on 7 December 1782, at Arcot. Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{years after the}} conquest of Granada, Muslims in Granada and {{elsewhere}} continued to enjoy freedom of religion. This right was guaranteed in various legal instruments, including treaties, charters, capitulations, and coronation oaths. For example, the Treaty of Granada (1491) guaranteed <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> to the Muslims of the conquered Granada. Kings of Aragon, including King Ferdinand II and Charles V, swore to protect the Muslims' religious freedom in their oaths of coronation.|$|E

5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.|$|E
5|$|Elected king of Poland in 1632, Władysław {{was fairly}} {{successful}} in defending the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth against invasion, {{most notably in}} the Smolensk War of 1632–34, in which he participated personally. He supported <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> and carried out military reforms, such as {{the founding of the}} Commonwealth Navy. He was also a renowned patron of the arts and music. He failed, however, to realize his dreams of regaining the Swedish crown, gaining fame by defeating the Ottoman Empire, strengthening royal power, and reforming the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|King Charles II {{granted the}} land for the Pennsylvania Colony to William Penn on March 4, 1681 as payment for a debt the crown owed his family. Penn wrote the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania before departing for the colony, which called for <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> towards many groups, {{including}} the Religious Society of Friends and local natives. As a proprietary colony, Penn governed Pennsylvania, yet its citizens were still subject to the English crown and laws. Penn's cousin William Markham served as the first colonial deputy governor.|$|E

5|$|King Stanisław August's {{acquiescence}} to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On February 29, 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and {{his young}} son Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a confederation at the town of Bar. The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance.</b> It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772.|$|E
5|$|Prevalent minorities, {{particularly}} Hindu and Christian, feel a {{sense of}} vulnerability because of their religious beliefs. Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste by virtue of their birth. A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blashphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance,</b> such as Canada and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinal Laws, a quasi-constitution {{endorsing}} most of {{the conservative}} laws responsible for the inefficient functioning of the Commonwealth, were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. The Sejm also continued enacting laws reducing <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> in the Commonwealth. The passive electoral rights of the Orthodox and Protestants were diminished, with a restriction {{limiting the number of}} non-Roman Catholic Sejm deputies to three (one from Greater Poland, one from Lesser Poland, and one from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). They were also banned from election to the Senate or ministerial positions.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance.</b> However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} {{and did not}} support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of his}} death, it had 11. Despite his support for <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance,</b> he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite his support for the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide of intolerance, either in Poland or abroad, as shown by the fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither did he get involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an {{increasing}} number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch had over the Church of England. This {{led to the formation of}} independent churches and schools by what are known as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance,</b> but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670.|$|E

5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|His {{two most}} {{important}} works are The Lives of the Saints (Żywoty świętych, 1579) and Sejm Sermons (Kazania Sejmowe, 1597). The former, a hagiography, won him fame in his lifetime, while the Sermons gained recognition only in subsequent centuries, during the Partitions of Poland. Tazbir describes the Lives as Skarga's chief work and as a major attack on the <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> promoted by the Warsaw Confederation. The book was immensely popular, the first edition selling out by 1583. A second edition was published in 1585, and by the mid-17th century twelve editions had been printed, {{making it one of}} the most popular books published in Poland and Lithuania in that era (rivaled by the Kronika Polska—Polish Chronicles—of Marcin Bielski). It was Skarga's most popular work and continued to rank highly with Polish readers until the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was eclipsed by his Sermons.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the <b>religious</b> <b>tolerance</b> of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E
40|$|Religious {{pluralism}} is {{a phenomenon}} that cannot be avoided. If religious pluralism is not rightly understood by religious believers, pluralism will lead to interreligious conflict. This paper would like to reveal the thoughts of Yusuf al-Qaradawi about <b>religious</b> pluralism and <b>tolerance</b> in Islam.

Source of the data was gained from information available in the literatures. The data analysis was done by using content analysis method (content analysis), which {{is an attempt to}} explore the symbolic meaning of the message or the contents of a book or other writings products. Result showed that pluralism in Islam is {{based on the fact that}} God has created man in the diversity and plurality. For that to avoid disaster or human conflict, it is necessary tolerance values. Quran, Sunnah, and behavior as scholars have become reasons to appreciate the difference...|$|R
