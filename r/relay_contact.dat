Important specifications include operating range or the input shaft speed, trip set-point, operating temperature range, operating conditions, field adjustability, operating voltage, and <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> rating. For various applications, zero speed switch suppliers can provide zero speed switches that are explosion proof, weather proof or dust proof.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{digital systems}} can measure and display the phase angle {{difference}} directly. The display {{may be a}} ring of discrete LEDs arranged to simulate {{the effect of a}} pointer moving over a scale, with a different color of LED to indicate the [...] "in phase" [...] condition. These instruments may also have a <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> for use by external control circuits, to indicate synchronism.|$|E
50|$|When used {{as part of}} a {{security}} system, the electronics in the PIR typically control a small relay. This relay completes the circuit across a pair of electrical contacts connected to a detection input zone of the burglar alarm control panel. The system is usually designed such that if no motion is being detected, the <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> is closed—a 'normally closed' (NC) relay. If motion is detected, the relay opens, triggering the alarm.|$|E

50|$|A {{digital input}} {{indicates}} if a device {{is turned on}} or not - however it was detected. Some examples of an inherently digital input would be a 24 V DC/AC signal, current switch, an air flow switch, or a volta-free <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> (dry contact). Digital inputs could also be pulse type inputs counting the frequency of pulses over a given period of time. An example is a turbine flow meter transmitting rotation data as a frequency of pulses to an input.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{circuits}} in {{the form}} of latches can also be created by having a <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> complete the circuit of its own coil when operated. The relay will then latch and store the state to which it was driven. With this capability, relays were used to create special purpose computers for telephone switches in the 1930s. These designs were converted, starting in the 1950s, to wire spring relays, making them faster and more reliable. The majority of wire spring relays were used in 5XB switches.|$|E
50|$|The relay {{analyzes}} the resultant A/D converter outputs {{to determine if}} action is required under its protection algorithm(s). Protection algorithms are a set of logic equations in part designed by the protection engineer, and in part designed by the relay manufacturer.The relay is capable of applying advanced logic. It is capable of analyzing whether the relay should trip or restrain from tripping based on parameters set by the user, compared against many functions of its analogue inputs, <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> inputs, timing and order of event sequences.|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} as high-current {{switches}} or contactors, where contact erosion from constant cycling {{would be a problem}} for conventional <b>relay</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another relay saw a metal washer {{slip off}} and jam the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> up; the half-washers {{had to be}} {{replaced}} by full-circle washers.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of running}} mains voltage to the switches, a low voltage—typically 24 V AC—is {{connected}} to remote momentary toggle or rocker switches. The momentary switches usually have SPDT contacts in an (ON)-OFF-(ON) configuration. Pushing the switch actuator {{in one direction}} causes the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> to close; pushing it {{in the opposite direction}} causes the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> to open. Any number of additional rocker switches can be wired in parallel, as needed in multiple locations. An optional master control can be added that turns all lights in the facility on or off simultaneously under the control of a timer or computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} {{switching}} circuit for the absorption method is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the switch's contacts {{must have some}} form of arc suppression. Eaton had the telegraph key drive electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of switch contacts in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> was bridged by a resistor. Consequently, the switch was never completely open, but {{there was a lot of}} attenuation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{language}} {{itself can}} be seen as a set of connections between logical checkers (contacts) and actuators (coils). If a path can be traced between the left side of the rung and the output, through asserted (true or [...] "closed") contacts, the rung is true and the output coil storage bit is asserted (1) or true. If no path can be traced, then the output is false (0) and the [...] "coil" [...] by analogy to electromechanical relays is considered [...] "de-energized". The analogy between logical propositions and <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> status is due to Claude Shannon.|$|E

Gage measurements such as force, temperature, pressure, strain, etc. are recorded using this equipment. Approximately 2500 reusable instrumentation B&F Signal Conditioning units were purchased over an interval from 1978 to 1988 {{at a cost of}} around $ 1000 each. Through use and over time, the relay contacts on the signal conditioning mode cards have become corroded, resulting in excessive contact resistance. This causes inaccurate and inconsistent calibration data and could jeopardize the test results. These signal conditioning cards are needed for product testing for an estimated five more years, therefore, it is necessary to develop a solution to isolate the malfunctioning units for repair. The current screening method requires Test Area technicians to check cards manually, however the connections and measurements required for this process are inefficient and time consuming. To resolve this problem, funding was approved to design and build two B&F Signal Conditioner Checkout Units. Each unit will allow technicians to test <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> resistance on signal conditioning mode cards before they are installed for data collection procedures.

40|$|AbstractLet f:{ 0, 1 }n→{ 0, 1 } be a {{monotone}} Boolean function whose {{value at}} any point x∈{ 0, 1 }n can be determined in time t. Denote by c=⋀I∈C⋁i∈Ixi the irredundant CNF of f, where C is {{the set of the}} prime implicates of f. Similarly, let d=⋁J∈D⋀j∈Jxj be the irredundant DNF of the same function, where D is the set of the prime implicants of f. We show that given subsets C′⊆C and D′⊆D such that (C′,D′) ≠(C,D), a new term in (C⧹C′) ∪(D⧹D′) can be found in time O(n(t+n)) +mo(logm), where m=|C′|+|D′|. In particular, if f(x) can be evaluated for every x∈{ 0, 1 }n in polynomial time, then the forms c and d can be jointly generated in incremental quasi-polynomial time. On the other hand, even for the class of ∧,∨-formulae f of depth 2, i. e., for CNFs or DNFs, it is unlikely that uniform sampling from within the set of the prime implicates and implicants of f can be carried out in time bounded by a quasi-polynomial 2 polylog(·) in the input size of f. We also show that for some classes of polynomial-time computable monotone Boolean functions it is NP-hard to test either of the conditions D′=D or C′=C. This provides evidence that for each of these classes neither conjunctive nor disjunctive irredundant normal forms can be generated in total (or incremental) quasi-polynomial time. Such classes of monotone Boolean functions naturally arise in game theory, networks and <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> circuits, convex programming, and include a subset of ∧,∨-formulae of depth 3...|$|E

40|$|Alert System for High Speed Vehicles to Avoid Wildlife Accidents” is {{an alert}} system used to {{safeguard}} our wildlife. We often hear of various accidents of wild animals like elephant, nilgai etc., {{who are trying}} to cross the railway track. So, an intelligent electronics system is necessary which can be affixed to avoid the possibilities of accidents. Regarding this, in our project we are using a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR sensor) which is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view and switches ON any electrical/electronic device to which it is connected to. The key component of the sensor module is the pyroelectric element. All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit heat energy in the form of radiation. Usually this radiation is invisible to the human eye because it is radiated at infrared wavelengths, but it is detected by this PIR sensor. This sensor does not radiate any energy for detection purposes and thus, it has no harmful effects on living beings. In our project the PIR sensor is used {{as a part of a}} burglar alarm and the electronic in the PIR typically control a small relay. This relay completes the circuit across a pair of electrical contacts connected to a detection input zone of the burglar alarm control panel. The system is usually designed such that if no living creature is being detected, the <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> is closed- a „normally closed‟ (NC) relay.

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} paper {{focuses on}} {{development of a}} method for mechanical parameters control of the neutral relay of rail automatics by current analyzing in the coil and the relay contacts at switching based on wavelet transform. Methodology. The methodology was based on current analysis of the relay coil and contacts currents under its switching and analysis obtained results by using wavelet transform. Findings. The time dependences of the current in coil and in contacts under switching {{on and off for}} the operable relays and relays with certain defects have been measured at different voltages applied to coil (10, 12 и 14 V). When voltage applied to coil was increased the rate of coil current increased, but time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly. The current value maximum at which the relay armature begun to move for the operable relays was depended on applied voltage slightly. For the time interval, at which armature was putted to the relay core fully, time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly also. The maximum current value at which the armature starts to move to the relay serviceable little dependent on the applied voltage. For site based in which the anchor is completely dragged constant current rise time is also a little dependent on the applied voltage. Similar results were obtained for the current reduction time constant with turning off the voltage and current confinement. The current pick-up and the current release of the armature increases for the relay with the load anchor is proportional to the weight of cargo, {{as well as for the}} <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> with the rear, bent down, while the flexural rear contact up these currents have smaller values. Large-scale (low-frequency) coefficients of DWT can be used for a more accurate comparison of the current pick-up, and release time constants of the transient.

For the first time, on the basis of the research proposed to use detailing coefficients of a discrete wavelet transform as a symptom of mobile relay system.

40|$|Electrostatic {{actuation}} is {{the most}} common and well-developed method of generating motion on the micro scale. To overcome the challenge of providing both high force and large displacement, electrostatic zipping actuators have been developed and applied to various devices. As device thicknesses increase, however, conventional laterally- moving zipping actuators become less practical due to their high pull-in voltages caused by their minimum achievable electrode gaps. This thesis presents a fundamental improvement of the laterally-moving electrostatic zipping actuator. Its major contributions are: 1) a compliant starting zone is introduced into the fixed electrode to significantly reduce the pull-in voltage of the zipping electrode; 2) numerical and analytical methods are developed to solve general zipping actuator problems; 3) optimization is performed to minimize the effort required to actuate the zipping electrode and its load; and 4) the improved zipping actuators are designed into a relay to illustrate their use and performance. To design a cross-bar micro relay, two zipping actuators are combined with a curved bistable switch beam and two contacts. (cont.) The micro relay is monolithically fabricated in silicon using deep reactive ion etching to move laterally in the wafer plane. Both actuators provided up to 10 mN of actuation force over their 80 [mu]m of stroke at 140 V, and toggle the bistable relay at a maximum rate of 160 Hz. Pullin voltage, actuation voltage and force-displacement measurements of the actuators and switch beam confirm theoretical expectations based on numerical, analytical and finite element analyses, after accounting for fabrication variations. The shortest pulse required to switch the relay is 400 [mu]s, and the time taken for the actuator to close the relay was approximately 3 ms. The relay was operated at 100 Hz for over 120 hours through more than 40 million cycles without any observed stiction or fracture fatigue. To achieve low contact resistance for a laterally-moving micro relay, wet anisotropically etched silicon [111] planes are developed to form <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces that offer flat wiping surfaces and ease of thick metalization. Experimental contacts are fabricated and their average contact resistance is measured to be [approx. ] 50 m[omega]. (cont.) A process plan is also proposed to combine the [111] plane contacts with the prior zipping actuators and the switch beam to build a micro relay with low contact resistance for power protection applications. The compliant starting zone concept can also be applied to vertically-moving MEMS devices. A MEMS valve is also designed using a zipping actuator having com- pliant starting zones. As another application of the zipping mechanism, a nonlinear spring is also presented and analyzed. by Jian Li. Thesis (Ph. D.)
