5|$|Fearing {{he could}} not {{guarantee}} {{the integrity of the}} polling places, Clayton canceled fall elections in counties where political violence had broken out. In doing so, however, he further reduced the Democratic vote, and the state ended up supporting the election of President Grant, the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> despite the population being mostly Democratic.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} {{speculation}} that the U.S. Senate race, already seen as tight, would be affected. <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> Thomas Kean, Jr. said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez did not oppose Corzine's tax hike because Corzine appointed Menendez to serve out {{the remainder of his}} own term in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} down from Bain Capital and his local {{leadership role in}} the LDS Church, Romney ran as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> in the 1994 Massachusetts election for U.S. Senate. After losing to longtime incumbent Ted Kennedy, he resumed his position at Bain Capital. Years later, a successful stint as President and CEO of the then-struggling Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics led to a relaunch of his political career.|$|E

He was heavily criticized for this endorsement, with conservatives questioning his candidacy for President in 2012 and even comparing him to Benedict Arnold. Gingrich has since regretted his decision.|$|E
5|$|Illinois's 1st congressional {{district}} is a minority-majority district. At {{the time of}} the election, 65percent of its constituents were African American. In redistricting after the 1990 United States Census, the district was extended into the suburbs {{for the first time in}} 90 years, but a majority of the districts' residents (70%) lived in Chicago. A strongly Democratic district, only twice since 1966 has a <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> for United States Congress received over 20% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Morrow {{was chosen}} as the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> for the Senate seat of Thomas Paynter. Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats {{nominated}} Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.|$|E

5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} career of John C. Breckinridge included {{service in the}} state government of Kentucky, the United States federal government, {{and the government of}} the Confederate States of America. In 1857, at 36 years old, he was inaugurated as James Buchanan's vice president, and remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of Southern Democrats, but lost the election to the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to win the election. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but {{when it became clear that}} Ulysses S. Grant would be the <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
