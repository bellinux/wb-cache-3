The applied multi-leg topology and the interleaved switching method can effectively reduce fuel cell current ripple to meet the suggested limitation of 4 %. Input inductors {{play a critical role}} for ripple current reduction, while output capacitors are used for specified output voltage performance. In the selection of the input inductors and the output capacitors, this paper uniquely presents an analytic method for obtaining optimum parameter values. The design considerations include leg number, switching frequency, output loads, and dynamic response. Novel equivalent models with equivalent series resistors for multi-leg boost converters are proposed. This model can simplify the analysis of multi-leg converters and is thus used for compensation design.

40|$|Conventional filter {{circuits}} {{suffer from}} a number of limitations, including performance degradation due to capacitor parasitic inductance and the size and cost of magnetic elements. Coupled-magnetic filters have been developed that provide increased filter order with a single magnetic component, but also suffer from parasitic inductance in the filter shunt path due to imperfectly-controlled coupling of the magnetics. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to coupled-magnetic filters that overcomes these limitations. Filter sensitivity to variations in coupling is overcome by adaptively tuning the magnetic circuit for minimum <b>rms</b> <b>ripple</b> performance with feedback based on the sensed filter output ripple. This active control enables much greater robustness to manufacturing and environmental variations than is possible in the conventional "zero-ripple" coupled-magnetic approach, while preserving its advantages. Moreover, the proposed technique also adaptively cancels the deleterious effects of capacitor parasitic inductance, thereby providing much higher filter performance than is achievable in conventional designs.
