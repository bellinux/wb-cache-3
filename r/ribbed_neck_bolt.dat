50|$|Mere, {{and other}} patu, {{were used for}} close-quarter fighting. Held in one hand, these close-range {{striking}} weapons were used primarily for end-on thrusting or jabbing (tipi). In combat, jabbing thrusts or strikes would be directed at the <b>ribs,</b> <b>neck</b> or temple. It has been claimed that a strike to the skull combined with a twisting flick of the wrist could force or wrench the victim's skull open. The designed use of the mere for forward striking thrusts is an unusual characteristic of Maori patu, where {{in other parts of}} the world, clubs are generally wielded with an ax-like downward blow. The butt (reke) of a mere could also be used to strike an opponent's head.|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} {{available on the}} nutritional value of the meat of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) is very limited. The mineral elements and proximate composition of muscle tissues taken from the shoulders, thighs, <b>ribs,</b> <b>necks</b> and humps of seven young (1 - 3 years) male camels have been determined. The amounts of mineral elements, protein and ash in the various muscle tissues of the camel are generally similar to the amounts reported for these constituents in the corresponding tissues of beef. However, the meat of the camel contains significantly less lipids (1. 2 - 1. 8 % versus 4. 0 - 8. 0 %) and higher water content (5 - 8 % more) than beef. The hump consists mainly of lipids (86. 9 %) ...|$|R
5000|$|Ring Bungee: The 'Ring Bungee' {{introduces}} a metal ring along the bungee length (in the armpit area). [...] This permits {{the use of}} a choker to connect tanks to the ring, making bungee wrapping of the cylinder valve/neck unnecessary. A popular configuration has the bolt snap connected to a ring by a quick link, with a length of bungee from the ring to another quick link which is used to connect the assembly to a D-ring {{on the back of the}} harness. The bolt snap is clipped to the shoulder D-ring and the cylinder <b>neck</b> <b>bolt</b> snap is clipped to the ring. The choker is used to minimise the distance the cylinder top can dangle away from the ring bungee.|$|R

40|$|Costal {{movement}} was defined on living subjects by determining the spatial vectors along the ribs that are produced during inspiration. The determination of these vectors was achieved with an instrument specially designed for this purpose. Rib {{movement was}} studied on 61 ribs in 10 normal subjects and on 35 ribs in six patients suffering from kyphoscoliosis and ankylosing spondylitis. In normal subjects during smooth inspiration all the ribs studied, which {{ranged from the}} 2 nd to the 9 th, rotated round a single axis. The direction of the inspiratory movement of the ribs was oblique, upward, outward, and forward, and symmetrical in both hemithoraces. This direction is compatible with rotation around the rib-neck axis but not with other axes that have been postulated. In ankylosing spondylitis and in kyphoscoliosis the magnitude of rib movement was reduced but movement still took place solely around the rib-neck axis. In the patients with kyphoscoliosis the direction of this movement was altered due {{to a change in}} the position of the <b>rib</b> <b>neck...</b>|$|R

50|$|Ulcerative {{dermatitis}} is a {{skin disorder}} in rodents associated with bacterial growth often initiated by self-trauma {{due to a}} possible allergic response. Although other organisms can be involved, bacteria culture frequently shows Staphylococcus aureus. Primarily found on the <b>rib</b> cage, <b>neck,</b> and shoulder, lesions are often irregular, circumscribed, and moist. Intense itching may lead to scratching which may aggravate and perpetuate the lesion. Destruction of the epidermis along with underlying pustules or abscesses, and granulomatous inflammation, may be present.|$|R
50|$|Bollinger {{was drafted}} by the Florida Tuskers in the UFL's Inaugural draft. The Tuskers {{retained}} his UFL rights as {{he worked in the}} Detroit Lions training camp. He was signed by the Tuskers on September 22, 2009. In the 2009 season, he led the Tuskers to the championship game with a perfect 6-0 regular season record. Bollinger was the league leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completion percentage, and completed passes. Though the Tuskers lost the championship, Bollinger was named season MVP through an online and text message vote by fans. Bollinger had a tough start in the 2010 UFL season, going 2-2 {{in the first half of}} the season, and then receiving <b>rib,</b> <b>neck</b> and thumb injuries during the Week 6 game against the Sacramento Mountain Lions. Bollinger would not play for the rest of the season as backup QB Chris Greisen took the Tuskers back to the UFL Championship, which they would later lose, once again to the Las Vegas Locomotives. After the season, due to his injuries Bollinger decided to retire from professional football. On February 1, 2011 Bollinger announced that he would take over as head coach for the Hill-Murray Pioneers of St. Paul, Minnesota.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{concentrate}} {{for sheep}} grazing Buffel grass may improve the productive performance and carcass traits of animals. The objective of present trial was {{to evaluate the}} productive performance and carcass traits of sheep grazing Buffel grass receiving different concentrate levels. The concentrate levels used were: 0; 0. 33; 0. 66 and 1. 0 % of dry matter in relation to body weight. Forty lambs were used, ten animals by treatments, with 16. 5 ± 2. 0 kg of initial body weight and 20. 97 kg final body weight, distributed in four groups. The experimental design was a completely randomized with ten replicates by treatments. The concentrate levels did not influence the cold and hot carcass weight. However, the increasing levels of concentrate promoted higher cold and hot carcass yield. Blood, head, hide, heart, lung, kidney and liver (non carcass components) weights and proportion of slaughtered body weight (SBW) and leg, shoulder, brisket, <b>rib,</b> <b>neck</b> and loin weights (commercial meat cuts) were not affected by increasing levels of concentrate. Full intestine in proportion of SBW was lower {{with the increase of}} concentrate levels, while the brisket's weight was higher with increase of concentrate...|$|R
50|$|Doctor Stein gives Eddie new {{replacement}} arms using his DNA solution, and Eddie {{seems to be}} recovering well until Malcomb confesses his attraction to Winifred. Winifed tries to let him down gently, explaining that she intends to marry Eddie {{as soon as the}} surgeries are complete, and Malcomb seems to accept her statement, but he later vindictively sabotages the DNA solution used during Eddie's leg surgeries with the contaminated RNA, causing the former soldier to start to devolve into a primitive brutish state with hairy hands and a Neanderthal brow ridge. As his condition worsens and he loses the mental capacity for speech and rational thought, the stony-faced Eddie becomes a slowly shambling monster resembling an African-American version of the iconic Boris Karloff monster with a squarish afro instead of the usual scars and <b>neck</b> <b>bolts.</b> Although he lies in a near catatonic state by day, compelled by horrible cannibalistic urges the black suit and turtleneck-clad Eddie secretly leaves the house late each night in search of victims who he dismembers, disembowels and devours zombie-style, always returning in time each morning for his ongoing schedule of DNA injections with his doctors none the wiser.|$|R
5000|$|The Ventures Model [...] - [...] Also {{came as a}} {{bass and}} later on, A 12-string. Post Ventures, 1968 and 1969 it was named the [...] "Mark I". The first Ventures Models came with a set neck, bound body and a large Ventures and Mosrite logo, less than 250 of these were made before {{settling}} on the standard Ventures Model sometime in 1964, without body binding and the <b>neck</b> became <b>bolt</b> on. The Mosrite logo and Ventures model logo were slightly reduced.|$|R

50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on <b>necks.</b> Real <b>bolted</b> joints (i.e., using bolt coupled with a nut) exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external self-tapping thread — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|R

The markers all feature a high impact composite body, double trigger, a center feed <b>neck,</b> in-line <b>bolt</b> system and a 200-round gravity feed hopper.|$|R
5000|$|Gibson started {{producing}} the S-1 in mid-1974, but released {{it on the}} market in 1975. Its production lifespan was 1974-1980. Like the Gibson Marauder, the S-1 was an attempt to break through into the single-coil guitar market. It too consisted of a flat Les Paul -like body with a maple Flying V <b>neck</b> <b>bolted</b> on. Unlike the Marauder, however, the S-1 featured three [...] "see-thru" [...] single-coil pickups designed by Bill Lawrence, with fairly elaborate circuitry to generate humbucking and single-coil pick-up sounds. Just like the Marauders, the S-1 all had Schaller made [...] "Harmonica" [...] ("tune-o-matic" [...] style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece. The S-1 had one 2 way toggle switch and a [...] "chicken head" [...] 4 position rotary switch. This 4 way rotary switch made it possible to use the pick-ups in 4 different ways: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. In the down position the 2 way toggle switch bypassed the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one straight connection to the bridge pick-up, which resulted in a sound that was pretty close to that of the Fender Esquire (Telecaster in bridge only position). The potentiometers are volume and tone. The sound was similar to that of a Fender Stratocaster or a Fender Telecaster.|$|R
