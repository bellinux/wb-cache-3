50|$|Zenith had sued Hazeltine for a {{declaration}} of misuse and treble antitrust damages. It was therefore necessary for the Court to determine whether coercive total-sales royalties was not only misuse but a basis for antitrust damages as well. The Court ruled that for Hazeltine to be liable for antitrust treble damages, the other requirements of such an action must be met—such as sufficient anticompetive impact. This holding reaffirmed a line of Supreme Court patent-misuse decisions holding that the competitive impact of a <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> may fall short of an antitrust violation and nonetheless be misuse.|$|E
50|$|In Zenith Radio Corp. v.

Hazeltine Research required Zenith pay a total percentage of all its sales to license Hazeltine's patents. The court ruled that this license requirement was patent misuse, even though it might not be an antitrust violation because the anticompetive impact may have been too slight. This holding reaffirmed a line of Supreme Court patent misuse decisions holding that the competitive impact of a <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> might fall short of an antitrust violation and nonetheless be misuse.|$|E

40|$|The uses of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} controversial over recent decades. With an increasing emphasis in recovery orientated values and person centred care, the uses of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> have become ever more contentious. National and international policies and guidelines {{have called for a}} reduction in the uses of these practices and interventions, and emphases on ‘least restrictive practices’ have been outlined. The notion of ‘least restrictive practices’ however, is not clearly defined. Limited research has been conducted to examine the uses of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> specifically within forensic mental health services. Little is known with regards how patients perceive and experience <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> within high security hospital settings. It is therefore timely to consider patient experiences of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> and interventions, specifically {{within the context of a}} forensic high security mental health hospital. This study aims to explore patients’ experiences of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> and interventions within Rampton High Security Hospital. Twenty eight interviews were conducted, with nineteen male and nine female patients. The interviews were conducted using a narrative inquiry approach in seeking the personal experiences of patients, and towards gaining a better understanding of the complexities surrounding least <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> within a high security hospital context. Findings from the interviews revealed three core themes; i) patient experiences of the high security hospital environment; ii) experiences of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> and interventions, and iii) working towards overcoming trauma and adversity. Patient experiences of the high security hospital environment were narrated in terms of learning the rules of the hospital. Patient experiences of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> were spoken of both in terms of their personal involvement as well as observation of others; each of which were perceived to be traumatising and re-traumatising. Restrictive interventions were frequently perceived as punitive; either actually or inadvertently, and were described in terms of fear, anxiety and loss of dignity. In working towards overcoming trauma, patients spoke of the importance of humanity, occupation and the maintenance of relationships outside of the hospital. Findings of this report therefore highlight the importance of: i) building trust and supporting patients into this new and unfamiliar environment; ii) the maintenance of identity and relationships, and iii) being treated with dignity and humanity in overcoming past and present traumas that may be associated with experiencing <b>restrictive</b> <b>practices</b> with a high security hospital environment...|$|R

50|$|The Royal Marine Police {{had little}} time to {{establish}} themselves before the Second World War of 1939 was upon them. The <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> of recruiting only RN and RM pensioners showed its weakness with the drying up {{of the source of}} supply, men who expected to retire from the Forces being retained {{for the duration of the}} War. To counter this the rules were amended to permit ex-servicemen from any branch of the Armed Forces to enlist in a new section of the force known as the Royal Marine Police Special Reserve. This still failed to achieve its aim and a third force, the Admiralty Civil Police was formed and anyone, regardless of former military service, could join. In fact, many men who did join that Force were allowed to do so an as an alternative to joining the Armed Forces.|$|E
5000|$|The author {{considers}} {{high-tech industries}} that evolve and change rapidly and are complicated. That may call for different rules than {{used in the}} past. The author states, [...] "This paper proposes a plausible alternative approach for the Kodak-Xerox contexts, based upon an idea for redefining the scope of a patent holder's rights by means of expanding the definitions of the exhaustion doctrine and doctrine of repair to conform with patent policy goals." [...] The author excludes from his discussion [...] "pure" [...] refusals to deal, by which he means those refusals to deal without an ulterior purpose, such as one to divide markets illegally or restrict competition in markets {{outside the scope of}} the patent. His focus is on selective refusals to deal used to require adherence to a <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice.</b> He asserts that the exhaustion doctrine should be expanded so that an equipment seller such as Kodak or Xerox [...] "should neither indirectly limit the existing choices of a buyer nor constrain a buyer's right to use, repair, and resell the product, without reasonable business interests or justifications." [...] He further asserts:When a consumer purchases the product, maintaining the purchased product through repair service should be one of the consumer's freedoms, whether or not the components of the product are patented. Once it is sold, some parts of the product will eventually need to be repaired or replaced in most cases. Thus, the product composed of patented parts must be treated as primary. After a seller sells a product and the patented repair parts, a patentee should not be able to restrict the buyers' right to repair some components of the purchased product through repair service, or to refuse to sell to any other buyer on similar terms, without a business justification.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the process of assessing applications for genetically modified (GM) crops or plants for import or commercial planting in Norway. GMO legislation in Norway is {{closely linked to the}} EU through the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), to which Norway is a party. A central difference with the EU processes is emanating from specific clauses in the Norwegian Gene Technology Act on ‘sustainable development ’ and ‘societal utility’, which provide a potentially wider leverage for Norwegian authorities to turn down the applications. Research material indicates evidence of an increasingly <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> in the Norwegian evaluations; raising the question of how this can be explained in the face of increasing global acceptance of GMOs. A related question is to what extent and how this result is affected by the trends in the EU. An increasingly <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> may be explained by changes in the access structure to the evaluating body, or it may be due to learning and a growing acceptance of the precautionary principle in this sector. Third, a higher number of rejections may largely be associated with the interest structure pertaining to GMOs in Norway. Final decisions are pending and there are uncertainties concerning how Norwegian authorities will apply the specific criteria of the Gene Technology Act.

40|$|Dental hygiene {{changes as}} it {{responds}} {{to a global}} society. One of these significant changes {{is the emergence of}} new roles for dental hygienists, which {{is a step in the}} professionalization process. However, little progress is perceived to have taken place in terms of determining what is valued in professionalism. The study examined what various groups of dental hygienists, including educational leaders, political leaders, and grassroots practitioners, perceived as having an impact on professionalism, and what importance these elements are perceived to have. ^ The investigation has realized the above purpose through analysis of qualitative data from focus groups and interviews, and quantitative data from surveys. The research design in the qualitative area was adapted to fit the need of the study, as supported by Lincoln and Guba. Phenomenology with modified-grounded theory was employed with focus groups and interviews of dental hygiene leaders. Constant comparative technique of data collection was used and dental hygienist co-researchers were employed to assure accuracy of the data. A survey was developed from these data and sent to a total of 1, 000 grassroots dental hygienists in two states. These states were Washington, perceived to be a liberal practice state, and Pennsylvania, perceived to be restrictive. ANOVAs were used to analyze these quantitative data. ^ Dental hygienists agree with the literature about elements that are important in professionalism. They also value six emergent elements. There were 13 independent variables studied; nine had significance and were reported. While some differences emerged with the groups, the results show that dental hygienists are a homogeneous group with shared values when professionalism is considered. ^ Definitions of liberal and <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> of dental hygiene emerged and the differences in the valuing of elements of professionalism between dental hygienists in liberal and <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> states were studied. Additional study is recommended. ...|$|E

40|$|Competition law - or {{antitrust}} law, as it {{is called}} in the United States - is a field of law to which economic concepts, such as "restriction of competition" and "anti-competitive effect", are of central importance. This thesis analyses a number of such concepts, both from an economic and a legal perspective. The first part reviews the economic literature on the competitive effects of vertical agreements (agreements concluded between firms operating at different levels of the production or distribution chain) and studies the role of economic analysis in the application of the EU competition rules towards such agreements. The second part of the thesis provides three applications of the game-theoretic analysis of restrictive practices. In two chapters, the rationale behind a particular type of <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice,</b> namely resale price maintenance, is tested in specific market circumstances. The final chapter is about cartel formation in industries where firms are uncertain about each other's pricing incentives. In a specific model, the general conception is tested that the likelihood of firms forming a cartel is greater in concentrated industries than in industries with many firms. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to answer the {{following}} question: What is the aim and the purpose of the migration-related detention? The question is further specified in four sub-questions provided in the introduction. Given that the essence of the detention is the deprivation of personal liberty as one of the fundamental human rights, the practice of detaining migrants in the Czech Republic seems to be in conflict with the personal liberty guarantees stipulated by the constitutional laws of the country, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and several international human rights treaties. Resolutions of this conflict requires that such conditions are identified, under which the restriction of personal liberty is permissible. The list of conditions is provided in the thesis, including a legitimate purpose of the restriction of the fundamental right. Any <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> must be capable of achieving this purpose and must not be misused for a purpose other than this. Subsequently, the thesis identifies aims of the different types of migrated-related detention, provided by the Czech laws - the Police Act, Aliens Act and the Asylum Act.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{experiences}} of a refugee family navigating complex disability and <b>restrictive</b> <b>practice</b> service systems. Living with disability, or caring for someone with disability can compound the disadvantage and marginalisation already experienced by refugees. The nexus between disability and refugee status, particularly intellectual disability and restrictive practices, has received little scholarly attention and almost nothing is known of people’s experiences in this situation. Design/methodology/approach - Thematic analysis of a case study is used to illustrate the experiences of a refugee family in this situation. The case study presented was part of a larger ethnographic study exploring the experiences of people of refugee background living with disability. Findings - There were numerous barriers to accessing appropriate services. The family experienced high levels of stress simultaneously navigating the resettlement process and the disability service system. They were poorly informed and disempowered regarding the care of their loved one and the use of restrictive practices. Experiences in the country of origin, employment responsibilities, and unfamiliarity with the service system were key factors in this family’s difficulty in safeguarding the rights of their family member with disability. Originality/value - This case study examines the complexity experienced when disability intersects with refugee background. Areas for additional research and significant gaps in service provision are identified. The case study clearly demonstrates the importance of understanding people’s pre- and post-settlement experiences to inform policy and service provision...|$|E
