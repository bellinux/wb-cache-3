25|$|Among {{the criticisms}} of the IIT system {{by the media and}} academia, a common notion is that it {{encourages}} brain drain. This trend has been reversed somewhat (dubbed the <b>reverse</b> <b>brain</b> <b>drain)</b> as hundreds of IIT graduates, who have pursued further studies in the USA, started returning to India in the 1990s. Additionally, IIT alumni are giving back generously to their parent institutions (examples are Kanwal Rekhi to IIT Bombay, Dr. Prabhakant Sinha to IIT Kharagpur, and many others). Until liberalisation started in the early 1990s, India experienced large scale emigration of IITians to developed countries, especially to the United States. Since 1953, nearly twenty-five thousand IITians have settled in the USA. Since the USA benefited from subsidised education in IITs at the cost of Indian taxpayers' money, critics say that subsidising education in IITs is useless. Others support the emigration of graduates, arguing that the capital sent home by the IITians has been a major source of the expansion of foreign exchange reserves for India, which, until the 1990s, had a substantial trade deficit.|$|E
2500|$|A {{part of the}} {{worldwide}} Arab diaspora, the Emirati diaspora is very small, {{mainly because of the}} adequate opportunities provided to citizens in the UAE, removing the need for many to live and work in other countries.

However, some skilled Emirati nationals move abroad to avail better work opportunities or gain valuable experience. According to one report, two out of three UAE nationals who moved abroad tended to have skilled credentials.

5000|$|Along {{with many}} African nations, South Africa has been {{experiencing}} a [...] "brain drain" [...] {{in the past}} 20 years.

In this paper we give a survey of the principal "Brain Drain Competition" policies implemented in Europe. The key strategies and mechanisms found are: making the academic system more open and flexible; improving the regulatory conditions particularly on immigration; better sign-posting and information at national level; dedicated grants for foreign researchers; adapting income situations to market forces; providing tax reductions specifically for researchers and knowledge workers; more active international marketing and support for international researchers. Finally, we analyse the effects of these policies on the <b>Brain</b> <b>Drain</b> in Europe by giving examples of countries (i. e.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and empirical studies have emphasized {{the fact that the}} prospect of international migration increases the expected returns to skills in poor countries, linking the possibility of migrating (<b>brain</b> <b>drain)</b> with incentives to higher education (brain gain). If emigration is uncertain and some of the highly educated remain, such a channel may, at least in part, counterbalance the negative effects of <b>brain</b> <b>drain.</b> Moreover, recent empirical evidence seems to show that temporary migration is widespread among highly skilled migrants (such as Eastern Europeans in Western Europe and Asians in the U. S.). This paper develops a simple tractable overlapping generations model that provides an economic rationale for return migration and which predicts who will migrate and who will return among agents with heterogeneous abilities. We use parameter values from the literature and the data on return migration to calibrate our model and simulate and quantify the effects of increased openness on human capital and wages of the sending countries.
