This paper {{develops}} a dynamic model of household bargaining and {{uses it to}} motivate an empirical analysis of the impact changes in Canadian laws regarding the allocation of family assets upon divorce on female suicide. Using time series data, we show that in Ontario, the passage of Canadian legislation that improved women’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> upon divorce was associated with reductions {{in the rate of}} female suicide amongst older (married) women while not affecting younger (unmarried) women. As suggested by our model, its impact was asymmetric in that male suicide rates were unaffected by this change. We also exploited a quasi-natural experiment in these data, namely that no comparable legislative change occurred in Quebec. Here, we do not observe a structural break in the data...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the state}} {{has proven to be}} incompetent in its {{management}} of state owned enterprises a new structure must be found that takes into account the incompetence of the state but ensures that the state's economic interests are preserved the best way possible. Two of the most difficult tasks in this process are how to exercise ownership <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> and simultaneously delegate decision making to the management of the firm. This paper finds that the solution of these problems is to lease state owned enterprises to entrepreneurs through contracts derived from the principal-agent literature where the state is the principal and the agent is the lessee. Since the state needs to delegate responsibility to the management of state owned enterprises, the process of reform becomes in reality a principal-agent problem. To facilitate the reform process it is necessary to establish a credit market because the lessee may have investment plans that need to be financed. So far no country has yet tried to implement lease schemes based on principal-agent contracts. Future work needs to build a bridge between theory and reality to see whether they both can benefit from the interaction.

40|$|This paper presumes the {{international}} {{discourse on the}} sustainability of development is concerned with: (a) the rights of future generations to the services of natural and produced assets; and (b) whether formal and informal institutions which affect the transfer of assets to future generations are adequate to assure {{the quality of life}} in the long-run. Sustainability is primarily an issue of intergenerational equity. The noneconomic discourse on sustainability is clearly about caring for the future. Conversely, this paper contests the implicit premises of economics as now practiced. First, in the face of the sustainability debate, many academic and practicing economists still assume that technology will offset resource depletion and environmental degradation. Second, existing theory on intertemporal resource allocation tacitly assumes that current generations hold all <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> and should efficiently exploit them. Third, there has been an implicit assumption that the mechanisms affecting the maintenance and transfer of assets to future generations are both working optimally and are unaffected by current economic decisions. This paper addresses each of these working premises of economics. It presents sociological explanations of how economics evolved to help identify how it became the way it is and to give perspective on how sustainability challenges the discipline.

40|$|This article empirically examines, the {{structure}} of relationships between business service firms and their clients, in particular, the allocation of control <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the intellectual <b>assets</b> created in joint projects. Business service firms are a distinctive case because their 'product' is essentially knowledge, {{and in many cases}} this knowledge is partly tacit and collectively generated and applied. It is proposed that allocation of the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> intellectual <b>assets</b> in service relationships has a bearing on the creation and deployment of knowledge. Therefore, {{from the perspective of a}} service firm, contractual arrangements need to be aligned with the nature of its knowledge base. Knowledge base is characterized here by the firm's service strategy and by its learning strategy. Estimation results using a survey dataset of 167 business service firms provide support for the conjecture. Service firms that provide expert skills or learn incrementally are less likely <b>to</b> retain control <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> their intellectual output. A possible interpretation is that control rights are less valuable to knowledge service providers, whose activities are based on tacit and non-replicable knowledge resources, than to firms with organizationally controlled and replicable resources.
