5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly <b>relevant</b> example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the surreal number , where Ï‰ is the first infinite ordinal; the <b>relevant</b> game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters <b>relevant</b> to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the <b>relevant</b> charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer <b>relevant,</b> or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more <b>relevant</b> legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.|$|E

5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS <b>relevant</b> to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be <b>relevant</b> to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E

Articles are selected that are <b>relevant</b> to the issues of injury prevention and safety promotion from over 16000 scholarly journals (as of January 2016) in the physical, biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, medicine, and the applied social sciences. SafetyLit also indexes selected doctoral theses and <b>relevant</b> technical reports from government agencies and NGOs.|$|E
