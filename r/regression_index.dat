The Equal Parent Index, <b>Regression</b> <b>Index</b> and Herd-Mate Average were calculated for each of eight bulls using five daughters and using all daughters. The study consisted of data collected from 1957 to 1965 in Oregon State University dairy herd.

In comparison between the <b>Regression</b> <b>Index</b> and Herd-Mate Average, neither method gave a clear-cut estimate; the <b>Regression</b> <b>Index</b> tended to give an overestimate while the Herd-Mate Average tended to give an underestimate of a bull's transmitting ability.

METHODS: Sixteen patients with RC (12 men, mean age 60. 7 [*]±[*] 12. 8  years) underwent integrated (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) /perfusion CT (PET/PCT), followed by neoadjuvant CRT and surgery. In 13 patients, PET/PCT was repeated after CRT. Perfusion [blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT) ] and metabolic [maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) ] parameters as well as the FMP (BF × SUVmax) were determined before and after CRT by two independent readers and correlated to histopathological prognostic factors of RC (microvessel density, necrosis index, <b>regression</b> <b>index,</b> vascular invasion) derived from resected specimens. The diagnostic performance of ΔFMP for prediction of treatment response was determined. RESULTS: FMP significantly decreased after CRT (p[*] [*] 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{modeling}} and removing outliers from 2 -D sets of scattered points is presented. The method {{relies on a}} principle due to Helmholtz stating that every large deviation from uniform noise should be perceptible, provided that the deviation is generated by an a contrario model of geometric structures. By as-suming local linearity, we first employ a robust algorithm to model the local manifold of the corrupted data by local line segments. Our rationale is that long line segments should not be expected in a noisy set of points. This assumption leads to the modeling of the lengths of the line segments by a Pareto distribution, which is the adopted a contrario model for the observations.

To adjust each noise source independently, we synthesized virtual laundry noises from actual laundry noise together with isolated sources of dropping noise, water noise, motor noise and circulation pump noise. We used this virtual noise to conduct a listening test by customers, finding that the dropping noise has a decisive effect on subjective sound quality. We conducted multiple regression analysis of sound quality using statistical data processing. The reliability of the multiple <b>regression</b> <b>index</b> was verified by comparison with subjective listening results and index results of actual laundry noises.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of localizing point sources in 3 D from {{boundary}} measurements of a wave field. Recently, we proposed the sensing principle which allows extracting volumetric samples of the unknown source distribution from the boundary measurements. The extracted samples allow a non-iterative re-construction algorithm that can recover the parameters of the source distribution projected on a 2 -D plane in the continuous domain without any discretization. Here we extend the method for the 3 -D localization of multiple point sources by combining multiple 2 -D planar projections. In particular, we propose a three-step algorithm to retrieve the locations by means of multiplanar application of the sensing principle. First, we find the projections of the locations onto several 2 -D planes. Second, we propose a greedy algorithm to pair the solutions in each plane. Third, we retrieve the 3 D locations by least squares <b>regression.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Sensing principle, finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI), wave equation, source imaging, inverse proble...|$|E

40|$|New {{evidence}} is provided {{to assess the}} recent controversy regarding the volatility of real economic activity before 1929 relative to the period since World War II. Some recent work claims that the longstanding stylized fact of greater prewar volatility is "spurious". In contrast, this paper reconfirms the greater amplitude of business fluctuations prior to the Great Depression. The basic technique is the regression method, which estimates equations for real GNP during 1909 - 38, {{with one or more}} explanatory variables for components of GNP, and then uses the estimated coefficients to "backcast" real GNP or the period 1869 - 1908. The paper contains an extensive examination of the sensitivity of these <b>regression</b> <b>indexes</b> to alternative dependent variables, sample periods, detrending methods, and the inclusion of alternative explanatory variables. Particular attention is paid to the conflicting evidence regarding the amplitude of cycles in construction activity between 1870 and 1890. The resulting prewar/postwar volatility ratios, for 1869 - 1928 as compared to 1950 - 1980, range from 1. 43 to 2. 16. The paper concludes by suggesting that this range of volatility ratios is more likely to understate than overstate the prewar/postwar volatility ratio. ...|$|R

However, the effects of variables other than DIF on the performance of the logistic <b>regression</b> and Mantel-Haenszel <b>indices</b> have yet to be researched. The present study examines the effects of sample size, item difficulty, item discrimination, and ability distribution on the distributions and percentiles (P 90 and P 95) of logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel statistics under the null hypothesis. Simulated data were used in order to evaluate the effects of the stated variables on the distributions of the logistic <b>regression</b> <b>indices</b> of uniform (LU) and nonuniform (LN) differential item functioning DIF or item bias. The same simulated data were used to evaluate the effects of the variables on Mantel-Haenzel procedure (MH-delta and MH-CHISQ).

This is evident {{from the fact that the}} distribution of LN and LU index are known and that the four independent variables had no significant effect on the LU index. However the observed values were notably larger than expected values. Further research should be done to evaluate the effects of the stated variables and others such as test length, and using data with known amount of dif. Generalization of this study should be proved by replications of its findings. Evidently, variables other than DIF, significantly influence the two procedures. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

In particular, we question {{the existence of a}} set of problems for which the use of fuzzy rules, in combination with genetic algorithms, produces more robust models, or classifiers that are inherently better than those arising from the Bayesian point of view. We will show that this set of problems actually exists, and comprises interval and fuzzy valued datasets, but it is not being exploited. Current genetic fuzzy classifiers deal with crisp classification problems, where the role of fuzzy sets is reduced to give a parametric definition of a set of discriminant functions, with a convenient linguistic interpretation. Provided that the customary use of fuzzy sets in statistics is vague data, we propose to test genetic fuzzy classifiers over imprecisely measured data and design experiments well suited to these problems. The same can be said about genetic fuzzy models: the use of a scalar fitness function assumes crisp data, where fuzzy models, a priori, do not have advantages over statistical <b>regression.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Fuzzy fitness function, fuzzy rule-based classifiers, fuzzy rule-based models, genetic fuzzy systems, vague data.

The presented study has proven that the El Nino and La Nina should be added to the weather forecast variables because of their major effects.

In this study, a probabilistic approach has been chosen to show the effect of El Nino and La Nina on the monthly maximum temperature. Different ENSO Indices have been proposed for El Nino or La Nina occurrences but each of them has some deficiencies. In order to overcome the drawback of using one of the ENSO Indices, the fuzzy based analysis approach has been chosen in this paper. Data from Chabahar, one of the stations in the south of Iran, has been chosen for the algorithm to be applied on. MATLAB has been used to run the algorithm on the data.

At this study, it has been tried to study cavitation from the view point {{of the effects of}} flow regime changes on spillway, changes of step dimensions and the change of number of steps. Therefore, five spillway models (one smooth spillway and four stepped spillways) have been used to assess the cavitation risk.

40|$|Abstract—Remotely sensed imagery {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as a powerful support for characterizing and estimating biodiversity. Spectral distance among sites {{has proven to be}} a powerful approach for detecting species composition variability. Regression analysis of species similarity versus spectral distance allows us to quantitatively estimate the amount of turnover in species composition with respect to spectral and ecological variability. In classical regression analysis, the residual sum of squares is minimized for the mean of the dependent variable distribution. However, many ecological data sets are characterized by a high number of zeroes that add noise to the regression model. Quantile regressions can be used to evaluate trend in the upper quantiles rather than a mean trend across the whole distribution of the dependent variable. In this letter, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regressions to estimate the decay of species similarity versus spectral distance. The achieved decay rates were statistically nonzero (p < 0. 01), considering both OLS and quantile regressions. Nonetheless, the OLS regression estimate of the mean decay rate was only half the decay rate indicated by the upper quantiles. Moreover, the intercept value, representing the similarity reached when the spectral distance approaches zero, was very low compared with the intercepts of the upper quantiles, which detected high species similarity when habitats are more similar. In this letter, we demonstrated the power of using quantile regressions applied to spectral distance decay to reveal species diversity patterns otherwise lost or underestimated by OLS <b>regression.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Biodiversity, distance decay, environmental gradients, quantile regressions...|$|E

At city level, some parameters were just proved by correlation analysis, but they were not used as explanatory variables in regression analysis in order to obtain optimal model. Those used in regression analysis are number of inhabitants and number of people in main age groups. <b>Regression</b> <b>index</b> R 2 indicates that this model explains 58, 78 % of the variability in total household waste generated in cities. To conclude, socio-demographic determinants of environmental protection are usually less relevant for explanation of fluctuations within waste management chain than psychological variables (attitudes, values, beliefs) and political factors. Anyway, literature review indicates that the investigations and assessment of future municipal waste streams should cover not only commonly used economic parameters, but also socio-demographic factors (Bach, 2003; Beigl, 2004; Řeháková, 2001) ...|$|E

Our design {{is inspired by}} recent advances in text-independent speaker recognition, where intra-class variability is modeled by factor analysis in Gaussian mix-ture model (GMM) space. We use approximations to GMM-likelihoods which allow variable-length data sequences to be represented as statistics of fixed size. Our experiments on NIST LRE’ 07 show that variability-compensation of these statistics can reduce error-rates {{by a factor of}} three.

These mid-latitude anomalies occur on timescales of up to a month, and are related to changes in wave forcing. A change in the meridional Brewer–Dobson circulation extends from the middle stratosphere into the mesosphere and forms a temperature-change quadrupole from Equator to pole. We develop a dynamical index based on detrended, deseasonalised mid-latitude temperature. When employed in multiple linear <b>regression,</b> this <b>index</b> can account for up to 60...|$|R

It is {{a modified version of}} a measure previously described by John O'Quigley and colleagues, itself a modification of Nagelkerke’s earlier proposal for a general index of determination. I describe Stata programs str 2 ph, which implements the new measure, and str 2 d, which implements a measure proposed in 2004 by Royston and Sauerbrei. I provide examples with real data.
