5000|$|In Estonia {{there is}} a {{universal}} deposit and recycling system since 2005 for one-time and <b>refillable</b> <b>containers.</b> In 2012, 90% of all PET bottles, 63% of all aluminium cans and 86% of all glass bottles sold in Estonia were returned into the deposit and recycling system. About the somewhat lower can and glass bottle return rates {{it must be noted}} that due to so-called [...] "alcohol tourism" [...] a remarkable number of beer cans and bottles are taken to neighbouring Finland and are not returned to Estonia. The donation buttons on vending machines which give your deposit amount to the charity organization were introduced in 2011. By the end of 2012, 49% of all vending machines had donation buttons. All of the deposits are €0.10 per bottle/can.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recycler}} {{places the}} empty bottle or can into the receiving aperture; the horizontal in-feed system allows {{the user to}} insert containers one at a time. (An alternative system, found in many older machines, {{is one in which}} the user opens a door by hand and places the empty container in a pan. When the door is released and closed, the process continues.) The bottle or can is then automatically rotated; the bottle/can is then scanned by an omnidirectional UPC scanner, which scans the beverage container's UPC. [...] Once a container is scanned, identified (matched to database) and determined to be a participating container, it is processed and typically crushed (for one-time-use containers) to reduce its size, to avoid spillages of liquid and to increase storage capacity. <b>Refillable</b> <b>containers</b> are collected and sorted by hand to be brought back to the bottling company. The machines can use material recognition instead of/as well as a bar code scanner when needed.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{sustainability}} (ES) from {{a consumer}} perspective refers to four behavior dimensions: 1. Consumers purchasing less of: unrecycled goods (e. g., gasoline motored cars) {{and more of}} recycled substitutes (e. g., battery-motored cars), environmentally unfriendly goods (e. g., paper communications) and more of environmentally friendly substitutes (e. g., electronic communications), goods with environmentally unfriendly packaging (e. g., orange juice in plastic bottles) and more goods with environmentally friendly packaging (e. g., <b>refillable</b> <b>containers),</b> and goods that consume much energy (e. g., gas guzzler cars) and more goods that consume less energy (e. g., economy cars); 2. Consumers consuming less material and energy goods (e. g., decreasing consumer spending and using less heat in the winter months and less air conditioning in the summer months); 3. Consumers enhancing the longevity of their material possessions by maintaining and repairing them instead of disposing and purchasing new ones (e. g., repairing one’s car instead of trading it in for a new one); and 4. Consumers disposing of their material possessions in environmentally friendly ways (e. g., recycling most of their throwaways). Available Outcome Measure...|$|R
40|$|Ontarians are {{producing}} more waste {{per capita than}} previous generations and consuming more bottled water. Using the product policy quadrangle developed by Oosternhuis (1996), the research examines four components of Ontario bottled water packaging policy— policy objectives, policy instruments, product groups and actors. Interviews with Ontario experts reveal stakeholder communication and Extended Producer Responsibility can promote packaging minimization. There was no agreement about whether Ontario has a waste policy framework to support bottled water waste reduction, reuse and recycling. Stakeholders did agree that a policy framework can help to promote packaging minimization. The discussion will examine the following: various concepts to support zero waste, eco-labelling, policy objectives, enforcement, use of language, focus on financial obligations, deposit-return systems, <b>refillable</b> <b>containers,</b> bottle standardization, waste minimization, how waste is measured, {{an evaluation of the}} waste hierarchy, reporting waste reduction and reuse, learning from history and alternative methods of encouraging the consumption of municipal water. The research recommends these changes be implemented with the development of the new Waste Diversion Act. The research recommends that Ontario implement Integrated Product Policy and Extended Producer Responsibility to support packaging minimization...|$|R
40|$|Closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) {{refer to}} supply chains where {{products}} or materials re-enter the production or distribution stream {{at some point}} during their lifecycles forming closed cycles. CLSCs have gained more importance in recent years due to the emergence of environmental legislation, and company recognition of economic benefits associated with value recovery from used goods. This study considers factors that {{play an important role in}} the establishment of CLSCs. Facilitators and obstacles encountered in forming closed loops are extracted from published cases. Another approach utilised in this study is the application of an existing supply chain paradigm that relates product type to supply chain characteristics in a reverse flow context. Some facilitating factors have been found to apply to most return types, such as designing modular components and standardised parts, establishing designated central returns facilities, and using information exchange and tracking technologies. However, the analysis conducted in this study suggests that certain factors have more influence on specific types of returns. Short life cycle products require responsive disposition and processing, enabled by systems that identify disposition alternatives, products that are designed for disassembly, and standardised grading and sorting systems. The same factors facilitate the recovery of less innovative factors such as photocopiers, although the time constraint is not as significant as in short life cycle products. The study also shows that efficient supply chains are required to accommodate to functional products (e. g. <b>refillable</b> <b>containers,</b> fast moving consumer goods), end of life products, material flows in industrial ecosystems, and repair parts of long life cycle products such as cars and jet engines. Facilitating factors for the formation of efficient CLSCs were found to be primarily cost-reduction related. They include establishing strong relationships with suppliers to maintain a stable supply, and with competitors to achieve higher economies of scale. Other factors include governmental support, physical proximity of supply chain partners, and the provision of enough incentives for them to engage in closed loop activities...|$|R

40|$|Food and {{packaging}} interactions that may impair the food quality {{have been studied}} and methods to determine these interactions have been developed. An off-line supercritical fluid extraction method using carbon dioxide was developed and used to extract sorbed low molecular weight compounds from polymer films. This method is quantitatively comparable to methylene chloride extraction, but faster and more environmental friendly. Both external factors like humidity, and properties of the food itself (e. g. type and concentration of compounds) were found to affect the type and degree of interaction with the packaging material. The relative humidity (RH) was found to affect the permeation and sorption of aldehyde and alcohol vapours in both polar (EVOH) and unpolar (LLDPE and HDPE) polymers. The alcohols and aldehydes were affected in different ways. In the EVOH film the permeability of aldehydes increased with increasing RH while the permeability of alcohols was at a maximum at 50 % RH. This difference is attributed to the different ability of the compounds to interact with sorbed water and the polymer and {{can be explained by}} also studying the sorption and diffusion of the compounds. Sorption of vegetable oil into polyolefins (HDPE and PP) increased the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) through the polymers. After 40 days of storage in rapeseed oil, the OTR of a 40. my. m HDPE-film was increased by approximately 40 % compared to the OTR of the virginal polymer. The PP film was affected to a lesser extent. As foods consist of a complex mixture of many compounds it is often necessary to use a simplified model system to study aroma/packaging interactions. The effect of the model system (i. e. gas/liquid state, concentration, and mixture of compounds) on the sorption data obtained was investigated. Hexyl acetate and ethyl butyrate in a liquid model system (40 % ethanol) at a concentration of 50 or 1000. my. g/ml, were sorbed to a lesser extent from a mixture of compounds than from a single compound solution. The use of single compound solutions may thus lead to overestimation of the amounts sorbed in an actual food packaging application. However, at low concentrations (i. e. 5. my. /ml), which could be found in foods, the compounds were found to be sorbed in the packaging material independently of co-sorbants. The aroma vapours were sorbed in amounts related to the feed concentration without any interactive effects of co-sorbants, in the concentration range (i. e. 0. 12 - 3. 4. my. g/ml) and mixtures investigated. In spite of the increasing use of <b>refillable</b> polymer <b>containers</b> for foods there is currently no standard test procedure to check the sorption and remigration of aroma or misuse chemicals into/from the packaging material. A test scheme for a cost and time-efficient inertness test for determination of the interactions between misuse chemicals or aroma compounds and refillable PET bottles was developed. Small strips of PET bottle walls in contact with a selection of model contaminants were used in the test. This thesis shows the importance of studying the barrier properties of a polymer film under as realistic conditions as possible, taking into account both the storage conditions and the interactions between a food and the packaging material...|$|R
