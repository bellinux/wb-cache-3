40|$|Student Number : 0353470 - MA {{research}} report - School of Philosophy - Faculty of HumanitiesThe South African Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act 92 of 1996 {{is regarded as}} one of the most liberal abortion laws in the world. It aims to uphold the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> women as equal citizens, give effect to their rights to reproductive healthcare and redress past discriminatory legislation. Conscientious objection by healthcare providers to terminating pregnancies is also allowed in terms of the act. This {{research report}} considers the justification for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> by the healthcare provider in the face of the conflicting claims of a pregnant woman seeking abortion. There are good reasons for a pregnant woman’s right to terminate pregnancy, just as they exist for the healthcare provider who objects, on grounds of conscience, to involvement in the process. I will attempt to balance these sets <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> weigh priorities, and offer possible solutions. A focus on the unique value of each individual demands that each one be accorded dignity and respect. Thus ways of minimizing conflict are explored. Though compromise may be required, it is important that healthcare workers have the freedom to live their lives with integrity...|$|R

5000|$|Conscience {{began as}} The Peace Tax Campaign in 1979. A Cornish Quaker, Stanley Keeble sought to {{establish}} the legal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> to military taxation, suggesting that the portion of tax {{that was used to}} fund the military should instead be used for peaceful purposes. He initially sent out a leaflet announcing the beginning of the Peace Tax Campaign, and began a campaign of letter writing, lectures and organising meetings to bring together those with similar ideas. People were actively encouraged to write to their MPs to change the law, something Conscience continues to do today. A letter to the Guardian newspaper signed by both MPs and religious leaders brought the campaign to national attention in 1981, leading to over 3,000 supporters and 50 local co-ordinators to join the campaign. In 1981 Alex Lyon MP put forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to allow those with a [...] "conscientious objection to paying for expenditure on defence" [...] to pay the military part of their taxes to the then Ministry of Overseas Development. This, though unsuccessful, was the first attempt to enable such legislation in the UK. Since then the campaign have submitted a number of Early Day Motions and 10 Minute Rule Bills.|$|R

Article 51 gives the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> self Article seems to have a diametrical ap consensus with regard to the concept of aggression. What the Article intent to prohibit is the aggressive war. Though war is a peremptory <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the state and is closely associated with the right to existence it is not absolutely an unconditional right. It is a last resort for existence; perhaps the right to wage war has undergone a dramatic change with the development and advancement of civilization among the nations and that’s why a exceptional right under exceptional circumstance and as an eternal right for existence, so it’s clear that war do existence as a legal affirmation under UN Charter but with restric self-defense can be exercised to protect states eternal right to existence.

40|$|Over the years, {{states have}} been {{developing}} and implementing legislation {{with the aim of}} protecting individuals against discrimination, inter alia, on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Recent developments have led to an expansion of the concept of ‘family’ to include same-sex couples and single parents and the progressive adjustment of the law with a view to extend parenthood rights to less ‘’traditional’ family forms. In terms of access to parenthood, <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> conscience may arise in relation to facilitating adoption by same-sex couples or single parent adoption, whereby religious objectors may feel that their professional duties are in direct conflict with the tenets of their religion. Conscientious objections have traditionally been expressed by persons whose beliefs are at odds with laws compelling them to carry out certain functions, such as facilitating adoptions in same-sex families or registering and officiating civil unions. The progressive legal recognition of alternative family unions and parenthood rights to non-traditional family forms on the one hand, and the manifestation of religious beliefs outside an individual’s forum internum 1 on the other, can be described as an ‘explosive mix’ <b>of</b> conflicting <b>rights</b> and freedoms.

In the European context, the European Court <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights</b> has demonstrated through its jurisprudence that although a ‘human right’ to conscientious objection exists, this is not absolute, but subject to permissible limitations as found in Article 9 (2) ECHR 2 including the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> and freedoms <b>of</b> others...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree ofDoctor of PhilosophyThe protection <b>of</b> the emerging <b>right</b> <b>of</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> to military service {{is one of the}} most challenging questions in international human rights law. The primary objective of this doctoral thesis is to clearly identify the minimum international legal standards on the phenomenon <b>of</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> to military service as emerging from the jurisprudence <b>of</b> international human <b>rights</b> bodies. Furthermore, this study aims to explore and assess how the Member States of the Council of Europe are effectively implementing these standards within their domestic laws and practice. The implementation of legal standards on conscientious objection in the Council of Europe varies considerably between the 47 Member States of the organisation due to a rapidly transforming sociopolitical landscape that affects the speed in which legislative and procedural amendments take place. Some of the themes explored throughout this thesis include: the legal contours <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to conscientious objection to military service, including the grounds legally accepted to justify a conscientious objection; procedural guarantees with regard to the application process to be granted conscientious objectors status; the provision of accurate information to members of the public affected by mandatory military service and the extension of these principles to professional members of the armed forces. The thesis is structured as a thematic presentation of applicable international human rights standards and State practice and explores common issues, best practices and future challenges between the Member States of the organisation. The study does not merely aspire to describe the present situation in the Council of Europe, but rather aims to contribute to academic know ledge by proposing the development of a more coherent framework of legal and procedural obligations, based on the need to review and adapt national legislation in accordance to indicators and benchmarks derived from the Council's standard-setting policies...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Patients who consult {{hospital}} due {{to physical}} or mental damages have legal <b>rights.</b> Observation <b>of</b> patients <b>rights</b> will result in patient satisfaction, which will help to improve hospital services. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine awareness and observation <b>of</b> patients <b>right</b> in hospitals affiliated with medical universities in Tehran. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2009 in hospitals affiliated with medical universities in Tehran. A total of 601 patients were randomly selected from 11 hospitals affiliated with three medical universities in Tehran. Data were collected using a 50 -item questionnaire the validity and reliability of which had been confirmed. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. The software used was SPSS. 17. Results: The mean age of the patients (59 % females and 41 % males) was 43. 3 (SD= 18. 5) years and the average length of hospitalization 7. 1 (SD= 7. 4) days. Data analysis showed that the proportions of the patients with a poor, intermediate and desirable patients rights awareness were 71. 5 %, 22. 0 % and 5. 8 %, respectively. Observation <b>of</b> patients <b>rights</b> was good in 13. 8 % of the cases, medium in 82. 9 % of the cases and poor in 3. 3 % of the cases. There was a significant statistical relationship between observation <b>of</b> patients <b>rights</b> on the one hand and the hospital ward and length of stay on the other hand (p= 0 / 007). Further analysis of the data showed that the strongest and the weakest observed rights were patient awareness right and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> making <b>objections</b> and lodging complaints, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that patients are not well aware <b>of</b> patients <b>rights</b> and that observation <b>of</b> patients <b>rights</b> is not at a desirable level. We recommend organizing public educational programs including components on patients <b>rights</b> and follow-up <b>of</b> patient <b>rights</b> violations, as well as passing a comprehensive act to ensure observation <b>of</b> patients <b>rights</b> and specific programs designed for monitoring and supervising it...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In fall 2011 the Norwegian {{government}} {{issued a}} statement specifying that there exists no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> conscientious <b>objection</b> (CO) for Norwegian GPs. Previously, informal collegial agreements had existed among {{a limited number of}} GPs. This allowed GPs to avoid referrals to terminations of pregnancy, in vitro fertilization and administration of certain types of contraception. The statement sparked a lively public discourse lasting nearly 3 years. METHOD: This paper examines the reasons used for or against CO for GPs in Norwegian newspaper entries in {{the first few months of}} the debate. Entries were included through searching the Norwegian news database ATEKST for the period 01. 07. 11 - 30. 06. 12. Entries that did not concern the current debate, were identical to other entries or that did not present any reasons were excluded. The reasons in the included entries were analyzed and categorized in broad and narrow categories and according to whether they were used in support of, in opposition to or were ambiguous to CO for GPs. RESULTS: 327 entries were identified whereof 138 did not concern the debate, 21 were identical to other entries and 6 did not present any reason. Of the 162 entries analyzed, 845 reasons were identified. Among these 596 supported, 220 opposed and 29 were ambiguous to CO for GPs. The arguments were categorized into 27 broad and 201 narrow categories of reasons, of which 118 were supportive, 75 were opposed and 8 were ambiguous to CO for GPs. DISCUSSION: The strengths and weaknesses of this method are discussed. The validity of some of the relevant and predominant reasons for and against CO are discussed. The author is a personal proponent of CO for GPs, and the influence of this opinion on this paper is also discussed...|$|R
