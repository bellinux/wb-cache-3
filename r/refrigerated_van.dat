2500|$|The {{refrigerated}} {{rail car}} (<b>refrigerated</b> <b>van</b> or refrigerator car), {{along with the}} dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before {{the invention of the}} refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots. [...] Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. [...] After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. [...] The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. [...] The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. [...] During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war. [...] The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. [...] This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for {{a good portion of the}} year while making no revenue for the car’s owner. [...] The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east. [...] The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. [...] By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.|$|E

Loading guidelines exist for cattle that attempt to prevent injury or debilitation during transit, and literature exists on the orientation and some kinematics of loaded cattle.

However, no research is reported on the case of a loaded livestock trailer—although it is analogized (incorrectly) to the above. The research that is outlined herein focuses specifically on loaded Class 8 tractors and livestock semi-trailers. The authors have engaged in an extensive program involving the five following components: 1. Extensive full scale testing of loaded livestock trailers in accepted test protocols including: a. Tilt table tests (SAE J 2180) b. U-turn maneuvers (SAE J 2181) c. 200 ft. radius turns (SAE J 2181) d. Slalom maneuver (ISO 7401) e. Highway Evasive maneuver (ISO 3888) 2. Driving on public roads at highway speeds 3. Simulation of the tractor-trailer using EDVDS (Engineering Dynamics Vehicle Dynamics Simulator) to perform the driving maneuvers in the computer environment. 4. Comparison to quasi-static analysis using a static roll model (SRM). 5. Analysis of videotape of cattle during test maneuvers. Results of this research verify the stability of Class 8 livestock trailers and validate the use of EDVDS as tool for analysis...|$|E
40|$|On days 30 September and 1 - 2 October 2013, a 7. 8 m long ice core {{has been}} {{extracted}} from a permanent ice cave deposit in the Southeastern Alps (Vasto’s cave, Mt. Canin - Julian Alps). Each 20 to 100 cm long {{section of the}} ice core have been immediately stored in plastic bags and preserved thanks to dry ice. The ice samples, thanks to the helicopter, has been subsequently brought on valley and promptly stored in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>van,</b> made available by BoFrost. Thus the ice cores has been transported intact to the EUROCOLD laboratory in Milan. These operations {{have been carried out}} within the project MONICA (MONitoring of Ice within CAves) promoted by University of Trieste, Italy thanks to the “Finanziamento di Ateneo per progetti di ricerca scientifica-FRA 2012 ”. The choice of the place where to extract the ice core has been selected after a dedicated high-resolution GPR survey performed {{on the surface of the}} ice deposit. This methodology allowed to visualize and avoid debris and boulders present in the ice deposit that could have damaged the tip of the ice driller. In this way it was possible to extract the longest core ever extracted in the Italian Alps in an ice cave. The ice core has been cut and stored thanks to the EUROCOLD facilities and a detailed full stratigraphic analysis has been realized. All the samples are now ready to be analyzed by using isotope geochemistry techniques (δ 18 O and δD), crystallographic analysis and C 14 radiocarbon dating of organic materials. The preliminary results allow us to hypothesize the use of additional methods for a complete characterization of this very interesting potential paleoclimatic recor...|$|E

50|$|A covered goods wagon or van is {{a railway}} goods wagon which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof.
