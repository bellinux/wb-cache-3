5|$|Boletopsis nothofagi is {{the most}} {{southern}} member of the genus Boletopsis, and as of 2013 the sole known member of the genus in the Southern Hemisphere; its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> found in Asia and Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat is {{the only}} extant species in the family Craseonycteridae, which is grouped in the {{superfamily}} Rhinolophoidea {{as a result of}} molecular testing. Based on this determination, the bat's closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> members of the families Hipposideridae and Rhinopomatidae.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Two {{unrelated}} {{patients with}} Bernard-Soulier syndrome and their <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> studied. The patients demonstrated severe bleeding diathesis, the <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> asymptomatic.

5|$|The ruff is a wader in {{the large}} family Scolopacidae, the typical shorebirds. Recent {{research}} suggests that its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> the broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus, and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata. It has no recognised subspecies or geographical variants.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the song thrush's closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|E
5|$|Although no {{specific}} {{studies have been}} done on the black catbird's feeding ecology, it is thought to be an omnivore, like its close <b>relatives</b> <b>are.</b> It is known to eat the fruits of Bursera simaruba and Ficus cotinifolia, two deciduous trees found in the Neotropics.|$|E

5|$|Antlions {{are poorly}} {{represented}} in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a monophyletic group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions' closest living <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to be the}} owlflies (Ascalaphidae). The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history, and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times.|$|E
5|$|Portia {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which is}} thought to be primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Portia {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Portia′s closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> the genera Spartaeus, Phaeacius, and Holcolaetis.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah's closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> the cougar (Puma concolor) and the {{jaguarundi}} (P.yagouaroundi). These {{three species}} together form the Puma lineage, {{one of the}} eight lineages of Felidae. The sister group of the Puma lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera Felis, Otocolobus and Prionailurus.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> unrelated to European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the songbird infraorder Passerida. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird and its prey consists of insects and spiders. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.|$|E
5|$|This bird's closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> a {{group of}} South Polar species, the South American (Sterna hirundinacea), Kerguelen (S. virgata), and Antarctic (S. vittata) terns. On the {{wintering}} grounds, the Arctic tern can be distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in moult is the best clue here, with Arctic terns being in winter plumage during the southern summer. The southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flight.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the large}} dabbling duck genus Anas, the {{northern}} pintail's closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> other pintails, {{such as the}} yellow-billed pintail (A. georgica) and Eaton's pintail (A. eatoni). The pintails are sometimes separated in the genus Dafila (described by Stephens, 1824), an arrangement supported by morphological, molecular and behavioural data. The famous British ornithologist Sir Peter Scott gave this name to his daughter, the artist Dafila Scott.|$|E

50|$|According to Kakil Erdem, one of {{the living}} eyewitnesses of the Zilan massacre, thirty-five of his <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> killed, and {{soldiers}} cut and opened the abdomen of a pregnant woman.

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> easily {{distinguished}} by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson {{classified}} the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in {{the genus}} Parascaphirhynchus and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all sturgeon worldwide. Its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which may soon become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has only one other genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by three species found in west-central Asia.|$|E

5|$|Telopea truncata is one, and {{possibly}} the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. It is the earliest offshoot of a lineage that {{gives rise to the}} Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) and Monga waratah (T.mongaensis) of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of T.truncata are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing the centre of the flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away.|$|E
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is one of}} 19 species in the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original spiny lobster genus, Palinurus. Its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail (Atlantisia rogersi) {{is a small}} bird of {{the rail}} family, Rallidae. It is the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Endemic to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan Archipelago in the {{isolated}} south Atlantic, it is notable for being the smallest extant flightless bird in the world. The species was described by physician Percy Lowe in 1923 but had first come {{to the attention of}} scientists 50 years earlier. The Inaccessible Island rail's closest <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> uncertain but may be crakes in the genus Laterallus.|$|E
