5|$|Initially, the Clearview was {{intended}} to <b>run</b> <b>along</b> the existing right-of-ways of Utopia Parkway and Francis Lewis Boulevard. An alternate proposed routing would have <b>run</b> <b>along</b> Little Neck Bay and through Alley Pond Park, essentially parallel to the Cross Island Parkway. By September 1956, the Clearview was mapped along 206th and 207th Streets and Hollis Court Boulevard, east of Francis Lewis Boulevard, after community opposition. The reroute {{reduced the number of}} properties to be demolished or relocated from 860 to 421. An information center was set up by the TBTA for local residents displaced by the expressway.|$|E

Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
