40|$|The dynamic tensile {{mechanical}} {{response of}} a soft polymer material (Clear Flex 75) is investigated using a split Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB). Stress-strain relations are derived {{to reveal the}} mechanical properties at moderate and high strain rates. These relations appear to be <b>rate</b> dependent. Under <b>static</b> <b>loading,</b> the polymer exhibits an elastomeric behaviour, while under dynamic loading, the response is elasto-plastic with a hardening branch. The critical strain rate for transition from a rubbery-like behaviour at low strain rates to a glassy-like behaviour at high strain rates at room temperature is determined. The axial and lateral deformation of the specimen in the SHTB test is recorded by a high-speed camera. The final fracture surface is examined by SEM to explore the physical origins of deformation and fracture behaviour: void formation, craze nucleation, craze extension, crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, a shielding mechanism is revealed by the observation of crazing and micro cracking in the crack tip zone, which contributes to the dynamic tensile toughness of CF 75 polymer material. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Before {{concrete}} {{structures are}} subjected to dynamic loadings such as earthquake, usually they have already withstood <b>static</b> <b>loads.</b> Accordingly, the study on the strain-rate sensitivity of concrete should also be {{closely related to the}} initial <b>static</b> <b>loads</b> that concrete structures experience.

In this study, experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> on the dynamic strength and deformation characteristics of concrete in compression. A load was initially applied on the specimen at a very low speed to a specified value and then the dynamic load was applied at a high strain rate up to the failure of the specimen. From the test results it was revealed that the initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> had significant influence on the dynamic strength.

40|$|The {{effect of}} oxygen partial {{pressure}} on crack growth rates in Alloy 617 {{has been studied}} using both <b>static</b> and fatigue <b>loading</b> at 650 °C. Tests were conducted at a constant stress intensity factor, K, for <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> conditions or constant AK for fatigue loading using a direct current potential drop measurement system to measure crack length. The oxygen concentration was measured on both the outlet of the test retort as well as in-situ with a probe located directly at the specimen surface. High purity argon gas was used to establish oxygen partial pressures at low as 10 - 22 atm while premixed oxygen/argon gases were used to vary the oxygen potential. For fatigue loading, the crack path was observed to be transgranular with increasing growth rates as the oxygen concentration was increased. A transition oxygen partial pressure of approximately 10 - 5 atm was found to exist, at which the fatigue crack growth rates started to increase with increases in oxygen concentration in the environment. Furthermore, fatigue at R = 0. 5 also showed a slight increases in growth rates when the frequency was decreased from 2 Hz to 0. 1 Hz. In contrast, the fracture surfaces resulting from <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> {{were found to be}} intergranular and exhibited two different environmental behaviors. At a stress intensity factor of 49. 5 MPa'Im, decreasing the oxygen potential lead to an increase in crack growth <b>rates.</b> However, the <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> crack growth <b>rates</b> 33. 0 MPadm exhibited negligible variation with oxygen potential. Detailed microstructural analysis of fracture surfaces and grain boundaries ahead of crack tips was performed using Auger spectroscopy. (cont.) The results confirm the formation of chromium oxide in the wake of cracking and provide little or no indication of intergranular oxygen diffusion ahead of the crack. However, the resolution of the Auger spectroscopy results was insufficient for a definitive statement in this regard. The observations in this study most closely relate to dynamic embrittlement process involving short range intergranular oxygen absorption under the presence of stress. by Julian K. Benz. Thesis (S.

40|$|The {{determination}} of bridge lifetime load {{effect is a}} complex problem. Usually, statistical extrapolation of simulated <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect is used to derive a lifetime characteristic <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect. In reality, when a vehicle crosses a bridge, dynamic interaction occurs which often causes a greater total load effect. This total load effect {{is related to the}} <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect through a dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Often the worst estimated DAF is applied to the lifetime <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect to obtain a total lifetime characteristic load effect. This does not allow for the reduced probabilities of both high <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and high dynamic interaction. The authors present an approach that accounts for this reduced probability by using multivariate extreme value theory, in conjunction with extensive static simulations and 3 -D finite element bridge-truck dynamic interaction models. It is found that the DAF that should be applied to the characteristic <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect is significantly less than originally thought. This has significant implications for the type of traffic (free-flowing or congested) thought to govern short- to medium-length bridges...|$|R

40|$|The {{delamination}} fracture behaviour in <b>static</b> {{and fatigue}} <b>loading</b> for T 300 / 914 C composite laminate has been experimentally investigated by MMB test. The composite laminate examined exhibited various crack growth behaviours for different Mixed-Mode rates. The {{results show that}} the total delamination fracture toughness G_c for T 300 / 914 C composite material decreases with increase in Mixed-Mode ratio m. Fractographs of MMB specimens for T 300 / 914 C show that two typical fracture mechanisms. One, the interfacial debonding was combined with deformation of the resin matrix (associated with Mode II failure). Another one was commonly matrix failure indicating relatively good adhesion between fibre and resin. The matrix failure was occurred in interface of the inhomogeneous system and the granular fracture surface was observed. Besides, the fibre breakage observed on the fracture surfaces at m > 1 indicates that the fibre bridging existed in fracture procedure. These features are typical fracture fashion for T 300 / 914 C laminate under Mode I (DCB). Moreover, as the Mode I load increased, the fracture feature of Mode I increased obviously. The transition of fracture mechanism can be observed at m = 1. The delamination growth may be controlled by Mode I loading. The Mode I loading {{plays a major role in}} the delamination failure behaviour of carbon-fibre reinforced composites under Mixed-Mode loading and the influence of Mode I loading on Mode II failure is primarily that it constrains the development of crack-tip plastic deformation (associated with the Mode II contribution). The interaction between Mode I and Mode II loading may be characterised by the interaction parameter (I_i) "M. The delamination fracture behaviour 0 f T 300 / 914 C laminates was compared with the delamination fracture behaviour of T 300 /M 10 and of HAT/ 6376. The difference of the delamination behaviour between T 300 / 914 (or HAT/ 6376) and T 300 /M 10 was that nature of interfacial adhesion between fibre and matrix resin. The delamination growth rates in a wide range of #DELTA#G are not much difference. The delamination growth is discontinuous with the number of cycles depending upon the #DELTA#G value and the material structure. The fatigue crack growth rate associates with the value of strain energy release <b>rate</b> under <b>static</b> <b>loading,</b> although cyclic fatigue crack growth occurs under stresses which would not induce fracture under <b>static</b> <b>loading.</b> As was expected, fatigue crack growth rate for MMB tests lie well between DCB and ENF tests.
