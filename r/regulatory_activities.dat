40|$|We {{examine the}} {{determinants}} of environmental <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> (inspections and enforcement actions) for 1616 U. S. manufacturing plants in four large U. S. cities – Los Angeles, Boston, Columbus, and Houston – using data for 2000 - 2002. The main focus of our study is to examine whether or not regulators treat different {{segments of the population}} differently, by directing more <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> at plants in rich, white neighborhoods and less in poor, minority neighborhoods, controlling for characteristics of the plant (size, age, and industry), and the plant’s past environmental performance. To date, tests of “Environmental Justice” hypotheses tend to focus on whether or not polluters are disproportionately likely to locate in neighborhoods with relatively high poor/minority populations, or on whether polluters located in those neighborhoods emit disproportionately high levels of pollution. Focusing instead on the allocation of enforcement activity across neighborhoods within each city allows us to shed light on a key mechanism through which discrepancies in pollution exposure across neighborhoods could arise and persist. Our results show relatively little statistically significant evidence that <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> is less intense near disadvantaged demographic groups. We do find some suggestive coefficients - plants located in minority neighborhoods face less <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> - but this effect is generally insignificant, and plants located in poor neighborhoods face (insignificantly) more <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> In contrast, we do find significant effects for plant characteristics and political variables, with plants that are larger and more energy-intensive, owned by single-plant firms, and located near politically active and liberal populations, facing more <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> environmental justice, <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity,</b> enforcement, political, poor, minority...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the large and {{expanding}} area of Environmental Justice (EJ). The {{research in this area}} has developed from examining relatively simple comparisons of current demographic characteristics near environmental nuisances to performing multiple regression analysis and considering demographics at the time of siting. One area that has received considerably less attention is the identification of potential mechanisms that could be driving observed EJ correlations. We extend the current literature by examining one possible mechanism: the intensity of <b>regulatory</b> enforcement <b>activity.</b> If regulators pay less attention to the environmental performance of plants located near poor and minority areas, those plants might feel less pressure to pursue pollution abatement projects, increasing environmental hazards in those areas. We perform our analysis on a sample of manufacturing plants located near four large U. S. cities: Los Angeles, Boston, Columbus, and Houston. Our analysis of <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> found little evidence that demographic variables {{have a significant impact on}} the allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> In particular, <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> does not seem to be less intense in plants located near particular demographic groups. It is true that plants located in minority neighborhoods are inspected less often and face fewer enforcement actions, but these effects are nearly always small and insignificant, and plants located in lower-income areas seem to face (surprisingly) more <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> In a separate analysis, we also find very little evidence that demographic variables significantly influence pollution emissions.. In summary, the results presented here do not show much evidence to support EJ concerns about either <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> or pollution emissions, at least within the set of plants, pollutants, and time periods covered in our analysis. environmental justice, <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity,</b> enforcement, political, poor, minority...|$|R

40|$|Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} food-borne gastroenteritis. A major virulence determinant {{of the organism}} is a type III secretion system (T 3 SS 2) encoded on a pathogenicity island, Vp-PAI. Vp-PAI gene expression is regulated by two transcriptional regulators, VtrA and VtrB, whose N-terminal regions share homology with an OmpR-family DNA-binding domain. VtrA activates the gene expression of VtrB, which in turn activates Vp-PAI gene expression; however, the mechanism of this transcriptional activation by VtrA is not well understood. In this study, we determined that VtrA is a membrane protein with a transmembrane (TM) domain, which was required for its transcriptional <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> Although the N-terminal region of VtrA alone is insufficient for its transcriptional <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity,</b> forced oligomerization using the leucine-zipper dimerization domain of yeast GCN 4 conferred transcriptional <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> and a greater affinity for the promoter region of vtrB. A ToxR-based assay demonstrated that VtrA oligomerizes in vivo. We also showed that bile, a host-derived activator of VtrA, induces the oligomerization of VtrA, which requires the C-terminal domain. The promoter region of vtrB contained repetitive T-rich DNA elements, which are important for vtrB transcriptional activation and are conserved among T 3 SS 2 -possessing Vibrio species. These findings propose that VtrA is active as oligomers, which may facilitate its N-terminus binding the target DNA, thus enhancing its transcriptional <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Claims about {{government}} regulation and its detrimental effects on job creation {{and economic growth}} are currently receiving substantial attention in the public sphere. Yet, conclusive evidence demonstrating this link between <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> and macroeconomic indicators remains elusive. This paper seeks to empirically examine these linkages, using the on-budget costs of regulation over time {{as a proxy for}} federal <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> Our analysis finds that the macroeconomic effects of regulatory agency budgets as a whole as well as of subcategories of regulatory spending are indistinguishable from no effect based on the data and statistical methods available. This finding is generally robust throughout our sensitivity analysis. We explore possible explanations for this finding, as well as why our results differ from other studies on the same subject. This report highlights throughout the numerous challenges associated with both accurately measuring <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> and obtaining valid estimates of its effects on the macroeconomy. It also offers recommendations moving forward on how to keep the public conversation about regulation constructive and evidence-based...|$|R
40|$|Clusterin (CLU) is a {{ubiquitous}} {{protein that}} has been implicated in tumorigenesis, apoptosis, inflammation, and cell proliferation. We and others have previously shown that CLU is an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. However, the exact form of CLU and the region(s) of CLU involved in this effect were unknown. Using newly generated molecular constructs encoding for CLU and various regions of the molecule, we demonstrated that the presecretory form of CLU (psCLU) form bears the NF-κB <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> Sequence comparison analysis showed sequence motif identity between CLU and β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), a main E 3 ubiquitin ligase involved in IκB-α degradation. These homologies were localized in the disulfide constraint region of CLU. We generated a specific molecular construct of this region, named ΔCLU, and showed that {{it has the same}} NF-κB <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> as CLU. Neither the α-chain nor the β-chain of CLU had any NF-κB <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity.</b> Furthermore, we showed that following tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation of transfected cells, we could co-immunoprecipitate phospho-IκB-α with ΔCLU. Moreover, we showed that ΔCLU could localize both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. These results demonstrate the identification of a new CLU activity site involved in NF-κB pathway regulation...|$|R

40|$|Sequence-specific {{recognition}} of nucleic-acid motifs {{is critical to}} many cellular processes. We have developed a new and general method called Neighborhood Inference (NI) that predicts sequences with activity in regulating a biochemical process based on the local density of known sites in sequence space. Applied {{to the problem of}} RNA splicing regulation, NI was used to predict hundreds of new exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and silencer (ESS) hexanucleotides from known human ESEs and ESSs. These predictions were supported by cross-validation analysis, by analysis of published splicing <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> data, by sequence-conservation analysis, and by measurement of the splicing <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> of 24 novel predicted ESEs, ESSs, and neutral sequences using an in vivo splicing reporter assay. These results demonstrate the ability of NI to accurately predict splicing <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> and show that the scope of exonic splicing regulatory elements is substantially larger than previously anticipated. Analysis of orthologous exons in four mammals showed that the NI score of ESEs, a measure of function, is much more highly conserved above background than ESE primary sequence. This observation indicates a high degree of selection for ESE activity in mammalian exons, with surprisingly frequent interchangeability between ESE sequences...|$|R

40|$|Natural IgM anti-leukocyte autoantibodies (IgM-ALAs) inhibit {{inflammation}} {{by several}} mechanisms. Here, {{we show that}} pan-B cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) are switched to regulatory cells when pretreated ex vivo with IgM. B cells are also switched to regulatory cells when pretreated ex vivo with CpG but not with LPS. Pre-emptive infusion of such ex vivo induced regulatory cells protects C 57 BL/ 6 mice from ischemia-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) via regulation of in vivo NKT- 1 cells, which normally amplify the innate inflammatory response to DAMPS released after reperfusion of the ischemic kidney. Such ex vivo induced regulatory pan-B cells and BMDC express low CD 1 d and inhibit inflammation by regulating in vivo NKT- 1 {{in the context of}} low-lipid antigen presentation and by a mechanism that requires costimulatory molecules, CD 1 d, PDL 1 /PD 1, and IL 10. Second, LPS and CpG have opposite effects on induction of <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> in BMDC and B cells. LPS enhances <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> of IgM-pretreated BMDC but negates the IgM-induced <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> in B cells, while CpG, with or without IgM pretreatment, induces <b>regulatory</b> <b>activity</b> in B cells but not in BMDC. Differences in the response of pan-B and dendritic cells to LPS and CpG, especially in the presence of IgM-ALA, may have relevance during infections and inflammatory disorders where there is an increased IgM-ALA and release of TLRs 4 and 9 ligands. Ex vivo induced regulatory pan-B cells could have therapeutic relevance as these easily available cells can be pre-emptively infused to prevent AKI that can occur during open heart surgery or in transplant recipients receiving deceased donor organs...|$|R
