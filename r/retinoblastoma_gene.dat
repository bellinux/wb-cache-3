As a result, mitotic cells show chromatid breaks and chromatid cohesion defects. These aberrations lead to aneuploidy in the descendent cell population.

Cytogenetic studies localized the region to the long arm of chromosome 13, and molecular genetic studies demonstrated that tumorigenesis was associated with chromosomal mechanisms, such as mitotic recombination or non-disjunction, that could lead to homozygosity of the mutation.

This research resulted in a breakthrough discovery published in the journal Science in 1988, with Harbour as first author. Previously it had been thought that mutations in the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene,</b> the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered, would be limited to the rare eye cancer retinoblastoma.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene {{products}} of S. cerevisiae cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16INK4a. This kinase was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> product (Rb). Ser/Thr-kinase component of cyclin D-CDK4 (DC) complexes that phosphorylate and inhibit members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family including RB1 and regulate the cell-cycle during G1/S transition. Phosphorylation of RB1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F from the RB/E2F complexes and the subsequent transcription of E2F target genes which are responsible for the progression through the G1phase. Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G1 phase. Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals. Also phosphorylates SMAD3 in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and represses its transcriptional activity.

5000|$|Ceramide mediates many cell-stress responses, {{including}} {{the regulation of}} programmed cell death (apoptosis) [...] and cell aging (senescence). [...] Numerous research works have focused interest on defining the direct protein targets of action of ceramide. These include enzymes called ceramide-activated Ser-Thr phosphatases (CAPPs), such as protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), which were found to interact with ceramide in studies done in a controlled environment outside of a living organism (in vitro). On the other hand, studies in cells have shown that ceramide-inducing agents such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha α (TNFα) and palmitate induce the ceramide-dependent removal of a phosphate group (dephosphorylation) of the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> product RB and the enzymes, protein kinases B (AKT protein family) and C α (PKB and PKCα). Moreover, there is also sufficient evidence which implicates ceramide to the activation of the kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), PKCζ, and cathepsin D. [...] Interestingly, cathepsin D has been proposed as the main target for ceramide formed in organelles called lysosomes, making lysosomal acidic SMase enzymes {{one of the key}} players in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Ceramide was also shown to activate PKCζ, implicating it to the inhibition of AKT, regulation of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell (membrane potential) and signaling functions that favor apoptosis. Chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin and etoposide enhance the de novo synthesis of ceramide in studies done on mammalian cells. The same results were found for certain inducers of apoptosis particularly stimulators of receptors in a class of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) called B-cells. Regulation of the de novo synthesis of ceramide by palmitate may have a key role in diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Experimental evidence shows that there is substantial increase of ceramide levels upon adding palmitate. Ceramide accumulation activates PP2A and the subsequent dephosphorylation and inactivation of AKT, a crucial mediator in metabolic control and insulin signaling. This results in a substantial decrease in insulin responsiveness (i.e. to glucose) and in the death of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas called islets of Langerhans. [...] Inhibition of ceramide synthesis in mice via drug treatments or gene-knockout techniques prevented insulin resistance induced by fatty acids, glucocorticoids or obesity.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{diseases}} related to cone cells present in retina is retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma {{is a rare}} cancer of the retina, caused by the mutation of both copies of <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>genes</b> (RB1). Most cases of retinoblastoma occur during early childhood. [...] One or both eyes may be affected. The protein encoded by RB1 regulates a signal transduction pathway while controlling the cell cycle progression as normally.

40|$|The {{expression}} of p 53 and the <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> {{has been investigated}} by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis in 45 cases of nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma with high-grade histology, Most cases (73. 3 per cent) were primary nodal lymphomas without any extra-nodal site involvement. Most of them (75. 6 per cent) were histologically classified as pleomorphic, small, medium, and large cell type. Immunohistochemistry detected p 53 in nine cases (20 per cent). In each of these cases, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) /heteroduplex analysis did not show the presence of mutations, this finding being consistent with an alteration of the p 53 functional pathway, {{in the presence of}} a wild-type protein. The <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> product was detected by immunohistochemistry in 35 cases (77. 8 per cent) and not detected in ten cases (22. 2 per cent). In the latter cases, the reverse transcription (RT) -PCR analysis showed the presence of a specific <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> transcript in six cases and was negative in the remaining four cases. The immunohistochemical and molecular findings seem to be consistent with abnormalities of <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> expression at either the transcriptional or the post-transcriptional level, Since all nine p 53 -positive cases by immunohistochemical analysis were also <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> product-positive, and all ten <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> product-negative cases were also p 53 -negative, two different and mutually exclusive pathways of possible pathogenetic significance may be suggested, the former involving abnormalities of the functional pathway of p 53 in the absence of mutations and the latter abnormalities of <b>retinoblastoma</b> <b>gene</b> expression at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level.

40|$|Studies on the <b>retinoblastoma</b> {{susceptibility}} <b>gene</b> (RB) {{have played}} a central role in the conceptual development of the tumor suppressor gene field. Patients inheriting a mutation in the RB gene develop the rare pediatric eye cancer retinoblastoma with 90 % penetrance. In addition, somatic mutations in the RB gene have been found in many sporadically occurring human tumors. A great deal of insight has also been gained from studies of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in tissue culture. These studies have shown that the protein product plays an important role in cell cycle coordination, perhaps by modulating some aspect of the restriction point during the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Despite this vast amount of information, until recently very little was known about the normal function of RB in development.
