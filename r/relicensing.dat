The site then operated in conjunction with Calder Hall under the banner of BNFL’s Electricity Generation Business (EGB) until rebranding, <b>relicensing</b> and restructuring of the various nuclear businesses operated by HM Government under the umbrella legal entity of BNFL took place in April 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Apple relicensed Squeak twice. First, in May, Apple {{used its}} own Apple Public Source License, which {{satisfies}} the Free Software Foundation's {{concept of a}} Free Software License and has attained official approval from the Open Source Initiative as an Open Source License. The Apple Public Source License, as it turns out, fails to pass the third standard that Free and Open Source Software licenses are held to: the Debian Free Software Guidelines promulgated by the Debian project, an influential volunteer-run Linux distribution. To enable inclusion of Etoys in the One Laptop Per Child project, a second <b>relicensing</b> was undertaken using the Apache License. At this point, an effort was also made {{to address the issue}} of code contributed by members of the Squeak community, which it was not in Apple's power to unilaterally relicense.|$|E
500|$|Irrigation {{along the}} upper Klamath and the Shasta and Scott rivers, {{along with the}} almost-total {{diversion}} of the upper Trinity River, have all lowered the total river flow supporting out-migrating young salmon in spring and in-migrating adult salmon in the fall. In the 1960s, a project was proposed to divert the entire Klamath River to Central California and Southern California, an undertaking known as the Klamath Diversion, but this project was defeated. It would have limited salmon to the last [...] of the entire river. In 2002, a major fish kill took its toll on {{the river and the}} Tribes that depend on it. More than 34,000 salmonoids died alone, due to the low waters and poor hindsight, as well as compassion, of those in charge(PacifiCorp). In 2005, PacifiCorp applied to the federal government to relicense its four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath for up to 50years. Environmentalists opposed the <b>relicensing,</b> arguing that the dams should be removed to reopen the upper Klamath to salmon.|$|E

2500|$|One main {{hindrance}} in {{the licensing}} {{process is the}} Endangered Species Act ( [...] , [...] et seq., ESA). [...] Passed in 1973, this act sought to protect endangered species from {{the negative effects of}} anthropogenic actions. [...] It distinguished between endangered and threatened species but applied the same protection to both. [...] The reason it hinders the hydropower licensing and <b>relicensing</b> process is because it has priority over any government activity and therefore supersedes any construction project.|$|E
2500|$|During Sun's {{announcement}} of Java's release under the GNU General Public License (GPL), Jonathan Schwartz and Rich Green both hinted {{at the possibility}} of releasing Solaris under the GPL, with Green saying he was [...] "certainly not" [...] averse to <b>relicensing</b> under the GPL. When Schwartz pressed him (jokingly), Green said Sun would [...] "take a very close look at it." [...] In January 2007, eWeek reported that anonymous sources at Sun had told them OpenSolaris would be dual-licensed under CDDL and GPLv3. Green responded in his blog the next day that the article was incorrect, saying that although Sun is giving [...] "very serious consideration" [...] to such a dual-licensing arrangement, it would be subject to agreement {{by the rest of the}} OpenSolaris community.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November 2014, Microsoft {{announced}} [...]NET Core, in {{an effort}} to include cross-platform support for [...]NET, the source release of Microsoft's CoreCLR implementation, source for the [...] "entire [...] library stack" [...] for [...]NET Core, and the adoption of a conventional ("bazaar"-like) open-source development model under the consolation stewardship of the [...]NET Foundation. Miguel de Icaza describes [...]NET Core as a [...] "redesigned version of [...]NET that is based on the simplified version of the class libraries", and Microsoft's Immo Landwerth explained that [...]NET Core would be [...] "the foundation of all future [...]NET platforms". At the time of the announcement, the initial release of the [...]NET Core project had been seeded with a subset of the libraries' source code and coincided with the <b>relicensing</b> of Microsoft's existing [...]NET reference source away from the restrictions of the Ms-RSL. Landwerth acknowledged the disadvantages of the formerly selected shared source license, explaining that it made codename Rotor [...] "a non-starter" [...] as a community-developed open source project because it did not meet the criteria of an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license.|$|E
