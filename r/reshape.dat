40|$|This paper {{presents}} Forma, a practical, safe, {{and automatic}} data <b>reshaping</b> framework that reorganizes arrays to improve data locality. Forma splits large aggregated data types into smaller ones to improve data locality. Arrays of these large data types are then replaced by multiple arrays {{of the smaller}} types. These new arrays form natural data streams that have smaller memory footprints, better locality, and {{are more suitable for}} hardware stream prefetching. Forma consists of a field-sensitive alias analyzer, a data type checker, a portable structure <b>reshaping</b> planner, and an array reshaper. An extensive experimental study compares different data <b>reshaping</b> strategies in two dimensions: (1) how the data structure is split into smaller ones (maximal partition × frequency-based partition × affinity-based partition); and (2) how partitioned arrays are linked to preserve program semantics (address arithmetic-based <b>reshaping</b> × pointer-based <b>reshaping).</b> This study exposes important characteristics of array <b>reshaping.</b> First, a practical data reshaper needs not only an inter-procedural analysis but also a data type checker to make sure that array <b>reshaping</b> is safe. Second, the performance improvement due to array <b>reshaping</b> can be dramatic: standard benchmarks can run up to 2. 1 times faster after array <b>reshaping.</b> Array <b>reshaping</b> may also result in some performance degradation for certain benchmarks.

30|$|In {{acoustic}} multi-channel equalization techniques, such {{as complete}} multi-channel equalization {{based on the}} multiple-input/output inverse theorem (MINT), relaxed multi-channel least-squares (RMCLS), and partial multi-channel equalization based on MINT (PMINT), {{the length of the}} <b>reshaping</b> filters is generally chosen such that perfect dereverberation can be achieved for perfectly estimated room impulse responses (RIRs). However, since in practice the available RIRs typically differ from the true RIRs, this <b>reshaping</b> filter length may not be optimal. This paper provides a mathematical analysis of the robustness increase of equalization techniques against RIR perturbations when using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter length than conventionally used. Based on the condition number of the (weighted) convolution matrix of the RIRs, a mathematical relationship between the <b>reshaping</b> filter length and the robustness against RIR perturbations is established. It is shown that shorter <b>reshaping</b> filters than conventionally used yield a smaller condition number, i.e., a higher robustness against RIR perturbations. In addition, we propose an automatic non-intrusive procedure for determining the <b>reshaping</b> filter length based on the L-curve. Simulation results confirm that using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter length than conventionally used yields a significant increase in robustness against RIR perturbations for MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT. Furthermore, it is shown that PMINT using an optimal intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length outperforms all other considered techniques. Finally, it is shown that the automatic non-intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length in PMINT yields a similar performance as the optimal intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{analyzed}} {{the use of}} a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter length than conventionally used in order to increase the robustness of acoustic multi-channel equalization techniques. We have analytically shown that using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter decreases the condition number of the (weighted) convolution matrix, increasing as a result the robustness against RIR perturbations. In addition, we have proposed to automatically determine the <b>reshaping</b> filter length as the point of maximum curvature of the parametric plot of the condition number versus the (weighted) least-squares error, such that both quantities are simultaneously kept small. Using instrumental performance measures, {{it has been shown that}} using shorter <b>reshaping</b> filters indeed increases the robustness of MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT against RIR perturbations. In addition, it has been shown that PMINT using the optimal intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length outperforms MINT and RMCLS.

30|$|In summary, {{decreasing}} the <b>reshaping</b> filter length in acoustic multi-channel equalization techniques decreases the condition {{number of the}} matrix being inverted, increasing the robustness against RIR perturbations. However, {{decreasing the}} <b>reshaping</b> filter length also reduces the equalization performance {{with respect to the}} true RIRs, resulting in a trade-off between equalization performance for perfectly estimated RIRs and robustness in the presence of RIR perturbations. Using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter is not only desirable to increase the robustness against RIR perturbations, but also because of the lower computational complexity of the <b>reshaping</b> filter design.|$|R

30|$|The {{length of}} the <b>reshaping</b> filters in MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT is {{conventionally}} chosen such that perfect dereverberation can be achieved for perfectly estimated RIRs. As already mentioned, since in practice the available RIRs typically differ from the true RIRs, this choice of the <b>reshaping</b> filter length yields a high sensitivity to RIR perturbations. In [33], it has been analytically shown that decreasing the <b>reshaping</b> filter length increases the robustness for MINT and PMINT only if the multi-channel convolution matrix of the RIRs is a square matrix. In this paper, it is analytically shown that decreasing the <b>reshaping</b> filter length increases the robustness of MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT independently of the dimension of the (weighted) multi-channel convolution matrix of the RIRs. A mathematical relationship between the <b>reshaping</b> filter length and the condition number of the (weighted) multi-channel convolution matrix of the available RIRs, hence, the sensitivity of equalization techniques to RIR perturbations, is derived.

5|$|Among {{the goals}} of the team for Angel of Darkness were to create more {{complicated}} puzzles and make the character of Lara Croft, together with the tone of the game, darker and more hard-edged. They also wished to compete with some of the newer action-adventure games on the market, which were providing heavy competition, and include gameplay ideas from Shenmue and the Metal Gear series. Many character movements were drawn from and based directly on movements made by real people, similar to later motion capture techniques, and the world design drew from various artists and elements of films from the likes of Luc Besson and David Fincher. Murti Schofield, who had previously worked with Core Design, was brought in to write the story and script. As part of writing the background for the organisations involved in the story, he researched historical secret societies and artefacts, and accurate translations of Latin text incorporated into the game.

Using the triangle method [36], the automatic <b>reshaping</b> filter length L^auto_g corresponding to the point of maximum curvature of the L-curve is determined.
