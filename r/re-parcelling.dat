50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by archaeological investigations how in this period areas {{that had previously been}} made public were reoccupied. A paradigmatic example of this phenomenon was the subdivision of the land formerly occupied by the Roman Forum for new settlement. The old Roman Cardo survived in the Islamic city, communicating with Išbīliya and the Great Mosque of Córdoba. Its route may have corresponded closely to its ancient location, which would partly explain the absence of archaeological remains of buildings, there not having been frequent <b>re-parcelling</b> out of plots. A new main road seems to have opened at this time to align the Seville Gate with the Moron Gate.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the {{comprehensive approach to}} planning of the new, sustainably-designed housing estate Ilovica in southern Ljubljana. It was executed as an ideal model of a larger densely populated settlement, which would also ensure {{the reconstruction of the}} extant area of low-density housing with deficient utilities provision. Besides the architectural and urbanistic design and solutions to technological problems, we also showed implementation possibilities that use instruments of real estate polices (<b>re-parcelling</b> etc.) and prepared a feasibility study of the investment. Such multi-faceted projects demand multi-disciplinary approaches, whereby only the full participation of various experts and also wider community can lead to better results with synergetic effects that are the result of common endeavour...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} a proposal of a layout {{of a part}} of the Moravče settlement. The first part of the thesis describes a theoretical basis as well as the legal grounds of the spatial planning and a specific layout of rural areas. The second part features a proposal of a layout of {{a part of the}} Moravče settlement in the cadastral community of Drtija. It depicts the place as such and presents the process of the preparation of the required technical documentation. After all factors have been considered, a proposal of the layout of the area has been prepared {{on the basis of a}} parcelling procedure, envisaging the construction of new individual residential buildings. The thesis continues with a comprehensive technical report on redesigning parcel boundaries and <b>re-parcelling...</b>|$|E
50|$|Two main issues {{dominated}} the garden show at Wartberg, {{the preservation of}} an intact environment and the commitment {{to the concerns of}} people with disabilities. The land at Wartberg slopes were <b>re-parceled.</b> 40 permanent allotments resulting from this measure. The 3.5 km network of paths had a width of 5.5 m. To remain true to the premise of a responsible treatment of nature, the initiators came regarding the path width that only 3.5 m were asphalted. The edges of one meter width were gravelled.|$|R
40|$|The law No. 139 / 2002 Col., on {{reparcelling}} {{and land}} offices can be consider {{as one of}} the most important tools of active land law in the CR. In frame of administrative procedure in public interest, the law enables to <b>re-parcel</b> lands and ownership relations to them in order to create conditions for consequential management. A property right to newly defined parcels is acquired by a decision of the appropriate land office which is an administrative authority. By means of reparcelling, also „modern“ ecological problems are solved. Reparcelling is necessary for renewal of statutory land registration, clearing and delimitation of borders in the landscape, and so it is a significant contribution for renewal of peace in land ownership in the CR shaken in 1948 – 1989. Reparcelling shows only secondary economic impact, it is more suitable to assess the effectiveness only from the point of view of effectiveness of the financial means expended for reparcelling. The pieces of knowledge presented in the paper are a result of solution of the research intention 6046070906 „Economics of Czech agriculture resources and their efficient use in frame of multifunctional agri-food systems“...|$|R
40|$|Incomplete takings {{are vital}} and {{extremely}} common. Yet, they present unique challenges that cannot {{be resolved by}} standard rules of eminent domain. In particular, incomplete, or partial, takings may result {{in the creation of}} suboptimal parcels, and even unusable and unmarketable ones. Additionally, partial takings create nettlesome assessment problems that do not arise when parcels are taken as a whole. Finally, incomplete takings engender opportunities for inefficient strategic behavior {{on the part of the}} government after the partial taking has been carried out. Current partial takings jurisprudence fails to resolve these problems, and, in some instances even exacerbates them. In this Article, we offer an innovative mechanism that remediates the shortcomings of extant partial takings doctrines. Specifically, we propose that whenever the government engages in a partial taking, the affected property owner should be given the power to force the government to purchase the remainder (or, untaken part) of the lot at fair market value. Exercise of this power by the private owner would lead to the reunification of the land in its pre-taking form, while transferring title to the entire parcel to a new single owner, namely the government. Implementation of our proposal would yield several important benefits: First, it would allow for the preservation of the current configuration of parcels, enabling them to remain highly usable and marketable. Second, it would lower the cost of determining compensation for private property owners and thereby of the adjudication process as a whole, in those cases in which private owners choose to exercise their entitlement to sell the remainder to the government. Third, it would significantly reduce the ability of the government to behave strategically and externalize costs on private property owners. Fourth, it would create opportunities for more efficient planning and land use by the government as the government would be free to <b>re-parcel,</b> develop and re-sell the parcels sold to it...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} review {{and analysis of}} innovative financial instruments for real estate development in Western Europe: the UK, Germany and Holland. This research outcomes will be useful to EU and European national policy makers in public finance and real estate development. Case study examples from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands were employed to reveal any national nuances in financing with similarities and differences drawn out through comparative analysis. The examples chosen were the Battersea Power Station Development in London; Leipziger Platz site in Berlin; and the Lammenschans site {{in the city of}} Leiden, Netherlands. The studies reveal different approaches to the financing of development within a regeneration framework. The recommendations for policy and practice stemming from this study take various themes. First, securing blended and diverse sources of finance for real estate development is key to aiding regeneration, and projects need to be set within a collaborative-competitive partnerships framework. These partnerships need to consider the wider macroeconomic considerations such as interest rates and how that will affect various funding sources over the longer-term. Second, recent years have seen the growth of infrastructure bonds and there is a current opportunity to expand the use of project bonds into real estate development and regeneration. Third, long-term sustainability and resilience is key, meaning a wider critique of some financial innovations should be explored – such as the greater pre-sale real estate revenue, foreign institutional finance, and legal co-operative finance approaches in <b>re-parcelling</b> sites. Finally, {{there is a need to}} consider the financial innovations emerging from equity (rather than debt) and the use of institutional funds in real estate development for regeneration...|$|E
