5|$|Jali are pierced stone screens with {{regularly}} <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns.</b> They {{are characteristic}} of Indo-Islamic architecture, for example in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards {{and the need for}} security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once the screen was at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E

40|$|<b>Repeated</b> <b>patterns</b> (such as windows, tiles, {{balconies}} and doors) {{are prominent}} and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these <b>repeated</b> <b>patterns</b> be-comes {{very important for}} city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of <b>repeated</b> <b>patterns</b> detection in a pre-cise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction followed by a Kronecker product low-rank modeling approach. Our method is tailored for 2 D im-ages of building façades. We have developed algorithms for automatic selection of a representative texture within façade images using vanishing points and Harris corners. After rectifying the input images, we describe novel algorithms that extract <b>repeated</b> <b>patterns</b> by using Kronecker product based modeling {{that is based on}} a solid theoretical founda-tion. Our approach is unique and has not ever been used for façade analysis. We have tested our algorithms in a large set of images. 1...|$|R

The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling that lacks a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern</b> is called [...] "non-periodic". An aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a <b>repeating</b> <b>pattern.</b> In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or honeycomb is also called a tessellation of space.|$|R

The simplest static patterns ("still lifes") and <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> ("oscillators"—a superset of still lifes) were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using graph paper, blackboards, physical game boards (such as Go) and the like. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-pentomino failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has fired six escaping gliders (these were the first gliders ever discovered).|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of the Great War, the Germans were looking for a way to {{effectively}} camouflage the aircraft of the Luftstreitkräfte to inhibit enemy observation of the aircraft while it was airborne and when on the ground. Large, irregular blotches with two or three colors were used on the upper surfaces of the wing which led to the development of the Buntfarbenanstrich, the lozenge camouflage made up of <b>repeating</b> <b>patterns</b> of irregularly shaped four-, five- or six-sided polygons. Because painting such a pattern was very time consuming, and the paint added considerably to the weight of the aircraft, the patterns were printed on fabric, and the fabric was then used to cover the aircraft. This printed fabric was used in various forms and colors from late 1916 until the end of the war.|$|E

She reveals that she is a virgin, and though she decides to have sex with Will, she changes her mind at the last moment. Will suggests that she see a counselor for help with her debilitating issues. Emma later discovers that Will kissed another woman and verbally berates him, terminating their relationship. In the season finale, Will kisses Emma and tells her that he loves her. Emma begins a relationship with her dentist, Dr. Carl Howell (John Stamos), which leads to a Vegas wedding. Her reservations about sex lead her to become faculty advisor to the school's celibacy club. Carl arranges a meeting with sex education teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), and reveals that they have yet to sleep together. Emma confesses that she may still have feelings for Will, and Carl tells her he will be moving into a hotel until she is certain of her feelings.|$|E
