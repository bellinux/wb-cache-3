5|$|During the 1896 season, <b>Roe</b> {{enjoyed his}} best run of scores for Somerset. Against Kent, he batted {{for most of}} Somerset's innings to score 93 runs without being dismissed, almost half of his team's total, to help Somerset recover from 12 for 5 to post 194. He added a further 45 runs in the second innings, but despite his efforts, Somerset lost by 145 runs. In his next match, <b>Roe</b> posted a low score in the first innings, but {{recorded}} his second century in first-class cricket in the second innings to help Somerset secure a draw. He scored 106 runs, including six boundaries. Against Sussex in the next game, <b>Roe</b> scored an unbeaten 85, but was overshadowed by scores of 154 and 156 by Richard and Lionel Palairet, and 191 by Sussex's Ernest Killick. <b>Roe</b> finished the season fourth in the national batting averages, the highest of any Somerset player, his 434 runs coming {{at an average of}} 43.4.|$|E
5|$|In November 1835, an {{expedition}} led by Governor James Stirling joined another party {{led by the}} Surveyor General John Septimus <b>Roe</b> in King George Sound. <b>Roe</b> had made arrangement for both parties {{to return to the}} Swan River Colony via an alternative route. The route was intended to join the settlements of King George Sound, York and the Swan River Colony along with the newly established settlement of Williams. This expedition passed through the area of Avondale sighting the Dale River and a granite hill that <b>Roe</b> name Bald Hill on 27 December. Bald Hill was to become the primary reference point for surveying the region.|$|E
40|$|The {{portion of}} food {{interest}} of sea urchin {{is located in}} the gonads, a dish increasingly appreciated in the international cuisine. The aims of this study were evaluate the process of fresh <b>roes</b> from rock-boring urchin sea Echinometra lucunter for human consumption, check the acceptance and preference of the product, and consumer purchase intent. Studies on processing of <b>roes</b> from E. lucunter are nonexistent, thus, this study is a pioneer in Brazil. The <b>roes</b> were processed following the steps: wash in a solution of potassium alum, drainage, separation by color, packaging and storage under refrigeration (0 - 4 °C). Following, batches of the <b>roes</b> were characterized by physical, chemical and microbiological analyses, and subjected to sensory analysis to check acceptance and preference of potential consumers. The methodology of potassium alum used was efficient for E. lucunter <b>roes</b> and the color attribute was more relevant in the acceptance, preference and purchase intent from processed fresh <b>roes.</b> The extraction process might be improved in order to minimize rupture of the gonads. For managers of fisheries and sea food quality we recommend the implementation of public policies that result in the sustainability of sea-urchin species and food safety for the consumers...|$|R
40|$|From {{a social}} {{cognitive}} theoretical point of view, strong positive outcome expectations of smoking are {{a cause of}} relapse in smoking cessation, working in concert with self-efficacy. This study investigated whether {{and to what extent}} this could be verified in a sample of ex-smokers. Some (N = 324) ex-smokers were followed for 7 months. At Time 1 (T 1) and Time 2 (T 2), participants filled in a self-report questionnaire assessing residual outcome expectations (<b>ROEs),</b> self-efficacy, craving for tobacco, and smoking behavior, which was sent and returned by mail. First, prospective analyses showed that <b>ROEs</b> assessed at T 1 predicted relapse reported at T 2 over and above self-efficacy. Second, the influence of <b>ROEs</b> (and self-efficacy) on relapse was mediated by craving experience. Third, the hypothesized interactions between <b>ROEs</b> and self-efficacy were significant and meaningful...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{discover}} the role played by regimes of exception (<b>RoEs)</b> in contemporary Bolivian politics. <b>RoEs</b> have been seldom studied by political scientists, despite constituting a key legacy of authoritarian regimes that have survived the transitions to democracy in Latin America. Focusing on the case of Bolivia, the research is based on relevant laws as well as 65 presidential decrees, which are analyzed with the method of content analysis. As a result of the analysis, we show that in Bolivia both the legal framework and political use of <b>RoEs</b> have moved on from a purely repressive mechanism to a more administrative one. The study has important implications for how <b>RoEs</b> are conceptualized from a theoretical point of view as well as for our understanding of the nature of emergency politics in fragile democracies in recent years...|$|R
5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{planning}} and construction of additional junctions with new major roads in Perth.

The proposed deviation became Kenwick Link, constructed as part of the <b>Roe</b> Highway extension towards Fremantle. It was initially built as a single carriageway, and upgraded to a dual carriageway later. It opened on 17 April 1998, ahead of the <b>Roe</b> Highway extensions from Welshpool Road to Kenwick Link (opened 30 November 2002) and from Kenwick Link to Nicholson Road (opened 21 January 2003).|$|E
5|$|William Nichols <b>Roe</b> {{was born}} on 21 March 1861 in Closworth, near Yeovil, in south Somerset.

He left Elstree in 1901 to set up Stanmore Park preparatory school with former England Test cricketer Vernon Royle. In 1892 he married Zoe Susanna Charlotte Jennings Crew Crew, and the pair had a son, also named William Nichols <b>Roe,</b> in 1898. <b>Roe</b> (senior) died on 11 October 1937, aged 76, {{in a nursing home}} in Marylebone, London following an operation.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and <b>Roe</b> Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with <b>Roe</b> Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E

40|$|Gadusol, C 8 H 12 O 6, {{has been}} {{isolated}} from <b>roes</b> of the cod (Gadus morhua L.), i. e., ovaries that contain ripe eggs just before spawning. The concentration is about 4 g/kg dry wt.

Concentrations of gadusol in the <b>roes</b> of other marine teleost fish examined are of the same order as in cod <b>roes.</b> Gadusol has some properties similar to ascorbic acid and both compounds, after oxidation, react with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine in the commonly-used assay procedure for ascorbic acid. Specific assays showed that the concentrations of gadusol in the <b>roes</b> of marine fish are severalfold greater than those of ascorbic acid. Gadusol is structurally related to the mycosporines previously reported from a number of different organisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Equity is overvalued {{when its}} market value is far above its {{underlying}} value. Jensen (2005) proposes that overvaluation leads to value-destroying opportunistic earnings management. In this study I examine how equity overvaluation affects a firm’s financial opacity and its stock crash risk. I find that overvalued firms {{tend to use}} more earnings management (higher financial opacity) and they do so to conceal firm specific information from the investors, it is especially so for substantially overvalued firms. On the contrary, undervalued firms are willing to provide more firm-specific information to the market. Furthermore, I find that the reported <b>ROEs</b> of substantially overvalued firms are {{significantly higher than the}} unmanaged <b>ROEs.</b> But no significant difference of reported <b>ROEs</b> and unmanaged <b>ROEs</b> is detected among substantially undervalued firms. In addition, I show that overvalued firms have higher crash risk than otherwise identical but non-overvalued firms. At last, I find that a powerful CEO (proxy by CEO and chairman duality) can restrain an overvalued firm’s urge to manage earnings more aggressively...|$|R
