5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
25|$|One last unique {{addition}} to the new design was a single high mounted <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> on the driver's side. On US based cars, the mirror was lowered to a more normal placement in 1987 and quickly joined by a passenger side <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> for the driver {{to be able to}} make safe easy lane changes.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror),</b> eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the video, {{whenever}} Meat Loaf {{sings the}} line [...] "Objects in the <b>Rear</b> <b>View</b> <b>Mirror</b> May Appear Closer Than They Are", he sees either the ghost of the plane, the woman or himself when he was younger.

40|$|Every {{automobile}} has <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{and side}} <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{to make it}} easier for the driver to look at the rear side of the vehicle easily. They help the driver in moving the vehicle backwards without anyone's assistance. Usually, the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> are located at the top of the windscreen and they are adjustable according to the position and viewing angle of the driver. During night times, the light from the head lights of the vehicle behind is reflected and falls directly on the eyes of the driver. This light reflection from the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> causes a strain on our eyes and results in our eyes becoming tired and drowsy, consequently results in lack of alertness and can result in an accident. People who drive for more than 100 miles during the night experience this type of strain in their eyes. This can be avoided by reducing the reflection of light from the side <b>view</b> <b>mirrors</b> by implementing the process of electro chromism in the mirrors. By means of this process, we will be introducing a glass that changes the intensity of reflection when a voltage is applied...|$|R
