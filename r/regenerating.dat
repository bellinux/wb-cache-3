40|$|In this paper, we {{manufactured}} the <b>regenerated</b> FBG by {{the thermal}} annealing of seed FBG based on UV irradiation. The writing conditions of <b>regenerated</b> FBGs were investigated in {{four types of}} optical fiber. FBGs written in H 2 -free fiber were erased and not <b>regenerated</b> during the thermal annealing. FBG written in H 2 loaded Boron co-doped fiber was erased at the temperature of about 580 ℃ and <b>regenerated</b> about 590 ℃. However, the extinction of <b>regenerated</b> FBG started at the temperature over 900 ℃ and then FBG disappeared out.

In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, it was {{revealed}} that a Debian developer discovered that the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack, since only 32,767 different keys were generated. The security weakness was caused by changes made in 2006 by another Debian developer in response to memory debugger warnings. The complete resolution procedure was cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough; it involved <b>regenerating</b> all affected keys and certificates.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of <b>regenerated</b> NaY zeolite (thermal treatment from cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) -modified NaY zeolite and pretreatment with Na ions) loaded with silver ions were examined using the broth dilution {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) method against Escherichia coli (E. coli ATCC 11229) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ATCC 6538). X-ray diffraction (XRD), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and chemical elemental analyses were used to characterize the <b>regenerated</b> NaY and AgY zeolites. The XRD patterns indicated that the calcination and addition of silver ions on <b>regenerated</b> NaY zeolite {{did not affect the}} structure of the <b>regenerated</b> NaY zeolite as the characteristic peaks of the NaY zeolite were retained, and no new peaks were observed. The <b>regenerated</b> AgY zeolite showed good {{antibacterial activity}} against both bacteria strains in distilled water, and the antibacterial activity of the samples increased with increasing Ag loaded on the <b>regenerated</b> AgY zeolite; the <b>regenerated</b> AgY zeolite was more effective against E. coli than S. aureus. However, the antibacterial activity of the <b>regenerated</b> AgY was not effective in saline solution for both bacteria. The study showed that CTAB-modified NaY zeolite materials could be <b>regenerated</b> to NaY zeolite using thermal treatment (550 °C, 5 h) and this material has excellent performance as an antibacterial agent after silver ions loading...|$|R
5|$|The {{successor}} trough to Emily produced torrential rains over eastern Cuba, {{causing some}} rivers to overflow. Damaging flood waters spread across roads in Santiago de Cuba, where 37 homes {{were affected by}} mud. While <b>regenerating</b> into a tropical depression, Emily dropped prolonged rainfall in the Bahamas; a severe thunderstorm warning was accordingly issued for Grand Bahama and adjacent waters. Precipitation totals of up to 7.9 in (200mm) were recorded during the time.|$|E

At 2100 UTC on September 18, the hurricane watch was upgraded into a hurricane warning. Meanwhile, {{a tropical storm}} warning was designated south of the hurricane warning area to Mazatlan. On the evening of September 19, all watches and warnings were discontinued, as Manuel had moved inland.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to independent movements, the party can create formations, with specific formations triggering different status buffs such as <b>regenerating</b> HP or AP. New formations are acquired {{through the course}} of the game, and are specific to characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points; the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening their abilities. In {{addition to}} standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} the material parameters of <b>regenerated</b> bone, {{it is important}} to clarify the mechanical performance of the <b>regenerated</b> portion. In general, the shape and size of <b>regenerated</b> bone tissue is heterogeneous. It is often difficult to elucidate material properties by means of conventional mechanical tests such as compressive and/or tensile tests and bending tests. The nanoindentation technique has been utilized to {{evaluate the}} material properties of small or microstructured materials because they do not necessarily require a large well-designed specimen. Thus, this technique may be useful for the evaluation of the material properties of <b>regenerated</b> bone tissue. In this study, this technique was applied for the assessment of the Young’s modulus and hardness of <b>regenerated</b> and intact long bones of a rabbit. The <b>regenerated</b> bone exhibited a significantly lower Young’s modulus and hardness than the intact bone. The <b>regenerated</b> long bone also exhibited impaired mechanical properties, which may have been caused by the difference in the nano-organization of its collagen fibers and mineral crystals (the main components of bone tissue), from that of the intact bone...|$|R

5|$|On August14, roughly 24hours after degenerating into {{a remnant}} low, {{convection}} began to redevelop over the system. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance plane deployed dropsondes into the system. They {{found that the}} system was <b>regenerating</b> and shortly after, the NHC began re-issuing advisories on the depression when it was located roughly 1,075mi (1,735km) east of the Leeward Islands. The depression continued to track westward {{in response to an}} upper-level high over the north Atlantic. Early on August15, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Ana as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, wind shear caused convection to become displaced from the circulation, exposing the center of Ana again.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without <b>regenerating</b> into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The game is set during World War II and the {{campaign}} mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the <b>regenerating</b> health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.|$|E
30|$|This is {{the first}} animal study to {{demonstrate}} a statistically significant correlation between DXA and mechanical parameters for <b>regenerate</b> bone determined by compression testing. The correlation between this non-invasive investigation of <b>regenerate</b> material properties and mechanical properties may have clinical implications. Failure under axial load {{is the most common}} mode of <b>regenerate</b> bone failure and fundamentally differs from fracture in normal bone. A non-invasive method of estimating this mechanical property could therefore identify incompetent <b>regenerate</b> and potentially reduce complications related to premature external fixator removal.|$|R

30|$|Plain {{radiography}} {{has been}} used to evaluate the <b>regenerate</b> bone during limb lengthening, bone transport and deformity correction. It is useful in overall assessment of bone alignment, length and width of <b>regenerate</b> bone but cannot detect the potential complications of failure of early distraction gap consolidation or delay in <b>regenerate</b> bone formation [16]. With the advent of digital radiography, it has been postulated {{that it is possible to}} quantify the mechanical properties of the <b>regenerate.</b> Kolbeck et al. [9] reported a high correlation between digital radiographic densimetric evaluation of <b>regenerate</b> and torsional force measurements in a micropig animal model of distraction. Shim et al. [8, 17] have assessed digital radiography and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) in clinical practice. They used relative pixel value ratios of <b>regenerate</b> bone to that of original cortex and found changes in bone density followed a sigmoid curve pattern. In their cohort of patients, the average healing index was 59  days/cm, more than 10  days/cm longer than previously published clinical research using DXA to evaluate <b>regenerate</b> [8]. The higher healing index is clinically significant as delayed external fixator removal can lead to osteoporosis and fractures unrelated to the <b>regenerate,</b> increased opportunity for pin site infection and an adverse psychological and socio-economic impact to the patient.|$|R
5|$|The player {{character}} {{is equipped with}} an energy shield which nullifies damage from weapons fire and forceful impacts. The shield's charge appears as a blue bar {{in the corner of}} the game's heads-up display, and it automatically recharges if no damage is sustained for a brief period. When the shield is fully depleted, the player is highly vulnerable, and further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. When this health meter reaches zero, the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint. Health can be replenished through the collection of health packs scattered around the game's levels, but the game's introduction of a <b>regenerating</b> shield mechanic represented a departure from FPS games of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{space between}} the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, a {{connective}} tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act {{as a type of}} skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in <b>regenerating</b> tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Irradiated axolotl arms bearing grafts of brachial nerves can <b>regenerate,</b> albeit imperfectly.

Sections of nine <b>regenerates</b> provide consistent evidence for the following conclusions. (1) The epidermis of the <b>regenerate</b> is probably an extension of the irradiated host epidermis. (2) All other tissues of the <b>regenerate</b> which differentiate from a mesenchymal blastema originate from the non-irradiated graft. Regeneration thus involves a true dedifferentiation and redifferentiation (i. e. a loss of determination and equivalent gain in potency for histological transformation).
