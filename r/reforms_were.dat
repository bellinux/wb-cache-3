5|$|The Ordainers {{also took}} care to confirm and {{elaborate}} on existing statutes, and <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> made to the criminal law. The liberties of the church were confirmed as well. To ensure {{that none of the}} Ordainers should be swayed in their decisions by bribes from the king, restrictions were made on what royal gifts and offices they were allowed to receive during their tenure.|$|E
5|$|Under the power-sharing agreement, {{a number}} of limited <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> passed. In early 2009, Mugabe's {{government}} declared that—to combat rampant inflation—it would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilise prices. ZANU-PF blogged many of the proposed reforms although a new constitution was passed in March 2013.|$|E
40|$|Administrative <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{perceived as}} dramatic organizational changes solving administrative problems {{once and for}} all. In this article it <b>is</b> argued that <b>reforms</b> reflect organizational stability more than organizational change. <b>Reforms</b> <b>are</b> driven by problems, solutions and forgetfulness, which are all common phenomena in modern organizations. <b>Reforms</b> <b>are</b> also driven by <b>reforms</b> [...] <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> highly self-referential. Organizations may have reasons for avoiding reforms, for instance because reforms may increase a preference for values that the organization has particular difficulty in achieving rather than improving performance. Paradoxically, one effective way of stopping <b>reforms</b> <b>is</b> to try to implement them and to propose new <b>reforms,</b> which <b>is</b> a further reason of why <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> common in organizations.

5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Against {{all these}} <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> the nobles of Wessex, who {{included}} most of Dunstan's own relatives, {{and who had}} an interest in maintaining established customs. For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and Crediton in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
50|$|Welfare <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> {{changes in}} the {{operation}} of a given welfare system. Welfare <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> often more aligned with neo-liberal policies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} country’s economic <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> affected by <b>reforms</b> adopted by other countries. A simple model of economic <b>reforms</b> <b>is</b> developed to motivate the econometric work. Unsurprisingly, the model predicts that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> more likely when {{factors of production}} are internationally mobile and <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> pursued in other economies. More interesting is the finding that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> not driven by greater trade openness. Using {{the change in the}} Index of Economic Freedom as the measure of marketliberalising reforms and panel data 144 countries and the years 1995 - 2006, we identify the most important channels through which <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> transmitted from country to country. We find evidence of the importance of reforms in other countries. Moreover, consistent with our model international trade is not a vehicle for the diffusion of economic reforms, rather the most important mechanism is geographical or cultural proximity...|$|R
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The <b>reform's</b> goal <b>was</b> to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|R
5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin {{showed his}} {{disregard}} for local resistance by arranging the abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan Sołtyk, Józef A. Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> adopted, political {{rights of the}} religious minorities were restored {{and the need for}} more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|In {{a report}} to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon {{proposed}} dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His plan called for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called for the formation of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues. On March 5, 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon's reassignment to Russia that year, however, few of his <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> implemented.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized {{the degree of}} popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy. However, the land <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area impacted by the <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> unclear.|$|R

5000|$|The Brezhnev era, {{which had}} begun with high growth, began to stagnate {{some time in}} the early-1970s. Kosygin's [...] "radical" [...] <b>reform</b> {{attempts}} <b>were</b> halted in 1971 and his second <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> more modest. The second <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> halted because of the 1973 oil crisis, when an international increase in oil price prompted economic growth based on selling oil. Another <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> implemented in 1979 but this, too, failed as by this time the Soviet economy had become [...] "addicted" [...] to high oil prices.|$|R
5|$|Long's time as {{governor}} {{was described by}} historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of these <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.|$|E
5|$|No further {{constitutional}} <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> enacted {{during the}} Principate. The only development of any significance was the continuing slide towards monarchy, as the constitutional distinctions {{that had been}} set up by Augustus lost whatever meaning that they still had. Starting in 235, with the reign of the barbarian Emperor Maximinus Thrax, the Empire was put through a period of severe military, civil, and economic stress. The crisis arguably reached its height during the reign of Gallienus, from 260 to 268. The crisis ended with the accession of Diocletian in 284, and the abolishment of the Principate.|$|E
5|$|Quảng Đức's act {{increased}} {{international pressure}} on Diệm {{and led him}} to announce reforms {{with the intention of}} mollifying the Buddhists. However, the promised <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> not implemented, leading to a deterioration in the dispute. With protests continuing, the ARVN Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, launched nationwide raids on Buddhist pagodas, seizing Quảng Đức's heart and causing deaths and widespread damage. Several Buddhist monks followed Quảng Đức's example, also immolating themselves. Eventually, a U.S.-backed Army coup toppled Diệm, who was assassinated on 2 November 1963.|$|E

50|$|Implementation of the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> slow. New {{associations}} {{were still}} being established in 1980s, {{a decade after the}} <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> initiated. High-standing Soviet officials commented on the problem when the 1979 <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> initiated. Local planners and economists in the 1980s still complained that they had too little power in the daily running of their local economies. Specialised literature proved that the reform's main goal had failed to meet the expected standards.|$|R
5|$|Since 1978 all CCDI heads {{have been}} {{members of the}} PSC, {{although}} Wei Jianxing was a member from 1997–2002 but not from 1992–1997.

Although most of Zhao Ziyang's <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> later themselves rescinded, concurrent PSC membership was not reintroduced until the 15th National Congress in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> {{being pursued}} by the more enlightened szlachta, who wanted to expand {{the role of the}} Sejm at the monarch's and magnate faction's expense, and by the elected kings. Sigismund III during the later part of his rule constructively cooperated with the Sejm, making sure that between 1616 and 1632 each session of the body {{produced}} the badly needed statutes. The increased efforts in the areas of taxation and maintenance of the military forces made possible the positive outcomes of some of the armed conflicts that took place during Sigismund's reign.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, the Friends of the Constitution, {{regarded}} as the first Polish political party, and including many participants of the Great Sejm, was formed to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. The response to the new Constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party exerted stronger influence. The Great Sejm's <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> brought down by the Targowica Confederation and {{the intervention of the}} Russian Empire. On 23 November 1793 the Grodno Sejm annulled all the enactments of the Great Sejm, including the Constitution of May 3, 1791.|$|E

5000|$|The Vilayets (...) of the Ottoman Empire {{were the}} first-order {{administrative}} division, or provinces, {{of the later}} empire, introduced with the promulgation of the Vilayet Law (Teşkil-i Vilayet Nizamnamesi) of 21 January 1867. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> part of the ongoing administrative <b>reforms</b> that <b>were</b> being enacted throughout the empire, and enshrined in the Imperial Edict of 1856. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> at first implemented experimentally in the Danube Vilayet, specially formed in 1864 and headed by the leading reformist Midhat Pasha.

5|$|The {{defining}} {{crisis of}} his early reign, the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), led to the First Partition of Poland (1772). The latter part of his reign saw reforms wrought by the Great Sejm (1788–1792) and the Constitution of 3 May 1791. These <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the War in Defense of the Constitution, leading directly to the Second Partition of Poland (1793), the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) and the final Third Partition of Poland (1795), marking {{the end of the}} Commonwealth. Stripped of all meaningful power, Poniatowski abdicated in November 1795 and spent the last years of his life in semi-captivity in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax <b>reforms</b> <b>were</b> passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
