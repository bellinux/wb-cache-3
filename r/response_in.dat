5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune <b>response</b> <b>in</b> insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune <b>response.</b> <b>In</b> Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune <b>response</b> <b>in</b> those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune <b>response</b> <b>in</b> psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E
