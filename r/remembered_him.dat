5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as studious and awkward in social situations.|$|E
5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.|$|E

Along with his {{military}} decorations, he was honoured with a Gold Medal by the Aéro-Club de France, and a Bronze Medal and Diploma by the Aero Club of America. The town of Toogoolawah, Queensland, commemorated {{him in the}} name of its airport, and the national capital of Canberra <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> with Dallas Place. His home town of Mount Morgan has dedicated a water reservoir in his honour; its Historical Society Museum holds his medals, uniform, and sword, as well the propeller from one of his planes.|$|E

5|$|Casimir IV's successor, John I Albert, {{wanted to}} grant Moldavia to his younger brother, Sigismund, but Stephen's {{diplomacy}} {{prevented him from}} invading Moldavia for years. John Albert broke into Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă, but had to acknowledge {{the loss of the}} two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler, Bogdan III, played {{an active role in the}} government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in Moldovenism. After the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as Stephen the Great and Holy (Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt).|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had <b>remembered</b> <b>him.</b> Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E
5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them {{in more ways than}} one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> {{for his role in the}} Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, {{whether or not they}} were destined for a career in the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, Weise {{enrolled}} at Red Lake Senior High School in Red Lake.

His grandmother said he had not been in school for five weeks before the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Edward was shy, and {{classmates and}} {{teachers}} <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, {{as if he}} were laughing at his own personal jokes.

25|$|Had Heraclius lived {{only until}} 629, {{he might have}} been remembered for his {{successful}} military reorganization and impressive handling of the last Persian war, which saw hope and victory snatched from the jaws of defeat. However, his lengthy life meant that the Byzantines <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> for his religious controversies, failures against the Arabs, and incestuous marriage to his niece, which many believed to have brought divine retribution upon the entire Empire.|$|E
25|$|Born in Honolulu in 1959, Byran Koji Uyesugi {{grew up in}} the Nuuanu neighborhood. While {{attending}} Roosevelt High School, Uyesugi was {{a member}} of the school's Army JROTC chapter and the school's rifle team. Classmates <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as a quiet student who never got into trouble. According to his brother Dennis, Uyesugi crashed their father's car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in 1977; he was never the same.|$|E
25|$|After the war MacGillivary {{returned}} home to Boston where {{for a short time}} he worked as a special agent for Boston's Treasury Department. He joined the United States Customs Service in 1950 starting as a warehouse officer, but soon became an agent for the United States Customs Office of Investigations, conducting special investigations. His daughter Charlene Corea <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as being particularly busy in the winter inspecting Christmas trees that entered the United States from Canada. He retired from the Customs Service in 1975.|$|E

25|$|Goodman's {{success story}} was {{told in the}} 1955 motion picture The Benny Goodman Story, {{starring}} Steve Allen and Donna Reed and produced by Universal-International as a follow-up to the successful The Glenn Miller Story, produced the year before. The screenplay was heavily fictionalized, but the music was the real draw. Many of Goodman's professional colleagues appear in the film, including Ben Pollack, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton and Harry James. A special appearance {{was made by the}} New Orleans jazz legend Kid Ory, who was pleased that Goodman <b>remembered</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lim's {{entry into}} film began in 1984, when he auditioned for the New York casting agent of Year of the Dragon (1985) in Singapore. Lim was unsuccessful, but the casting agent <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> and {{recommended}} him for Shanghai Surprise (1986). Although {{the film was}} not critically acclaimed, it gave Lim the break to star in films like Keys to Freedom (1988) and Fifty/Fifty (1992). Lim also got {{the role of an}} interrogator in Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), but had to give up the role due to a scheduling conflict.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff {{was also}} {{involved}} in various ways with music on piano rolls. Several manufacturers, {{and in particular the}} Aeolian Company, had published his compositions on perforated music rolls from about 1900 onwards. His sister-in-law, Sofia Satina, <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> at the family estate at Ivanovka, pedalling gleefully through a set of rolls of his Second Piano Concerto, apparently acquired from a German source, most probably the Aeolian Company's Berlin subsidiary, the Choralion Company. Aeolian in London created a set of three rolls of this concerto in 1909, which remained in the catalogues of its various successors until the late 1970s.|$|E

25|$|In late 1943 {{he entered}} the preparatory harmony class of Georges Dandelot at the Paris Conservatoire. There he was {{introduced}} to Andrée Vaurabourg, wife of the composer Arthur Honegger, and between April 1944 and May 1946 he studied counterpoint privately with her. He greatly enjoyed working with her and she <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as an exceptional student, using his exercises as models in advanced counterpoint {{until the end of}} her teaching career. He also studied the piano privately in the hope of entering Jean Doyen's class, but he was unsuccessful. On 26 August 1944, the day of de Gaulle's return to Paris, Boulez was among the crowd in the Place de la Concorde which came under sniper fire from the few remaining Germans and collaborators.|$|E
25|$|He had {{difficulty}} adjusting to a vastly changed peacetime Army. In addition, Thompson's marriage had been troubled {{even before his}} captivity, and his wife Alyce, believing him dead, was living with another man {{at the time he}} was repatriated. He and his wife divorced in 1975. Alyce told author Tom Philpott that she believed prison had affected her husband's mind. She said he suffered from nightmares and was abusive towards both her and the children. Thompson later remarried but divorced soon afterwards. Thompson never formed any kind of a relationship with his children. His daughters were 6, 5 and 4 when he left, and his son was born the day of his capture. Only his eldest child barely <b>remembered</b> <b>him.</b> He eventually became completely estranged from all of them.|$|E
25|$|In September 1941, No.151 Wing RAF {{arrived at}} Vaenga by sea, with 39 Hawker Hurricane fighters {{which they were}} to train Soviet {{personnel}} to operate and then hand over. Safonov headed the Soviet side of the training programme and made a good impression on his British colleagues, who <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as serious and likeable. He took command of a new squadron, 78IAP VVSVMF (78th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Naval Aviation) which was formed to fly the Hurricanes and was largely manned by his pilots from 72SAP VVSVMF. As a commander, he showed superb organisational and tactical skills, while enforcing strict discipline on his men, once threatening to shoot a pilot whom he judged to have returned early from combat. However, he defended a colleague who accidentally shot down a friendly bomber and often gave others the credit for his own kills.|$|E

He had no written speech, so he left us rude scratchings of beasts and things, cracked marrow-bones, and weapons of stone. It was the best expression {{of which he was}} capable. Had he scratched his own particular name with the scratchings of beasts and things, stamped his cracked marrowbones with his own particular seal, trade-marked his weapons of stone with his own particular device, that particular man would we remember.
