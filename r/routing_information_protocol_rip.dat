25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>RIP)</b> and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E

RRAS included two unicast routing protocols, <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>RIP)</b> and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) as well as IGMP routing and forwarding features for IP multicasting.|$|E
50|$|Supernetting {{requires}} {{the use of}} routing protocols that support Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, Exterior Gateway Protocol and version 1 of the <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (RIPv1) assume classful addressing, and therefore cannot transmit the subnet mask information required for supernetting.|$|R
50|$|The term {{distance}} vector {{refers to the}} fact that the protocol manipulates vectors (arrays) of distances to other nodes in the network. The {{distance vector}} algorithm was the original ARPANET routing algorithm and was also used in the Internet under the name of <b>RIP</b> (<b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol).</b>|$|R
50|$|In a naive {{distance}} vector protocol, {{such as the}} <b>routing</b> <b>information</b> <b>protocol,</b> the loop will persist until the metrics for C reach infinity (the maximum number of routers that a packet can traverse in RIP is 15. The value 16 is considered infinity and the packet is discarded).|$|R
50|$|Novell based {{its network}} {{protocol}} on Xerox Network Systems (XNS), and created its own standards from IDP and SPP, which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX).

50|$|Dynamic routing {{attempts}} {{to solve this}} problem by constructing routing tables automatically, based on information carried by routing protocols, allowing the network to act nearly autonomously in avoiding network failures and blockages. Dynamic routing dominates the Internet. Examples of dynamic-routing protocols and algorithms include <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>RIP),</b> Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).|$|E
50|$|There are 3 routing {{protocols}} available for IPX networks: In early IPX networks {{a version of}} <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>RIP)</b> was the only available protocol to exchange routing information. Unlike RIP for IP, it uses delay time as the main metric, retaining the hop count as a secondary metric. Since NetWare 3, the NetWare Link Services Protocol (NSLP) based on IS-IS is available which is more suitable for larger networks. Cisco routers implement an IPX version of EIGRP protocol as well.|$|E

50|$|Addresses in {{the range}} of 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 are {{individually}} assigned by IANA and designated for multicasting on the local subnetwork only. For example, the <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (RIPv2) uses 224.0.0.9, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6, and Zeroconf mDNS uses 224.0.0.251. Routers must not forward these messages outside the subnet in which they originate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Routing</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>RIP)</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} distance-vector routing {{protocols}} which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.|$|E
