As they neared him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea {{as if an}} isolated thing, and continually set in a <b>revolving</b> <b>ring</b> of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowls softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.|$|E

It is portrayed as being genetically engineered to have an enhanced perception of the space-time vortex, enabling it to direct Dalek strategies involving time travel while limiting temporal destabilisation. The novel describes it as the ultimate form of Dalek life, able to command even the Dalek Supreme, and having a neck bin encircled by diagonally <b>revolving</b> <b>rings</b> of vortex energy.

6000|$|The general {{nature of}} Laplace's theory {{scarcely}} needs stating. Books of popular astronomy have familiarized most readers with his conceptions;--namely, that the matter now condensed into the Solar System, once formed a vast rotating spheroid of extreme rarity extending beyond {{the orbit of}} the outermost planet; that as this spheroid contracted, its rate of rotation necessarily increased; that by augmenting centrifugal force its equatorial zone was {{from time to time}} prevented from following any further the concentrating mass, and so remained behind as a revolving ring; that each of the <b>revolving</b> <b>rings</b> thus periodically detached, eventually became ruptured at its weakest point, and, contracting on itself, gradually aggregated into a rotating mass; that this, like the parent mass, increased in rapidity of rotation as it decreased in size, and, where the centrifugal force was sufficient, similarly left behind rings, which finally collapsed into rotating spheroids; and that thus, out of these primary and secondary rings, there arose planets and their satellites, while from the central mass there resulted the Sun. Moreover, it is tolerably well known that this a priori reasoning harmonizes with the results of experiment. Dr. Plateau has shown that when a mass of fluid is, as far may be, protected from the action of external forces, it will, if made to rotate with adequate velocity, form detached rings; and that these rings will break up into spheroids which turn on their axes in the same direction with the central mass. Thus, given the original nebula, which, acquiring a vortical motion in the way indicated, has at length concentrated into a vast spheroid of aeriform matter moving round its axis--given this, and mechanical principles explain the rest. The genesis of a Solar System displaying movements like those observed, may be predicted; and the reasoning on which the prediction is based is countenanced by experiment.[17] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{technique}} described here was to study the influence of external factors upon the flying speed {{and the ability of}} small 'swarms ' of locusts to sustain prolonged flight. The wind forces acting on a flying animal depend only on the motion of its elements relative to the air mass, i. e. on the relative wind. Instead of investigating actual free flight, a locust can therefore be suspended in front of a wind tunnel and made to fly against a streamlined and uniform current of air, the wind speed being adjusted so as to correspond to the air speed of the freely flying insect. Under such conditions it has been possible to make a single individual fly for several hours. But a very large tunnel would be necessary for a number of animals to fly simultaneously as is required for quantitative work. Instead of moving the air mass, one can move the suspended animal through still air with a speed corresponding to the flying speed and so have several insects flying at once. Thus proper aerodynamic conditions for flight can be obtained by attaching the animals to a <b>revolving</b> <b>ring,</b> provided the ring is made so large that the angular velocity is kept small...|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} the Sun had shrunk until it {{occupied}} a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Saturn, the balance, we are to suppose, between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed, through increase of rotary velocity, the result of condensation, that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and an annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before; which, on rupture through ununiformity, became consolidated into the planet Saturn. This latter threw off, in the first place, seven uniform bands, which, on rupture, were spherified respectively into as many moons; but, subsequently, {{it appears to have}} discharged, at three distinct but not very distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution was, by apparent accident, so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture; thus they continue to <b>revolve</b> as <b>rings.</b> I use the phrase “apparent accident;” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was, of course, nothing:—the term is properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable law.|$|R

40|$|In these expository notes I discuss several {{concepts}} {{and results in}} the theory of modules over commutative <b>rings,</b> <b>revolving</b> around the Gorenstein dimension of modules. Some of the related notions are the Auslander dual, k-torsionless modules, and k-th syzygies. Essentially everything in these notes can be found, in one form or another, in the memoir "Stable module theory" by M. Auslander and M. Bridger (Mem. A. M. S., no. 94, 1969). The only difference is in presentation. In the Auslander-Bridger memoir many of the results are proved in the most general setting, e. g. over possibly non-commutative, non-Noetherian rings. The techniques used are quite abstract and unfamiliar to many commutative algebraists. Much space is devoted to the theory of satellites of functors which are exact only in the middle, etc. While such a degree of generality has many advantages, it does make the memoir difficult to read for the non-expert. My goal in writing these notes was to develop the theory in the context of commutative Noetherian rings, and to show that, in this important special case, the theory is fairly elementary and easy to build. As a practical matter, then, I wrote the notes using Matsumura's "Commutative ring theory" as the only pre-requisite; and indeed, my hope is that these notes can be read just like an extra chapter in Matsumura's book.

The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The bearings consist of brass boxes arranged to be lubricated by two rings in each bearing. These <b>rings</b> <b>revolve</b> as the shaft turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The core is firmly bolted to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the slots by thin wedges of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel. The laminae are insulated from each other by sheets of tissue paper or by a coating of japan, {{in order to reduce the}} loss by eddy currents which are induced by the flux. The conductors in this member are heavy copper bars which are short circuited at the ends of the rotor by heavy copper plates...|$|R
