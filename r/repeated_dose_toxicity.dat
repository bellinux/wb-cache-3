50|$|The {{protocol}} {{presents a}} summary of safety pharmacology studies in two species (rat, dog) and <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies in four species (13-week sub-chronic studies in mouse, dog and monkey; a 26-week chronic study in the rat). Of note, few adverse events were observed {{in any of the}} studies, with the oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) varying between 10 mg/kg/day in rats to 75 mg/kg/day in monkeys. The authors suggest that these were the maximum doses tested in these studies, though it is not clear. The authors also report no effects of significance in the animal models used for the CNS safety pharmacology studies, which studied a dose of up to 300 mg/kg/day. The protocol nominates a human NOAEL of 100 mg as a human equivalent dose to the 26-week rat NOAEL, though with no description how this was calculated. The summary presented however includes no assessment of the relevance of the animal species selected for study (that is, in terms of physiological and genetic similarities with humans and the mechanism of action of the study drug). Early reports that the molecule had been studied in chimpanzees turned out to be incorrect.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} an {{investigation}} on {{the relevance of}} developmental toxicity endpoints in animal studies for setting acute limits is described. In this analysis NOAELs and LOAELs from single dose experiments are compared to NOAELs and LOAELs from normal 'guideline-based' <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> developmental <b>toxicity</b> studies. Based on this analysis {{it was concluded that}} gross maternal toxicity (maternal body weight, food intake, organ weights, clinical signs) are not an appropriate starting point for setting limits for acute exposure. The relevance of fetal body weight (and retarded ossification) for acute limit setting should be evaluated within the total context of developmental effects and maternal toxicity. Resorptions are considered relevant for setting acute exposure limits. Malformations and skeletal effects are considered relevant starting points for acute limit setting unless evidence is available to indicate otherwise.

All are being developed with a special emphasis on the mechanistic basis of the models considered. Computational workflows as well as a new comprehensive database with reliable structures and <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> data will be freely available to support safety assessment without the use of animals and will thus contribute to the 3 Rs.

40|$|Assessment of {{reproductive}} toxicity is an animal-, time- and cost-consuming process. In order to refine, replace and reduce animal testing, {{the use of}} in-silico, in-vitro and alternative in-vivo strategies is tested for their value to predict adverse reproductive outcomes. Due {{to the complexity of}} the reproductive cycle, encompassing maturation of gametes, mating, implantation of the conceptus, intra-uterine survival and maturation as well as postnatal development, no alternative testing strategies so far are able to cover all aspects of fertility. One approach should therefore be the use of existing animal study data, especially from repeated dose studies, to analyse indicators for reproductive toxicity. The current versions of OECD Guideline requirements for <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> include structural changes in reproductive organ tissues (mainly testes, epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicles and ovaries and uterus). Based on this information <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies are useful for selection of substances for further reproductive toxicity testing, for appropriate dose selection and for selection to incorporate additional parameters, e. g. for endocrine testing, into reproductive toxicity studies. In addition repeated dose studies can have a predictive value for detecting certain impairments {{of reproductive}} function. These conclusions have been extended by analysing animal studies from the Fraunhofer ITEM databases RepDose for <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> and FeDTex for reproductive toxicity. Further, based on the analysis of FeDTex, and in view of the development of AOP (adverse outcome pathway) -based approaches it should be considered to enhance the list of mandatory study parameters in repeated dose studies by hormone and sperm parameters and oestrus cyclicity in order to increase the predictivity for reproductive toxicity...|$|E

40|$|In vitro <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> {{testing for}} the {{assessment}} of chronic drug-induced effects is a huge challenge in preclinical pharmaceutical drug development. Chronic toxicity results in discontinuation of therapy or post-marketing withdrawal of drugs despite in vivo preclinical screening. In case of hepatotoxicity, due to limited long term viability and functionality of primary hepatocytes, chronic hepatic effects are difficult to detect. In this study, we maintained primary human hepatocytes in a serum-free cultivation medium for more than 3 weeks and analyzed physiology, viability and drug metabolizing capacities of the hepatocytes. Moreover, we assessed acute (24 h) diclofenac toxicity in a range of (10 - 1000 muM) concentrations. The chronic (9 <b>repeated</b> <b>doses)</b> <b>toxicity</b> at one clinically relevant and another higher concentration (6. 4 and 100 muM) was also tested. We investigated phase I and II metabolism of diclofenac upon <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> exposure and analyzed effects on the cellular exometabolome. Acute 24 h assessment revealed toxicity only for the highest tested concentration (1 mM). Upon <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> exposure, toxic effects were observed even at a low, clinically relevant concentration (6. 4 muM). Biotransformation pathways were active for 3 weeks and diclofenac-acylglucuronide was detected as the predominant metabolite. Dose dependent diclofenac-induced effects on exometabolome, such as on the production of lactate and 3 -hydroxybutyric acid as well as glucose and galactose metabolism, were observed upon nine <b>repeated</b> <b>doses.</b> Summarizing, we show that <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> testing on long-term functional cultures of primary human hepatocytes may be included {{for the assessment}} of long term toxic effects in preclinical screening and can potentially help replace/reduce in vivo animal testing...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:This {{study was}} {{performed}} to check for reversibility in the changes induced by a 13 -week, <b>repeated,</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> test of Sweet Bee Venom (SBV) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Methods:Fifteen male and 15 female SD rats were treated with 0. 28 mg/kg of SBV (high-dosage group) and the same numbers {{of male and female}} SD rats were treated with 0. 2 mL/kg of normal saline (control group) for 13 weeks. We selected five male and five female SD rats from the high-dosage group and the same numbers of male and female SD rats from the control group, and we observed these rats for four weeks. We conducted body-weight measurements, ophthalmic examinations, urinalyses and hematology, biochemistry, histology tests. Results:(1) Hyperemia and movement disorder were observed in the 13 -week, <b>repeated,</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> test, but these symptoms were not observed during the recovery period. (2) The rats in the high-dose group showed no significant changes in weight compared to the control group. (3) No significant differences in the ophthalmic parameters, urine analyses, complete blood cell counts (CBCs), and biochemistry were observed among the recovery groups. (4) No changes in organ weights were observed during the recovery period. (5) Histological examination of the thigh muscle indicated cell infiltration, inflammation, degeneration, necrosis of muscle fiber, and fibrosis during the treatment period, but these changes were not observed during the recovery period. The fatty liver change that was observed during the toxicity test was not observed during the recovery period. No other organ abnormalities were observed. Conclusion:The changes that occurred during the 13 -week, <b>repeated,</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> test are reversible, and SBV can be safely used as a treatment modality...|$|E

40|$|The European Union (EU) Cosmetics Regulation {{established}} {{the ban on}} animal testing for cosmetics ingredients. This ban does not assume that all cosmetics ingredients are safe, but that the non-testing procedures (in vitro and in silico) have to be applied for their safety assessment. To this end, the SEURAT- 1 cluster was funded by EU 7 th Framework Programme and Cosmetics Europe. The COSMOS (Integrated In Silico Models for the Prediction of Human <b>Repeated</b> <b>Dose</b> <b>Toxicity</b> of COSMetics to Optimise Safety) project was initiated {{as one of the}} seven consortia of the cluster, with the purpose of facilitating the prediction of human <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> associated with exposure to cosmetics-related compounds through in silico approaches. A critical objective of COSMOS was to address the paucity of publicly available data for cosmetics ingredients and related chemicals. Therefore a database was established containing (i) an inventory of cosmetics ingredients and related structures; (ii) skin permeability/absorption data (route of exposure relevant to cosmetics); and (iii) <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> data. This thesis describes the process of “knowledge discovery from the data”, including collation of the content of the COSMOS database and its subsequent application for developing tools to support the prediction of <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> of cosmetics and related compounds. A rigorous strategy of curation and quality control of chemical records was applied in developing the database (as documented in the Standard Operating Procedure, chapter 2). The chemical space of the cosmetics-related compounds was compared to food-related compounds from the U. S. FDA CFSAN PAFA database using the novel approach combining the analysis of structural features (ToxPrint chemotypes) and physicochemical properties. The cosmetics- and food- specific structural classes related to particular use functions and manifested by distinct physicochemical properties were identified (chapter 3). The novel COSMOS Skin Permeability Database containing in vivo and in vitro skin permeability/absorption data was developed by integrating existing databases and enriching them with new data for cosmetics harvested from regulatory documents and scientific literature (chapter 4). Compounds with available data on human in vitro maximal flux (JMAX) were subsequently extracted from the developed database and analysed in terms of their structural features (ToxPrint chemotypes) and physicochemical properties. The profile of compounds exhibiting low or high skin permeability potential was determined. The results of this analysis can support rapid screening and classification of the compounds without experimental data (chapter 5). The new COSMOS oral <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> database was established through consolidation of existing data sources and harvesting new regulatory documents and scientific literature. The unique data structure of the COSMOS oRepeatToxDB allows capturing all toxicological effects observed at particular dose levels and sites, which are hierarchically differentiated as organs, tissues, and cells (chapter 6). Such design of this database enabled the development of liver toxicity ontology, followed by mechanistic mining of in vivo data (chapter 7). As a result, compounds associated with liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis phenotypic effects were identified and further analysed. The probable mechanistic reasoning for toxicity (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR) activation) was formulated for two hepatotoxicants, namely 1, 3 -bis-(2, 4 -diaminophenoxy) -propane and piperonyl butoxide. Key outcomes of this thesis include an extensive curated database, Standard Operating Procedures, skin permeability potential classification rules, and the set of structural features associated with liver steatosis. Such knowledge is particularly important {{in the light of the}} 21 st Century Toxicology (NRC, 2007) and the ongoing need to move away from animal toxicity testing to non-testing alternatives...|$|E

A model developed using Estate type fingerprints correctly predicted the LD 50 classes for 70 of 94 training set chemicals and 19 of 24 test set chemicals. An individual category was formed {{for each of the}} chemicals by extracting its corresponding k-analogs that were identified by k-NN classification. These categories were used to perform the read-across study for prediction of the chronic toxicity, i. e., Lowest Observed Effect Levels (LOEL). We have successfully predicted the LOELs of 54 of 70 training set chemicals (77 %) and 14 of 19 test set chemicals (74 %) to within an order of magnitude from their experimental LOEL values. Given the success thus far, we conclude that if the k-NN model predicts LD 50 classes correctly for a certain chemical, then the k-analogs of such a chemical can be successfully used for data gap filling for the LOEL.

MON 87411 is a GM maize variety that leverages dsRNAs to selectively control corn rootworm through production of a 240 base pair (bp) dsRNA fragment targeting for suppression the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) Snf 7 gene (DvSnf 7). A bioinformatics assessment found that endogenous corn small RNAs matched ∼ 450 to 2300 unique RNA transcripts that likely code for proteins in rat, mouse, and human, demonstrating safe dsRNA consumption by mammals. Mice were administered DvSnf 7 RNA (968 nucleotides, including the 240 bp DvSnf 7 dsRNA) at 1, 10, or 100  mg/kg by oral gavage in a 28 -day <b>repeat</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> study. No treatment-related effects were observed in body weights, food consumption, clinical observations, clinical chemistry, hematology, gross pathology, or histopathology endpoints. Therefore, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for DvSnf 7 RNA was 100  mg/kg, the highest dose tested. These results demonstrate that dsRNA for insect control does not produce adverse health effects in mammals at oral doses millions to billions of times higher than anticipated human exposures and therefore poses negligible risk to mammals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Jawarish Jalinoos (JJ) is a {{classical}} semisolid traditional Unani formulation clinically {{used for the}} treatment of weakness of vital organs, liver, and stomach. Although JJ has been widely used clinically for several decades, no scientific report is available for its safety. Methods: JJ and its sugar-free tablet version (SFJJ; formulated to target diabetic population) were assessed for safety in rats. Ninety-day <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> oral <b>toxicity</b> study was performed as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guideline 408. JJ was orally administered at the dose of 2000  mg/kg bw/d, whereas SFJJ was orally administered at the doses of 506  mg/kg body weight (bw) /d, 1012  mg/kg bw/d, and 2024  mg/kg bw/d for 90 days. The animals were periodically observed for clinical signs of toxicity, mortality, morbidity, body weight changes, and feed consumption. At the end of the study, hematology, clinical biochemistry, electrolytes, gross pathology, relative organ weight, and histological examination were performed. Results: Treatment with SFJJ and JJ showed no significant differences in body weight gain, feed consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry, and serum electrolytes. No gross pathological findings and differences in relative organ weights were observed between control and drug treated rats. Histological examination revealed no toxicologically significant abnormalities related with SFJJ or JJ treatment. Conclusion: The 90 -day <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> oral <b>toxicity</b> study demonstrates that the no observed adverse effect level of SFJJ and JJ is greater than 2024  mg/kg bw/d and 2000  mg/kg bw/d (p. o.) in rats, respectively. Both formulations were found to be safe up to the tested dose levels and experimental conditions, and therefore safe for clinical use as specified in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A k-nearest {{neighbor}} (k-NN) classification {{model was}} constructed for 118 RDT NEDO (<b>Repeated</b> <b>Dose</b> <b>Toxicity</b> New Energy and industrial technology Development Organization; currently {{known as the}} Hazard Evaluation Support System (HESS)) database chemicals, employing two acute toxicity (LD 50) -based classes as a response and using a series of eight PaDEL software-derived fingerprints as predictor variables. A model developed using Estate type fingerprints correctly predicted the LD 50  classes for 70 of 94 training set chemicals and 19 of 24 test set chemicals. An individual category was formed {{for each of the}} chemicals by extracting its corresponding k-analogs that were identified by k-NN classification. These categories were used to perform the read-across study for prediction of the chronic toxicity, i. e., Lowest Observed Effect Levels (LOEL). We have successfully predicted the LOELs of 54 of 70 training set chemicals (77 %) and 14 of 19 test set chemicals (74 %) to within an order of magnitude from their experimental LOEL values. Given the success thus far, we conclude that if the k-NN model predicts LD 50 classes correctly for a certain chemical, then the k-analogs of such a chemical can be successfully used for data gap filling for the LOEL. This model should support the in silico prediction of <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Acute {{systemic}} toxicity {{is one of}} the areas of particular concern due to the 2009 deadline set by the 7 th Amendment of the Cosmetics Directive (76 / 768 /EEC), which introduces a testing and marketing ban of cosmetic products with ingredients tested on animals. The scientific community is putting considerable effort into developing and validating non-animal alternatives in this area. However, it is unlikely that validated and regulatory accepted alternative methods and/or strategies will be available in March 2009. Following the initiatives undertaken in the pharmaceutical industry to waive the acute oral toxicity testing before going to clinical studies by using information from other in vivo studies, we proposed an approach to identify non-toxic compounds (LD 50 > 2000 mg/kg) using information from 28 days <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies. Taking into account the high prevalence of non-toxic substances (87 %) in the New Chemicals Database, it was possible to set a NOAEL threshold of P 200 mg/kg that allowed the correct identification of 63 % of non-toxic compounds, while < 1 % of harmful compounds were misclassified as non-toxic. Since <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies can be performed in vivo until 2013, the proposed approach could have an immediate impact for the testing of cosmetic ingredients. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Category {{approaches}} {{are an important}} tool to reduce, refine and replace (3 R principle) animal testing under REACH. Two strategies for developing categories may be distinguished: chemical categories are based on structural properties of the substances such as structural alerts, similarity and molecular properties. These are refined and evaluated by analysing toxicological properties. Numerous chemical categories have already been analysed by this strategy e. g. in the OECD HPV programme. They {{can be used to}} estimate endpoints like mutagenicity, irritation, sensitization, but may not suffice for complex endpoints such as <b>repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> or reproductive toxicity. Toxicological categories may be useful for complex endpoints: they can be developed based on the toxicological fingerprint where critical target organs and effects observed in animal studies are taken into account. Another possibility is to derive toxicological categories for specific effects. An example is already established for urinary nephropathy which is associated with branched hydrocarbons. Finally rare target organs e. g. adrenals may be investigated. Common structural properties are then identified to characterize the category further. <b>Repeated</b> <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> data for 587 chemicals and 1739 studies within the database RepDose© developed by Fraunhofer ITEM ([URL] will be used to develop new categories. Both strategies are demonstrated using examples such as glycol ethers...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To provide {{information}} on the safety of ACM, we carried out a 13 -week <b>repeated</b> oral <b>dose</b> <b>toxicity</b> and a 4 -week recovery test of ACM in Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: Female and male rats were treated with ACM with oral doses of 800, 2000, and 5000 ㎎/㎏. The ACM was administered for 13 weeks. Mortality, clinical signs, body weight changes, food consumption, ophthalmologic findings, urinalysis, hematological and biochemical parameters, gross findings, organ weights and histological markers were monitored during the study period. Moreover, the rats were monitored for 4 extra weeks to determine recovery time after the study period. Results: We found no mortality and no abnormalities in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmologic findings, urinalysis, hematological and biochemical parameters, gross findings, organ weights and histological markers {{in any of the}} rats tested...|$|R
