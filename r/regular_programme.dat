2500|$|Newton's single-minded {{attention}} to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton. His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how {{when he took a}} walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down. [...] Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the Principia: Newton for years kept up a <b>regular</b> <b>programme</b> of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all. [...] So it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was normally dedicated, and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.|$|E
2500|$|A choral {{tradition}} was {{established at the}} Brookvale college from the 1950s.

Affiliated to the Little Singers of the Wooden Cross (Pueri Cantores) and the Royal School of Church Music, its boys' choir was nationally famous for its liturgies, Eisteddfod wins, interstate tours and concerts. It toured Queensland in 1968, 1970 and 1972. After its success at the NSW Conservatorium of Music in the 1966 [...] "Mirror" [...] Choral Championships for Boys, it became the official Festival Records Boys choir and cut commercial recordings. It sang for the first visit of a pope to Australia, Pope Paul VI, in 1970. It likewise assisted in the Australian premiere of Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki's St. Luke Passion at the Sydney Opera House under the direction of Australian conductor Patrick Thomas in 1974. The performance was held {{in the presence of the}} composer. The school's liturgical choral {{tradition was}} continued vigorously through the 1970s and 1980s (by daily rehearsal and the annual choir camp) through a <b>regular</b> <b>programme</b> of Masses, Compline and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and public concerts. The choral repertoire and general musicianship of students were extended and promoted by musicians including the Rev. Ronald Bopf OSA (on staff 1957-74), Madge Wilson (sight singing and classroom music), the Rev. Senan Ward OSA (on staff 1975-82, 87-89), Peter Bohrsmann (on staff 1968-74, 77-81, and Choirmaster 1973-74, and member of St Mary's Cathedral Choir, Sydney), Errol Lea-Scarlett (on staff 1963-76, also then Organist of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney), and Ann Sutcliffe (on staff 1972-80, Choirmaster 1975-80).

40|$|Visible {{pedagogy}} {{and subtle}} interactions. Successful teaching in {{upper secondary education}} for students not eligible for <b>regular</b> <b>programmes.</b> In this article, two examples of teaching for students not eligible for <b>regular</b> <b>programmes</b> in Swedish upper secondary education are analysed. These were selected as they are representative of teaching that the students have spoken highly of. A theoretical point of departure are theories of organizing which focus on connections of actions and institutionalized patterns. Institutionalized patterns of visible pedagogy with strong classification and strong framing (cf. Bernstein 1975) are identified. However, the two examples also show other more subtle interactions. These are analysed and shown to be of importance {{with the help of}} concepts from John Dewey (1916) and his emphasis on the role of communication and interaction in the educational process...|$|R
