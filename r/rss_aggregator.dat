40|$|This article {{presents}} {{experiences in the}} automation of a testing process. The main goal is the unified testing of not only one program, but a whole family of programs. The family {{is characterized by a}} common functionality and therefore similar GUI interfaces. The testing process integrates extraction of the application specific data from its executable and the usage of the capture and replay testing technique. The testing of various me mbers of application family is driven by a unified, common script. The approach is illustrated by a case study. As a family of applications under test a set of <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregators</b> was used. A unified test RSSscript was developed and verified in test experiments. The results of functional, performance and regression testing are presented. The benefits and limitations of the solution are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Researchers need {{to share}} {{information}} about their publications. They also desire to share opinions and comments about each other’s publications. The paper describes a system which demonstrates how semantic blogging {{can be used for}} the purpose. The SWRC ontology has been incorporated in the blogging system for entering the metadata of publications. The semantic blogging system provides means to annotate publications. The system is a decentralized publication aggregation system. It utilizes the RSS technology to aggregate posts. The publication metadata is embedded in the RSS to produce BuRST feed. The <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregator</b> has been extended to handle the BuRST feeds. The system uses the FOAF links of the authors and friends to explore the social network of the research community for aggregation of relevant information. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{few years}} have passed from the first {{alarming}} yells about the unmanageable growth of data which is literally exploding from the Web. While Web 2. 0 technologies, born and grown from the crowd of the web community, are reaching their full maturity, and with W 3 C eventually managing to give concreteness to Berners-Lee Semantic Web Vision through a plethora of new languages and protocols, the same problem is still a living matter. Lots of vendors and providers offer social services with more-than-overlapping aspects, but with no intentions of sharing their data. <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregators</b> as well as blog and mailing list scrapers, erupt tons of data which are irritatingly replicated by search engines indexes. At the same time, {{most of the information}} services (wikis, blogs, mailing lists, forums, newsgroups etc.) still maintain their traditional functionalities and move no step forward reaching any kind of interoperability. In this paper we analyze the current scenario and propose our personal view on how new Semantic Web technologies could be employed to give life to a new generation of social, heterogeneous and coordinated informative services: Thematic Oases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Content {{syndication}} through RSS {{is gaining}} wide acceptance, {{and it is}} envisaged that feed aggregators will be provided as a commodity in future browsers. As we consume more of our information by way of RSS feeds, search mechanisms other than simple keyword search will be required. To this end, advances in semantic tooling can effectively improve {{the current state of}} the art in feed aggregators. This work reports on the benets of making a popular <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregator,</b> RSSOwl, ontology-aware. The paper uses three common functions, namely, semantic view, semantic navigation and semantic query, to illustrate how RSS aggregators can be ontology powered. The outcome is that location, browsing and rendering of RSS feeds are customised to the conceptual model of the reader, making RSS aggregators a powerful companion to face the RSSosphere. The system has been fully implemented, and successfully tested by distinct users. ...|$|E
40|$|In this Master thesis the {{performance}} of full-text search is analyzed. Search engine is implemented by using PHP and MySQL also Memcached cache engine. Data for the research is gathered from <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregator</b> that periodically collects information from lithuanian blogs. The main attention is drawn on speed of both data indexing and search results gathering. While analyzing indexing process the speed of its performance was measured on different data sets. Indexing {{requires a lot of}} computer resources and can last long when having a lot of data. The duration of this process was measured with enabled and disabled Memcached service and list of ignored words. A test on how strongly query's number of elements influence the collection of results was performed. Performances were tested by using both InnoDB and MyISAM tables. Paper suggests solutions that are recommended for implementing and using similar search engines...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{different}} commercial Weblog subscribing {{systems have}} been proposed to return stories from users ’ subscribed feeds. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregator</b> called as RSS Clusgator System (RCS) for Weblog reading. Note that an RSS feed may have several different topics. A user may only {{be interested in a}} subset of these topics. In addition there could be many different stories from multiple RSS feeds, which discuss similar topic from different perspectives. A user may be interested in this topic but {{do not know how to}} collect all feeds related to this topic. In contrast to many previous works, we cluster all stories in RSS feeds into hierarchical structure to better serve the readers. Through this way, users can easily find all their interested stories. To make the system current, we propose a flexible time window for incremental clustering. RCS utilizes both link information and content information for efficient clustering. Experiments show the effectiveness of RCS...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWith {{the rapid}} growth of data sources, {{services}} and devices connected to the Internet, online available web content is getting more and more diverse and dynamic. In order to facilitate the efficient dissemination of evolving and temporary information, many web applications publish their new information as RSS and Atom documents which are then collected and transformed by <b>RSS</b> <b>aggregators</b> like Feedly or Yahoo! News. This article addresses the particular issue of large scale aggregation of highly dynamic information sources by focusing on the design of optimal refresh strategies for large collections of RSS feed documents. First, we introduce two quality measures specific to RSS aggregation which reflect the information completeness and average freshness of the result feeds. Then, we propose a best effort feed refresh strategy that achieves maximum aggregation quality compared with all other existing policies with the same average number of refreshes. This strategy is based on specific online change estimation models developed after a deep analysis of the temporal publication characteristics of a representative collection of real-world RSS feeds. The presented methods have been implemented and tested against synthetic and real-world RSS feed data sets...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{university}} {{teachers have been}} developing several contents using streaming technology, since it promotes the support of pedagogical activity as a dynamic resource and {{due to the fact}} that is oriented to a model of shared learning contents. Now, a new challenge can be stated: the share and the reutilization of these learning contents. Apart from being an enhanced experience only concerning the sharing of knowledge, it promotes a desired partnership inter/intra-department. In this context the RSS technology introduces a new dimension in the access to streaming media contents. The RSS is a format to syndicate contents enabling users to be aware of new contents that are periodically published. The RSS technology, through the use of <b>RSS</b> <b>Aggregators</b> or <b>RSS</b> Readers, help the user to keep up to date all their favourite information sources that provide their contents as RSS feeds. In the scope of the streaming media contents the definition of RSS feeds enable the students to be up to date of new educational resources that are provided by the teacher. Therefore the students instead of checking the updates that are published in several educational information resources can locally see the new resources that are described and provided in the RSS feed. Some preliminaries results are presented and discussed...|$|R
