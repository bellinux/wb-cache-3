In this work, the finite element model of the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> of the NC machine tool is established. Then the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modals of the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> model are obtained with two different boundary conditions. One boundary condition is that the movable joint surface of the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> is considered, and regardless {{of the influence of}} the bolt joint surface of the guide. And another boundary condition is that the movable joint surface of the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> and the influence of bolt joint surface of the guide are all considered. By comparing the modal characters of the two states, it is proved that the movable joint and bolted interfaces of the guide have certain effects on the dynamic performance of the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide.</b> For the experiment, the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> also has been tested in two ways, the slider excited and the sliding guide excited respectively.

Linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{essential}} parts of the NC modern machine tools, and they play a significant supporting and guiding role in machine tools components. Especially, the joint surface between guides has great influence on machine's dynamic characteristics. According to this, in this work, taken the Japanese THK Corporation's SNS 35 LR <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> as specific study object, the finite element model of guide pair has been established with the joint surface influence considered. And by the method of the theoretical analysis with the experimental confirmation combined; the dynamic characteristics of the linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> pair's were studied relatively. Thus, the theoretical model and the finite element model established in this paper can be confirmed by the experiment.

In this paper, the relative deformation of guide interface was analyzed based on Hertz theory and normal contact stiffness of guide joint was calculated first. Then, the vibration model of linear <b>rolling</b> <b>guide</b> joint was performed. The kinetic energy and potential energy of carriage-rail system was derived. Based on Lagrangeâ€™s approach, motion equilibrium equations of different vibration modes were derived. At last, vibration test was designed to get natural frequencies and mode shapes of the carriage. The natural frequencies agreed well with the values calculated by analytical approach.

40|$|In this project, {{nonlinear}} characteristics on {{the rolling}} interface of a linear guide were studied by the {{finite element analysis}} and experimental verification. Contact of the ball/surface rolling interface in the <b>rolling</b> <b>guides</b> was simulated as a three-dimensional membrane element without thickness. By introducing Hertzian contact theory and applying proper normal/shear stiffness to such contact elements in the overall finite element model, dynamic behaviors of linear guides affected by preload were thus investigated. In the finite element procedure, three contact models, 1 D point-to-point, 2 D point-to-point and 3 D surface-to-surface, were sequentially introduced for purpose of verification with experiments. As a validation in this project, vibrational experiments on linear guides with different preloads were conducted and related frequency spectrums were derived. Both the finite element and the experimental results reveal that the natural frequency of a linear guide increases with the increment of the preload. In addition, the dynamic characteristics predicted by finite element analysis agree well with those measured from instrumental experiments. The proposal of current study may provide an alternate and reliable way for understanding of the dynamic characteristic of the rolling contact components in machine design field. (c) 2006 IMACS.

40|$|Land cover {{classification}} using {{very high}} spatial resolution (VHSR) imaging plays {{a very important}} role in remote sensing applications. However, image noise usually reduces the classification accuracy of VHSR images. Image spatial filters have been recently adopted to improve VHSR image land cover classification. In this study, a new object-based image filter using topology and feature constraints is proposed, where an object is considered as a central object and has irregular shapes and various numbers of neighbors depending {{on the nature of the}} surroundings. First, multi-scale segmentation is used to generate a homogeneous image object and extract the corresponding vectors. Then, topology and feature constraints are proposed to select the adjacent objects, which present similar materials to the central object. Third, the feature of the central object is smoothed by the average of the selected objectsâ€™ feature. This proposed approach is validated on three VHSR images, ranging from a fixed-wing aerial image to UAV images. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to a standard object-based approach (OO), object correlative index (OCI) spatial feature based method, a recursive filter (RF), and a <b>rolling</b> <b>guided</b> filter (RGF), and has shown a 6 %â€“ 18 % improvement in overall accuracy.

The paper shows that substitution of traditionally applied precision <b>rolling</b> <b>guides</b> by a pendulum suspension of the ultrasonic converter allows significantly to simplify a process equipment design. A calculative model for contact interaction of an end face of the ultrasonic converter installed on a pendulum suspension Â with a rigid basis and scheme of a mathematical Â pendulum Â that Â corresponds are proposed in the paper and they permit to investigate an influence of pendulum suspension parameters and its loading conditions on the operational mode of an acoustic oscillatory system. The paper contains analytical dependences that make it possible to calculate time and power parameters in contact interaction of a target end face of the ultrasonic converter installed on a pendulum suspension with a rigid basis. These dependences take into account an amplitude of ultrasonic oscillations, converter weight, pendulum length and an angle of its deviation. The paper reveals that the applicaÂ­tion of the pendulum suspension of the ultrasonic converter allows to ensure a vibrating impact (operational) mode of interaction of a converter target end face with a rigid basis surface. Design variants of the pendulum suspension of the ultraÂ­sonic converter while using various elastic elements are proposed and analyzed in the paper and with due account of concrete processing conditions these variants allow to provide the required value of own oscillation frequency of an acoustic system and also to create necessary value of a preliminary tightness in it. </p...|$|R

As the field of robotics advances and robots become more dynamic, control algorithms for landing safely from a long, intended fall will become more necessary.

The calculated impact pose results in minimal loss of energy through rolling, while maximizing the rolling time.
