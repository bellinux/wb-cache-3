50|$|A pork pie is a {{traditional}} British cold meat pie. It consists of <b>roughly</b> <b>chopped</b> pork and pork jelly sealed in a hot water crust pastry. It is normally eaten as a snack or with a salad.|$|E
50|$|In Vojvodina ƒçesnica {{is not a}} kind of bread, but {{a pastry}} made of layers of filo filled with <b>roughly</b> <b>chopped</b> nuts and raisins, similar to baklava, but drier and is usually made {{exclusively}} with added honey. A coin is placed at some point between the layers.|$|E

50|$|Developed in the 1980s in Hong Kong for Cantonese cuisine, XO {{sauce is}} made of <b>roughly</b> <b>chopped</b> dried seafoods, {{including}} scallops, dried fish and shrimp, and subsequently cooked with chili peppers, onions, and garlic. This dried seafood-based sauce bears similarity to the Fujianese Shacha sauce. Spring Moon, the Peninsula Hong Kong's Chinese restaurant, is often credited with the invention of XO sauce, although others claim the sauce's origin in the urban area of Kowloon.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of gajar ka halwa, but its main ingredients are freshly grated carrots, milk, sugar, khoya, and ghee. The {{quantity and quality}} may vary according to personal taste. In the sugar free variant, sugar is excluded from the recipe. For cooking gajar ka halwa, a cooker or kadai is usually preferred. Carrots must first be grated and then dried before cooking. The grated carrots are then put into a heated pan with a specific amount of milk or khoya and sugar. After stirring for 4-5 minutes, <b>roughly</b> <b>chopped</b> cashew nuts are added and 10-15 minutes later a specific amount of pure ghee is added as well. Finally, it is often served with a garnish of almonds and pistachios.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} British pork pie {{consists of}} <b>roughly</b> <b>chopped</b> pork cooked {{in a hot}} water pastry crust. Due to shrinkage of the meat during cooking, the gap formed around the meat is usually sealed using a gelatin based jelly to exclude air and thus help to preserve the pie. The properties of the jelly are such that it will ingress into the pastry crust causing undesirable softening. The jelly is traditionally produced by simmering pig trotters with seasoning for several hours. In this work we demonstrate the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{as a tool for}} investigating the conditions required for producing jellies with different properties and present two examples of this use. Firstly we demonstrate that MRI can determine the ability of water to diffuse through the jelly which is critical in minimizing the amount of moisture moving from the jelly to the crust. Secondly, the impact of jelly temperature on the penetration length into the crust is investigated. These examples highlight the power of MRI as a tool for food assessment...|$|E
