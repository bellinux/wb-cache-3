40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple procedure for acoustic noise reduction in {{switched reluctance motor}} (SRMs). <b>Radial</b> <b>forces</b> between rotor and stator teeth cause a vibration of stator laminations and windings. The vibrations lead to acoustic noise. The <b>radial</b> <b>forces</b> can {{be determined by the}} two-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The magnitude of the acoustic noise at any operating speed is calculated by an analytical mode which depends on the <b>radial</b> <b>forces</b> and circumferential deflection. The calculation, simulation and measurement results are useful to improve stator and rotor poles with acoustic noise reduction. Moreover, {{it is important for the}} SRM to avoid the mechanical resonant frequency. If the electric frequency equals mechanical resonant frequency, the vibration and acoustic noise is extremely high and destroys the mechanical structure of the high speed motor...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{exploit the}} {{multiple}} symmetries and the discrete {{character of the}} current distribution to express the torque and the <b>radial</b> <b>forces</b> in a PM synchronous machine. Under some assumptions, the magnetic field can be built with {{a limited number of}} discrete functions. These functions can constitute an orthogonal base of a vector space for the representation of the machine magnetic state.

Consider a tire supporting a 1,000 pound load running on a perfectly smooth roadway. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value.
