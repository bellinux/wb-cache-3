After having controlled for unobserved effects that might {{have an impact on}} the import prices by using sector dummies, we find that on average exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is a dominant effect compared to tariff rate pass-through (TRPT) in explaining changes in India’s import prices. The sectoral panel results suggest that the pass-through of exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> varies across products. ERPT into import prices is significant in 12 industries, whereas TRPT is significant only in 6 industries, with full pass-through. However, ERPT is incomplete only in 4 industries, but TRPT is incomplete in 36 industries, which means that firms exporting to India more frequently adopt strategies to maintain their market share against tariffs than against exchange rate changes. The sectoral differences in pass-through seem to be related to the sector’s share in total imports and the sector’s effective protection rate. Hence India’s relatively high levels of protection {{have an impact on the}} behaviour of foreign exporters. ...|$|R

We find that import penetration (instrumented with exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariffs)</b> leads to more incentive provision in a variety of ways. First, it increases the sensitivity of pay to performance. Second, it increases within-firm pay differentials between executive levels, with CEOs typically experiencing the largest wage increases. Finally, higher foreign competition is also associated with a higher demand for talent. These results suggest that increased foreign competition can explain some of the recent trends in compensation structures. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a practical {{supply and demand}} model of bilateral trade flows. The model is constructed in two tiers. First, aggregate import demand and aggregate export supply are determined from aggregate economic relations that contain real income (output) and relative prices. Second, bilateral import demand and bilateral export supply are determined from theory-based allocation relations. By differentiating import prices from export prices, the analysis incorporates international transportation costs <b>and</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The result is a simultaneous system that determines bilateral trade flows and bilateral prices given country incomes, domestic price levels and international transmission factors. The model in dynamic form is estimated from a panel of bilateral trade flows for five major OECD countries (United States, Japan, France, West Germany, United Kingdom) for the years 1958 - 1971. The model has many applications, e. g. in the analyses of the impacts on trade flows of differential economic growth <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariff</b> policies.

This study is significant as municipalities need {{to ensure that they}} are financially sustainable for the continued provision and maintenance of quality and affordable services to all the residents within their jurisdiction. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} assess the financial performance of the Cape Agulhas Municipality over a period of ten years. A secondary objective was to identify factors that constrain or facilitate improved financial management in municipalities and that may have an influence on their sustainability. The focus of the study was limited to financial management aspects of the Cape Agulhas Municipality from 2003 to 2014 and was conducted at a macro or strategic level. The research is a longitudinal qualitative study as this methodology was deemed as the best to undertake in a study of this nature. The data collection process comprised of open ended semi- structured interviews with senior politicians and officials in the municipality. Financial data from the annual financial statements and the Auditor General of South Africa over the period of study were evaluated and analysed so as to produce financial ratios and establish trends. The financial data was assessed against the financial health measures as identified by the National Treasury to determine the financial status of the municipality. Analysing the financial performance of the municipality produced information that can be used as an early warning system to mitigate further deterioration of the financial situation and inform future decisions in terms thereof. This study was useful as the findings may contribute towards effective municipal financial management and the financial sustainability of municipalities. The study makes the following findings and recommendations: The municipality experienced liquidity tensions from 2006. Although the payment ratio had been increasing over the last two years of the study, consumer debtors had been increasing and limited amounts were budgeted for the writing off of bad debt. Electricity tariff increases were significantly above the inflation rate, and salaries, wages and allowances were the largest expenditure item over the whole period of the study. In terms of provision for maintenance and repairs, these were less than half of the norm for most of the study period, and lastly the cash reserves were severely depleted from 2006 as they were used to fund long term capital projects. It is recommended that the municipality stabilises the decline in current assets and continues with the diligent implementation of its credit control policy, not only to maintain the positive collection rate but also to curb the increase in consumer debtors. In order to enhance the affordability of <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariffs</b> the municipality must perform a cost analysis of all <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariffs</b> to ensure that they are cost reflective. The organisational structure must be reviewed annually to verify that only critical and legislatively required posts are approved and budgeted for, as this is the largest expenditure item in the municipal budget. Furthermore, a comprehensive infrastructure maintenance plan must be developed to guide decisions when the budget for maintenance and repairs is considered, not only to ensure that this budget item is closer to the national norm but that it is spent on and tracked to infrastructure with the highest priority. The municipality needs to develop and approve a long term financial plan with its related policies to curb the further decline of its cash reserves and which includes a capital funding mix that is aligned to the useful life of the infrastructure to be financed...|$|E

At the same time socio-economic factors as prerequisites for the development of housing sector of city and region economy in special scientific literature are remained out of sufficient attention, hampering the process of monitoring and forecasting regional trends and defining the prospects of creating conditions for public-private partnership in the housing sector.

40|$|This Volume {{records the}} {{activities}} of the PICR User Cost Surveys Group which conducted a large vehicle operating cost survey in Central, Western and Southern Brazil during the period 1975 to 1981. The Group was responsible for the collection and analysis of vehicle maintenance parts and labor costs, tire costs, depreciation and interest charges, and drivers' salaries. In addition, fuel consumption and speed data were collected, the latter when easily available, to serve as consistency checks on the equations derived from experimental data. The Group was also responsible for collecting data on surface roughness, as well as vertical and horizontal geometry characteristics of the routes of those operators registered in the survey. The primary data collection phase ran from 1975 to 1979. and 26 staff members were employed, comprising 14 field workers, 8 clerical assistants and 4 supervisors. More than two years was spent in developing and testing appropriate methodologies, documentation and data p. rocessing systems for the collection, checking,. storage and analysis of both operating cost and highway characteristic data. Contact was made with over 300 companies and more than 2500 vehicles were regis tered for survey membership. Operating cost data were then collected on_ a regular basis from company records. Many difficulties had to be overcome during this period. A number of companies only had records of a few cost components and, where possible, assistance was givento provide the necessary documentation and training to collect missing items. Some companies dropped out of the survey and data collection in others was discontinued because the route characteristics of their vehicles were found to be redundant {{to the needs of the}} PICR. Finally, data on over 1600 vehicles derived from 132 companies were available in for preliminary analysis. 1979 Highway characteristics were collected using two specially instrumented vehicles. Roughness was measured with a Maysmeter and calibration maintained through a GM Profilometer and Quarter-Car~Simulator which generated a se~ies of profile~ for a calibration course of highway sections established near Brasflia. Vertical geometry w~s measured using a linear accelerometer connected to a panel scale capable of recording grade changes + of - 1 % + to - 12 %. Horizontal measurements were taken from a standard aircraft directional gyro compass, mounted in the survey vehicles. Over 85, 000 km of roughness and geometry data were collected after measuring more than 36, 000 km of operators' routes. After. editing, these data had then to be combined with the vehicle operating cost data so that a single file comprising both dependent and independent variables could be made available for analy~is. The second PICR Phase covered the period 1980 to 1981. The staff was reduced to 5, who were principally engaged in conducting more detailed analyses. The statistical methods employed were rationalized into distinct groups of techniques and advanced econometric procedures employed. An important technique which provided a number of the equations reported herein was the generalized least squares estimation of the error ~omponent model. The latter considers. the company specific error term and the vehicle specific error term which jointly form the components of the unknown random error term consider~d by ordinary least squares techniques. This is one of the first reported application of error components analysis in the field of transportation stu - dies. All the different techniques are detailed in the analysis pro - cedures section of this Volume. The analyst was able to run a selec - tion of these techniques simultaneously on any data set. This made comp~rison of the results and the choice of recommended equations an easier task. Vehicle operating cost information presented for analysis cover the full range of vehicles operating on Brazilian highways. These are grouped into cars_. utility vehicles, buses, medium trucks and heavy articulated vehicles for analysis purposes. The results of the anal - yses of fuel consumption, oil and grease consumption, maintenance parts and labor, tire consumption, depreciation and interest charges and vehicle speed are presented. All five vehicles classes are used in the analyses except for speed which is restricted to cars and buses, and tire costs which are analysed by tire size. The equations recommended in this Volume concentrate on estimating roughness, vehicle age, vehicle characteristics (where appropriate) and geometry effects only when these appear unambiguous. A substantial amount of time was spent estimating the effect of geometry on the various operating cost items and details on the progress made are given in both main text and selected appendices. It is clear that more time is needed to resolve th~ issue. Further small analyses,. together with the findings of the operating cost study in India, presently being analysed, may result in the emergence of a more coherent pattern of the geometry effect on user costs. The PICR User Survey data are the most comprehensive collec~ ed to date and are important both to Brazil, where out-of-date cost tables are widely used and the international research community~ where they. complement the Kenya. Caribbean and India studies. The PICR survey data covers a spectrum of vehicle types and appears to be the only study with a full range of truck classes. The data have now passed through several phases of analysis and the results presented in this Volume. together with the relevant technical memoranda, can be regarded as an interim final form. They are now ready for extensive evaluation in a variety of economic exercises. When they have passed these tests they can be viewed as being in final form for the period ending December 31, 1981. Comparistins are made between total operating costs predict - ed from the various equations recommended in this Volume and prevail - ing transport service <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The results are encouraring and give confidence to the view that the recommended equations will provide better predictions of vehicle operating costs than anything currently used in Brazil. It is recommended that a user cost manual be prepared to allow the results of the PICR survey to be widely disseminated.

The study applies the model of transfer pricing incentive of Swenson (2001) by employing generalised method of moments (GMMs) to {{examine the effect of}} income tax <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on the setting of transfer prices in ten commodity groups of multinationals operating in Vietnam during the period of 2008 - 2013. The study concludes a positive correlation between changes of transfer pricing incentives and changes of reported transfer prices. Furthermore, the findings also show that increases in Vietnamese income tax rate lead to decreases in income tax rate in the headquartered country of parent firms, or Vietnamese tariff rate. Additionally, the level of reported transfer prices of imports from the parent firm to its affiliates in Vietnam will increase the majority of investigated commodity groups (except motor vehicles). transfer pricing incentives; tariff rates; income tax rates; generalised method of moments; GMM; Vietnam; transfer prices; multinational corporations; MCNs; multinationals; parent firms; affiliates...|$|R
25|$|Despite scarce {{resources}} in many Mexican regions water consumption is {{at a high}} level, partly favored by poor payment <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> low <b>tariffs.</b> In 2006, more than three quarters (76.8%) was used for agriculture, while public supply only used up 13.9%, the remainder being used by thermal power station (5.4%) and industry (3.8%). In 2006, all in all 77.3 billion m3 were consumed in Mexico, of which 10.7 billion m3 were used for domestic consumption. This means that the average domestic use per capita and day was 270 litres.|$|R

The {{balance of trade}} is primarily influenced by the real exchange <b>rate,</b> aggregate demand <b>and</b> <b>tariff</b> changes.
