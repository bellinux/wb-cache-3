40|$|Existing {{approaches}} to data <b>path</b> <b>allocation</b> in highlevel synthesis use a binding {{model in which}} values are assigned to the same register for their entire lifetimes.

We have developed the Hybrid algorithm which either selects or <b>rejects</b> an edgedisjoint <b>path,</b> depending on the length of that path. We show using simulations that the algorithm performs significantly better (up to ~ 1, 300 %) than the consistent selection or rejection of edge-disjoint paths, and it performs comparably with (and in some cases even better than) an algorithm that makes lightpath selections dynamically based on the current network state...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for performing routing in three-stage {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) switches which feature multiple channels between the switch modules in adjacent stages. The method is suited to hardware implementation using parallelism to achieve a very short execution time. This allows cell-level routing to be performed, whereby routes are updated in each time slot. The algorithm allows a contention-free routing to be performed, so that buffering is not required in the intermediate stage. An algorithm with this property, which preserves the cell sequence, {{is referred to as}} a <b>path</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm. A detailed description of the necessary hardware is presented. This hardware uses a novel circuit to count the number of cells requesting each output module, it allocates a path through the intermediate stage of the switch to each cell, and it generates a routing tag for each cell, indicating the path assigned to it. The method of routing tag assignment described employs a nonblocking copy network. The use of highly parallel hardware reduces the clock rate required of the circuitry, for a given-switch size.

40|$|Abstract. The advice {{complexity}} of an online {{problem is a}} measure of how much knowledge of the future an online algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain competitive ratio. We determine the advice {{complexity of}} hard online problems such as Online Independent Set, Online Vertex Cover and Online Disjoint <b>Path</b> <b>Allocation.</b> These problems are hard since a single wrong answer by the online algorithm can have devastating consequences. We show that log 1 + (c− 1) c− 1 cc n = Θ(n/c) bits of advice are necessary and sufficient (up to a lower-order term) to achieve a strict competitive ratio of c for each of these problems. This is done by introducing a new string guessing problem related to that of Böckenhauer et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 2014). It turns out that this gives a powerful but easy-to-use method for providing both upper and lower bounds on the advice complexity of an entire class of online problems. Previous results of Halldórsson et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 2002) on Online Independent Set, in a related model, implies that the advice complexity of the problem is Θ(n/c). Our results improve on this by providing an exact formula for the higher-order term. Böckenhauer et al. (ISAAC 2009) gave a lower bound of Ω(n/c) and an upper bound of O((n log c) /c) on the advice complexity of Online Disjoint <b>Path</b> <b>Allocation.</b> We improve on the upper bound by a log c factor.
