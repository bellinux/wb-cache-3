40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{civil and}} ecclesiastical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Pula, {{in this article}} author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages one <b>of</b> them is mentioned two times at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times {{in the seventeenth century}} and eight times in the eighteenth century. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times in the seventeenth century and eight times in the eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely recorded in the sources, too – only 11 times. In <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages they are not mentioned at all, but in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decea-sed <b>the</b> most <b>of</b> them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased only two times (both in the eighteenth century), and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (in the nineteenth century). Similarly, in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is recorded. By the same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased (in the mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (in the nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased in the mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century and three times in <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased, 11 notes in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> baptisms, and two times in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy confi rmation and in <b>the</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriages.
