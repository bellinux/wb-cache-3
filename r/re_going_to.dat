In fact, sometime around 2042, spending on the entitlement programs alone is projected to consume all federal revenues, leaving nothing for any other purposes. Nor do I believe it is politically possible to rein in the growth of the entitlement programs sufficiently to dispense with the need for a VAT. The best chance to do that was health care reform, but it was missed because the reform did nothing to address the core incentives of both patients and doctors to order more procedures, since the doctors are still paid by procedure and the patients do not bear anything like the full cost.

40|$|Renewable energy (hereafter, RE) {{is being}} championed as a {{potentially}} significant {{new source of}} jobs and rural growth in OECD countries, and a means of addressing environmental and energy security concerns. In most countries, governments have invested large amounts of public money to support RE development and are requiring significant quantities of it to be sold by energy providers. But what are the economic impacts of these policies and investments? Can RE really help to develop rural economies? These {{are some of the}} questions explored by this report, which presents the results of a two-year study of the impact of RE on rural development. Drawing on case studies in 16 regions across Europe and North America, it finds that while RE indeed represents an opportunity for stimulating economic growth in hosting communities, it also requires a complex and flexible policy framework and a long-term strategy. <b>RE</b> is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create lot of jobs, but rather some additional employment opportunities in rural areas. Making a positive connection between RE development and local economic growth will require more coherent strategies, the right set of local conditions, and a place-based approach to deployment. What does renewable energy offer rural areas? The global deployment of RE has been expanding rapidly. For instance, the RE electricity sector grew by 26 % between 2005 and 2010 globally and currently provides about 20 % of the world’s total power (including hydro-power). Rural areas attract a large part of investment related to renewable energy deployment, tending to be sparsely populated but with abundant sources of RE.

40|$|A {{variety of}} methods is {{necessary}} to solve the many bird damage problems that occur in agriculture and other fields of interest. It is apparent that no one method {{can be used to}} provide answers for all damage situations; each problem and problem area is unique and requires thorough knowledge and investigation before intelligent measures of bird control can be applied. Thus, basic research in the laboratory and initial field studies are necessary to arrive at the most safe, efficient, and economical method of bird damage control possible for each situa-tion. The use of chemicals for damage control {{is one of the major}} approaches in solving bird damage problems, and personnel of the Denver Wildlife Research Center rely heavily on this line of attack. The following is a resume of the various chemical agents that (1) are in the initial phases of investigation and show promise, and (2) are nearing the final stages of research and hopefully will become operational.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{senseless}} things to do is re-inventing the wheel. Still, how do you know, {{what is going on}} in the field of agricultural research in the world around you, your region, your country or even abroad? Secondly, doing research, requires access to reliable information, either from previous or new research. Information management, including libraries, research journals and databases, are essential for research organisations but also for politicians and planners, who need to know what research to support, expand, copy or abolish. Nonetheless, in recent years the research budgets especially in the developing countries have been declining and libraries and other information processing activities faced paradoxically the first and heaviest budget cuts. An extra reason and challenge to organise information storage, distribution and overall management as efficient as possible. Knowing where you are going accommodates a rich variety in concepts, examples and methodologies to achieve this. Small wonder that technologies, such as geographical information systems and new information and communication technologies, receive ample attention. The first part is specifically written for the research manager and explains how to establish a Management Information System, which is practically illustrated with cases in Ghana, Uganda, Zambia and Latin American countries. The second part is for the information manager and is more technical of nature and deals with information and computer science, and new technologies.
