5|$|The round ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride the ray. The round ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{small groups}} of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow the rising tide onto sandy flats to root for small benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of its beauty and size, the bluespotted ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> caught incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, {{and beach}} seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> limited by {{how difficult it is to}} handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> born on May 8, 1842 in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. His father, Adam <b>Ray,</b> <b>was</b> {{a member}} of the Wisconsin State Assembly. An uncle, George Augustus <b>Ray,</b> <b>was</b> also a member. On April 22, 1889, Ray married Ada Blackman. He died in 1911.|$|R
50|$|Anticrepuscular rays or antisolar <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to}} crepuscular rays, but seen {{opposite}} {{the sun in}} the sky. Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> near-parallel, but appear to converge at the antisolar point because of linear perspective. Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> most frequently visible near sunrise or sunset. Crepuscular <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> usually much brighter than anticrepuscular <b>rays.</b> This <b>is</b> because for crepuscular rays, seen {{on the same side}} of the sky as the sun, the atmospheric light scattering and making them visible is taking place at small angles (see Mie theory).|$|R

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> {{an ambush}} predator that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision {{is of little}} importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|While timid and {{innocuous}} towards humans, the bluespotted ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> {{capable of}} inflicting an excruciating wound with its venomous tail spines. Its attractive appearance and relatively small size {{has resulted in}} its being the most common stingray found in the home aquarium trade. However, it seldom fares well in captivity and very few hobbyists are able to maintain one for long. Many specimens refuse to feed in the aquarium, and even seemingly healthy individuals often inexplicably die or stop feeding. A higher degree of success has been achieved by public aquariums and a breeding project is maintained by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (for example, a total of 15 pups were born at Lisbon Oceanarium from 2011 to 2013). The bluespotted ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> utilized as food in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia; it is captured intentionally or incidentally using gillnets, longlines, spears, and fence traps.|$|E

Ray Ferrier is a divorced crane operator longshoreman {{who works at a}} dock in Brooklyn, New York and lives in Bayonne, New Jersey. <b>Ray</b> <b>is</b> estranged from his children. His former wife, Mary Ann, later drops off the children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie, at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in Boston. Unexplained changes in the weather occur, including lightning that strikes multiple times {{in the middle of an}} intersection and disrupts all electricity.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting shallow, sandy areas near rocky reefs, the Japanese sleeper <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> a bottom-dwelling {{predator}} of invertebrates. Like {{other members}} of its family, it can produce a strong electric shock from its electric organs for defensive purposes. Females give live birth to litters of up to five pups. The gestating young are sustained at first by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Vulnerable, due to its susceptibility to trawl fisheries that operate intensively throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Other {{common names}} {{used for this}} species include bluespotted ray, bluespotted fantail ray, bluespotted lagoon ray, bluespotted stingray, fantail ray, lesser fantail ray, lagoon ray, reef ray, ribbon-tailed stingray, and ribbontail stingray. Morphological {{examination}} {{has suggested that the}} bluespotted ribbontail <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> more closely related to the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched fantail ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.|$|E

Spines are generally stiff, sharp and unsegmented. <b>Rays</b> <b>are</b> generally soft, flexible, segmented, and may be branched. This segmentation of <b>rays</b> <b>is</b> the main difference that distinguishes them from spines; spines may be flexible in certain species, but never segmented.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ray</b> Krebbs <b>was</b> born on October 19, 1945 in Emporia, Kansas. His alleged father, Amos Krebbs, {{left him}} and his mother, Margaret Hunter Krebbs, when <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> three years old. At age 15, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> sent off to Dallas and to the Southfork Ranch with a letter from his {{recently}} deceased mother asking Jock Ewing to help Ray out. Ray's mother, a United States Army Air Corps nurse, was a woman with whom Jock Ewing had an affair during World War II. At the time when Ray arrived on Southfork, both Jock Ewing and Miss Ellie Ewing knew that <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of the}} same woman whom Jock had an affair with in Britain during the war, but they did not know at that time that <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> Jock's son.|$|R
5|$|Ray <b>Ray</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. It was released October 5, 2004, by his record label, Pookie Entertainment. After being dropped from Universal Records, Saadiq formed the label and recorded the album. He pursued a 1970s-inspired musical direction that was looser than his 2002 debut album, Instant Vintage, and produced Ray Ray with Michael Angelo, Jake and the Phatman, and Kelvin Wooten.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian and Tasmanian subpopulations of the crossback stingaree differ {{markedly}} in habitat {{preferences and}} merit further taxonomic investigation, {{according to the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related to the}} yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). In addition to morphological similarities, the two may also hybridize (see below) and, in a 2007 study of 388 fishes by Robert Ward and Bronwyn Holmes, were the only species that could not be distinguished {{on the basis of their}} cytochrome c gene sequences, attesting to a close evolutionary relationship.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due {{to the fact}} that this <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them {{to the bottom of the}} seafloor with its fins. The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny teeth, with the lower jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E
50|$|Henri Becquerel himself {{proved that}} beta <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> fast electrons, while Rutherford and Thomas Royds proved in 1909 that alpha {{particles}} are ionized helium.

5|$|The finless sleeper <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It {{is a potential}} bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> caught incidentally in bottom trawls, trammel nets, {{and bottom}} longlines; {{it has little}} economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common electric ray, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. A curtain of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{produced}} by the onefin electric ray can be painful, but is not substantially dangerous to humans. Though not utilized economically, this <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> frequently caught as bycatch in bottom trawls in South African waters. Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} negatively affected by water pollution from coastal development. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of specific data, while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
