40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of varying the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> between {{consecutive}} ambulatory bouts in community-based outcomes. Ambulation was assessed in 97 community-dwelling older adults (mean (SD) age 69. 2 (7. 7) years) using an accelerometer (activPAL™) worn on the upper thigh for 7 consecutive days. The volume, pattern and variability of ambulation were calculated over a range of maximum <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> (1 – 30 s). Outcomes with a maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> from 1 to 6 s did not vary due to device functionality. Non-linear regression (power law, r 2 > 0. 99) showed that increasing the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> from 6 to 30 s resulted in changes in volume (increased duration spent walking, and decreased number of bouts), variability (S 2 increased) and pattern (α decreased), and a linear relationship with an increase in average bout length. With a MRP of 6 s, 6 % of the cohort achieved the public health guidelines of 150 min of ambulation/week accumulated in bouts ≥ 10 min, which increased to 40 % using a maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> of 30 s. Modifying the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> impacts on volume, pattern and variability measures of community based ambulation, and attainment of public health guidelines. This highlights the need for standardised algorithms to aid interpretation and explicit reporting of the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> to aid comparison between studies...|$|R

This could be tested at a pre-clinical stage with dynamic loading experiments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of <b>resting</b> <b>periods,</b> which are a considerable part of the daily activity cycle, on the migration characteristics of femoral cemented stems. Ten polished Exeter stems were implanted in composite femurs and loaded either with a continuous load or a discontinuous load. Continuous loading involved 345, 600 loading cycles at 1 Hz, whereas the discontinuous loading involved loading at 1 Hz for 2. 5 hours and a <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> of 21. 5 hours for a period of four days. Hence, a total of 36, 000 loading cycles were applied to these reconstructions. The subsidence patterns of the prostheses were considerably affected by the <b>resting</b> <b>periods.</b> The prostheses exhibited a step-wise migration pattern with migration steps of about 50 microns after every <b>resting</b> <b>period,</b> whereas the continuously loaded prostheses showed a more gradual migration pattern. The final subsidence of the specimens when loaded with <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> was significantly less than the subsidence measured without <b>resting</b> <b>periods.</b> However, these specimens were loaded with fewer loading cycles. If this was taken into account, the discontinuously loaded specimens had a four fold higher average migration per loading cycle than the specimens that were loaded continuously. In conclusion, the <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> had a considerable effect on the migration patterns, which should be realized when these stems are analyzed with pre-clinical tests...|$|R

The offensive was launched on February 28, and the 9th smashed across the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact, and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored Division minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on March 7, 1945. The division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated. The Division drove on to Frankfurt {{and then turned to}} assist in the closing of the Ruhr Pocket. In April it continued east, encircled Leipzig and secured a line along the Mulde River. The division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on V-E Day in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his <b>rest</b> <b>period.</b> His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

5|$|After the {{crossing}} was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps. The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of Mutzig. These forts {{had been designed}} by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1893 to block access to the plain of Alsace. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the Maginot Line defenses. During this time much of the division's artillery assets were attached to the 44th Infantry Division to provide additional support. The 45th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Robert T. Frederick, who had previously commanded the 1st Special Service Force, was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year's Day. From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the Moder River. It sent half of its artillery to support the 70th Infantry Division. On 17 February the division was pulled off the line for rest and training. Once this <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory. The 45th moved north to the Sarreguemines area and smashed through the Siegfried Line, on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th. The advance continued, with Aschaffenburg falling on 3 April, and Nuremberg on the 20th. The division crossed the Danube River on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. The division captured Munich {{during the next two}} days, occupying the city until V-E Day and the surrender of Germany. During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and camps for the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during its almost two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men. The division was then slated to move to the Pacific theater of operations to participate in the invasion of mainland Japan on the island of Honshu, but these plans were scrubbed before the division could depart after the surrender of Japan, on V-J Day.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the nitrogen transforming bacterial communities within a partially saturated vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland (VF) treating urban wastewater in southern Brazil. The VF had a surface area of 3144 m 2, and was divided into four wetland cells, out of which two were operated while the other two rested, alternating cycles of 30 days. The nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial communities were characterized in wetland cell 3 (764 m 2 surface area) over a period of 12 months by using the FISH technique. Samples were collected monthly (from Feb 2014 to Feb 2015) from different layers within the vertical profile, during operation and <b>rest</b> <b>periods,</b> comprising a total of 6 sampling campaigns while the cell was in operation and another 6 when the cell was at rest. This wetland cell operated with an average organic loading rate (OLR) of 4 g COD m- 2 d- 1 and a hydraulic loading rate of 24. 5 mm d- 1. The <b>rest</b> <b>periods</b> of the wetland cell presented influences on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (8 % and 3 % for feed and <b>rest</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) (5 % and 2 % for feed and <b>rest</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively). However, there was no influence of the <b>rest</b> <b>periods</b> on the denitrifying bacteria. AOB were only identified in the top layer (AOB ß-proteobacteria) in both operational and <b>rest</b> <b>periods.</b> On the other hand, the NOB (Nistrospirae and Nitrospina gracilis) were identified in feed periods just in the top layer and during <b>rest</b> <b>periods</b> just in the intermediate layer. The denitrifying bacteria (Pseudomonas spp. and Thiobacillus denitrificans) were identified from the intermediate layer downwards, and remained stable in both periods.
