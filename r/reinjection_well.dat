In addition to providing all of the domestic heating needs of the facility (with {{the exception of the}} laundry facility, as well as a few dishwashers which still require natural gas), the wells provide some of the cooling for the facility. Completion of the project was in early 2010. [...] A <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> had already been constructed on the property just west of the marquee during a prior expansion. An additional <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> was also constructed to the south of the existing reinjection site, at the far southeastern corner of the resort's property (the most recent well is at the northwest corner of the property), allowing for the maximum possible distance between the extraction and reinjection sites. The Peppermill was planned to be the only hotel in the United States for which the heating is provided solely by geothermal energy derived on their immediate property. In October 2009, the Peppermill hosted the Geothermal Resources Council (GRC) and GEA Trade Show.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Niutuozhen {{geothermal}} system, {{located in}} North China, {{is composed of}} the Jixian system dolomite reservoir and a Neogene sandstone reservoir. A three-dimensional model with 5437 elements and seven layers based on the geological and geothermal data was built using the AQUA 3 D package designed for solving flow and heat transport problems. Production history of forty five wells and pressure monitoring data from six wells were used for calibration. The calibrated model was then used to predict the geothermal system response of the geothermal field. The maximum predicted drawdown after 20 years of production without any reinjection ranged from 30 to 120 m {{in the north and}} south, respectively. The rate of drawdown was predicted to be kept at a lower level if 50 % of the produced water was reinjected into the system. Cones of depression were predicted to gradually enlarge due to an increased production rate without reinjection, but were effectively limited and even diminished with a reinjection ratio of 50 %. A maximum temperature decrease of 2. 75 °C was predicted to occur in production well A 34, located near the <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> R 3, for a production rate of 162 l/s with 50 % reinjection.

At less than one gram rock titrated, there was an observed steep increase in SiO 2 (aq) and Na+ concentrations, indicating quartz and silicate mineral dissolution from the andesitic host rock. Total molality of SiO 2 (aq) changed from 4. 74 x 10 − 5 to 6. 80 x 10 − 3 (mol/kg solution). Major dissolution occurs at lower titrated rock mass, and this likely occurs at the section of the rock near the open hole section where the condensate and host rock first interact in the reservoir.

40|$|Reinjection {{of water}} into {{fractured}} geothermal reservoirs holds potential both for improvement and degradation of total energy recovery. The replacement of reservoir fluid can mean support of placement of reservoir pressures and also more efficient thermal energy recovery, {{but at the same}} time the premature invasion of reinjected water back into production wells through high permeability fractures can reduce discharge enthalpy and hence deliverability and useful energy output. Increases in reservoir pressure and maintenance of field output have been observed in operating fields, but unfortunately so too have premature thermal breakthroughs. The design of reinjection schemes, therefore, requires careful investigation into the likely effects, using field experimentation. This paper summarizes field experience with reinjection around the world, with the intention of elucidating characteristics of possible problems.

This research is aimed to study the reservoir character after 20 years of exploitation and to investigate the effect of reinjection as a artificial recharge for steam input {{in the future and}} also the nature of secondary processes in the reservoir using isotope geochemistry tools. The research is conducted by natural isotopes (18 O, 2 H and 3 H) analysis of many sources of water (meteoric, cold spring, fumaroles and shallow groundwater) in the surrounding of Kamojang field and also fluid reservoir to establish fluid reservoir origins and isotopic composition. Gas analysis and isotopes monitoring on the 25 production wells have been conducted every 2 - 3 years intervals for more than 10 years to investigate the effect of exploitation to the reservoir performance. Tritium radiotracer test with 370 GBq (10 Ci) activity was conducted at the KMJ 15 <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> to determine qualitatively and quantitatively the flow of reinjection water to its surrounding producing well (KMJ 11, 14, 17, 18, 26, 17 and 30). Data interpretation and evaluation to determine reinjection water mass recovery and cooling prediction modeling were conducted using ICEBOX program package (TRINV and TRCOOL). Interpretation and evaluation of data concluded that reservoir fluid of Kamojang geothermal field was originated from meteoric water which infiltrated through fault structures at elevation of 1350 m – 1650 m above sea level. There {{is no evidence that the}} fluid was originated from magmatic water. Reservoir fluid moved both laterally and vertically (deep fluid) with lateral fluid movement from west to the east. The isotope data analysis indicated there is water entry in west-northwest reservoir boundary. Water entry gradually moved from northwest to the southeast (through wells of KMJ 42, 40, 27, 26 and 28).

40|$|One of the {{guidelines}} {{established for the}} safe and efficient management of the Palinpinon Geothermal Field is to adopt a production and well utilization strategy such that the rapid rate and magnitude of reinjection fluid returns leading to premature thermal breakthrough would be minimized. To help achieve this goal, sodium fluorescein and radioactive tracer tests have been conducted to determine the rate and extent of communication between the reinjection and producing sectors of the field. The first objective {{of this paper is}} to show how the results of these tests, together with information on field geometry and operating conditions were used in algorithms developed in Operations Research to allocate production and reinjection rates among the different Palinpinon wells. Due to operational and economic constraints, such tracer tests were very limited in number and scope. This prevents obtaining information on the explicit interaction between each <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> and the producing wells.

Since the beginning of exploitation until today, all the deep thermal fluids produced during the generation of electricity have been injected back to the reservoir.

40|$|The use of Ground Water Heat Pumps (GWHPs) for {{the heating}} and cooling of {{buildings}} has been increasing in recent years due to the sustainability and economic convenience of this technology. One {{of the most critical}} design issues of these systems is the formation of a thermal plume downstream the <b>reinjection</b> <b>well,</b> which can be captured by the abstraction well, thus impairing the energy efficiency of the system. Some analytical models have been already developed to simulate this phenomenon, but they require an imposed injection well temperature, which should be know a priori. With this assumption, the thermal power exchanged with groundwater diminishes with time, due to the thermal alteration of the extracted water. A numerical code called TRS (Thermal Recycling Simulator) was therefore developed to consider a constant temperature difference between the injection and the abstraction well, and hence a constant thermal load, which is a more realistic modelling assumption for GWHPs. The code is based on the potential flow theory and it has been validated against coupled flow and heat transport simulations with FEFLOW. TRS is freely available at www. polito. it/groundwater/software/TRS. html and works in MATLAB environment. An empirical formula, which describes the time evolution of the extracted water temperature, has also been derived from a series of simulations with TRS.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{geothermal}} energy, that is, energy emitted continuously {{in the form of}} heat from our planet, that from the deepest areas propagates towards the surface. The research activities have been carried out for evaluating different aspects related to geothermal energy and more specifically the way in which this energy can be extracted. The present work has tried to deal with all the different levels of temperature in which the geothermal energy is classified, i. e. low temperature, medium temperature and high temperature, as hereafter described more in detail. Geothermal Energy low temperature: this energy is transferred by means of ground heat exchangers coupled with a heat pump. In this case usually the heat transfer fluid can be water or a mixture containing water and an antifreeze fluid. In the frame of this technology first the characteristics of a GRT (ground response test) has been tested, in order to check the accuracy of the method to evaluate the average temperature of the ground, as well as to determine the thermal conductivity of the soil and the overall coefficient of linear heat exchange between the transfer fluid and the soil. The accuracy of the GRT has been evaluated for different sizes of the grout (an usual ground heat exchanger and a pile) as well as for different velocities of the aquifer. The simulations have been carried out by means of a Finite Element Method (FEM) software. Then the FEM has been used for evaluating the energy and structural analysis on piles foundations when they are used as ground heat exchangers. The work has shown the combined effect of structural loads in heating and cooling periods. The results are in agreement to the theory as well as to results carried out by measurements which have been found in literature. Finally a study for comparing different heat pumps and different fluids in the ground heat exchangers has been carried out in mild climates. The work shows the benefits of using pure water as heat transfer fluid in almost all conditions, since in mild climates the temperature of the ground is around 14 °C and usually heat pumps are used for both heating and cooling, thus allowing the ground to be regenerated over one year. The use of flooded evaporators in the heat pumps will allow the ground heat pumps to be more attractive in the next future. Geothermal Energy medium temperature: in this case the ATES (Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage) has been investigated. ATES is a particular type of thermal storage which uses water from the subsoil where the groundwater can vary between 15 °C and 130 °C. The extraction and reinjection wells should be sufficiently distant in order to avoid short-circuits. This technology could be used also for low temperature aquifers; in this case the water of the aquifer is used for cooling the condenser during summertime, while it is cooled down in winter time to transfer heat to the evaporator. The wells are used alternatively in order to accumulate a cold storage during winter time and a warm storage during summer time. The work of the present thesis has focused on the thermal influence of the <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> on the undisturbed temperature conditions along the aquifer, depending on the thickness of the aquifer. Results of a FEM model have been compared to the analytical solution of various authors (Carslaw and Jaeger, Lauwerier, Ghassemi). The goal is to evaluate the distance between the two wells in order to prevent thermal interference, {{as a function of the}} thickness of the aquifer. Geothermal Energy high temperature: it allows to extract dry and superheated steam without liquid phase (in this case they are called "dominant steam systems") or liquid water mixed with steam (in this case they are called "water-dominated systems"). The usual depth of these systems is between 3 km and 15 km in correspondence of magmatic intrusions. For these systems the thesis has the aim to study the heat exchange between the rock and hot water, considering the variation of the outlet temperature of the water as a function of time. These studies were developed at first considering a single fracture in the rock, then we moving to a more realistic model consisting in a multi rock-fracture. The model proposed in literature based on analytical methods have been compared with a FEM mathematical model. The models have been then applied to a site in the Philippines where experimental data were availabl...|$|E

The experiments were done in four stages: the first stage comprised of tests with different flows of separated water at 70 °C, the second stage {{was carried out by}} mixing the separated water at 70 °C and the seal water with different amounts of the seal water, the third and the fourth stages were like the first and second but with the separated water at 120 °C. The results show that this method is good if the mixture is around 50 / 50 separated water and seal water, to control the silica scaling in the separated water {{and to be able to}} reinject the seal water with the separated water. This does not eliminate the silica scaling in all of the separated water because the amount of separated water is much more than the amount of seal water that comes from the plant. ...|$|R
40|$|The International Workshop on Deposition of Solids in Geothermal systems {{was held}} in August 1988. Papers were {{presented}} on field and laboratory studies of scale deposition from geothermal fluids and in geothermal reservoirs. Scale types investigated included carbonate minerals, amorphous silicates, and mixed metal oxides and sulfides. Scale formation was reported to occur in geothermal systems under {{a wide range of}} enthalpy and chemical conditions. The predominant factors found to control the solubility of scale-forming minerals include changes in temperature and pH with lesser control being exerted by the concentrations of other ionic species and by kinetic effects. The range of conditions under which scale mineral formation occurs has resulted in the deposition of these minerals throughout the geothermal utilization system including production wells, surface equipment, and wastewater <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells.</b> Chemical and engineering methods applied to the treatment of scale-forming minerals during extraction of geothermal heat included the addition of chemical inhibitors, control of fluid pressures and temperatures, and mechanical and chemical removal of deposited scale minerals. The work reported at the conference indicated that the success of these methods was somewhat limited, and additional work was recommended on more effective methods of chemical inhibition of scale mineral deposition...|$|R
30|$|Geothermal {{water in}} Xiongxian {{has been used}} for more than 30  years, with {{reservoir}} temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 95 °C. Before 2009, the geothermal energy was exploited by local residents and industries for space heating, bathing, and greenhouse agriculture. The majority of these wells have operated without reinjection procedures, causing a 30 -m drop of the groundwater table from 2001 to 2009. In 2009, China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) made an investment in the reservoir, with the construction of 27 new production/reinjection wells, and a refurbishment of 15 existing wells. As recommended by the modeling result (Pang et al. [2014 b]), <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells</b> are constructed away from the production wells, in order to optimize the utilization efficiency and prevent preferential flows. All 42 wells are then connected to a central heating system and provide heat for the entire Xiongxian city from Nov 15 th to March 15 th every year. During the operation, the extracted reservoir water flows through multiple heat exchangers, with an average inflow temperature of 68 °C and a reinjection temperature around 35 °C. A 100 % reinjection ratio is achieved in the Xiongxian city. As a result, groundwater level has to recover, though slowly.|$|R
40|$|Asbestos-cement (Transite) pipe was {{installed}} at the Raft River Geothermal Area {{in the fall of}} 1975 and has been used extensively since. The pipe is used to transfer water from the well sites to the testing areas, reserve pits, and <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells.</b> The pipeline was designed to transport approximately 300 F water at 150 psi {{over a period of time}} for the present testing program and later, for the 5 MW(e) Raft River Pilot Plant. Numerous line failures have occurred since the original lines were installed. Due to the various causes of the line failures and the extensive downtime which has occurred because of them, further examination of Transite pipe is necessary to determine its future use as completion of the 5 MW(e) pilot plant approaches. The Conversion Technology and Engineering Branch has completed a preliminary study of the effects of S&I system transients on Transite pipe (re: OJD- 7 - 79). Recommendations are proposed to conduct further studies and tests; however, no funding is presently available due to limitations in the budget for the 5 MW(e) pilot plant project. The Mechanical Design Branch is continuing design analysis in an effort to gather information to determine maximum warmup rates for the S&I system...|$|R
