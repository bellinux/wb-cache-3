Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>bearing.</b> It has the brake around {{the outside of the}} rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} eventually {{determined that}} the rotors in the cabin pressurisation blower on number 2 engine began to break up, resulting in severe vibration that loosened the nuts securing the oil metering unit to the blower and allowed oil to escape freely. [...] The <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> {{of one of the}} rotors also came free, so the rotor gyrated, causing metal-to-metal contact and great heat. [...] The blower was located aft of the firewall, and a fire started {{in the rear of the}} nacelle when the escaping oil was ignited by contact with the hot metal in the damaged blower. The fire burned the engine control rods, preventing feathering of the propeller. [...] Burning oil flowed into the wheel bay and from there into the leading edge of the left wing, where the fire breached the wall of a fuel tank. The abundant supply of fuel caused the fire to spread throughout much of the left wing and become so intense it caused softening of aluminium alloy and loss of strength of the upper boom (or upper flange) in the wing spar. The spar was critically weakened in the region between number 1 and 2 engines.|$|E

Once installed {{it was found that}} the <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> was inaccessible and could not be repaired with the motor installed. It was difficult to inspect the armature or repair damage to the insulation. The motor was not designed to come to an immediate halt when power was disconnected, but instead would freewheel to a halt relatively slowly. Reverse power could not be applied until it had stopped moving, so it was not possible to immediately reverse the propeller in case of emergency. The motor proved so problematic that it was replaced with a smaller but more powerful Sautter-Harlé motor.|$|E

5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E

50|$|The {{double-sided}} impeller was 28.8 {{inches in}} diameter, compared to 20.68 for the Derwent I, {{to produce an}} airflow of 80 lb/s, while the overall diameter of the engine was 49.5 inches. A scaled up Derwent would have a 60-inch diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, {{an attempt was made}} to start the engine, without the inlet vanes, which had not yet been fitted. To everyone's dismay the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On the next attempt, Denis Drew unscrewed the igniter and as the starter motor ran the engine up to speed, lit the engine with an oxy-acetylene torch. The engine was run up to 4,000 lbf and more, and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. Upon Hooker's arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was satisfied to see the thrust gauge needle registering 5,000 lbf, making the B.41 the most powerful jet engine in the world. Weight was around 1,600 lb.|$|E
