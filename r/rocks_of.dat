5|$|The hill {{is formed}} in layers {{from a variety}} of {{sedimentary}} <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising {{from the edge of the}} valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.|$|E
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|All the <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Helvellyn {{are part}} of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, formed on the margin of an ancient {{continent}} during a period of intense volcanic activity during the Ordovician period, roughly 450 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The lower {{reaches of}} Kase Run lie over <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Wills Creek Formation.

5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high.

5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the granite <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Mont Blanc massif were an {{important}} source of stone for constructing buildings; one hundred Italian stonemasons were brought to the Chamonix valley by Charles Albert of Sardinia for reconstructing the towns of Sallanches and Cluses, both of which had at that time just been destroyed by fires.|$|E

5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|The Vespidae {{include the}} extinct genus Palaeovespa, seven species {{of which are}} known from the Eocene <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Florissant fossil beds of Colorado and from fossilised Baltic amber in Europe. Also found in Baltic amber are crown wasps of the genus Electrostephanus.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} of Silurian age (443–419 million years ago), the most southerly known outcrop of <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> this age in Britain.

5|$|The {{volcanic}} <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> {{which the}} mountain is made were {{formed in the}} caldera of an ancient volcano, {{many of them in}} violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years ago during the Ordovician period.
