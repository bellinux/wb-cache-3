40|$|Reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> {{teaching}} {{is very important}} for a person’s life. Reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching begins in the first class of primary education and it is delivered by classroom teachers. Classroom teachers get prepared for teaching with the “first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course” given in their undergraduate education. As the content of the course is analyzed, first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching has three theoretical credit hours per week. It is indicated that exercises {{should be included in the}} content of the course, however, the exercises stay in the university environment <b>and</b> a real <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> exercise cannot be realized. Based on this fact, the purpose of this study is to state that <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course should not be theoretical, contrarily, it should be exercises based. The study conducts an action research to achieve this purpose. Descriptive method is used in the research to establish the current status. In this research, to determine the factors which affect the success of methodology in the content of first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course of classroom teaching departments, one of the qualitative research methods, a semistructured interview technique is applied. Reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> {{teaching is}} realized in Tokat city, central district by using voice based sentence method on 40 adults who knew neither reading nor writing. The population of the research is composed of 40 junior students of classroom teaching department who taught <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> to 40 adults and 30 students who were enrolled to theoretical <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course. Students, who participated in the first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching exercise, indicate that they feel more comfortable about <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching, from now on, they know what to do, and they assert that applied <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching is more useful. Those students who are enrolled to theoretical first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> course state that they know what they are going to do, however, they do not know how to teach <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>and</b> they denote that this course should absolutely have an integration of theoretical and applied concepts. Based on these findings of the research, the first <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> teaching course of classroom teaching program should be 3 credit hours, with 1 hour theoretical, 2 hours applied content, and if required it should be 6 credit hours over 2 semesters.

The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>write</b> operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>write</b> operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Traditionally, <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> were {{addressed}} in English language teaching curricula as two discrete skills. Research has since shown that <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> have a reciprocal relationship; therefore, many <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> courses have shifted towards integrated skills instruction.
