5000|$|In {{secondary}} xylem - the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather {{than when it}} first appears - a vessel element originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a [...] "fusiform initial", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly [...] "lignified", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a vessel element have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They {{have a variety of}} shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate perforation plate (several round openings) and the <b>reticulate</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> (a net-like pattern, with many openings).|$|E

The generic {{delimitation}} of these predominantly African Psychotrieae, which is mainly based on fruit morphology, is compared with wood anatomical variation patterns.

The genus pair gaertnera/Pagamea differs obviously from the other genera and is wood anatomically clearly distinguished by the presence of fibre-tracheids and parenchyma bands. Chassalia, Chazaliella, Hymenocoleus and Psychotria have rather similar wood structure, although variation in vessel diameter, vessel arrangement, ray composition and axial parenchyma occurs.

40|$|SEM {{study of}} xylem macerations of Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn. (Parkeriaceae, or Pteridaceae, tribe Ceratopterideae) has co-occurring vessel {{elements}} and tracheids in rhizormes and probably also in roots, a condition newly reported for ferns. Vessel elements with helical thickening in the root have <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> that consist of elliptical holes in primary walls, with no thinning or discontinuation of the gyres of secondary wall bands; groups of perforations alternate with smaller zones of intact primary wall. Perforations {{of this type}} are not visible with a light microscope, and thus the <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> differ from those previously figured for vascular plants [Bailey, I. W., 1944. Am. J.

Weblike pit membranes that contain pores of various sizes are present on some <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and in the transitions between <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and intact lateral wall pitting. The presence of clearly differentiated vessels in Ceratopteris shows that vessels are present even in a submersed aquatic fern.

In Magnolia, until now, two types of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> have been reported: the conservative, scalariform and the specialized, simple one. 			 			In this paper, are presented some findings, new to magnolia wood science, like exclusively simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in some species or mixed <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> – simple and scalariform in one vessel member. Intravascular pitting is another taxonomically important trait of vascular tissue. Interesting transient states between different patterns of pitting in one cell only have been found. This proves great flexibility of mechanisms, which elaborate cell wall structure in maturing tracheary element. The comparison of this data with phylogenetic trees, based on the fossil records and plastid gene expression, clearly shows that there is a link between the type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and the degree of evolutionary specialization within Magnolia genus...|$|R

In Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae, rhizome tracheary elements are short, contorted, with numerous facets.

The rhizome tracheary elements of Cyatheaceae are like those of Dicksoniaceae, but fusiform tracheary elements like those of many fern families occur in Sadleria (Blechnaceae); this correlates with the close grouping of Cyatheaceae with Dicksoniaceae in recent phylogenies that show Blechnaceae well removed from the tree fern families Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of vestured pits in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and vestured pits. Virtually all taxa with vestured pits have simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and vestured pits, has inspired functional hypotheses that vestured pits contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas scalariform perforations may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, vestured pits {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the pit chamber may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within intervessel pits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|High vein density (DV) {{evolution}} in angiosperms represented a key functional transition. Yet, a mechanistic account {{on how this}} hydraulic transformation evolved remains lacking. We demonstrate that a consequence of producing high DV is that veins must become very small to fit inside the leaf, and that angiosperms are the only clade that evolved the specific type of vessel required to yield sufficiently conductive miniature leaf veins. From 111 species spanning key divergences in vascular plant evolution, we show, using analyses of vein conduit {{evolution in}} relation to vein packing, that a key xylem innovation associated with high DV evolution is a strong reduction in vein thickness and simplification of the <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of primary xylem vessels. Simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in the leaf xylem occurred only in derived angiosperm clades exhibiting high DV (> 12 mm mm− 2). <b>Perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in the vessels of other species, including extant basal angiosperms, consisted of resistive scalariform types that were associated with thicker veins and much lower DV.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} manuka growing in five {{different}} habitats was analysed to establish {{whether or not}} different anatomical forms exist. The study involved {{the use of the}} light microscope for obtaining vessel and fibre quantitative data such as their length, width, wall thickness, density of vessel elements in a transection and average grouping of vessels. The confocal microscope was used to measure the area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of fibriform vessels and wide vessels. The study also involved the use of the scanning electron microscope for determining the presence of cell wall sculpturing in the walls of wide vessels. The data was analysed by univariate analysis to determine any variation of wood characters within a population and between populations in the five habitats. The habitats were margins of lowland forests, swamp, sand dune, subalpine and hot thermal soils. The study has established variations within each population in all the cell types. The study showed that plants differed anatomically in the average sizes of their cell length, width, wall thickness, abundance of vessels, area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and the average grouping and the type of grouping of vessels. There was also variation of wood anatomy between populations in most cell characters except for the length of wide vessels, length of fibriform vessels and wall thickness of fibre-tracheids. In these characters the wood anatomy of manuka was more homogeneous. The significant trends were that margins of lowland forests had wide and thick walled cells in all the cell types and also had high average group of vessels and large area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of fibriform vessels and small area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> for wide vessels. It had short libriform fibres and fibre-tracheids. The swamp habitat seemed to follow margins of lowland forests except that it had the longest fibre-tracheids and libriform fibres and had the greatest area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> for wide vessels. Both of these habitats had the lowest density of wide vessels. Sand dune, hot thermal soils and subalpine habitats had on average the smallest vessels in terms of diameter and wall thickness and area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> but had high abundance or density of wide vessels. Sand dune had wide and thick walled libriform fibres like margins of lowland forests. Subalpine and hot thermal soils had comparatively small fibres in all dimensions. Even though variations were established in most of the cell characters, the correlation of wood with ecology was less pronounced as compared to that found in families and genera in past research. Significant trends were manifest in diameter, wall thickness and density of wide vessels. The margins of lowland forests and swamp (more mesic habitats) had great diameter and cell wall thickness. They also had low density of cells. The other habitats, sand dune, subalpine and hot thermal soils (less mesic habitats) had comparatively narrow diameter of wide vessels, thin cell walls and high levels of wide vessels densities. It was found that the other characters such as length, width, wall thickness of fibriform vessels, libriform fibres, and fibre-tracheids, grouping and area of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of wide vessels showed complex and overlapping ranges between the habitats and had no significant correlation with ecology.

40|$|The seven {{families}} hypothesized by Sosa and Chase {{to comprise}} Crossosomatales possess relatively long vessel elements with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting; tracheids; diffuse axial parenchyma; and heterogeneous rays. These and other primitive character {{states do not}} indicate relationships, {{but they do not}} offer any evidence against the idea that Crossosomatales are a natural order. Departures from the primitive character states are related to ecological adaptations. Crossosomataceae have simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> (scalariform brieﬂy {{at the beginning of the}} secondary xylem), a feature correlated with the seasonal aridity of habitats occupied by the family, the sole family of the order to exhibit such an ecological shift. Presence of tracheids (which confer embolism resistance to a wood) in ancestors of Crossosomataceae probably pre-adapted the family for entry into highly seasonal habitats. Minimal vessel grouping in all other genera shows that tracheid presence deters vessel grouping; tracheid presence also deters shortening of vessel elements. Autapomorphies are shown by Aphloiaceae (tracheid dimorphism, rays of two distinct widths); Crossosomataceae (<b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> predominantly simple, lateral wall pitting of vessels alternate); Geissolomataceae (wide rays); Ixerbaceae (ﬁber-tracheid tendency); Staphyleaceae (adjacence of axial parenchyma to vessels); Stachyuraceae (simpliﬁcation of perforation plates); and Strasburgeriaceae (large cell size). Although tracheid presence seems plesiomorphic in Crossosomatales, a degree of lability in density and size of bordered pits on imperforate tracheary elements probably occurs within this order and in other dicotyledon groups...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effect of date palm fibre as backing on sound {{absorption}} using three types of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and porous layers. The predicted results were verified by measurements conducted in an impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption of 30 and 50 mm-thick date palm fibre and backing that may have positive effect are elaborated in this study. It describes how the porous materials of date palm fibre absorber panel can change the absorption behavior. The results obtained show that <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> porous layers have a significant effect on absorption, whereas thickness panel have considerable effect too. This further indicate that three types have been used and also supported can be powerfully exploited to improve the absorption of date palm fibre and at the same time a reasonable thickness chosen, would be very efficient for absorption sound. An example is presented to show the approaches of enhancing the absorption, by utilizing the advantage of modification in the absorption sound. It exhibits that properly chosen perforation ratio along with suitable sample thickness can increase the absorption as well as the selected porous layers. It was evident that these can be powerfully exploited to improve the absorption of date palm fibre. Three types of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> porous layers were used to improve acoustic properties of date palm fibre.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of functionally adaptive diversification of wood {{structure in the}} course of evolution as advanced by Carlquist is critically tested for vessel member length and type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate.</b> The functional significance of within-tree variation in vessel member morphology is discussed first, and a criticism of Philipson & Butterfield’s theory for explaining classical length-on-age curves for fusiform initial length is given. At the genus and family level examples are cited which contradict the hypothesis that specialization of the <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> has a strong selective advantage for the occupation of more xeric environments or for high conductive rates. Other examples, however, seem to support this. The functional interpretation of correlations between vessel member length and ecological conditions is criticised. A comparison is made between whole woody floras or vegetation types with respect to the proportion of genera with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2). In tropical lowland rain forests the percentage of genera with scalariform plates is rather low. It strongly increases for tropical montane forests and for temperate to arctic floras. It is lowest in seasonally dry to arid regions. These trends support Carlquist’s idea that scalariform plates are, in general, only successful for conditions which require low rates of water conduction. In addition, the role of temperature is stressed. The total evidence presented in this paper is discussed in terms of random ‘patio ludens’ evolution which has to a considerable extent been canalized through selective pressures by environmental factors...|$|R

Wood anatomy for stem, root, and lignotuber is reported for the monotypic Cape genus Retzia. Stilbaceae and Retziaceae are alike in wood anatomy but differ from Verbenaceae by having scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with few and wide-bordered bars (simple plates and modified scalariform plates are also present); vessel elements clearly fibriform in shape; very scarce axial parenchyma; and long uniseriate wings on multiseriate rays. When added to endosperm presence and ericoid habit, these features may serve to segregate Stilbaceae from Verbenaceae. The wood of Stilbaceae is xeromorphic in having very narrow vessels, numerous vessels per mm 2, and pores grouped into radial multiples. The least xeromorphic wood within Stilbaceae is found in species from relatively moist montane localities; these species also have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in vessels. The most xeromorphic wood occurs in those Stilbaceae restricted to lowlands or lowlands plus dry montane sites. Scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are interpreted {{as an indicator of}} primitiveness in Stilbaceae and Retziaceae, an interpretation reinforced by presence of borders on pits of imperforate tracheary elements in Eurylobium serrulatum (all other Stilbaceae have libriform fibers with simple pits).

Several {{features in the}} secondary xylem occur consistently at the tribal level: arrangement of vessel-ray pits, distribution of axial parenchyma, ray width, and the presence and location of crystals. The primitive nature of Prionoteae and Archerieae {{is supported by the}} presence of scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with many bars and scalariform to opposite vessel pitting. The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively uniseriate rays and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with many bars, a very high vessel density and paratracheal parenchyma, although they clearly differ in ray width (exclusively uniseriate rays in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide multiseriate rays in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

Also similar in tracheary element types is Orchidaceae, now considered a member of Asparagales. Ultrastructural study of Sansevieria tracheary elements reveals intermediacy between vessel elements and tracheids because porose pit membranes extend across entire end walls of tracheids, and portions of scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of vessel elements. This correlates with longevity of roots in Sansevieria, and probable moderate transpiration rates in leaves. In Sansevieria, as in other monocotyledons, vessel type occurrence, organographic distribution, and tracheary element ultrastructure relate primarily to ecology, although molecular-based trees, in fact, help understand the patterns of shift in ecological adaptation with attendant change in tracheary element structure...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} characteristics for 21 taxa of Cassiope are reported. Qualitative features differ somewhat {{from the}} general pattern of the Ericaceae. However, considerable deviation {{is found in the}} quantitative aspects of the wood features. The stems are very slender with narrow growth rings evident in all but one species. Vessel elements are very small and usually have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with several bars. Vessels are extremely abundant in transection. Vascular rays are mostly uniseriate with a few biseriates and all are composed exclusively of erect cells. The imperforate elements are tracheids which are the only conductive elements in the late wood. Calluna-type pith is found in most of the taxa while homogeneous pith is found in two species. The recognition of these in the separate genus Harrimanella is supported. Cassiope plants are often found in moist, protected microenvironments in arctic and alpine areas of extreme cold and desiccating winds. Short growing seasons and low mean temperatures probably contribute {{in large part to the}} dwarf stature of the plants, which in turn accommodates the reduced vascular system. The tracheids provide a safe conductive system in the late wood which is less susceptible to loss of function due to air embolisms. The vessel elements with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> accommodate the presumably slow conductive rates in the earlier part of the growing season. The vessel elements of Cassiope are considerably smaller than most others known to have scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> The values for vulnerability, an indicator of the degree of vessel redundancy and hence safety, are much lower than any yet calculated for any group.

40|$|International audiencePremise of research. Piperales {{displays}} a wide diversity of growth forms {{that appears to}} be linked with differences in cambial activity and subsequent derived wood production. To date, no overall synthesis of the evolution of woodiness in Piperales has been done and few studies have proposed an ancestral habit (woody/herbaceous). We provide anatomical data of all lineages within Piperales and reconstruct ancestral character states, focusing on the origin of woodiness within the order and on the ecological significance of key anatomical features. Methodology. Stem anatomical observations with special emphasis on wood anatomical features were performed on 28 species of the Piperales; by combining previously published studies with original data, we conducted phylogenetic reconstructions of cambial activity and vessel element <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> to assess the origin of woodiness and vessel evolution in Piperales. Pivotal results. Different patterns of cambial activity are observed in Piperales, from active secondary growth in both intra- and interfascicular areas in Aristolochia, Thottea (Aristolochiaceae), Saruma (Asaraceae), Manekia, and Piper (Piperaceae) to cambial activity mainly restricted to fascicular areas in Saururaceae and a complete lack of secondary growth in Verhuellia. Vessels in Piperaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Asaraceae present simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> while those of Saururaceae are mostly scalariform. A stem endodermis bearing a Casparian band—an atypical feature in aerial stems—is reported for all genera within the Piperaceae and for Saururus and Houttuynia in the Saururaceae. Conclusions. The common ancestor of the order likely had an active cambium and woody habit, including vessel elements with simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> All woody species share several wood features, including wide and tall rays, suggesting a single origin of wood in the order. The high diversity of growth forms observed in Piperales is linked to frequent shifts in cambial activity and changes in habit-related features within the different lineage...|$|R
40|$|Olson (2014; in {{this issue}} of New Phytologist, pp. 7 – 11) {{provides}} a valid criticism of our recent commentary (Nardini & Jansen, 2013). Although we see no controversy surrounding Bailey’s functional and evolutionary ideas, we would like to pay attention in this Letter to two related concerns: (1) the integration of experimental data from the field of plant hydraulics into traditional, comparative wood anatomy; and (2) the reversibility of evolutionary transitions between <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> types that form a continuum...|$|R
40|$|Gross and {{anatomical}} {{features of}} ten wood species from North Sulawesi were observed and described. Two of them hove light colour and considerable hard, and therefore recommended for ramin substitute. They are Pangium edule and Neonauclea sp. For identification purposes several important features were noted: oil cell in Elmerillia, <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> scalariform in Elmerillia and Laplacea, vertical septum in axial parenchima strand of Serianthes, fiber septate in Pangium, Aglaia and Desoxylum. Serianthes minahassae contain fiber with best quality. It is therefore recommended for pulpwood...|$|R
40|$|Wood of Bruniaceae is very {{primitive}} {{according to}} widelyaccepted criteria. Vessels are relatively long, with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> having numerous bars, fully or vestigially bordered. Many aberrations in disposition of bars and <b>perforations</b> in <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are present, and no species has exclusively normal <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Lateral wall pitting of vessels, both intervascular and between vessels and rays, is scalariform to opposite. Vessels are solitary or nearly so, angular to round in transection. Helical thickenings {{are present in}} vessels of only a single species. All imperforate elements are thick-walled tracheids, some with gelatinous walls. Tracheids are only slightly longer (in two instances shorter) than the vessel elements they accompany in any given species. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with very slight tendencies toward aggregates or vasicentric scanty. Rays are heterocellular, with a predominance of upright cells, or upright cells exclusively in species with very narrow multiseriate rays. Multiseriate rays vary from biseriate {{to an average of}} more than five cells in width, according to species. Uniseriate wings are present on at least some multiseriate rays in all species. Borders are frequently present on the tangential walls of ray cells, which tend to be thick. U niseriate and multiseriate rays are present in all species. Growth rings vary from absent to conspicuous, the latter mostly in montane species. Inconspicuous growth rings feature narrow vessels or narrow tracheids in latewood. More pronounced growth rings have more numerous as well as wider vessels in earlywood; vessels may be absent or nearly so in latewood, which would thus constitute an all-tracheid band produced annually. Crystals are present in rays of most species, sometimes chambered in subdivided ray cells. A few species have crystals in chambered axial parenchyma cells. Droplets or massive deposits of amorphous dark-staining compounds are present in all species. Woods of Bruniaceae are exemplary, considering their primitiveness, for adaptation to xeromorphy, based on current concepts of wood xeromorphy. Vessels are notably narrow or numerous per mm 2 of transection, or both. The nature of growth rings and of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> modifications are suggestive of xeromorphy. Although species of moister habitats do have quantitatively more mesomorphic wood features, the span within Bruniaceae is not great, suggesting that wood of the family as a whole is adapted to extremes of water stress in accordance with the dry, hot summers, high incidence of wind, and porous sandstone soils of Cape Province, South Africa. Lignotubers have woods more parenchymatous and mesomorphic than wood of stems in the lignotuber- bearing species. Wood of stems does not differ appreciably from that of roots. Bruniaceous woods are most closely comparable to those of Geissolomataceae and Grubbiaceae, although other 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 families have similar woods. This agrees with the 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 placement accorded Bruniaceae by most phylogenists...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Calligonum mongolicum Turcz. was {{described}} from an ecological perspective. This species showed similar wood structure to that species {{published in the}} same genus [1]. This species has distinct growth ring boundaries, ring-porosity, distinct helical thickenings, simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> nonseptate fibre, axial parenchyma, uni- or 2 - 5 -seriate heterogeneous rays, and alternate intervessel pitting. It was observed {{that there is a}} slightly increase of fibre length as the diameter from the pith increases. However, the vessel element length remained more or less constant from pith to bark. Furthermore, the relationships between anatomical features and adaptability to desert environments were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{wood of the}} Atherospermataceae {{from the}} upper Cretaceous of James Ross Island, Antarctica, is {{described}} {{for the first time}} and represents the earliest record of this family in the Southern Hemisphere. The specimens are characterised by diffuse porous arrangement of vessels, scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> scalariform and opposite intervessel pitting and predominantly multiseriate rays which occasionally bear low, uniseriate margins. Despite anatomical conformity at the familial level, the fossil woods are not identical to any one extant genus and have therefore been assigned to the fossil organ genus, Laurelites Nishida, Nishida et Nasa, with which the fossils show greatest similarity...|$|R
40|$|Early {{angiosperms}} are hypothesized as constrained to wet environments {{where many}} of their defining characteristics evolved. A functional capability potentially enforcing the wet habitation of early angiosperms was possession of xylem with low hydraulic capability and drought intolerance. Recent studies indicate that a structural hallmark of these performances is long, steeply angled scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in extant basal angiosperms. However, Canella winterana (Canellaceae), a magnoliid, appears to have radiated into much drier tropical dry forest habitats despite possessing a wood vasculature structurally similar to hypothesized ancestral wet-adapted system for angiosperms as a whole. Based on a field study of Canella wood hydraulic function, we present ecophysiological data that basal vessels do not necessarily mark low resistance to drought. We found that Canella wood was resistant to drought-induced cavitation. Leaf hydraulic capacity as well as leaf pressure-volume relations and leaf water potential minima found for Canella were comparable {{to some of the}} most drought-tolerant tropical dry forest angiosperms. Thus, our results suggest that vessels of an ancestral design can be exported to dry environments. We found that scalariform-plated vessels in Canella were associated with low hydraulic capacities at the xylem and whole shoot-scales as well as limited plasticity of the xylem to varying hydrodynamic demand. Consequently, our results support the hypothesis that evolution of simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> not vessels per se, represented a critical adaptation for producing large hydraulic gains during angiosperm evolution across a broader range of environments...|$|R
40|$|Early {{desiccation}} {{limits the}} vase life of Acacia cut flowers and foliage {{and may be}} attributable to poor hydraulic conductivity (K-h) of the cut stems. Acacia holosericea A. Cunn. ex G. Don has been adopted as the test species to investigate the postharvest water relations of the genus Acacia. To understand potential constraints on K-h, xylem conduits in cut A. holosericea stems were anatomically characterised by light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessels with simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and tracheids were the principal water conducting cells. Bordered vestured intervessel pits were present in xylem vessel elements. The majority of conduits (89 %) were short at 1 - 5 cmlong. Only 2 % were 15 - 16 cmin length. Mean xylem conduit diameter was 77 +/- 0. 9 mu m and the diameter profile showed a normal distribution, with 29 % of diameters {{in the range of}} 70 - 80 mu m. Simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> can offer relatively low resistance to water flow. On the other hand, bordered vestured pits and short xylem conduits can confer comparatively high resistance to water flow. Overall, the presence of bordered vestured pits, together with a high proportion of short xylem conduits and high stomatal densities (232 +/- 2 mm(- 2)) on unifacial phyllodes, could contribute to early dehydration of A. holosericea cut foliage stems standing in vase water. Further research will relate these anatomical features with changes in K-h and transpiration of cut foliage stems...|$|R
40|$|Small {{diameter}} pyritized axes, {{commonly referred}} to as ‘twigs’, of fossil platanaceous wood are described from the Lower Eocene London Clay Formation of south-east England. These twigs are characterized by solitary vessels with scalariform <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> opposite intervessel pits, and tall, multiseriate rays that dilate in the phloem region. The wood anatomy supports close relationship to members of extant Platanaceae and the material is placed in the organ genus Plataninium Unger erected for fossil woods with close anatomical similarity to Platanus L. This material supplements the fossil record of platanaceous type wood from the Eocene London Clay and documents the first record of Plataninium decipiens Brett in the twig flor...|$|R
