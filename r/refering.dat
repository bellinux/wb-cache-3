When precipitation {{is used as a}} proxy for near-cloud-base mass fluxes, the preliminary results indicate that surface divergence is fairly well correlated with the precipitation and that the surface divergence lags the precipitation. These results suggest {{that it is possible to}} use the proposed method to inferred the near-cloud-base mass fluxes. Two CRM simulations of convective systems were also used to evaluate the near-cloud-base <b>refering</b> method. The results show there is a good correlation between the infer and true near-cloud-base mass fluxes except for some difference in timing and at peak values. An alternative to the original near-cloud-base mass flux <b>refering</b> method using the surface divergence statistics is to use the surface precipitation...|$|E

Research Paper, School of Teacher Training and Education Faculty. Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta. January, 2016. The {{research}} aims at {{describing the}} intention, implicature, and flouting maxim of directive utterance in Islamic Holy Scripture. The research employs descriptive qualitative as {{the type of}} research. Data source {{of this research is}} the script of Islamic Holy Scripture. Techniques of collecting data are reading English version data in Islamic Holy Scripture chapter Al-A’raf, searching sentences containing utterances, selecting data containing directive utterances, and coding the data script. Techniques of data analysis are describing the intention contained in the directive utterance in Islamic Holy Scripture chapter Al-A’raf by <b>refering</b> to the theory of speech act from Kreidler(1989), describing the implicature contained in the directive utterance in Islamic Holy Scripture chapter Al-A’raf by <b>refering</b> to the theory of implicature from Levinson(2000), and describing the maxims violated contained in the directive utterance in Islamic Holy Scripture chapter Al-A’raf by <b>refering</b> to the theory of maxim from Grice (1975). The data are shown with the italic and underline words. One datum analysis presents intention, implicature and flouting maxim analysis. The result of the study shows that 1) The categories of intention are: commanding(50...|$|E
