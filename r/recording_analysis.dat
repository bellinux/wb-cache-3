5000|$|Fundamental {{distortion}} {{mechanisms are}} present in the conventional implementation of DSD. These distortion mechanisms can be alleviated to some degree by using digital converters with a multi-bit design. Historically, state-of-the-art ADCs were based around sigma-delta modulation designs. Oversampling converters are frequently used in linear PCM formats, where the ADC output is subject to bandlimiting and dithering. Many modern converters use oversampling and a multi-bit design. It has been suggested that bitstream digital audio techniques are theoretically inferior to multi-bit (PCM) approaches: J. Robert Stuart notes, [...] "1-bit coding would be a totally unsuitable choice for a series of recordings that set out to identify the high-frequency content of musical instruments, despite claims for its apparent wide bandwidth. If it is unsuitable for <b>recording</b> <b>analysis</b> then we should also be wary of using it for the highest quality work." ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Second opinion (SO) {{is common}} in medical {{practice}} and can reduce unnecessary risks and costs. To date, there is no population-based estimation {{of how many people}} seek SOs and what the characteristics of second-opinion seekers are. Objectives: To estimate how many people seek SOs, and what the characteristics of second-opinion seekers are. Methods: We conducted both a medical <b>records</b> <b>analysis</b> (n= 1, 392, 907) and a cross-sectional national telephone survey with a representative sample of the general Israeli population (n= 848, response rate= 62 %). In the medical <b>records</b> <b>analysis,</b> we linked consultations with specialists at community secondary care and private consultations using claims data. We developed a time-sensitive algorithm that identified potential SO instances. In both methods, we predicted the characteristics of second-opinion seekers using multivariate logistic regressions. Results: The medical <b>records</b> <b>analysis</b> and the survey findings were highly consistent, and showed that about sixth (14. 9 % in the medical records vs. 17. 2 % in the survey) of a general population sought a SO, mostly from orthopedic surgeons. Women, native-born, and established immigrants, people living in central urban areas or close to central urban areas, people with chronic conditions, and those who perceived their health status as not very good, were more likely to seek SOs than others. Conclusions: A considerable amount of people sought a SO. Certain patient profiles tended to seek SOs more than others. Such utilization patterns are important to devise policy regarding SOs, due to their implications on expenditure, policy, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction...|$|R
