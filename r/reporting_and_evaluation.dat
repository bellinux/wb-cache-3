40|$|Nonprofits {{are facing}} {{increasing}} expectations from their funders to demonstrate progress and effectiveness. Most foundations strive {{to understand their}} own impact in large part through the successes of their grants and grantees, and many within the philanthropic community are pushing to obtain evidence of effectiveness from the nonprofit organizations they support. At the same time, a number of foundations are also working to simplify <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. Project Streamline, for example, is an effort aimed at "reducing the burden on nonprofits" and freeing up "more time and money for mission-based activities. " Recommendations to trim processes include funders "right-sizing" <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> requirements, enabling web reporting, creating standardized reporting processes, and making other operational improvements. There can be tension between these dual emphases [...] on better understanding effectiveness and on streamlining processes [...] and {{at the center of}} this tension is how best to structure <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. Some funders push for a more rigorous and often time-intensive process, while others seek to trim it down to free grantees' time, resources, and energy for their core work. But how are grantees experiencing foundation required <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes? How helpful do they find them? What actually matters most to grantees? To shed light on these questions, the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) collected survey responses from more than 24, 000 grantees about their views of 130 foundations. We learned that: On average, grantees do not find current <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes to be very helpful in strengthening their organizations and programs. Strong relationships between grantees and their funders are central to helpful <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. Grantees who report discussing their report or evaluation with their funder perceive the reporting or evaluation process to be more helpful [...] yet nearly half of grantees say no discussion occurred...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{established}} {{a program of}} research to improve the development, <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of practice guidelines. We assessed {{the construct validity of}} the items and user's manual in the beta version of the AGREE II. METHODS: We designed guideline excerpts reflecting high-and low-quality guideline content for 21 of the 23 items in the tool. We designed two study packages so that one low-quality and one high-quality version of each item were randomly assigned to each package. We randomly assigned 30 participants to one of the two packages. Participants reviewed and rated the guideline content according to the instructions of the user's manual and completed a survey assessing the manual. RESULTS: In all cases, content designed to be of high quality was rated higher than low-quality content; in 18 of 21 cases, the differences were significant (p < 0. 05). The manual was rated by participants as appropriate, easy to use, and helpful in differentiating guidelines of varying quality, with all scores above the mid-point of the seven-point scale. Considerable feedback was offered on how the items and manual of the beta-AGREE II could be improved. INTERPRETATION: The validity of the items was {{established a}}nd the user's manual was rated as highly useful by users. We used these results and those of our study presented in part 1 to modify the items and user's manual.

40|$|Currently, {{regulators}} make marketing authorisation {{decisions based}} on the benefit-risk balance of a treatment with little input from patients and the public. The aims of this thesis are to apply systematic methods of benefit-risk assessment proposed for use in regulatory decision-making, and examine how they can incorporate patient and public involvement. These aims were met through the investigation of three case studies: efalizumab, rimonabant, and natalizumab. Efalizumab (indication: plaque psoriasis) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. I examined the feasibility of applying descriptive and quantitative frameworks to determine the benefit-risk balance of efalizumab, and evaluated where patient and public involvement can be applied in the decision-making process. Rimonabant (indication: overweight and obesity) was withdrawn from the market due to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders. I conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit patient and public preferences regarding the benefits and risks of treatment, and developed a probabilistic analysis method to analyse the preference data and determine the benefit-risk balance of rimonabant. Natalizumab (indication: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis) received authorisation, but the benefit-risk balance was reassessed due to the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Authorisation was maintained with risk minimisation measures. I developed a framework to guide the application, <b>reporting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of patient and public involvement in benefit-risk assessment. I then tested the feasibility of the framework with protocols designed to elicit patient and public preferences on the benefits and risks of natalizumab. Based {{on the findings of}} these case studies, preferences can be elicited from patients and the public and used to determine the benefit-risk balance of a medicine. This thesis provides a methodological foundation to guide the application, <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of PPI in the benefit-risk assessment of medicines and improve the legitimacy, transparency, and quality of regulatory decision-making.

40|$|Background National {{standards}} for delivery of out-of-hours services have been refined. Health service users' preferences, <b>reports,</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of care are of importance in {{a service that}} aims to be responsive to their needs. Aim To investigate NHS service users' <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of out-of-hours care {{in the light of}} UK national service quality requirements. Design Cross sectional survey. Setting Three areas (Devon, Cornwall, Sheffield) of England, UK. Method Participants were 1249 recent users of UK out-of-hours medical services. Main outcome measures were: users' <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of out-of-hours services in respect of the time waiting for their telephone call to the service to be answered; the length of time {{from the end of the}} initial call to the start of definitive clinical assessment (`call back time'); the time waiting for a home visit; and the waiting time at a treatment centre. Results UK national quality requirements were reported as being met by two-thirds of responders. Even when responders reported that they had received the most rapid response option for home visiting (waiting time of `up to an hour'), only one-third of users reported this as `excellent'. Adverse evaluations of care were consistently related to delays encountered in receiving care and (for two out of four measures) sex of patient. For 50 % of users to evaluate their care as `excellent', this would require calls to be answered within 30 seconds, call-back within 20 minutes, time spent waiting for home visits of significantly less than 1 hour, and treatment centre waiting times of less than 20 minutes. Conclusion Users have high expectations of UK out-of-hours healthcare services. Service provision that meets nationally designated targets is currently judged as being of `good' quality by service users. Attaining `excellent' levels of service provision would prove challenging, and potentially costly. Delivering services that result in high levels of user satisfaction with care needs to take account of users' expectations as well as their experience of careFull Tex...|$|R
