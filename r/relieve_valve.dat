RELAP 5 was used to calculate transient pressures when hypothetical overpressurization events are considered.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the complex three-dimensional flowfield of an oxygen safety pressure <b>relieve</b> <b>valve</b> during an incident, with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Specifically, the analysis will provide a flow pattern that would lead to the expansion of the eventual erosion pattern of the hardware, so as to combine it with other findings to piece together a most likely scenario for the investigation. The CFD model is a pressure based solver. An adaptive upwind difference scheme is employed for the spatial discretization, and a predictor, multiple corrector method is used for the velocity-pressure coupling. The computational result indicated vortices formation near the opening of the valve which matched the erosion pattern of the damaged hardware...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{numerical}} model is developed {{to investigate the}} fluid and dynamic characteristics of a direct-operated safety <b>relieve</b> <b>valve</b> (SRV). The CFX code {{has been used to}} employ advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques including moving mesh capabilities, multiple domains and valve piston motion using the CFX Expression Language (CEL). With a geometrically accurate CFD model of the SRV and the vessel, the complete transient process of the system from valve opening to valve closure is simulated. A detailed picture of the compressible fluid flowing through the SRV is obtained, including small-scale flow features in the seat regions. In addition, the flow forces on the disc and the lift are monitored and analyzed and the comparison of the effects of design parameters, are examined; including the adjusting ring position, vessel volume and spring stiffness. Results from the model allow the fluid and dynamic characteristics of the SRV to be investigated and shows that the model has great potential of assisting engineers in the preliminary design of SRVs, operating under actual conditions which are often found to be difficult to interpret in practice...|$|E
5000|$|The new {{lifeboat}} {{was of a}} self-righting, pulling and sailing type [...] and was 36 ft {{in length}} and a beam of 9 ft. The design encompassed air cases for reserve buoyancy, a low centre of gravity (iron drop keel), the ability to self-bail (<b>relieving</b> <b>valves)</b> and water ballast tanks which gave the lifeboat stability {{and the ability to}} self-right achieved {{as a result of the}} combination of these features.|$|R
50|$|Most newer systems employ {{electromechanical}} or electronic controllers. In this scenario, {{the controller}} {{is connected to}} an electrical circuit that operates a solenoid attached to each valve (solenoid valve). When the solenoid is actuated, the water above the diaphragm is <b>relieved</b> and the <b>valve</b> opens.|$|R
50|$|The new {{lifeboat}} hull {{was constructed}} using the clench method fixed with copper fastenings. The keel was 4 in deep and 5 in wide, {{with an iron}} keel plate and a belt of cork. She was 35 ft long with a breadth of 10 ft. The inside depth was 4 ft. There were fourteen oars which were double banked and she was also equipped with a dipping lug sail. The lifeboat would be steered by either a rudder or sweep oars. Benjamin Bond Cabbell II had a watertight deck, with copper tubes and self-acting valves to release the water, and portable airtight cases round {{the sides of the}} boat between the deck and the thwarts. Cork-packed air-cases were placed under the deck in the wings of the lifeboat. These cases weighed 4.5 tons and drew 18 in of water clear of ballast. The boat had a relatively light construction with a high bow and a raking stem. The keel was curved, typical of the north country-designed lifeboats first built in the late eighteenth century. The water ballast tanks had ten <b>relieving</b> <b>valves</b> and the rudder was retractable to prevent it being damaged when beach launched or during the recovery procedure.|$|R

40|$|A newly {{described}} immediate complication after percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty is acute lung injury. Here {{we report}} {{a case of}} fatal acute lung injury after pulmonary valvuloplasty. The patient was a 26 -year-old woman, referred to a general hospital with the diagnosis of livercirrhosis. In her work-ups severe pulmonary stenosis was detected and so a decision was madeto <b>relieve</b> the <b>valve</b> stenosis. Despite the procedural success, the patient developed severe dyspneaand desaturation {{a few hours later}} and died within 3 days due to shock state. Although the definition, incidence or severity of acute lung injury after pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty is not yet clear, this is {{as far as we know}} the first mortality reported in literature. This presentation in our patient should prompt clinicians to consider a more aggressive approach at the first sight of this previously considered innocent complication...|$|R
5000|$|While most Functionalists {{sought to}} link ritual to the {{maintenance}} of social order, South African functionalist anthropologist Max Gluckman coined the phrase [...] "rituals of rebellion" [...] to describe a type of ritual in which the accepted social order was symbolically turned on its head. Gluckman argued that the ritual was an expression of underlying social tensions (an idea taken up by Victor Turner), and that it functioned as an institutional pressure <b>valve,</b> <b>relieving</b> those tensions through these cyclical performances. The rites ultimately functioned to reinforce social order, insofar as they allowed those tensions to be expressed without leading to actual rebellion. Carnival is viewed in the same light. He observed, for example, how the first-fruits festival (incwala) of the South African Bantu kingdom of Swaziland symbolically inverted the normal social order, so that the king was publicly insulted, women asserted their domination over men, and the established authority of elders over the young was turned upside down.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Myxomatous {{mitral valve}} with {{prolapse}} are classically seen with abnormal leaflet apposition during contraction of the heart. Hemodynamic disorders {{can result from}} eccentric mitral regurgitation usually caused by chordae tendinae rupture or papillary muscle dysfunction. Echocardiography is {{the gold standard for}} evaluation of leaflet flail and prolapse due to high sensitivity and specificity. Though most mitral valve prolapse are asymptomatic those that cause severe regurgitation need emergent surgical intervention to prevent disease progression. CASE REPORT: We report a 54 year old Hispanic male who presented with progressively worsening dyspnea and palpitations. Initial evaluation was significant for atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram with subsequent echocardiography revealing myxomatous mitral valve with prolapse. Following surgical repair of the mitral valve, the dyspnea and palpitations resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve prolapse is a common valvular abnormality but the pathogenic cause of myxomatous valves has not been elucidated. Several theories describe multiple superfamilies of proteins {{to be involved in the}} process. Proper identification of these severe mitral regurgitation due to these disease <b>valves</b> will help <b>relieve</b> symptomatic mitral <b>valve</b> prolapse patients...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} testing of the set pressure of the EC hydraulic drive cylinder relief valve. The purpose of the relief valve {{is to provide a}} safety measure in the event that oil becomes trapped in the rod side of the cylinder and pressure is applied to the cap side. The note includes an explanation of the procedure used and a summary of the result of the testing done on February 14, 1991 by Gary Trotter. The result was that the cylinder relief <b>valve</b> <b>relieved</b> at the correct set pressure of 10, 500 psig. The basic concern is {{for the protection of the}} cylinder. The pump is capable of providing up to 10, 500 psi of pressure to either side of the cylinder. The cylinder is rated for 10, 500 psi. Under normal operating conditions, the valves would be open, and the pumping pressure would automatically flow oil into one side, and remove oil from the other side. If, however, the valve for the other side was closed, so that oil could not be removed, then the pressure would build in that side. If the rod side is pressurized to the maximum pump pressure of 10, 500 psi, the cross sectional area ratio of 2. 29 results in a pressure of approximately 4600 psi in the cap side, which is well under the rated pressure. If, however, the cap side is pressurized to 10, 500 psi, the cross sectional area would produce a pressure of approximately 24, 000 psi in the rod side, which could damage the cylinder. Therefore, the pressure on the rod side must be limited to the rated pressure of 10, 500 psi. In reality, the maximum operating force on the piston would be under 11, 000 Ibs., which would result in the maximum cylinder pressure being under 8000 psi to the rod side, and under 3500 psi to the cap side. Therefore, the relief is only needed as a safety precaution in the case that oil becomes trapped...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Aortic {{stenosis}} {{leads to}} the derangement of cardiac function and contraction mode because of chronic pressure overload that is <b>relieved</b> after surgical <b>valve</b> replacement. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the changes in left ventricular systolic rotation and contraction using MR tagging in patients with aortic stenosis before and after surgical valve replacement compared with age-matched healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with aortic stenosis were examined with an electrocardiographically triggered two-dimensional tagging sequence at 1. 5 T before and 12 months after surgical valve replacement for the evaluation of wall function of the apical, mid ventricular, and basal levels. Eight healthy volunteers in the same age group served as the control group. RESULTS: Before surgery, all patients showed a significant increase of apical rotation (22. 2 degrees +/- 5. 9 degrees vs 10. 3 degrees +/- 2. 5 degrees, p < 0. 0001) and overall left ventricular torsion (25. 1 degrees +/- 6. 6 degrees vs 14. 5 degrees +/- 3. 7 degrees, p < 0. 001); basal rotation was not significantly different (- 2. 9 degrees +/- 2. 1 degrees vs - 4. 2 degrees +/- 1. 9 degrees, p = not significant) compared with the volunteer group. Apical rotation and torsion were negatively correlated with left ventricular mass (r = - 0. 73, p < 0. 01, and r = - 0. 61, p < 0. 05, respectively) and end-diastolic volume (r = - 0. 73, p < 0. 01 and r = - 0. 64, p < 0. 03, respectively). One year after surgery, basal rotation was reduced in the patients with aortic stenosis compared with the patients in the control group (- 1. 9 degrees +/- 1. 8 degrees, p < 0. 01). In comparison with preoperative values, apical rotation (14. 2 degrees +/- 3. 6 degrees, p < 0. 01) also decreased but was still elevated, and this resulted in a normalization of left ventricular torsion (16. 1 degrees +/- 3. 7 degrees, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Surgical valve replacement for aortic stenosis leads to normalization of the left ventricular torsion 1 year after surgery. Pressure overload before surgery is associated with an increase of systolic left ventricular wringing motion, possibly serving as a compensatory mechanism. This mechanism declines with increasing left ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation...|$|R
