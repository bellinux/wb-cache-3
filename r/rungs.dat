Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith.

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what {{proportion}} of the corps commanders had risen from the ranks, but {{it is likely to}} have been small as most rankers would be nearing retirement age {{by the time they were}} given command of a regiment and would be promoted no further. In contrast, directly commissioned protectores and tribuni dominated the higher echelons, as they were usually young men when they started. For such men, promotion to corps command could be swift e.g. the future emperor Theodosius I was a dux at age 28. It was also possible for <b>rungs</b> on the rank-ladder to be skipped. Commanders of scholae, who enjoyed direct access to the emperor, often reached the highest rank of magister militum: e.g. the barbarian-born officer Agilo was promoted direct to magister militum from tribunus of a schola in 360, skipping the dux stage.|$|E
5|$|After a ten-month absence, Christian {{returned}} from injury on the June 17, 2013 episode of Raw, defeating Wade Barrett. Later that week on SmackDown, after defeating Drew McIntyre, Christian {{was attacked by}} The Shield while delivering a promo. On the June 26 episode of Main Event, Christian took on Shield member Dean Ambrose, {{which resulted in a}} disqualification win for Christian following interference from Ambrose's stablemates, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns. That same week on SmackDown, Christian teamed up with the Usos to defeat The Shield, handing the stable their second loss in six-man tag matches. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Christian competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but was unsuccessful as the match was won by Randy Orton. During the match, Christian had his teeth chipped after a strong punch from Sheamus through the <b>rungs</b> of a ladder. On the July 29 episode of Raw, Christian defeated World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio in a non-title match. That same week on SmackDown, Christian defeated Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam in a three-way match to become number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, after which, he was attacked by Del Rio during a post-match interview. On the August 9 episode of SmackDown, Christian again defeated Del Rio in a non-title match. On August 18 at SummerSlam, Christian failed in his title challenge against Del Rio. On the September 9 episode of Raw, following Edge's opinion on Triple H's recent abuse of power, The Shield dragged out an assaulted Christian as a message to anyone that disrespected Triple H. On that week's SmackDown, Edge promised Christian would return soon and get his payback. Christian returned and appeared on the 2013 Slammy Awards, where he presented an award and appeared in a segment involving John Cena and Randy Orton.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare energetic workload, perceived exertion, perceived discomfort, safety, and mechanical load at lower limb joints among window cleaners during usage of extension ladders with 30 and 35 cm <b>rung</b> separation. Eleven healthy male professional window cleaners of short and tall stature participated in this study. No significant differences between 30 and 35 cm <b>rung</b> separation were observed for the energetic workload. Results concerning the perceived exertion, discomfort, and safety indicate that 35 cm <b>rung</b> separation is preferred. Based on the mechanical load at the hip, knee, and ankle during ascending and descending the ladder, 30 cm <b>rung</b> separation is preferable to 35 cm <b>rung</b> separation. It is advised to climb ladders with the knees inside the side rails of the ladder, but this seems only possible with 35 cm <b>rung</b> separation. Findings of the presents study suggest that overall, a 35 cm <b>rung</b> separation is marginally favourable while using extension ladders. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|Möbius ladders are vertex-transitive – {{they have}} symmetries taking any vertex {{to any other}} vertex – but (again with the {{exception}} of M6) they are not edge-transitive. The edges from the cycle from which the ladder is formed can be distinguished from the <b>rungs</b> of the ladder, because each cycle edge belongs to a single 4-cycle, while each rung belongs to two such cycles. Therefore, there is no symmetry taking a cycle edge to a rung edge or vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{report and}} debate {{lead to the}} league reorganising to allow for {{promotion}} and relegation {{prior to the start}} of the 1958-59 season. There were eight teams in each league section. A Qualifying League in two sections provided two lower <b>rungs</b> for the league, with a further Intermediate section below that. The formation of the sections again proved controversial, as some clubs were not placed in the section that their previous seasons standing would merit. In particular, it was reported that Saintfield (Intermediate A) had finished above four clubs in 1957-58 that were placed in Qualifying B.|$|E

40|$|We study an {{integrable}} two-leg spin- 1 / 2 ladder with an XYZ-type <b>rung</b> interaction. Exact <b>rung</b> {{states and}} <b>rung</b> energies are {{obtained for the}} anisotropic <b>rung</b> coupling {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Magnetic properties are analyzed at both zero and finite temperatures via the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and the high-temperature expansion. According to different couplings in the anisotropic <b>rung</b> interaction, there are two cases in which a gap opens, with the ground state involving one or two components in the absence of a magnetic field. We obtain the analytic expressions of all critical fields for the field-induced quantum phase transitions (QPT). Anisotropic <b>rung</b> interaction leads to such effects as separated magnetizations and susceptibilities in different directions, lowered inflection points and remnant weak variation of the magnetization after the last QPT.

Those who do so are considered converts.|$|E
25|$|The {{rack rail}} design used {{is one of}} Marsh's own inventions, using a ladder-like rack with open bar <b>rungs</b> engaged by {{the teeth of the}} cog wheel.

25|$|In 1981, Petraeus became aide-de-camp to General John Galvin, then Commanding General of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized).

From 1983 to 1985 he was at Princeton; and 1985–87 at West Point. After earning his PhD and teaching at West Point, Petraeus continued up the <b>rungs</b> of the command ladder, serving as military assistant to Gen.

25|$|In the short-term, Kovel advocates {{activities}} {{that have the}} “promise of breaking down the commodity form”. This includes organizing labor, which is a “reconfiguring of the use-value of labor power”; forming cooperatives, allowing “a relatively free association of labor”; forming localised currencies, which he sees as “undercutting the value-basis of money”; and supporting “radical media” that, in his eyes, involve an “undoing of the fetishism of commodities”. He advocates economic localisation {{in the same vein}} as many in the Green movement, although only as a prefigurative step rather than an end in itself. He also advises political parties attempting to “democratize the state” that there should be “dialogue but no compromise” with established political parties, and that there must be “a continual association of electoral work with movement work” to avoid “being sucked back into the system”. Such parties, he believes, should focus on “the local <b>rungs</b> of the political system” first, before running national campaigns that “challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises”.|$|E
