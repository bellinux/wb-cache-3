40|$|Abstract. The latest {{outburst}} of AG Peg has lasted for 150 years, {{which makes it}} the slowest nova eruption ever recorded. During the time of IUE observations (1978 − 1995) line profiles and intensity ratios of the N V and C IV doublet components changed remarkably, and we discuss plausible reasons. One of them is radiative pumping of Fe II which is investigated by studying the fluorescence lines from pumped levels. Three Fe II channels are pumped by C IV and one by N V. The pumping rates of those Fe II channels as derived by the modeling agree well with {{the strengths of the}} Fe II fluorescence lines seen in the spectra. We model the C IV and N V <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets</b> in IUE spectra recorded between 1978 and 1995 in order to derive optical depths, expansion velocities, and the emissivities of the red giant wind, the white dwarf wind and their collision region. The derived expansion velocities are ∼ 60 km s− 1 for the red giant wind and ∼ 700 km s− 1 for the white dwarf wind. We also suggest a fast outflow from the system at ∼ 150 km s− 1. The expansion velocity is slightly higher for N V than for C IV.

40|$|Preliminary {{inspection}} of archival high-dispersion ultraviolet spectra {{obtained by the}} International Ultraviolet Explorer reveal sharp shortward-shifted features in the spectra of O subdwarfs. In three examples presented here, BD + 75. 325 deg, HD 128220 B, and BD + 28. 4211 deg, stable, multiple, discrete shortward-shifted components of the N V, C IV, and Si IV <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets</b> are seen. The available data suggest {{that some of these}} features are persistent, being relatively stable in velocity and intensity over at least 9 months. It is tentatively suggested that the mechanism, or mechanisms, producing these discrete features operates universally in hot stars, from luminous O and B stars down through the O subdwarfs to include the hot white dwarfs. If true, this has important ramifications for current knowledge of mass loss in hot stars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{quantitative}} analysis of time series of ultraviolet spectra from {{a sample of}} 10 bright O-type stars (cf. Kaper et al. 1996, Paper I) is presented. Migrating discrete absorption components (DACs), responsible for the observed variability in the UV <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets,</b> are modeled. To isolate the DACs from the underlying P Cygni lines, a method is developed to construct a template (“least-absorption”) spectrum for each star. The central velocity, central optical depth, width, and column density of each pair of DACs is measured and studied {{as a function of}} time. It turns out that the column density of a DAC first increases and subsequently decreases with time when the component is approaching its asymptotic velocity. Sometimes a DAC vanishes before this velocity is reached. In some cases the asymptotic DAC velocity systematically differs from event to event...|$|R
40|$|Line {{profiles}} {{are examined}} for the <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets</b> of the ions C IV, Si IV, and N V in {{the spectrum of}} the dwarf nova TW Virginis as observed by Cordova and Mason (1982). Line strengths depend on the abundances of the scattering ions and hence on the physical characteristics in the stellar wind. Results of the study show that the observed UV line ratios from TW Vir cannot be produced by photoionization by either an unattenuated single bremsstrahlung or by a single blackbody spectrum. Satisfactory values of the abundance ratios can be produced by bremsstrahlung spectra extending into the X-ray region which have low-energy cutoffs near the N IV threshold energy at 77 eV and have fluxes corresponding to an ionization parameter xi-sub-br of about 10. A finding that the flux in the soft X-ray bremsstrahlung component must exceed the EUV blackbody flux by at least {{an order of magnitude}} has implications for theories of the continuum emission from cataclysmic variables...|$|R

A unified model is developed {{to account for the}} observed correlation among three stellar properties: the line profile characteristics of the C IV and Si IV <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets,</b> the variations in the strength of these lines, and the inferred magnetic field geometry. It is proposed that circumstellar plasma is trapped in the stellar magnetosphere near the magnetic equator or is channeled to form jetlike outflows from the magnetic polar regions. These results, together with those of a previous study of the helium-weak sn stars, show that both helium-weak and helium-strong stars can possess magnetospherically trapped plasma, notwithstanding their different photospheric properties. New results for radii and temperatures of the helium-strong stars in Ori OB 1 and for HD 64740 from low-dispersion IUE spectra are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{pressure}} broadened {{profiles of}} alkali <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets</b> {{are needed for}} modelling of the atmospheres of cool stars and for generating their synthetic spectra in the region 400 – 900 nm. When the usual impact theory of line broadening is used, the profile is simply Lorentzian and the widths and shifts of the lines can be calculated, provided that interaction potentials for the emitter–perturber system are available. However when the lines utterly dominate their region of the spectrum, it becomes important to also accurately represent the profile in the line wings, where the impact theory is no longer valid. The original development of line broadening theory by Baranger in 1958 is reexamined and calculations {{have been carried out}} in which it is shown that {{it is not necessary to}} invoke the impact approximation. To test the validity of different approximations, results for line widths and shifts are presented for the lithium and sodium resonance lines broadened by helium for 0. 1 K less-than-or-equals, slant T less-than-or-equals, slant 3000 K...|$|R

The dominant spectral features in the optical for these L-type dwarfs are resonance lines of Cs I and molecular band heads of CrH and FeH. The other dominant feature in these L-type spectra is a broad 600 ˚A absorption dip centered on 7700 ˚A, which we identify with extremely strong (equivalent width ∼ several hundred ˚A) absorption associated with the 7664, 7698 ˚A <b>resonance</b> <b>doublet</b> of K I.

40|$|Detailed {{simultaneous}} {{visible and}} ultraviolet spectroscopy of Zeta Puppis {{was carried out}} in order to study the time scale of variations in its stellar wind and to assess the relationship between fluctuations in lines of ions formed at different heights.

Fluctuations in the visible features occurred in times of about one hour, while the ultraviolet profiles showed changes which took several hours to develop. No evidence of periodicity was seen, but the time coverage is not sufficiently complete to preclude it. Specific changes, particularly in H alpha and 4686 A, may have been caused by the passage of density enhancements from the stellar surface outward through the wind. The profile variations, when compared with recent model calculations, imply changes in the mass-loss rate by no more than a factor of two in times of a few hours...|$|R

In clumped (or porous) winds, this ratio can lies between unity and the ratio of the f-values, and can change as a function of velocity and time, depending on the fraction of the stellar disk that is covered by material moving at a particular velocity at a given moment. Using these insights, we present the results of SEI modeling of a sample of B supergiants, zeta Pup and a time series for a star whose terminal velocity is low enough to make the components of its Si IV 1400 doublet independent.

40|$|The recent transit {{observation}} of HD 209458 b - an extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star - confirmed {{that it is}} a gas giant and determined that its orbital inclination is 85 degrees. This inclination makes possible investigations of the planet atmosphere. In this Letter we discuss the planet transmission spectra during a transit. The basic tenet of the method is that the planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar flux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb. The ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is small, approximately 10 ^{- 4 }; for this method to work very strong planet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in extrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the alkali metal lines, in particular the Na I and K I <b>resonance</b> <b>doublets,</b> and the He I $ 2 ^ 3 S$ - $ 2 ^ 3 P$ triplet line at 1083. 0 nm.
