40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of our work on H∞-optimal control problems. In two previous articles a controller degree bound was established for problems in which both P 12 (s) and P 21 (<b>s)</b> are <b>square</b> (problems of the first kind). Here we switch our attention to problems of the second kind. We allow P 12 (s) to have more rows than columns (with P 21 (<b>s)</b> <b>square),</b> or alternatively, we allow P 12 (s) to have more columns than rows (with P 12 (<b>s)</b> <b>square).</b> Our main result shows that the degree bound derived previously for problems of the first kind carries over to problems of the second kind without change. Our analysis suggests a number of modifications which are easily made to currently available computer programs. Test calculations (for problems of the second kind) show that these improvements result in a marked reduction in computation time and also enhance the numerical robustness of the software...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{detrimental}} effect that such DOA error could have {{on the performance of}} the MVDR beamformer, one may examine its corresponding beampattern. Figure 4 (bottom) depicts the beampattern of the MVDR beamformer computed using the noise coherence matrix of a theoretically diffuse noise field as in (11), steered towards the zero degrees direction, and using the microphone configuration described in Section 5.1. By observing the width of the main lobe, it appears that the error in DOA is small enough to not introduce distortions in <b>rooms</b> <b>S</b> 1 and S 2.

30|$|Compared to {{the scores}} {{obtained}} using the unprocessed signals (cf. horizontal black lines in Fig. 5), the WER increases slightly for the conditions {{with the lowest}} reverberation time (<b>room</b> <b>S</b> 1). This indicates that spectral coloration introduced by the enhancement scheme may reduce {{the performance of the}} ASR system while the benefit of dereverberation is limited for small reverberation times. In all other conditions, the single-channel spectral enhancement scheme reduces the WER, with SE 3 yielding larger improvements than SE 1.5. Except for <b>room</b> <b>S</b> 3, the MVDR beamformer yields better results than the single-channel scheme. The combination of the MVDR beamformer with SE 3 yields the largest improvement: absolute WER improvement up to 44.28 % for the simulated data (condition “S 2, far”) and up to 29.48 % for the real data (condition “R 1, near”).|$|R

30|$|Additionally, the {{presented}} FWSSNR values {{depict a}} significant increase in comparison to the unprocessed microphone signal for all processed signals, except for the MVDR beamformer in the case of <b>room</b> <b>S</b> 2. This illustrates the noise reduction capabilities of the proposed system. The difference in the FWSSNR values between the single- and the multi-channel scenarios further illustrates the benefit of using an MVDR beamformer aiming at noise reduction in the first stage. It can be noted that using a sliding window of 3 s instead of 1.5 s improves the FWSSNR scores in all simulated conditions, both in the single- and the multi-channel case. The advantage of using this longer sliding window is also illustrated by the lower CD values, both in the single- and in the multi-channel case, suggesting that distortions have been limited by avoiding leakage of the reverberation into the noise PSD estimate. Except for <b>room</b> <b>S</b> 1, with the lowest amount of reverberation, both CD and LLR values are lower for the processed signals than for the unprocessed signal.|$|R
