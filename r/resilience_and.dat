5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E
5|$|During {{religious}} ceremonies, many adherents {{choose to}} wear clothing that imitates the styles of dress worn in Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe. They also often wear symbols indicating their religious allegiance. The {{most commonly used}} sign among Heathens is Mjölnir, or Thor's hammer, which is worn as a pendant, featured in Heathen art, and used as a gesture in ritual. It is sometimes used to express a particular affinity with the god Thor, although is also often used {{as a symbol of}} Heathenism as a whole, in particular representing the <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vitality of the religion. Another commonly used Heathen symbol is the valknut, used to represent the god Odin or Woden.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

5|$|Michael Persinger is a {{neurophysiologist}} who {{has worked}} at Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched and examined the physiological and neurological causes of religious belief systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological <b>resilience,</b> <b>and</b> has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent psychiatry at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which may have affected unidentified flying object sightings in Washington. Suess and Persinger performed similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E

25|$|Ecological <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> the {{thresholds}} {{by which}} resilience is defined are closely interrelated {{in the way}} that they influence environmental policy-making, legislation and subsequently environmental management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of environmental impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem resilience, some levels of environmental impact associated with development are made permissible by environmental policy-making and ensuing legislation.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{implication}} {{that many of}} these impacts will be detrimental—especially for the three-quarters of the world's poor who depend on agriculture systems. The report does, however, note that owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the outcome}} of the battle was an {{important}} boost to Southern confidence and morale. Along with the Confederate victory at the Battle of First Bull Run (Battle of First Manassas) six weeks later, it provided what proved to be undue encouragement and confidence in a quick victory in the war to the Confederates. Union morale was correspondingly damaged but as events proved, the Northern public and military showed <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> determination in the face of several early defeats.|$|E
25|$|The term {{deforestation}} has {{a meaning}} that covers crossing {{the threshold of}} forest's <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area. The larger the scale of damage, {{the more difficult it}} is for the forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation that over 70% of the world’s fish stocks are either fully exploited or depleted which means overfishing threatens marine ecosystem <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> this is mostly by rapid growth of fishing technology. One of the negative effects on marine ecosystems is {{that over the last}} half-century the stocks of coastal fish have had a huge reduction as a result of overfishing for its economic benefits. Blue fin tuna is at particular risk of extinction. Depletion of fish stocks results in lowered biodiversity and consequently imbalance in the food chain, and increased vulnerability to disease.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{played their}} fifth and final match {{of the tournament}} at the same venue in Edinburgh against Netherlands. They lost the toss again and were {{inserted}} to bat again. This time though, the batting showed <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> the team put together a total of 172 {{for the loss of}} 8 wickets which came {{on the back of a}} half-century from Ruvindu Gunasekera (51) and late blitzes from team captain Rizwan Cheema and wicket-keeper batsman Hamza Tariq. In response, the Netherlands batsmen, particularly Steven Myburgh, Wesley Barresi and Michael Swart led an attacking display of powerful batting to record a solid win for their team with 15 balls to spare. Thus, ending a dismal 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier for the Canada national cricket team.|$|E
