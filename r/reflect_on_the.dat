5|$|My Truth is {{the second}} studio album by Swedish {{recording}} artist Robyn. It was released on 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Robyn collaborated with producers including Lindström & Ekhé, Christian Falk, Billy Mann, Thomas Rusiak and Masters at Work during its recording. A pop and R record, My Truth is an autobiographical album for which Robyn co-wrote all fourteen songs. Certain lyrics <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abortion the singer had {{in the fall of}} 1998, which sparked controversy when RCA Records began formulating a North American release. When she refused to make alterations to the album per request by the label, the plans to release My Truth outside of Sweden were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations {{have been set}} {{in the midst of}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E

25|$|To {{a lesser}} degree, the Figaro plays are semi-autobiographical. Don Guzman Brid'oison (Le Mariage) and Bégearss (La Mère) were caricatures {{of two of}} Beaumarchais's real-life adversaries, Goezman and Bergasse. The page Chérubin (Le Mariage) resembled the {{youthful}} Beaumarchais, who did contemplate suicide when his love was to marry another. Suzanne, the heroine of Le Mariage and La Mère, was modelled after Beaumarchais's third wife, Marie-Thérèse de Willer-Mawlaz.

25|$|Tuvalu {{does not}} face serious {{governance}} issues. The {{frequent use of}} the parliamentary vote of no confidence, engendering many changes of government in relatively short periods, has sometimes been on issues which <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relations between personalities rather than on pressing national issues. The apparent reasons for the resort to motions of no confidence in the prime minister in the period 1999 to 2004 were: the PM straying from policies supported by the majority caucus; claims that the PM was inefficient or ineffective; and accusations of corruption in making appointments.|$|E

25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> process {{and try to}} derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience.

If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
