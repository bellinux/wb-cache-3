5|$|By the 1930s the LFR {{network of}} {{ground-based}} radio transmitters, coupled with on-board AM <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> became {{a vital part}} of instrument flying. LFR provided navigational guidance to aircraft for en route operations and approaches, under virtually all weather conditions, helping to make consistent and reliable flight schedules a reality.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication {{because it is}} between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of long-distance radio listening {{began in the}} 1920s when shortwave broadcasters were first established in the US and Europe. Audiences discovered that international programming was available on the shortwave bands of many consumer <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> {{and a number of}} magazines and listener clubs catering to the practice arose as a result. Shortwave listening was especially popular during times of international conflict such as World War II, the Korean War and the Persian Gulf War.|$|E

5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as <b>radio</b> <b>receivers,</b> they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E

50|$|A {{preselector}} is a {{name for}} an electronic device that connects between a radio antenna and a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver.</b> The preselector is a band-pass filter that blocks trouble-causing out-of-tune frequencies from passing through from the antenna into the <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> (or preamplifier) that otherwise would be directly connected to the antenna.|$|R

50|$|The tuner {{can also}} {{refer to a}} <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> or {{standalone}} audio component {{that are part of}} an audio system, to be connected to a separate amplifier.

25|$|Synthesizers used in {{commercial}} <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> are {{largely based on}} phase-locked loops or PLLs.

25|$|Capacitors and {{inductors}} {{are applied}} together in tuned circuits to select information in particular frequency bands. For example, <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> rely on variable capacitors to tune the station frequency. Speakers use passive analog crossovers, and analog equalizers use capacitors to select different audio bands.|$|E

25|$|A {{point-contact}} diode works {{the same as}} the junction diodes described below, but its construction is simpler. A pointed metal wire is placed in contact with an n-type semiconductor.

25|$|A {{superheterodyne}} receiver, often shortened to superhet, {{is a type}} {{of radio}} receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency.
