40|$|Sundt's (1999) multivariate Panjer {{recursion}} is used {{to calculate}} the covariances in results from excess of loss layers protecting the same underlying risk when this is modelled by a compound distribution. The method developed handles the case where the covers of the layers are reduced with aggregate limits and deductibles and the layer premiums are regulated by reinstatement premiums. The results are used to calculate the loading on standard deviation of the layer structure regarded as one single risk.

40|$|Index clauses {{currently}} {{in place in}} the market do not specify how Annual Aggregate Deductibles (AAD) and Annual Aggregate Limits (AAL) should be indexed, which result in inconsistency when indexed deductibles and limits are in place. In this paper, concepts of indexed deductible and limit will be revisited for developing indexing methods for AAD and AAL. Formal mathematical proofs and numerical examples will be presented. The introduced AAL indexing methods enable determination of paid <b>reinstatement</b> <b>premium</b> when index clause for per-claim deductible and limit is in place. The choice of appropriate method for indexing AAD and AAL shall take into account both theoretical and practical soundness...|$|E
