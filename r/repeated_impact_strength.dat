40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} falling weight impact tests on glass-fibre-reinforced laminates. The test program consisted of (i) falling weight impact tests for {{the determination of the}} penetration energy and the influence of laminate construction on damage development and (ii) re-peated falling weight impact tests for the determination of the impact fatigue lifetime and damage development under <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> conditions at sub-penetration energy levels. The objective of this work is to compare the impact behaviour of cross-ply laminates based on a brittle unsaturated polyester resin and a more ductile vinyl ester resin system and two types of glass reinforcement, i. e. woven- and multiaxial non-crimp fabric. The penetration energy of the various composite laminates appeared to be mainly influenced by the type of reinforcement, whereas damage development during (<b>repeated)</b> <b>impact</b> is strongly influenced by both fibre architecture and resin. No significant effect of the different material parameters investigated on the number of impacts to penetration (impact fatigue lifetime) is observed. Especially when the <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> energy is normalised with respect to the penetration energy, all laminates showed similar behaviour.
