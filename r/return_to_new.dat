5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
5|$|As {{her career}} as an Army {{transport}} began, Princess Matoika picked up where her Navy career had ended and continued the return of American troops from Europe. After returning to France she loaded 2,965troops at Brest—including Brigadier General W. P. Richardson {{and members of the}} Polar Bear Expedition, part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War—for a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York on 15 October. In December, Congressman Charles H. Randall (Prohibitionist-CA) and his wife sailed on the Matoika to Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E

50|$|The {{destroyer}} escort got underway on 18 February, held shakedown training out of Bermuda, and <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York {{exactly one}} month later. Thornhill {{served as a}} training ship at Norfolk, Virginia, during April. In May, she <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York <b>to</b> escort a part of Convoy UGS-42 to Norfolk. The 108-ship convoy sortied from Hampton Roads on 13 May, bound for North Africa. Thornhill arrived at Bizerte on 1 June and <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York on the 29th with a westbound convoy. Late in July, the destroyer escort screened another convoy to North Africa and <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York on 7 September 1944.|$|R
50|$|After the conference, `Abdu'l-Bahá <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York City {{where he}} stayed until the 22nd, leaving to the Boston area {{for four days}} {{including}} a trip to Worcester, Massachusetts on the 23rd. On 26 May he <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York City where he would remain {{for most of his}} time until 20 June. He took short trips <b>to</b> Fanwood, <b>New</b> Jersey, from 31 May to 1 June, to Milford, Pennsylvania on 3 June, and to Philadelphia from 8 to 10 June, always <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York City.|$|R
5|$|Governor Horatio Seymour {{arrived on}} Tuesday and spoke at City Hall, where he {{attempted}} to assuage the crowd by proclaiming that the Conscription Act was unconstitutional. General John E. Wool, commander of the Eastern District, brought approximately 800 soldiers and Marines in from forts in New York Harbor, West Point, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He ordered the militias to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Raymond and Noémi {{worked with}} Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. In 1917 he enlisted with the United States Army serving {{overseas}} with the American Expeditionary Force. Upon his {{discharge from the}} army and his <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York, Wright persuaded {{him to go to}} Tokyo with him to work on the Imperial Hotel.|$|E
5|$|More {{recordings}} {{as leader}} ensued following Hope's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York, {{but they did}} little to gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced the frequency of his public performances, which ended a year before his death, {{at the age of}} 43. He remains little known, despite, or because of, the individuality of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.|$|E

In September of that year, she joined the Home Squadron based at Pensacola, Florida.|$|R
5|$|On 26 August, {{she began}} her second voyage to Sydney, but instead of {{retracing}} her route on the return, she continued eastward around the world, becoming—according to The New York Times—the first diesel ship to circumnavigate the globe. Upon her <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York on 2 March 1928, a reception {{was held at the}} Tompkinsville, Staten Island, pier where she had docked. The Roosevelt Steamship Company announced plans for West Honaker to continue in around-the-world service, making two voyages per year.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{enjoyed his}} time in Georgia, where he was {{accepted}} as an adult {{for the first time}} in his life. He was treated hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it was too late for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} June 1988 <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Orleans, Rice penned The Witching Hour as an {{expression}} of her joy at coming home. Rice also continued her popular Vampire Chronicles series, which later grew to encompass ten novels, and followed up on The Witching Hour with Lasher and Taltos, completing the Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy. She also published Violin, a tale of a ghostly haunting, in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The Hornets {{made their}} {{permanent}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Orleans on October 31, 2007, when they defeated the Sacramento Kings 109-90 {{to open the}} 2007–08 season. In the following two seasons, the Hornets averaged an attendance of 15,574. During the 2008 All-Star Game, the NBA donated $5 million towards relief work, and staged an NBA Cares program throughout the city to help rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André {{so that he would}} be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
5|$|Born in London, he {{emigrated to}} New Zealand after leaving school, {{where he worked}} as a surveyor. He joined a {{volunteer}} militia unit in 1893, and went to South Africa as an officer with the first New Zealand contingent sent to the Boer War in 1899. He later commanded the third, fourth and eighth contingents, becoming the first New Zealand officer to command an independent unit on active service overseas. Following his <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, he became inspector-general of the New Zealand Military Forces, and in 1909 was attached to a British Army brigade to gain staff experience.|$|E

El Oriente sailed to Philadelphia in mid September in {{preparation}} for a charter.|$|R
5|$|Following {{this the}} routine of the {{battalion}} became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, {{and at the time}} it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Fisher, {{exhausted}} by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks {{replaced}} Butler {{in command}} at New Orleans. Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow {{by refusing to}} repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Orleans {{to take part in}} the planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.|$|E
50|$|Oregonian {{subsequently}} {{made two}} more Atlantic crossings.

50|$|The Wulffs quit their <b>New</b> York jobs <b>to</b> {{embark on}} a three-month honeymoon by car through the Southwest to San Diego to see Lee's parents <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York via the {{northern}} Rockies and Midwest. They <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York in late September 1929 both unemployed. Although they both found jobs, {{the stock market crash}} on October 29, 1929 led to cuts in pay. Early in 1930, the couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky to work for an advertising agency there. By August 1930 they had <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York, Lee being very disappointed with both the job and the fishing in Kentucky.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of World War II for the United States, the War Shipping Administration requisitioned Henry R. Mallory for use as a civilian-manned troopship in July 1942. Remaining under the {{operation}} of her owners, Agwilines, Inc., she began operation on U.S. Army schedules in July 1942, when she sailed from New York to Belfast. After her <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York in August, she made way to Boston from whence she sailed to Saint John, Wabana, Newfoundland; Sydney, Nova Scotia; and Halifax, before returning to New York in October.|$|E
5|$|International rugby was {{suspended}} during the First World War, but a New Zealand Services team did compete in inter-services competition {{known as the}} King's Cup.

Dreiberg and Jupiter <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on.
