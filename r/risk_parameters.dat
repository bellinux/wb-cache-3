40|$|The goal of {{credibility}} theory is {{to estimate the}} future claim of a given risk. The most accurate estimator is predictive mean.

However, <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> cannot be observed practically {{and it can be}} difficult to estimate its distribution. In this study, the structure function is estimated by using kernel density estimation with several bandwidth selection methods. For comparing the efficiences of these methods, a simulation study performed by using the data from a mixture of a lognormal conditional over a lognormal prior.

Banks must also have in place a system governing the use of these models and whether they are fit for purpose for ongoing use; such a system must consider the stability of the model as well as its ability to predict default accurately.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> in conditional volatility models of the form ϵ_t=σ_t(θ_ 0) η_t and develops statistical procedures to estimate this parameter. For a given risk measure r, the <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> is expressed {{as a function of}} the volatility coefficients θ_ 0 and the risk, r(η_t), of the innovation process. A two-step method is proposed to successively estimate these quantities. An alternative one-step approach, relying on a reparameterization of the model and the use of a non Gaussian QML, is proposed. Asymptotic results are established for smooth risk measures as well as for the Value-at-Risk (VaR). Asymptotic comparisons of the two approaches for VaR estimation suggest a superiority of the one-step method when the innovations are heavy-tailed. For standard GARCH models, the comparison only depends on characteristics of the innovations distribution, not on the volatility parameters. Monte-Carlo experiments and an empirical study illustrate these findings. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} competition in the banking market, increasing regulatory requirements for transparency and sound risk–creation on this basis of adequate risk provisions in the banking sector is of paramount importance. In this paper, firstly it is proposed to use for estimating credit risks the exact maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) {{of the structure of}} stratified population for any sizes of the credit portfolio. These exact MLE could be applied to estimate Basel-II <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> PD (Probability of Default) and could be used to optimise provisions for covering expected losses of consumer credit portfolio. In usual banking practice for estimating <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> PD, the frequencies (rates) of default credits of the whole consumer portfolio or of sub–portfolios of the whole consumer portfolio are usually using. But the statistical characteristics of these estimates, such as unbiased property, consistency, efficiency, exact and asymptotic distributions, usually are unknown. The new statistical estimations have derived for characteristics used in the vintage analysis of consumer credit portfolio. These estimations for delinquency rates with different DPD (Days Past Due) are the exact maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the structure of stratified population for any sizes of the credit portfolio. These exact MLE could be applied to estimate Basel-II <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> PD (Probability of Default) and could be used to optimise provisions for covering expected losses of consumer credit portfolio. Making the adequate provisions to credit risks in the crisis conditions is the problem which needs to estimate risks with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{class of}} stochastic claims reserving methods {{is given by}} the models with conditionally independent loss increments (CILI), where the incremental losses are conditionally independent given a <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> Θ i,j depending on both the accident year i and the development year j. The Bühlmann-Straub credibility reserving (BSCR) model is a particular case of a CILI model where the <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> is only depending on i. We consider CILI models with additive diagonal risk (ADR), where the <b>risk</b> <b>parameter</b> is given by the sum of two components, one depending on the accident year i and the other depending on the calendar year t = i + j. The model {{can be viewed as}} an extension of the BSCR model including random diagonal effects, which are often declared to be important in loss reserving but rarely are specifically modeled. We show that the ADR model is tractable in closed form, providing credibility formulae for the reserve and the mean square error of prediction (MSEP). We also derive unbiased estimators for the variance parameters which extend the classical Bühlmann-Straub estimators. The results are illustrated by a numerical example and the estimators are tested by simulation. We find that the inclusion of random diagonal effects can be significant for the reserve estimates and, especially, for the evaluation of the MSEP. The paper is written with the purpose of illustrating the role of stochastic diagonal effects. To isolate these effects, we assume that the development pattern is given. In particular, our MSEP values do not include the uncertainty due to the estimation of the development patter...|$|R
