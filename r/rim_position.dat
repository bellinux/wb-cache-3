We determined the time evolution of the liquid film thickness both from interference microscopy measurements and finite element calculations. A characteristic rim develops ahead of the spreading surfactant front. Within certain time intervals, the <b>rim</b> <b>position</b> can be well represented by a power-law relation xrim z ta. The corresponding spreading exponent a depends on the method of surfactant deposition and the numerical values deduced from experiments and simulations quantitatively agree. Depth-resolved simulations that account for domain deformability using the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method show that shear-induced concentration non-uniformities across the rim film thickness tend to reduce the rim height.

In both cases, the minimum energy adiabatic paths, and the mean force potentials (MFP) for the insertion of TsCl along a reaction coordinate perpendicular to the CD plane, were calculated for the two possible orientations of TsCl.

Six cadaveric pelvises were mounted on a custom jig. A custom guide was attached to simulate anterolateral (AL), mid-anterior (MA), distal anterolateral (DALA) and posterolateral (PL) arthroscopy portals. Anterior 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock positions were drilled using MA and DALA portals. Posterior 8 o’clock to 11 o’clock positions were drilled using a 1. 4 -mm drill bit from the PL portal. At depths of 5, 10 and 15 mm, the distance from the drill to the intra and extra-articular surfaces was measured using a custom caliper. Mean distance between drill hole and articular surface for anterior and posterior positions ranged from 1. 61 to 2. 75 mm at 5 mm. The smallest distance between the drill hole and articular surface and the largest width between drill hole and the extra-articular surface were at the 4 o’clock position. No difference between the MA and DALA portals were noted for the anterior positions. For the posterior <b>rim</b> <b>positions,</b> the distance on the articular side remained consistent throughout. For the posterior positions, only the PL portal was utilized. Both the MA or DALA portals can be utilized for safe drilling of the anterior <b>rim</b> <b>positions.</b> The posterior positions can all be safely drilled with a relatively good bone margin using the PL portal, but use of the MA or DALA portals resulted in extra-articular cortical perforation in all cases...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{irritation}} of the iliopsoas tendon {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} persistent pain after total joint replacement of the hip. In the majority of cases, pain results from a mechanical conflict between the iliopsoas tendon and the anterior edge of the acetabular cup after total hip arthroplasty. Pain can be reproduced by active flexion of the hip and by active raising of the straightened leg. In addition, painful leg raising against resistance and passive hyperextension are suggestive of an irritation of the iliopsoas tendon. Symptoms evolve from a mechanical irritation of the iliopsoas tendon and an oversized or retroverted acetabular cup, screws penetrating into the inner aspect of the ilium, or from bone cement protruding beyond the anterior acetabular rim. The diagnosis may be assumed on conventional radiographs and confirmed by CT scans. Fifteen patients with psoas irritation after total hip replacement are reported on. Eleven patients were treated surgically. The acetabular cup was revised and reoriented with more anteversion in six patients, isolated screws penetrating into the tendon were cut and leveled in three patients, and prominent bone cement {{in conflict with the}} tendon was resected once. A partial release of the iliopsoas tendon only was performed in another patient. Follow-up examination (range: 11 - 89 months) revealed that nine patients were free of pain and two patient had mild residual complaints. Psoas irritation in combination with total hip replacement can be prevented by a correct surgical technique, especially with proper selection of the cup size and insertion of the acetabular cup avoiding a <b>rim</b> <b>position</b> exceeding the level of the anterior acetabular rim...|$|E
40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are part. During the last century the machines for electricity production have been developed from a few mega watts per unit up to several hundreds mega watts per unit. The development and increasing of size of the hydropower machines have also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurements are still the most reliable and commonly used method to avoid failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and as protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces in different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the guide bearing bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft depending on misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and C. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic pull force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper C, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic force. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the rotor <b>rim</b> <b>position</b> relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that the natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the rotor <b>rim</b> <b>position</b> in relation to the rotor spider is considered. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements together with analysis of the rotordynamics are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads as acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without redesign of the bearings. During commissioning of hydropower unit, measurements of shaft vibrations and forces are the most reliable method to investigate the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behavior of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behavior is important before the generator is put in operation, after rehabilitation or when new machines will be installed. Godkänd; 2005; 20061214 (haneit...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{energy demand}} leads to two crucial {{problems}} for the whole society. One is the economic cost {{and the other is}} the pollution of the environment, especially CO 2 emissions. Despite efforts to adopt renewable energy sources, fossil fuels will continue to dominate. The temperature and stress are planned to be raised to 700 °C and 35 MPa respectively in the advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) power plants to improve the operating efficiency. However, the life of the components is limited by the properties of the materials. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the high temperature properties of materials used for future power plants. This thesis contains two parts. The first part is about developing creep rupture models for austenitic stainless steels. Grain boundary sliding (GBS) models have been proposed that can predict experimental results. Creep cavities are assumed to be generated at intersection of subboundaries with subboundary corners or particles on a sliding grain boundary, the so called double ledge model. For the first time a quantitative prediction of cavity nucleation for different types of commercial austenitic stainless steels has been made. For growth of creep cavities a new model for the interaction between the shape change of cavities and creep deformation has been proposed. In this constrained growth model, the affected zone around the cavities has been calculated with the help of FEM simulation. The new growth model can reproduce experimental cavity growth behavior quantitatively for different kinds of austenitic stainless steels. Based on the cavity nucleation models and the new growth models, the brittle creep rupture of austenitic stainless steels has been determined. By combing the brittle creep rupture with the ductile creep rupture models, the creep rupture strength of austenitic stainless steels has been predicted quantitatively. The accuracy of the creep rupture prediction can be improved significantly with combination of the two models. The second part of the thesis is on the fatigue properties of austenitic stainless steels and nickel based superalloys. Firstly, creep, low cycle fatigue (LCF) and creep-fatigue tests have been conducted for a modified HR 3 C (25 Cr 20 NiNbN) austenitic stainless steel. The modified HR 3 C shows good LCF properties, but lower creep and creep-fatigue properties which may due to the low ductility of the material. Secondly, LCF properties of a nickel based superalloy Haynes 282 have been studied. Tests have been performed for a large ingot. The LCF properties of the core and <b>rim</b> <b>positions</b> did not show evident differences. Better LCF properties were observed when compared with two other low γ’ volume fraction nickel based superalloys. Metallography study results demonstrated that the failure mode of the material was transgranular. Both the initiation and growth of the fatigue cracks were transgranular. QC 20160905 </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} shear sensor calibrator {{consists of}} a rotating wheel with the sensor mounted tangential to the <b>rim</b> and <b>positioned</b> {{in close proximity to}} the rim. The shear stress generated by the flow at the sensor position is simply tau(sub omega) = (mu) r(omega) /h, where mu is the viscosity of the ambient gas, r the wheel radius, omega the angular velocity of the wheel, and h the width of the gap between the wheel rim and the sensor. With numerical values of mu = 31 (mu) Pa s (neon at room temperature), r = 0. 5 m, omega = 754 /s (7200 rpm), and h = 50. 8 m, a shear stress of tau(sub omega) = 231 Pa can be generated. An analysis based on one-dimensional flow, with the flow velocity having only an angular component {{as a function of the}} axial and radial coordinates, yields corrections to the above simple formula for the curvature of the wheel, flatness of the sensor, and finite width of the wheel. It is assumed that the sensor mount contains a trough (sidewalls) to render a velocity release boundary condition at the edges of the rim. The Taylor number under maximum flow conditions is found to be 62. 3, sufficiently low to obviate flow instability. The fact that the parameters entering into the evaluation of the shear stress can be measured to high accuracy with well-defined uncertainties makes the proposed calibrator suitable for a physical standard for shear stress calibration...|$|R
40|$|By {{surveying}} {{current research}} of various micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) shear stress sensor development efforts we illustrate {{the wide variety}} of methods used to test and characterize these sensors. The different methods of testing these sensors make comparison of results difficult in some cases, and also this comparison is further complicated by the different formats used in reporting the results of these tests. The fact that making these comparisons can be so difficult at times clearly illustrates a need for standardized testing and reporting methodologies. This need indicates that the development of a national or international standard for the calibration of MEMS shear stress sensors should be undertaken. As a first step towards the development of this standard, two types of devices are compared and contrasted. The first type device is a laminar flow channel with two different versions considered: the first built with standard manufacturing techniques and the second with advanced precision manufacturing techniques. The second type of device is a new concept for creating a known shear stress consisting of a rotating wheel with the sensor mounted tangentially to the <b>rim</b> and <b>positioned</b> in close proximity to the rim. The shear stress generated by the flow at the sensor position is simply tau = (mu) r(omega) /h, where mu is the viscosity of the ambient gas, r the wheel radius, omega the angular velocity of the wheel, and h the width of the gap between the wheel rim and the sensor.

40|$|AbstractThe {{vertebrate}} {{inner ear}} is structurally complex, consisting of fluid-filled tubules and sensory organs that subserve {{the functions of}} hearing and balance. The epithelial parts of the inner ear are derived from the otic placode, which deepens to form a cup before closing to form the otic vesicle. We fate-mapped {{the rim of the}} otic cup to monitor the cellular movements associated with otocyst formation and to aid in interpreting the changing gene expression patterns of the early otic field.

40|$|Magma {{upwelling}} forming volcanic plumbing {{systems in}} back arc settings is typically controlled by extensional tectonic {{structures of the}} upper crust. Here we investigate this process in the area between the volcanic arc of the Aeolian Islands and the Calabrian arc (SE Tyrrhenian Sea) by integrating morpho-bathymetry and reflection seismic data with the outcomes of “Inverse 3 D magnetic modeling” of previously gathered aeromagnetic data. Morpho-bathymetric data highlight {{the presence of a}} seamount ~ 10 km offshore Capo Vaticano Promontory (eastern Calabria). This feature, named Capo Vaticano seamount is composed of a series of NE-trending ridges, the greatest of which (R 1) is ~ 12 km long, and 2. 4 km wide, displays asymmetric flanks with a landward steep slope, oblique morphological steps and elongated NE-trending <b>rims.</b> The <b>position</b> of the R 1 ridge summit fits the Reduced-To-the-Pole peak of a high-intensity magnetic anomaly straddling Capo Vaticano Promontory and its offshore prolongation. Seismic and bathymetric data highlight two extensional fault systems affecting the offshore of Capo Vaticano Promontory during the Plio-Pleistocene: a) a Pliocene NW-trending, SW-dipping normal fault system, and b) a Pleistocene NE-trending, SE-dipping normal fault system. The younger system is composed of a series of en-echelon branching normal faults bounding {{the eastern side of the}} R 1 ridge. Aeromagnetic data modeling imaged a complex 3 D-magnetized body below the R 1 ridge exhibiting a sub-vertical conduit-like structure in the shallow part, and a NE-striking, sheet-like shape inclined by 45 ° in depth. The location of the sub-vertical conduit coincides with the summit of the R 1 ridge. The magma uprising at the root of the volcano was controlled by the Pliocene NW-trending faults whereas its further upwards migration was ostensibly controlled by the Pleistocene NE-trending faults. Both fault systems are responsible for the high level of fracturing that likely favored the up-ward migration of magma. The younger extensional systems also controls the present-day, mantle derived, fluid escapes observed at the summit of the R 1 ridge. Relying on seismic stratigraphic evidence as well as the polarity of the magnetic anomaly, the R 1 ridge probably started to form during the Olduvai chron (early Pleistocene, 1. 81 - 1. 96 Ma). Accordingly, the Capo Vaticano volcano may represent the result of magmatic activity that predates the Aeolian volcanic arc...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction and point registration, which are fundamental topics of numerous applications {{in the area of}} computer vision. First, we propose the multiple epipolar lines (MEL) shape recovery method for 3 D reconstruction from an image sequence captured under circular motion. This method involves recovering the 3 D shape by reconstructing a set of 3 D <b>rim</b> curves. The <b>position</b> of each point on a 3 D rim curve is estimated by using three or more views. Two or more of these views are chosen close to each other to guarantee good image point matching, while one or more views are chosen far from these views to properly compensate for the error introduced in the triangulation scheme by the short baseline of the close views. Image point matching among all views is performed using a new method that suitably combines epipolar geometry and cross-correlation. Second, we develop the one line search (OLS) method for estimating the 3 D model of an object from a sequence of images. The recovered object comprises a set of 3 D rim curves. The OLS method determines the image point correspondences of each 3 D point through a single line search along the ray defined by the camera center and each two-dimensional (2 D) point where a photo-consistency index is maximized. In accordance with the approach, the search area is independently reduced to a line segment on the number of views. The key advantage of the proposed method is that only one variable is focused on in defining the corresponding 3 D point, whereas the approaches for multiple-view stereo typically exploit multiple epipolar lines and hence require multiple variables. Third, we propose the expectation conditional maximization for point registration (ECMPR) algorithm to solve the rigid point registration problem by fitting the problem into the framework of maximum likelihood with missing data. The unknown correspondences are handled via mixture models. We derive a maximization criterion based on the expected complete-data log-likelihood. Then, the point registration problem can be solved by an instance of the expectation conditional maximization algorithm, that is, the ECMPR algorithm. Experiments with synthetic and real data are presented in each section. The proposed approaches provide satisfactory and promising results. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
