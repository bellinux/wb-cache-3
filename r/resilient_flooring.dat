50|$|The Resilient Floor Covering Institute (RFCI) is a U.S. {{industry}} trade group representing manufacturers of <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring,</b> primarily made of vinyl. It is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 Metro began testing new <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> on four 6000-series cars (6104+6105, 6142+6143). They {{announced}} in November 2013 that {{within two years}} all 5000- and 6000-series cars would feature the new floors.|$|E
50|$|Materials {{almost always}} {{classified}} as floor covering include carpet, area rugs, and <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> such as linoleum or vinyl flooring.

50|$|Unlike tiles {{which are}} made of minerals, <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> is made of {{materials}} that have some elasticity, giving the flooring a degree of flexibility called resilience. The flooring is available in large sheets or pre-cut tiles, and either comes with pre-applied adhesive for peel-and-stick installation or requires adhesive to be troweled on to the substrate. <b>Resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> includes many different manufactured products including linoleum, sheet vinyl, vinyl composition tile (VCT), cork (sheet or tile), and rubber. Performance surfaces used for dance or athletics are usually made of wood or resilient flooring.The two basic categories of vinyl floor tiles are solid vinyl and vinyl composition, and the three basic categories of vinyl sheet flooring are homogeneous, inlaid, and layered composite. These types of vinyl flooring differ in manufacturing process and content, ranging in vinyl (polyvinyl chloride) content from 11% to 55%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> products, such as PVC and {{polypropylene}} {{are becoming}} more popular in specialty applications such as trailer flooring and garage flooring. New applications have also emerged for marine flooring. There are important factors to consider in specialty applications, {{that may not be}} present in a typical application. For example, certain tires will leave marks on PVC flooring but those marks will be less prevalent on polypropylene products. Adhesives also change based on application.|$|E
50|$|The planned midlife {{rehabilitation}} of the 5000-series cars was {{to take place in}} the late 2010s through the early 2020s.

Over the last years many comparisons between in situ measurements and empirical estimations have been made, and the results show indisputably great differences between the results obtained through estimation models and the measured data {{for this type of}} floors. In this work an experimental approach to this problem is presented and a reference curve of impact sound pressure level for beam and block floors made by hollow clay blocks is proposed in order to provide representative field values for <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> starting from the reduction of impact sound pressure level measured in the laboratory on a homogeneous isotropic concrete slab floor...|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of household adaptation, different classifications of adaptation measures have been constructed, but classifications of adaptive households are rare. Harvatt et al. (2011) categorized households into active and non-active types; non-active households respond with a do-nothing strategy {{as a result of}} denying the risk or living with it, whereas active households take reducing or changing measures. By classifying the measures undertaken by households, Thurston et al. (2008) categorize flood resistance and resilience measures into categories of temporary resistance (e.g. installing door guards), of permanent resistance (e.g. permanent flood proof external doors), of resilience without <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> (e.g. raising electrics) and of resilience with <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> (e.g. sealed floors). Linnekamp et al. (2011) categorize flood protection into individual actions, such as raising the level of own yards, and collective actions, such as assisting neighbours in undertaking protective measures. Classifications of adaptation measures and of households with regard to their adaptation behaviour also exist in studies on river flooding. Precautionary river flooding measures can be categorized according to their costs and efforts: low-cost measures (e.g. relocation of water-sensitive objects), medium-cost measures (e.g. flood-adopted interior fitting) and high-cost measures (e.g. flood proof air conditioning) are mentioned as household and household business measures by Kreibich et al. (2011). Adaptive behaviour can also be classified into protection against financial risks (by purchasing insurances), acquisition of information about precaution and precaution itself, by flood-proofing and retrofitting property (e.g. adapting use of building) (Thieken et al. 2007). An example of a classification of specifically structural protection measures is the one study carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA London (2008)), which distinguishes between measures at property-level (e.g. against the entry of water into the house) and resilience (reduction of damaging by entered water). The classification methods applied in these studies differ; ad-hoc classifications are frequently used, whereas systematic approaches, such as statistical ones, have not been used extensively in the literature on household-level adaptation to coastal and river flooding.|$|E
40|$|Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) {{flooring}} {{products in}} the form of flexible sheets and tiles dominate the <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> market. These flooring products are produced by calendering compounds based on vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer filled with calcium carbonate, essentially with plasticizers and other additives. Plasticizers have become matter of concern from indoor air quality (IAQ) point of view as they are suspected to be the one of the sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, considered harmful to human health. In the research work reported here, polyolefin elastomers (POE) filled with calcium carbonate filler are prepared and their mechanical properties are evaluated as an alternative to poly(vinyl chloride), PVC matrix for flooring products. POEs are olefin copolymers synthesized using metallocene technology and does not require plasticizers for processing, yet can provide similar flexibility to the finished product as that of plasticized PVC. Also, POE can incorporate relatively higher amounts of post consumer polyethylene (PC-PE) while maintaining adequate properties. The POE used in this study is Engage- 8440, which is an ethylene-octene copolymer. Two types of PC-PE are studied in this research: the first one is a 50 - 50 mixture of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) and the second is a high density polyethylene (HDPE). The mechanical and thermal properties, as well as the technique is used to study the difference in thermal properties of the two recycled resins. Further, heat and UV stabilizers are added and the tensile properties of POE/PC-PE blend composites are tested for accelerated weathering effects. As a result of the present study, an alternative flooring material is attempted with appreciable properties, such as Young's modulus, tensile strength at break and yield point, elongation at break, impact, hardness and static load limit values...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn France, people aged over 60 {{represent}} 20 % of {{the population}} (more than 80 years: 3. 4 %). Because of their age, they are fragile, frail and isolated, so {{it is necessary to}} implement systems that overcome these disabilities. Today, there are about 800, 000 people dependent in France (1. 2 million in 2040). In this context, techniques for locating the person can limit the risk of falls and assist the person by observing his life scenarios. These techniques take into account the project life of the elderly by including particular needs and consequences of falls. Various technologies exist for localization. The impact of these technologies is illustrated by several technical solutions and in particular by the example of smart floor. Falls are the leading cause of accidental death among for people over 65. 8 500 deaths and 91 000 hospitalizations per year are related to fractures of the femur and legs, that occur on average one out of three (27 % for 65 - 70 years and 44 % for over 90 years). Falls also create social implications such as isolation or dependency. The localization of a person in his house can help to ensure a level of security and well-being leading to a vital home maintenance. Indoor localization solutions today use various techniques (ultrasound, RFID technologies, optical or RF triangulation methods). Geographical detections solutions using the floor itself consist in placing a thin layer of detectors under <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring.</b> The detectors are connected to an external electronic interface managed by specific software which allows to launch real-time alert in case of fall of the person. A major advantage is that the process is non intrusive because not visible to the person. Thus, it may be better accepted by the elderly. Through its electronics, the floor can be interfaced to automatic or computer equipments. Connected to an intelligent system, the floor can also easily be used to track activity of the person. The overall system connected to the Internet can handle emergency or alarm. It may also assist the individual in his daily tasks, controlling the automatic start of some appliances or multimedia (eg TV), or automatically opening certain doors. The system having the floor sensor can also easily and intelligently manage the lighting or the heating mode for comfort in occupied rooms and in economy mode in the non-occupied rooms. Different scenarios can then more easily be created for optimal management of the housing...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the assessment of}} products from a life cycle perspective. Product life cycles are often dominated by extensive chemical supply chains that lead up to the materials contained in the products and the overwhelming contribution that the production of these chemicals make to the overall life cycle due to their energy intensity. Hence, chemical engineers are uniquely positioned to carry out significant components of this assessment because of their skills in chemical process design and analysis. Furthermore, the complexity and extent of life cycle concerns creates opportunities for new process systems tools to be developed to support product design and analysis. The specific thesis objectives are threefold. The first is to develop a systematic methodology to optimize material selections for a product based on life cycle inventory (LCI) characteristics. The second is to use this methodology combined with sustainability assessment standards to assess whether these standards are congruent with life cycle assessment. The third is to develop an approach to design product sustainability assessment standards that are clear and consistent with life cycle principles. The overall contributions will be in the applied domain of life cycle assessment and its integration into standards setting, and in contributions to optimization tools and methods. The three objectives will be illustrated in the domain of carpet systems. Previous research has generated a substantial database of gate-to-gate (GTG) life cycle inventories for various chemicals that make up carpet, extending from the inputs to the final carpet mill back to the natural resources such as oil, natural gas and mined calcium carbonate. Carpet recycling is a promising alternative approach for reducing life cycle impacts and is being practiced at a growing scale in the U. S. This thesis uses the specific individual LCI gate-to-gate blocks for virgin materials and for important carpet recycling and general polymer recycling processes. A database for the GTG LCI will be used to construct a virtual chemical tree that automatically that represents the potential cradle-to-gate (CTG) use of resources. The alternatives for each possible route for the product will be generated, and optimization approaches will be applied to optimize the performance of the carpet system according to life cycle objectives. Sustainability assessment standards are currently being developed for a range of building products, such as carpet, <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring,</b> commercial textile coverings and office furniture. This activity has been stimulated through the considerable success of the U. S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) LEED standard. The LEED Standard is points-based: the building design and construction earns points for having certain attributes or promoting certain activities. The points are totaled and then the building earns a rating based on the total being above a certain threshold. The second thesis objective is met through extending the LCI optimization methodology to represent point-based standards. A product can then be optimized to maximize the number of points it earns or to minimize its life cycle attributes. This approach can be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} an emerging carpet sustainability standard, NSF- 140, in integrating LCI into the standard. The last objective, standard design, is approached through designing the tables that award points in the standard to be consistent with life cycle information. Certain minimum principles of consistency are articulated and then the designs shown to be consistent with these principles in the case that the life cycle impact assessment method maps the life cycle inventory to impact through a linear weighting.

This thesis {{explores the}} uses, appearance and making of Linoleum in Sweden {{in the twentieth}} century with focus on Linoleum {{as a part of the}} modernistic movement. 2 ̆ 028 Linoleum was invented by Fredrick Walton in the eighteen-sixties and had one hundred years of popularity until its decline in the nineteen-sixties. It is composed of oxidised linseed oil mixed with cork or wooden flour and pigment. Patterns are made in several different ways. The most common method was to make prints on linoleum. This way it was possible to achieve complicated and detailed patterns using many different colours, and to an affordable price. Many of the patterns of the early twentieth century were made to imitate more exclusive materials such as carpets and parquet wooden flooring. Tile and stone imitations were also common. A more durable pattern could be created by mixing different coloured granulats and produce a streaked pattern such as granite, marble or jaspé. Inlaid linoleum is the third version of making patterns. It is made my puzzling different coloured pieces together by hand or in a mold. Sweden has only had one linoleum factory. This is Forshaga Linoleum, a company that was established in 1891. There was a lot of collaborations between Forshaga Linoleum and the manufacturers in the rest of Europe, as the knowledge and the machines were all imported from already existing factories. In 1928 there was a business treaty between Forshaga linoleum and thirteen other factories in Europe, among them Deutsche linoleum werke (DLW). DLW exited the organisation at the start of World War II. There were also other similar <b>resilient</b> <b>flooring</b> materials invented during this period. During World War II there was a shortage of linseed oil and there were experiments with other binders. For the Swedish factory this resulted in a material known as forbolin, a material based on cellulose nitrate that was produced 1942 - 44. Another material produced was the felt base flooring, a flooring that only has a thin printed protective surface and is made as a cheap and less lasting alternative. Vinyl flooring also began being produced in the nineteen-forties, and eventually came to dominate the market. In the very beginning of the twentieth century linoleum was a very novel and exclusive material. In Swedish middle class homes it was often bought as a smaller carpet and given a prominent place under the dining room table. A few decades later this had changed and linoleum had become an ordinary flooring often used in kitchens and hallways where easy cleaning was essential. Modernism in Sweden brought big changes regarding how linoleum was viewed and how it was used in homes and public spaces. It was the perfect material for the new architecture, since it was practical, affordable and very versatile as it came in various colours and patterns. Forshaga Linoleum wanted to be closely associated with the modernism movement and this is visible in their marketing strategies. Due to Sweden’s strong economic growth there was big increase in housing construction with the intention to improve living standards for the population, and linoleum was widely used in the new architecture. 2 ̆ 02...|$|E
30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any floor finishing material or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft <b>resilient</b> <b>floor</b> finishing material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare floor without finishing.|$|R
