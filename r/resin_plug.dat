50|$|Female {{is larger}} than the male, about 12mm. Abdomen is triangular, and spinnerets {{pointing}} downwards and the hind-end pointing backwards. The body has silvery spots and has long and thin legs. Male has bumps on their head. After mating, male seals the epigyne of the female with a <b>resin</b> <b>plug</b> to inhibit further copulation.|$|E
40|$|A filter-XAD- 2 <b>resin</b> <b>plug</b> {{high-volume}} air sampler {{was used}} to collect particulate (P) and gaseous (G) phases of seven pesticides (atrazine, terbuthylazine, alachlor, metolachlor, cymoxanil, diflufenicanil, and fenoxaprop-p-ethyl) and two metabolites (de-ethylatrazine (DEA) and de-ethylterbuthylazine (DET)) in downtown Strasbourg (France). Most of the molecules listed above {{were found to be}} associated only with particulate aerosols and only four of them were detected regularly in both atmospheric phases (particulate and gaseous). The results presented in this work showed that models developed previously to describe the gas/particle (G/P) partitioning did not work for currently used pesticides. A new partition equation (Korg, m 3 ng 1) was defined for the pesticides under study using environmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and organic carbon content of atmospheric aerosols.

Coarsely crushed samples (25 g) were first treated with HCl for 2 h to remove carbonates and HF and HCl for 4 h on a hot plate at 97 °C twice to remove silicate minerals. After 1 week, the solution was centrifuged with heavy liquid to separate kerogen. The kerogen was embedded in a <b>resin</b> <b>plug</b> and polished to a flat shiny surface. Measurements {{of the percentage of}} incident light reflected from vitrinite particles under oil immersion were conducted using Carl Zeiss MPM- 03 at a magnification of × 500. Reflectance with a digital indicator was calibrated on a glass standard in oil. Vitrinite reflectance data (% Ro) are listed in Table  1, and typical histograms are shown in Figure  3 b.|$|E
30|$|Chemical water {{shut off}} {{technology}} {{is the most effective}} way to solve the problems which channels cause. Chemical water shut off agents can be divided into non selective water shutoff agents and selective water shutoff agents according to their action mechanism. Selective water shutoff agents are studied in the laboratory, but the actual application examples are less; non-selective water shutoff agents have been matured after a lot of study; many varieties have been developed including cement, calcium silicate, resin, gel and so on (Xin et al. 2010; Van Eijden et al. 2005). Among them the cement shutoff agent is the earliest used shutoff agent that has the advantages of low price, high strength, wide applicable temperature range and simple operational procedure. It is still the most widely used water shutoff agent. But it has the following disadvantages: its particles are too big to go easily into the medium and low permeability layer, and its plugging strength is not high; it is not acid-proof; it has poor liquidity, and high operational risk. The main advantage of resin shutoff agents is insolubility and infusibility after consolidation, acid-proof and alkali-proof, stable properties, and its high strength. It is an ideal material for water shutoff. But resin shutoff agents exist as a kind of solution before consolidation, because formation heterogeneity inevitably leads to non-linear flow which makes plugged oil layer non-full and ineffective. How we improve <b>resin</b> <b>plugging</b> ability is one important influence factor. By researching curing time control, system thickening agents and phase filling, the filling phase, modified urea–formaldehyde resin water shutoff agent, is developed and has good plugging performance.|$|R
50|$|These plugs can be {{installed}} {{in a variety of}} different ways in order to create the correct degree of strength needed for the fin to function. The more common method is to drill the plug hole {{at the end of the}} shaping process and then secure the plug in the hole with <b>resin.</b> The <b>plug</b> attaches through the use of the “H-pattern” which binds at both the deck and bottom of the board fiberglass to the plug which provide the most strength at the fin without permanent installation through glassing on (same as laying on fiberglass). A version of FCS (Fusion) had been designed to {{be installed}} before the surfboard blank is covered with fiberglass and is the preferred version of FCS for epoxy surfboards.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFoulden Maar, Otago, New Zealand, is an Early Miocene maar-diatreme volcano with {{a crater}} filled by highly {{fossiliferous}} lacustrine diatomite. Since investigations began in late 2003, several thousand exquisitely preserved macro- and microfossils {{have been collected}} from plants and animals that lived in or around the maar-lake. The flora includes ferns, leaves with cuticle, flowers with pollen, fruits, seeds and wood, which, together with pollen data, are indicative of a diverse subtropical Lauraceae-dominated rainforest growing on volcanic soils around the lake. Diverse, mainly ground-dwelling insects and spiders from eight orders and arthropod- plant interactions show that arthropods were {{a key component of}} the forest ecosystem. Aquatic taxa include fish, diatoms, sponges, Chrysophyceae, a few water plants and insects. The majority of arthropods from Foulden Maar have close representatives in the modern fauna, but many of the plant taxa are now extinct in New Zealand. Together, these fossils provide an unrivalled opportunity to reconstruct a well-dated Southern Hemisphere, mid-latitude, earliest Miocene lacustrine/forest ecosystem. Recently, amber from the South Island, New Zealand has become an exceptional novel paleontological source for terrestrial microorganisms and arthropods with an otherwise poor fossil record. Amber is nearly ubiquitous in coal/lignite and non-carbonaceous sediments throughout the South Island but no animal inclusions and only a few floral remains have been recognised until now. In an ongoing study, we have collected amber from the Upper Cretaceous, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene, including discrete blocks, rounded "amberpebbles", millimetre-sized drops, sometimes associated with wood, and tiny <b>resin</b> <b>plugs</b> on leaf fossils. The preliminary study of these samples has revealed a range of well-preserved inclusions, including (1), araucariacean wood, (2), fungi, (3), sheathed prokaryotic filaments, (4), arachnids such as mites, a possible tick and spiders, (5), springtails (Collembola), and (6), insects including beetles, dipterans, hymenopterans, hemipterans, and lepidopterans. These finds attest to the quality of New Zealand amber inclusions and their remarkable potential for reconstructing past terrestrial ecosystems...|$|R
