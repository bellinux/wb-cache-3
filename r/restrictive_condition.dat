2500|$|The {{assignment}} of orientational symbols to physical quantities and {{the requirement that}} physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually {{be used in a}} way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems. [...] In this approach one sets up the dimensional equation and solves it as far as one can. [...] If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral. [...] This puts it into [...] "normal form". [...] The orientational equation is then solved to give a more <b>restrictive</b> <b>condition</b> on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives. Often the added information is that one of the powers of a certain variable is even or odd.|$|E
2500|$|Conditional {{mutation}} is a mutation {{that has}} wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain [...] "permissive" [...] environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain [...] "restrictive" [...] conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (<b>restrictive</b> <b>condition),</b> but might have no deleterious consequences {{at a lower}} temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations {{in other parts of}} the genome. In vivo mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox Recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss of function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease is}} theorized {{to include the}} artery of the ligmentum teres femoris being {{constricted}} or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. [...] The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. [...] LCP disease is a vascular <b>restrictive</b> <b>condition</b> of idiopathic nature. [...] Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. [...] Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. [...] For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year- old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics {{do not appear to}} be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.|$|E
