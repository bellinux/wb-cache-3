25|$|The early proofs of {{quadratic}} reciprocity {{are relatively}} unilluminating. The situation changed when Gauss used Gauss sums {{to show that}} quadratic fields are subfields of cyclotomic fields, and implicitly deduced quadratic reciprocity from a <b>reciprocity</b> <b>theorem</b> for cyclotomic fields.

This proof served as a template for class field theory, which {{can be viewed as}} a vast generalization of quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the claim}} is {{commonly}} made that two-way HF propagation along a given path is reciprocal, that is, if the signal from location A reaches location B at a good strength, the signal from location B will be similar at station A because the same path is traversed in both directions. However, the ionosphere is far too complex and constantly changing to support the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>theorem.</b> The path is never exactly the same in both directions. In brief, conditions at the two terminii of a path generally cause dissimilar polarization shifts, dissimilar splits into ordinary rays and extraordinary or Pedersen rays which have difference propagation characteristics {{due to differences in}} ionization density, shifting zenith angles, effects of the Earth's magnetic dipole contours, antenna radiation patterns, ground conditions and other variables.|$|E

2500|$|The proof for {{arbitrary}} extensions uses a homomorphism {{from the}} group G onto the profinite completion of the integers with kernel G∞, or in other words a compatible sequence of homomorphisms of G onto the cyclic groups of order n for all n, with kernels G'n. These homomorphisms are constructed using cyclic cyclotomic extensions of fields; for finite fields they are given by the algebraic closure, for non-archimedean local fields they are given by the maximal unramified extensions, and for global fields they are slightly more complicated. As these extensions are given explicitly one can check that they [...] have the property that H2(G/G'n) is cyclic of order n, with a canonical generator. It follows from this that for any layer E, the group H2(E/E∩G∞) is canonically isomorphic to Q/Z. This idea of using roots of unity was introduced by Chebotarev in his proof of Chebotarev's density theorem, and used shortly afterwards by Artin to prove his <b>reciprocity</b> <b>theorem.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One-way wave {{equations}} conveniently describe {{wave propagation}} in media with discontinuous and/or rapid variations in one direction, but with smooth and slow {{variations in the}} complementary trans-verse directions. In the past, <b>reciprocity</b> <b>theorems</b> have been developed in terms of one-way wave fields. The boundaries of the integration volumes and the variations of the medium parameters must adhere to strict conditions. The variations must have the smoothness required by pseudo-differential operators, while the boundaries have to be flat. To extend the applicability to nonflat boundaries, this paper formulates one-way wave equations and corresponding <b>reciprocity</b> <b>theorems</b> in terms of curvilinear coordinates of the semiorthogonal (SO) type. In SO coordinate systems, one of the covariant basis vectors is orthogonal to the others, which can be nonorthogonal among each other. The same applies to the contravariant basis vectors. Furthermore, the orthogonal directions coincide; that is, the orthogonal co- and contravariant basis vectors coincide. SO coordinates are characterized by a local property of the basis vectors. An extra specification is necessary to make them conform {{in any way to}} nonflat boundaries. This can be done in terms of so-called lateral Cartesian (LC) coordinates.

Carlitz proved that these polynomials satisfy the reciprocity law (v- 1) c(u,v;a,b) + (u- 1) c(v,u;b,a) = u^(a- 1) v^(b- 1) - 1, from which one easily deduces many classical <b>reciprocity</b> <b>theorems</b> for the Dedekind sum and its generalizations.
