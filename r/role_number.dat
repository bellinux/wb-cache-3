It was empirically confirmed that EIs offer two categories of services: transaction-creating and physical-fulfillment services. It was postulated that {{the extent to which}} an EI offers these types of services is influenced by a set of factors that are internally-, product-, market-, supplier-, and buyer-related. Empirical tests on a sample of 135 British EIs established that an EI's exporting <b>role,</b> <b>number</b> of employees, amount of undifferentiated products carried, number of suppliers, and number of countries served all have a direct impact on an EI's service-offering behavior. © 2000 JIBS.

40|$|Objectives: There {{has been}} limited {{research}} examining how organizational factors {{are associated with the}} level of confidence of residential aged care staff in managing both residents 2 ̆ 7 depression and the behavioural and psychological symptoms of residents with dementia (BPSD). This study investigated this issue. Method: A cross-sectional study design was employed. In total, 255 aged care staff (131 senior staff, 124 junior staff) from 21 residential care facilities participated in the study. All staff completed measures of self-efficacy in managing BPSD as well as confidence in working with older people with depression. They also completed measures of organizational climate (autonomy, cohesion, trust, pressure, support, recognition, fairness and encouragement of innovation) and measures of workplace experience (job <b>role,</b> <b>number</b> of years working in aged care facilities), job stress and satisfaction, and knowledge of depression. Results: The results demonstrated that autonomy, trust, support, and job stress were associated with confidence in managing BPSD, while the factors related to confidence in managing depression were autonomy, support, job stress, job satisfaction, and knowledge of depression. Conclusion: These findings highlight that organizational climate factors need to be addressed in order to increase staff confidence in managing BPSD and depression. In particular, the findings demonstrate the importance of fostering organizational environments in which autonomy is promoted and there is support and cooperation among aged care staff. Attention to these factors is likely to increase the confidence of staff as they carry out their carer role...|$|E
40|$|Background Innovations {{to improve}} {{identification}} of physiological decline in hospitalised patients rely on timely measurement of vital signs. However, {{studies have indicated}} observations may be delayed or omitted, especially during night shifts. Aim To improve our understanding of patient surveillance at night through a description of knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of nurses working night shifts. Methods In June 2015, we sent email invitations to a web-based survey to all registered nurses, midwives, and health care support staff working in a 1200 -bed NHS hospital Trust. We used exploratory factor analysis to correlate survey items. Using multivariable linear regression we related factor scores with nurse characteristics (e. g. role, experience) to predict nurses’ knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vital signs observations. Results Of 695 surveys received, 497 (71. 5 %) respondents worked at least one night shift (RN 321 (64. 59 %); HCSW 120 (24. 14 %); midwives 24 (4. 83 %); student nurses 32 (6. 45 %)). Survey items correlated into four factors. Nurses with greater experience believed workload and capacity to impact work at night (factor 1 : workload and resources). Student nurses and midwives reported greater inclination to prioritise tasks at night. Respondents working more often, or only at night, used knowledge over early warning scores to prioritise tasks during night shifts (factor 2 : prioritisation). <b>Role,</b> <b>number</b> of night shifts worked, and shift patterns affected perceptions of quality of care delivered at night (factor 4 : responsibility & control). Discussion The extraction of four independent factors showed the multidimensional aspect of nurse work at night. Nurse characteristics (role, experience, and number of night shifts worked) associated with completion of care tasks. These correlated to prioritisation strategies of care tasks (attitudes and behaviours) and having {{a sense of control}} over the care at night. Conclusion Results of the regression model indicated the need to understand further how nurse characteristics influence compliance with surveillance protocols in acute care wards...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the <b>role,</b> <b>number,</b> and identity of glutamate (or aspartate) residues involved in cation occlusion on Na+, K(+) -ATPase, using the carboxyl reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). Extensive use is made of selectively trypsinized Na+,K(+) -ATPase [...] the so-called " 19 -kDa membranes" [...] containing a 19 -kDa COOH-terminal, smaller (8 - 11 kDa) membrane-embedded fragments of the alpha chain, and a largely intact beta chain; these membranes have normal Rb+ and Na+ occlusion capacities. The 19 -kDa peptide and a smaller (approximately 9 kDa) unidentified peptide(s) are labeled by [14 C]DCCD in a Rb(+) -protectable fashion. Rb(+) -protected [14 C]DCCD incorporation into the " 19 kDa membranes" and into native Na+,K(+) -ATPase is linearly correlated with inactivation of Rb+ occlusion. Similar linear correlations are observed when Rb(+) -protected [14 C]DCCD incorporation is measured by examination of labeling of 19 -kDa peptide purified from " 19 -kDa membranes" or of alpha chain purified from native enzyme. Stoichiometries, estimated by extrapolation, are as follows: (for " 19 -kDa membranes") close to one DCCD per Rb+ site and one DCCD per 19 -kDa peptide; and (for native enzyme) close to two DCCD per phosphoenzyme and two DCCD per alpha chain. We suggest that each of two K+ (or Na+) sites contains a carboxyl group, one located in the 19 -kDa peptide and one elsewhere in the alpha chain. After cyanogen bromide digestion of purified, labeled alpha chain, or of 19 -kDa peptide, a labeled fragment of apparent M(r) approximately 4 kDa was detected and was identified as that with NH 2 -terminal Lys- 943. Rb(+) -protected [14 C]DCCD incorporation was associated almost exclusively with Glu- 953. We suggest that the cation occlusion "cage" consists of ligating groups donated by different trans-membrane segments and includes two carboxyl groups such as Glu- 953 (and perhaps Glu- 327) as well as neutral groups, in two K+ (or Na+) sites, but only neutral groups in the third Na+ site...|$|E

40|$|Instruction for {{developing}} students 2 ̆ 7 number sense {{is a critical}} area of research in mathematics education because of the <b>role</b> <b>number</b> sense plays in early mathematics learning. Specifically, number system knowledge {{has been identified as}} a key cognitive mechanism in number sense development. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to explore variations in second-grade students 2 ̆ 7 number sense development as they engaged in a counting-focused instructional treatment, geared towards developing number system knowledge, for differing amounts of time. Sixty second-grade students participated in number sense assessments and two students participated in in-depth, task-based interviews to provide quantitative and qualitative data to investigate the change and development of students 2 ̆ 7 number sense during the instructional treatment. A generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis showed an associated average increase in test scores for students participating int 9 weeks of the instructional treatment as compared to students participating in 3 weeks of the instructional treatment. This indicated that the counting-focused instructional treatment influenced and changed students 2 ̆ 7 number sense. An important implication of this result is that it highlights the importance of number sense developing over time with multiple, connected experiences. The in-depth analyses of two cases showed learning growth from pretest to posttest for a low-achieving and high-achieving student. However, the two students 2 ̆ 7 number sense developed in different ways and their access of number system knowledge varied. Shifts in learning mainly occurred after 6 weeks of the instructional treatment and depended on the student 2 ̆ 7 s existing use of number sense. The implication of this result is that the multiple access points and the high-ceiling of the instructional treatment benefited low- and high-achieving students in this study.

40|$|Abstract Background Varicella is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} disease with a significant public health and economic burden, which can be prevented with childhood routine varicella vaccination. Vaccination strategies differ by country. Some factors are known {{to play an important}} <b>role</b> (<b>number</b> of doses, coverage, dosing interval, efficacy and catch-up programmes), however, their relative impact on the reduction of varicella in the population remains unclear. This paper aims to help policy makers prioritise the critical factors to achieve the most successful vaccination programme with the available budget. Methods Scenarios assessed the impact of different vaccination strategies on reduction of varicella disease in the population. A dynamic transmission model was used and adapted to fit Italian demographics and population mixing patterns. Inputs included coverage, number of doses, dosing intervals, first-dose efficacy and availability of catch-up programmes, based on strategies currently used or likely to be used in different countries. The time horizon was 30  years. Results Both one- and two-dose routine varicella vaccination strategies prevented a comparable number of varicella cases with complications, but two-doses provided broader protection due to prevention of a higher number of milder varicella cases. A catch-up programme in susceptible adolescents aged 10 – 14  years old reduced varicella cases by 27 – 43  % in older children, which are often more severe than in younger children. Coverage, for all strategies, sustained at high levels achieved the largest reduction in varicella. In general, a 20  % increase in coverage resulted in a further 27 – 31  % reduction in varicella cases. When high coverage is reached, the impact of dosing interval and first-dose vaccine efficacy had a relatively lower impact on disease prevention in the population. Compared to the long (11  years) dosing interval, the short (5  months) and medium (5  years) interval schedules reduced varicella cases by a further 5 - 13  % and 2 - 5  %, respectively. Similarly, a 10  % increase in first-dose efficacy (from 65 to 75  % efficacy) prevented 2 – 5  % more varicella cases, suggesting it is the least influential factor when considering routine varicella vaccination. Conclusions Vaccination strategies can be implemented differently in each country depending on their needs, infrastructure and healthcare budget. However, ensuring high coverage remains the critical success factor for significant prevention of varicella when introducing varicella vaccination in the national immunisation programme...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This assay {{interprets the}} role and {{function}} of Kresna Dwipayana Wyasa in his own epic of the Mahabharata. This approach is not directly very helpful in improving the performance of puppet theatre, but is scholarly demanded to improve other aspects (i. e. aesthetic, mission, and edification) Of the theatre, or {{to protect it from}} being polluted by too many dirty jokes. This approach partly distinguishes our new academic training education from that of our traditional teaching methods. This interpretation is based on my own exploration of Hindu mythology, theology, and related literature, primarily Sullivan’s three works as listed in the book references. 	To gain a comprehensive overview, this essay begins with a brief discussion of the Mahabharata as the greatest among all the epics we have inherited from the distant past. With 18 Parwas (cantos or books), 1200 chapters, 200, 000 lines of verse, “the Mahabharata is eight times as long as the Ilead and Odyssey put together or three and half times the Bible” (1). One thing that distinguishes the Mahabharata from other epics we inhereted from classical antiquity to the present is that the author, Wyasa, appears as an important character in the epic. Wyasa’s existence in his work evokes various interpretations about his role and function. 	Through a library research, i collect and found nine features that make Wyasa so distinguished. This “Wyasa’s nine roles” is purely my own way of summarizing and synthesizing Wyasa’s significance, because none of the author tell exactly how many role Wyasa really has. The following major discussion will assess Wyasa’s significance in those “nine roles” i. e. (1) as an author, (2) as a dramatic character, (3) as a composer and editor, and (4) as a Vedic disseminator. Wyasa’s debatable status comes into his <b>role</b> <b>number</b> (5) as the patriarch of the epic’s central family and (6) as an incarnation of Narayana Vishnu. Wyasa’s most interesting role is described in number (7) as the earthly counterpart of the god Brahma and (8) as a comparable character to Bisma, concluded with his appropriate role in number (9) as a scholar. 	Regardless of the accuracy of my interpretation, it must be continuously expanded. I believe and expect that this research method will eventually produce new knowledge to complement the skill of Dalang practitioners. All faculty members in the Puppetry (Pedalangan) Department are academically obligated to expand the knowledge of puppetry, either or both as a pure knowledge or as an applied skill. ...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Almost daily the <b>role</b> <b>number</b> {{of roles}} that {{microglia}} {{have been identified}} as playing a role in expands. Once considered to only act as the macrophages of the central nervous system, microglia are now recognised to be ‘master-orchestraters’ of events as diverse as neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, synaptogenesis, vascular remodeling, extracellular matrix remodeling, vascular surveillance and many others. Perhaps {{one of the most interesting}} and enigmatic features of microglia is their capacity to engage in rapid and profound structural reorganization. This ability has thus fascinated many researchers, a phenomenon that is only continued to grow in response to recent real time imaging of the cells in action. Most of is known about microglial structure has come from static two-dimensional images. Detailed morphological characterization of these cells in two dimensions, while significantly less glamorous, than real time multiphoton imaging has nevertheless proven to be an extremely reliable vehicle for revealing and characterizing the fundamental properties of state changes of these cells. Under normal conditions microglia are recognised to exist in the brain with relatively small somas and a number of thin tapering branches radiating out from the cell body. Often, although not always, these branches split and often split again in what is frequently referred to as their secondary and tertiary branching structures. Following exposure to severe environmental disturbances, microglia are known to engage in profound structural reorganization. The specific form that this reorganization takes is somewhat interventions specific but in many cases it will involve marked somal enlargement and significant process simplification and shortening. These changes are ultimately considered to be relevant and informative because they are known to be linked with changes in the specific functions engaged in by microglia. Chapter 2 : At the outset of my studies there had been no quantitative studies to what represented ‘normal’ microglial morphology within uninjured prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC is well documented to play a critical role in mood disturbance and our research group has found evidence that chronic stress induces significant changes in microglial activity in this region. Accordingly, the major aim of Chapter Two was to systematically examine the morphology of microglia (identified by ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule- 1 (Iba- 1) labelling). Here I undertook many hundreds of manual reconstructions across the five cortical layers of the rat PFC. The reconstruction analysis was used to determine the morphometric parameters including the convex hull area, cell body perimeter, total length, total volume, number of processes, number of branch points, and the complexity of cell. Our results revealed that microglial morphology was consistent across all layers by demonstrating as ramified microglia, while there was a variation in cell size. I additionally determined the density of microglia and found no difference in anterior-posterior direction of the PFC. These findings confirmed that microglia represent a relatively homogenous within the healthy PFC. Chapter 3 : Several previous studies have linked expression of the purine ionotropic receptor P 2 X 7, which is primarily found on microglia, with major depression. As chronic stress is recognised to be a significant risk factor in the emergence of major depression. I decided to identify if chronic restraint stress was involved in changes in the expression of P 2 X 7 within the hippocampus. In this study, I utilized an analysis technique recently developed by our group known as cumulative threshold spectra (CTS) to identify if stress altered P 2 X 7 at any of three different time points: acute stress (1 session), chronic stress (21 sessions) and a chronic stress with 7 days recovery time. The findings of this work suggested that exposure to acute or chronic stress significantly reduced the expression of P 2 X 7 receptor within the hippocampus and that levels remained suppressed in recovery period. In addition, the comparative analysis on normalised data showed that the level of the P 2 X 7 reduction was significantly greater in the chronic stress relative to the acute stress group. Furthermore, I found that P 2 X 7 expression rebounded to baseline in 7 days recovery time. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that chronic restraint stress produces markedly a reduction of the P 2 X 7 receptor within the hippocampus. Chapter 4 : In Chapter Four, I investigated how chronic stress influences the roles of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) as it related to disturbances of glutamatergic signaling. Using immunohistochemical analysis, the results showed that there was a reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes, in the hippocampus after exposure to chronic stress, while the expression of Iba- 1 was increased. In addition, I examined how these changes were associated with glutamatergic signalling proteins following chronic stress. Specifically I assessed changes in the expression of the astrocyte specific glutamate transporters EAAT 1 and EAAT 2. The proteins were observed to have opposition changes after stress with a increase in EAAT 1 and a decrease in EAAT 2 expression. Further, I measured the expression of related proteins such as vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT 1), which was increased and AMPA and NMDA subunits (GluA 1, GluA 2, GluN 1, GluN 2 A, GluN 2 B). The AMPA and NMDA subunits showed a complex pattern of changes, however, when taken together with the changes in VLGUT 1 and EAATs 1 and 2 are strongly suggestive of dramatic shift in glutamatergic activity. Together, these findings suggest that chronic stress-induced structural remodelling of astrocytes and microglia may be driven by alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Chapter 5 : Besides the roles of microglia in response to chronic stress-induced mood disorder, previous studies have demonstrated that microglia appear to be the most important cell involved in inflammatory related mood disturbances. The administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is well-validated model of immune challenge producing microglial activation and sickness behaviours in rodents and humans. Recently, these behaviours have become the representative indicator of how peripheral disturbances in immune signalling can disturb quite complex behaviours. Therefore, I examined the alterations of microglial structure within the PFC following the administration of LPS (100 µg/kg/i. p.) in adult male rats. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to analyse the changes in Iba- 1, a specific microglial marker, in the infralimbic and prelimbic of the PFC using a cumulative threshold spectra (CTS) analysis and digital reconstructions. Our results indicated that the somal area of was significantly enlarged, while cell processes became slightly shortened after LPS injection. This data is the first to demonstrate significant microglial alterations within the PFC following LPS administration. Collectively, the experiments clearly outline the complex nature of the structural changes that microglia can undergo in response to routine, yet severe, environmental challenges...|$|E
