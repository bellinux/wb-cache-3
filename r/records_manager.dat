500|$|Later, Vince and Peggy visit a {{local record}} store {{to check out}} Vince's new single, but they are shocked to {{discover}} that the Geneva <b>Records</b> <b>manager</b> gave the song to Mickey Alba, who recorded and released the song himself, thereby stealing Vince's song. Outraged, Vince storms into the label's office and confronts the manager, violently slapping him around. To avoid making the same mistake twice, Vince suggests that he and Peggy should form their own label. They do, naming the new label Laurel Records and hiring an attorney, Mr. Shores (Vaughn Taylor), to oversee their business. Vince then records [...] "Treat Me Nice" [...] and begins pitching it, but it is universally rejected. Peggy convinces her friend, disc jockey Teddy Talbot (Dean Jones), to air the song. He does, and it becomes an immediate hit. Later that evening, Vince asks Peggy out to celebrate the success of his new single, but is disappointed when he learns that she has accepted a dinner date for that evening with Teddy.|$|E
2500|$|After {{having an}} {{interest}} in musicianship and singing during her childhood, Ayiesha Woods released an independent album in 2004, What You Do to Me, {{and went on to}} receive three Gospel Music Marlin Awards that year, including [...] "New Artist of the Year". Gotee <b>Records</b> <b>manager</b> TobyMac discovered her music while visiting Jamaica, and Woods was eventually signed onto the record label. Her Grammy Award-nominated debut album, Introducing Ayiesha Woods, was released in June 2006. The album's single [...] "Happy" [...] garnered popularity on Christian radio in the U.S., and Woods received a Dove Award nomination in 2007, as well. She appeared at several major Christian music festivals during mid-2008, and soon afterward her second album, Love Like This, was released in September.|$|E

To secure its data, US-CERT's center began a DHS certification and accreditation process in May 2006 and expected to complete it by {{the first quarter of}} fiscal year 2007. As of March 2007, the center had no retention schedule approved by the National Archives and Records Administration and until it does, has no [...] "disposition schedule"—its [...] "records must be considered permanent and nothing may be deleted". As of April 2013, DHS still had no retention schedule but was working [...] "with the NPPD <b>records</b> <b>manager</b> to develop disposition schedules". An update was issued in May 2016.|$|E

2500|$|By 1982, South African guitarist, singer-songwriter and {{producer}} Trevor Rabin {{had moved to}} Los Angeles and sent a tape with several demos to record labels {{with the intent of}} releasing a fourth solo album. During this time, Atlantic <b>Records</b> <b>manager</b> Phil Carson, a long time fan and associate of Yes, sought for new musicians to work with Squire and White, was introduced to Rabin by producer Mutt Lange, with whom Rabin used to work as a session musician. Carson invited Rabin to meet and play with Squire and White in London; Rabin recalled the first sessions [...] "didn't sound great but it felt good ... {{there was a lot of}} potential", causing him to turn down an offer from RCA Records as he wished to work with a [...] "great rhythm section". The three began to develop songs for an album using most of Rabin's demos. His songs, including [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", [...] "Hold On", and [...] "Changes", were more commercial and pop-oriented and less complex in structure. With such a direction, Squire recruited original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye who left in 1971, feeling Kaye's simpler style of playing was more suitable to their new music. Horn followed suit as a potential lead singer, but after unsuccessful rehearsals, opted to become their producer.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Ayiesha Woods {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} an independent album, What You Do to Me, which {{was released in}} 2004. In 2004, {{she was the first}} female musician to receive the [...] "Producer of the Year" [...] award at the Caribbean Gospel Music Marlin Awards. She also received Marlin's [...] "New Artist of the Year" [...] and [...] "Contemporary Vocal Performance of the Year (Female)" [...] awards that year. [...] "Crazy", a song from the album, was being played on local Christian radio where she lived in Jamaica. Gotee <b>Records</b> <b>manager</b> TobyMac was visiting the area for an interview, and heard her song on the local station Love 101. After Caribbean Hour host Arnold Kelly played a few of Woods' songs for him, TobyMac obtained her contact info and called her as soon as he returned to the United States. Initially in disbelief upon receiving the call, Ayiesha Woods said, [...] "I wasn’t home when he first called ... I couldn't believe [...]" [...] A few weeks later he invited Woods and her family to a concert he was slated to perform at in Texas, where they met in person. She was soon signed onto his record label, and went in studio to record material for a new album.|$|E

40|$|Research problem: Cloud {{computing}} {{has become}} an important topic in many organisations, due to the benefits it can provide to businesses and their operations. This increased interest in cloud computing is also reflected in the records management profession. However, <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> using cloud computing {{need to be aware}} of many factors that could negatively affect control of their records, and be able to manage these potential implications. This study aims to discover the level of involvement that <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> have in decision-making relating to cloud computing, and also to determine how informed <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> are about the implications of cloud computing. Methodology: The research design used was a cross-sectional study, with an online web survey being distributed to members of the NZRecords mailing list (an e-mail list for the New Zealand recordkeeping community). Results: The results of this study highlight that <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> have low levels of involvement in cloud computing decision-making, and mostly do not believe that their opinions will influence decisions about cloud computing in their organisations. The findings of the survey reveal awareness of the potential implications of cloud computing is high, although more resources and training should be made available to these <b>records</b> <b>managers,</b> especially in the area of portability and interoperability of records in the cloud. Implications: Requests are made for additional training resources to be made available. Suggestions are made for further research into the factors affecting records managers’ involvement in cloud computing decisions...|$|R

40|$|The book {{covers a}} wide range of recent issues and controversies related to the mission and work of archivists and <b>records</b> <b>managers.</b> The essays {{contained}} in it consider both the practical issues of administering records and the much more contentious issues related to public policy and recordkeeping. The book is intended to push both archivists and <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> to reconsider their notions of the ethical dimension of their work and how they define their societal and organizational priorities. The book explores current issues confronting records professionals - such as censorship, intellectual property, truth and recordkeeping, and the control of government records and information - that may seem to threaten the integrity of their work and redefine {{the way in which they}} view their mission. Many of the essays reflect on the notion of whistle-blowing and its implications for archivists and <b>records</b> <b>managers.</b> The book challenges archivists and <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> to re-think their own perspectives about such matters, asking if their professional associations' ethics codes are sufficient, given recent challenges to the control of records and information in government agencies, corporations, and even cultural institutions...|$|R

40|$|Social {{media has}} become entrenched in public {{as well as}} private life. This new media defies {{recordkeeping}} conventions, creating {{a new set of}} challenges for <b>records</b> <b>managers.</b> This research project aimed to discover what methods government agencies in Australia are using to capture public records created on social media sites. It explored the effect of internal and external factors on social media recordkeeping and used the Records Management Continuum Model to examine the extent to which records are being captured. Using a quantitative design comprising a voluntary online questionnaire targeted at government <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> in Australia, it was found that so far only a minority of agencies are capturing social media records and even less believe that their methods are sustainable or compliant. Despite being limited by the sample size and design, this study contributes new knowledge to an emerging research area and, using the Continuum Model, traces how the dynamics of public sector information are changing. It suggests that the best way for <b>records</b> <b>managers</b> to respond to new media is by focusing on building internal relationships and adopting a big-bucket approach to appraisal. The findings provide an indication on how government agencies are currently performing; positing that more research is needed in how Public Records Offices can best support <b>records</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The trial {{typically}} {{goes through}} stages of: initial registration, ongoing record updates, and basic summary result submission. Each trial record {{is administered by}} trial <b>record</b> <b>manager.</b> A trial <b>record</b> <b>manager</b> typically provides initial trial registration prior the study enrolls the first participant. This also facilitates informing potential participants that the trial is no longer recruiting participants. Once all participants were recruited, the trial record may be updated to indicate that is closed to recruitment. Once all measurements are collected (the trial formally completes), the trial status is updated to 'complete'. If the trial terminates for some reason (e.g., lack of enrollment, evidence of initial adverse outcomes), the status may be updated to 'terminated'. Once final trial results are known or legal deadlines are met, the trial <b>record</b> <b>manager</b> may upload basic summary results to the registry either by filling a complex web-based form or submitting a compliant XML file.|$|R
