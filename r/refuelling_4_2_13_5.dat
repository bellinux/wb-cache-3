Among the three compounds, SbRe 2 O 6 exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of isobutane with a high selectivity of 83 % to methacrolein (MAL) +isobutylene at the steady-state conversion of 7 %. The Re–Sb–O catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in situ laser Raman microscopy (LRM). SbRe 2 O 6 decomposed to Re 2 O 7 and Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13</b> partly at the surface under isobutylene oxidation at 673 K, while Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13</b> was stable under the reaction conditions.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{behavior of}} three well-defined Re−Sb−O compounds, SbOReO <b>4</b> · <b>2</b> H <b>2</b> O, Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13,</b> and SbRe <b>2</b> O 6, {{was investigated in}} the selective oxidation of isobutylene to methacrolein at 673 K. We have directed {{our attention to the}} correlation between the catalytic performance of the compounds and their structural and superficial changes undergone under the reaction conditions. For the purpose, the effects of the pretreatment conditions for the catalysts and of the isobutylene/oxygen ratio in the reaction atmosphere on the performance of the catalysts were explored. Each Re−Sb−O compound was characterized before and after the pretreatments and the catalytic reactions by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrocopy, scanning electron microscopy, and in situ laser Raman microscopy. Among the three Re−Sb−O compounds, a novel SbRe 2 O 6 compound exhibited the highest catalytic performance for selective oxidation. The compound underwent a progressive decomposition to Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13</b> and Re <b>2</b> O 7 when pretreated or reacted at 673 K in the presence of oxygen. The decomposition was favored under more oxidative conditions, and a close parallelism between the catalytic performance and the quantity of Re 2 O 7 stabilized at the surface of the catalyst was observed. On the other hand, the activities of pure Re 2 O 7 and a new Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13</b> compound were very low when each of them was used as a catalyst independently. The results indicate that the reactivity of SbRe 2 O 6 is likely due to the presence of Re 2 O 7 at the surface, benefitting from a cooperation with Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13.</b> The model also accounts for the performance of SbOReO <b>4</b> · <b>2</b> H <b>2</b> O. SbOReO <b>4</b> · <b>2</b> H 2 O decomposed to Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13</b> and Re <b>2</b> O 7 regardless of the reaction atmosphere, which explains a higher activity of SbOReO <b>4</b> · <b>2</b> H 2 O than Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13.</b> However, the amount of Re 2 O 7 stabilized at the surface was smaller than that for the case of SbRe 2 O 6, which leads to lower performances of SbOReO <b>4</b> · <b>2</b> H 2 O than those of SbRe 2 O 6...|$|R

40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{performance of}} a novel SbRe 2 O 6 compound has been investigated in the selective oxidation of isobutylene to methacrolein at 673 K. The initial reactivity of the catalyst strongly depended on catalyst pretreatment conditions. The catalyst was more active after pretreatments under more oxidative atmospheres. However, {{the activity of the}} catalyst always reached an identical level at the steady state, independent of the pretreatment conditions. Scanning electron microscopy and in situ confocal Raman microscopy revealed that the reactivity of SbRe 2 O 6 was attributable to the presence at its surface of Re 2 O 7 which benefitted from a cooperation with Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13.</b> The two phases resulted from a partial decomposition of SbRe 2 O 6 in the presence of oxygen. When deposited on Sb <b>4</b> Re <b>2</b> O <b>13,</b> Re <b>2</b> O 7 was stabilized and did not volatilize under the reaction conditions.

Ten RIRs were simulated using an improved image-source method (ISM) [39] with reverberation time (RT 60) ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 s, with an increment of 0.1 s. To learn a high-quality DNN model, all 4620 training utterances from the TIMIT set were convolved with the generated RIRs to build a large multi-condition training set, resulting in about 40 h of reverberant speech at each microphone. To test DNN’s generalization capability in mismatch conditions, RIRs with RT 60 from 0.1 to 1.0 s with the increment of 0.05 s (rather than 0.1 s) were convolved with 100 randomly selected utterances from the TIMIT test set to construct the test set. This resulted in a collection of 19 × 100 reverberant utterances at each microphone.|$|R
