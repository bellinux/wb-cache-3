25|$|Direct {{interaction}} {{refers to}} the user's ability to simply <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> the interface of an application in order to interact with it, {{without the need for}} a mouse or keyboard. Multi-touch contact {{refers to the}} ability to have multiple contact points with an interface, unlike with a mouse, where there is only one cursor. Multi-user experience is a benefit of multi-touch: several people can orient themselves on different sides of the surface to interact with an application simultaneously. Object recognition refers to the device's ability to recognize the presence and orientation of tagged objects placed on top of it.|$|E
25|$|During Charlotte's {{lifetime}} {{friends and}} sponsors visited the parsonage, including Sir James and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, Ellen Nussey, Elizabeth Gaskell, John Store Smith, a young writer from Manchester, Bessie Parkes, who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and Abraham Holroyd, poet, antiquarian, and historian. However, following {{the publication of}} the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way through the crowds of people wanting to <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> the cape of the father of the Brontë girls. The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic. Whenever he agreed to meet them, Patrick received them with utmost courtesy and recounted the story of his brilliant daughters, never omitting to express his displeasure at the opinions held about Charlotte's husband.|$|E

2500|$|At age three, Duncan {{was injured}} in an {{accident}} on the snow that resulted in his becoming cross-eyed and seeing double. In Roots and Branches, his second major book, he wrote: [...] "I had the double reminder always, the vertical and horizontal displacement in vision that later became separated, specialized into a near and a far sight.

60|$|Bertha Kircher {{sat down}} at {{the far side of the}} hut {{awaiting}} she knew not what impending fate. She could not sleep so filled was her mind with wild schemes of escape though each new one must always be discarded as impractical. Half an hour after the warrior had returned her to her prison he rose and entered the hut, where he tried to engage in conversation with her. Groping across the interior he leaned his short spear against the wall and sat down beside her, and as he talked he edged closer and closer until at last he could <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> her. Shrinking, she drew away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I must," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "You don't {{know how}} I've grown to value, to lean upon, him. At times I have {{felt as if}} I always {{wanted him to be}} near me; I like to feel {{wherever}} I am--at the play, at a restaurant, anywhere --that I can <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> him. I know," [...] she continued, [...] "that it's only a wild fancy and that others would laugh at it, but you can understand, can you not--carino caruso mio? And think, darling, in our new life, how busy he, too, will be--making money for all of us--in a new money market. It's just wonderful how he does it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} that struck Hare {{was the way the}} burros in front of him stopped at the curves in the trail, and turned in a space so small that their four feet were close together; yet as they swung their packs they {{scarcely}} scraped the wall. At every turn they were higher than he was, going in the opposite direction, yet he could <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> them. He glanced up to see Mescal right above him, leaning forward with her brown hands clasping the pommel. Then he looked out and down; already the green cluster of cottonwoods lay far below. After that sensations pressed upon him. Round and round, up and up, steadily, surely, the beautiful mustang led the train; there were sounds of rattling stones, and click of hoofs, and scrape of pack. On one side towered the iron-stained cliff, not smooth or glistening at close range, but of dull, dead, rotting rock. The trail changed to a zigzag along a seamed and cracked buttress where ledges leaned outward waiting to fall. Then a steeper incline, where the burros crept upward warily, led to a level ledge heading to the left.|$|E

5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touches</b> adjacent members, <b>and</b> cuffs other members. <b>Reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|R
6000|$|So the Snark {{comes back}} on her course. The breath {{increases}} to a tiny puff. The Snark feels the weight of it and actually heels over a trifle. There is flying scud overhead, and I notice the stars being blotted out. Walls of darkness close in upon me, so that, when the last star is gone, the darkness is so near that it seems I can <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> it on every side. When I lean toward it, I can feel it loom against my face. Puff follows puff, and I am glad the mizzen is furled. Phew! that was a stiff one! The Snark goes over and down until her lee-rail is buried and the whole Pacific Ocean is pouring in. Four or five of these gusts make me wish that the jib and flying-jib were in. The sea is picking up, the gusts are growing stronger and more frequent, {{and there is a}} splatter of wet in the air. There is no use in attempting to gaze to windward. The wall of blackness is within arm's length. Yet I cannot help attempting to see and gauge the blows that are being struck at the Snark. There is something ominous and menacing up there to windward, and I have a feeling that if I look long enough and strong enough, I shall divine it. Futile feeling. Between two gusts I leave the wheel and run forward to the cabin companionway, where I light matches and consult the barometer. [...] "29-90" [...] it reads. That sensitive instrument refuses to take notice of the disturbance which is humming with a deep, throaty voice in the rigging. I get back to the wheel just in time to meet another gust, the strongest yet. Well, anyway, the wind is abeam and the Snark is on her course, eating up easting. That at least is well.|$|E

60|$|However, {{there was}} {{physical}} suffering.
