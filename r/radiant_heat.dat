5|$|The Boston and Maine Railroad built a new, {{more modern}} station in 1952 but reused the 1914-built platforms. This single-story {{building}}, {{located on the}} south side of the tracks at Mt. Vernon and Exchange streets, was in the same flat-roofed brick style as Winchester Center and Wedgemere built five years later. The building was the first on the Boston & Maine system to have <b>radiant</b> <b>heat,</b> and also included a restaurant and newsstand. The 1895-built station was demolished to make room for a parking lot. Saugus Branch service ended in May 1958, leaving through service on the Eastern Route as the only trains serving Lynn. Around this time, the third and fourth tracks through the station were removed due to reduced traffic, leaving the station with effectively two side platforms serving two tracks.|$|E
5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects <b>radiant</b> <b>heat,</b> and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{building}} {{energy consumption}} and total social energy consumption has increased rapidly and non-renewable energy is becoming exhausted. How can we use energy efficiently {{to respond to}} rapid increases in building construction, especially {{in the fields of}} heating in large space and building energy conservation? In an attempt to conserve energy and reduce energy loss, it has become necessary to seek effective means of reducing heat loss in energy consumption. The development of improved means of heat transfer, especially using <b>radiant</b> <b>heating,</b> is thus a very important aspect of energy conservation in buildings. Infrared <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> is a new kind of large space heating method.

25|$|Tyndall {{explained}} {{the heat in}} the Earth's atmosphere {{in terms of the}} capacities of the various gases in the air to absorb <b>radiant</b> <b>heat,</b> also known as infrared radiation. His measuring device, which used thermopile technology, is an early landmark in the history of absorption spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859). He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, but {{he was the first to}} prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.|$|E

25|$|Buckling is also {{a failure}} mode in {{pavement}} materials, primarily with concrete, since asphalt is more flexible. <b>Radiant</b> <b>heat</b> from the sun is absorbed in the road surface, causing it to expand, forcing adjacent pieces to push against each other.

25|$|In {{a vacuum}} or in outer space, {{there is no}} {{convective}} heat transfer, thus in these environments, radiation is the only factor governing heat flow between the heat sink and the environment. For a satellite in space, a 100°C (373 Kelvin) surface facing the sun will absorb a lot of <b>radiant</b> <b>heat,</b> because the sun's surface temperature is nearly 6000 Kelvin, whereas the same surface facing deep-space will radiate a lot of heat, since deep-space has an effective temperature {{of only a few}} Kelvin.|$|E

In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black body radiation. Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 Macedonio Melloni demonstrated that black body radiation could be reflected, refracted and polarised {{in the same way}} as light.|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{process of}} coal defrosting in defrosting tunnels is solved in this article. Individual technical solutions of defrosting tunnels, {{as well as}} energy demands, are dealt with in this report. Defrosting tunnels are used for the defrosting of deep-frozen substrates like coal, ore or powdery substances. There are two different ways of defrosting. The first one is based on convective heating and the second one on <b>radiant</b> <b>heating.</b> Nowadays, convective heating is used much more than <b>radiant</b> <b>heating.</b> However, theory and practice show that the <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> is much more efficient. The aim {{of this article is}} to describe the design and construction of a multifunctional method of a defrosting tunnel. In the second stage we make experimental measurements of convective and radiant methods of defrosting on a built model. Its third aim is to make energy and economy assessments of defrosting process on the model. Finally, to implement the acquired knowledge in the practice, determining the conditions, in which the change of present-day convective defrosting technology to the new radiant technology becomes effective.

25|$|In the {{investigations}} on <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> in air {{it had been}} necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the nephelometer and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect.

25|$|The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), {{originally}} {{known as}} the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), was a spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background(CMB) –the <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> remaining from the Big Bang. Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP spacecraft was launched on June 30, 2001 from Florida. The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft in the NASA Explorers program. In 2003, MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002), {{who had been a}} member of the mission's science team.

25|$|West Village, {{located on}} the University of California campus in Davis, California, was the largest ZNE-planned {{community}} in North America {{at the time of}} its opening in 2014. The development contains student housing for approximately 1,980 UC Davis students as well as leasable office space and community amenities including a community center, pool, gym, restaurant and convenience store. Office spaces in the development are currently leased by energy and transportation-related University programs. The project was a public-private partnership between the university and West Village Community Partnership LLC, led by Carmel Partners of San Francisco, a private developer, who entered into a 60-year ground lease with the university and was responsible for the design, construction, and implementation of the $300 million project, which is intended to be market-rate housing for Davis. This is unique as the developer designed the project to achieve ZNE at no added cost to themselves or to the residents. Designed and modeled to achieve ZNE, the project uses a mixture of passive elements (roof overhangs, well-insulated walls, <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> barriers, ducts in insulated spaces, etc.) as well as active approaches (occupancy sensors on lights, high-efficiency appliances and lighting, etc.). Designed to out-perform California's 2008 Title 24 energy codes by 50%, the project produced 87% of the energy it consumed during its first year in operation. The shortcoming in ZNE status is attributed to several factors, including improperly functioning heat pump water heaters, which have since been fixed. Occupant behavior is significantly different than anticipated, with the all-student population using more energy on a per-capita basis than typical inhabitants of single-family homes in the area. One of the primary factors driving increased energy use appears to be the increased miscellaneous electrical loads (MEL, or plug loads) in the form of mini-refrigerators, lights, computers, gaming consoles, televisions, and other electronic equipment. The university continues to work with the developer to identify strategies for achieving ZNE status. These approaches include incentivizing occupant behavior and increasing the site's renewable energy capacity, which is a 4 MW photovoltaic array per the original design. The West Village site is also home to the Honda Smart Home US, a beyond-ZNE single-family home that incorporates cutting-edge technologies in energy management, lighting, construction, and water efficiency.|$|E
