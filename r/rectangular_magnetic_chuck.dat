In this context the health of MF-exposed people is the subject of particular concern. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effect of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELFMF) used in magnetotherapy on the concentration of interleukin 6 (IL- 6) in rat heart and brain. Material and Methods: The male rats were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups: group I – control, without contact with magnetic field; group II − exposed to bipolar, <b>rectangular</b> <b>magnetic</b> field 40 Hz, induction “peak-to-peak” 7 mT 30 min/day for 2 weeks; and group III − exposed to bipolar, <b>rectangular</b> <b>magnetic</b> field 40 Hz, 7 mT 60 min/day for 2 weeks. Concentration of IL- 6 in the heart and brain of animals was measured after MF exposure. Results: Exposure to ELFMF: 40 Hz, induction “peak-to-peak” 7 mT 30 min/day for 2 weeks caused a significant IL- 6 increase in rat hearts compared to the control group (p < 0. 05) and a non-significant IL- 6 decrease in rat brain. The magnetic field applied for 60 min resulted in non-significant IL- 6 increase in rat hearts compared to the control group and significant IL- 6 decrease in rat brain (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The kinetic {{transport}} of electrons through graphene magnetic barriers is studied theoretically in {{presence of an}} external time harmonic scalar potential. The transmission coefficients are calculated {{in the framework of}} the non-perturbative Floquet theory using transfer matrix method. The time dependent scalar potential is found to suppress the usual Fabry-Perot oscillations occurring in the transmission through a constant vector potential barrier (corresponding to two oppositely directed delta-function magnetic barriers). Two types of asymmetric Fano resonances (FR) are noted and are discussed for the narrow barrier structure. One of them arises due to the oscillatory mode while the other due to the evanescent mode of the electron wave inside the barrier. In contrast, the oscillating field favors the transmission for <b>rectangular</b> <b>magnetic</b> barrier structure and also exhibits the FR due to the presence of bound state inside the barrier. The characteristic Fano line shape can be tuned by varying the amplitude of the oscillating potential.

40|$|The small {{oscillation}} modes {{in complex}} micromagnetic systems around an equilibrium are numerically evaluated {{in the frequency}} domain by using a novel formulation, which naturally preserves the main physical properties of the problem. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which describes magnetization dynamics, is linearized around a stable equilibrium con¯guration and the stability of micromagnetic equilibria is discussed. Special {{attention has been paid}} to take into account the property of conservation of magnetization magnitude in the continuum as well as discrete model. The linear equation is recast in the frequency domain as a generalized eigenvalue problem for suitable self-adjoint operators connected to the micromagnetic efective field. This allows one to determine the normal oscillation modes and natural frequencies circumventing the difficulties arising in time-domain analysis. The generalized eigenvalue problem may be conveniently discretized by finite-difference or finite element methods depending on the geometry of the magnetic system. The spectral properties of the eigenvalue problem are derived in the lossless limit. Perturbation analysis is developed in order to compute the changes in the natural frequencies and oscillation modes arising from the dissipative effects. It is shown that the discrete approximation of the eigenvalue problem obtained either by finite difference or finite element methods has a structure which preserves relevant properties of the continuum formulation.

The output accuracy of center-based machining systems such as lathes or <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> grinders relates directly {{to the accuracy of}} part centering before machining. Traditional tooling and methods for centering on such machines are subject to wear, dimensional inaccuracy, setup time (hard tooling) and human error (manual centering). A flexible system for initial part centering is developed based on a single measurement system and actuator, whereby the part is placed by hand onto the machine table, rotated and measured to identify center of geometry offset from center of rotation, then moved by a series of controlled impacts or pushes to align the centers. The prototype centering system is developed as a demonstration platform for research in a number of mechanical engineering areas, particularly: Characterization of optimal state estimators through analysis of accuracy and computational efficiency; Distributed communication and control, efficient transfer of information in a real-time environment, and information sharing between processes; Modeling of sliding dynamics and the interaction of friction with compliant body dynamic models; Motion path planning through both deterministic geometric transforms and through frequency domain command manipulation. A vision is created for future work not only in the described areas, but also in the areas of advanced controller design incorporating multiple variables, derived machine diagnostic information, and application of the distributed communication architecture to information flow throughout the manufacturing organization.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. An {{experimental study of}} the fast switching properties of the film-loop assemblies indicated that a line charge model for a <b>rectangular</b> <b>magnetic</b> film represents the external flux distribution of the film with good ([ [...] . ] 10 %) accuracy. The flux linkage of a deposited loop equals 100 % of the film flux. A 20 % decrease in film flux was measured {{at both ends of}} the film easy axis and a quadratic flux distribution is consistent with the experimental results. Eddy current and circulating loop current fields affect the nanosecond range switching of magnetic films. Eddy current fields increase rapidly with the fraction of magnetic film perimeter covered by the loop conductors. Capacitive loop current fields cause a small increase in film switching time. Resistive loop loading can slow film switching significantly. The bias and drive field properties of deposited loops can be predicted from the loop dimensions. The deposition of complete film assemblies was effected without opening the vacuum of the system. The film switching test equipment incorporated a new method for the integration of fast switching signals and had a response time of 0. 8 nsec. A theoretical study of the coupling loop circuitry indicated that the loop attenuation and the spatial distribution of loop induced voltage distort the film output signal. These effects are small, but not negligible, for a loop with conductor separation of 50, 000 A and conductor thicknesses of 4000 A, enclosing a 1 cm[superscript 2] film switching in 1 nsec. The use of integrated deposited circuitry containing magnetic films is feasible for fast computers. A set of logic elements suitable for a deposited configuration has reasonable fan-in and fan-out potentialities. Theoretical miniaturization limits for deposited film logic circuitry depend chiefly on the resistivity of the coupling loops. Operation of such circuitry at low temperature reduces the limit of film size to about 14 microns. Miniaturization alleviates the effect of loop currents and attenuation on film switching signals, leading to low power, short switching time circuitry...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} {{the manipulation of}} spin structures on a nanometer length scale is of primary importance to contemporary scientific investigations and future technological applications of magnetic materials. Soft x-ray transmission microscopy offers imaging with a spatial resolution down to 10 nm, and a temporal resolution of about 70 psec, with element specific magnetic contrast. As such, it is an ideal method for studying fast nanoscale spin dynamics. The focus of this dissertation is on imaging the response of magnetic vortex cores to external applied fields using soft x-ray transmission microscopy. 	A technique for pinpointing vortex dynamics without time resolution was used to survey the response of a vortex core to RF fields of varying frequency and amplitude. This investigation revealed an unexpected nonlinear response of the vortex core at higher amplitude driving frequencies. Time-resolved images of the vortex core response in the linear regime were taken using a technique which phase-locked the RF driving field to the x-ray imaging pulses. These experimental images probing the frequency response of the vortex core motion are the initial step towards {{a deeper understanding of}} the behavior of the vortex core when driven by magnetic fields with frequencies near its resonant frequency. In addition to investigating the dynamic response of a single vortex core, a magnetic system with two interacting vortex cores was studied. A patterned <b>rectangular</b> <b>magnetic</b> sample with a 7 -domain magnetization configuration and two vortex cores at remanence was used in this experiment. The magnetization of this sample was imaged after the application of a fast magnetic field pulse using a pump-probe time-resolved imaging technique. The images taken showed a distortion of the vortex cores after the pulse was applied, and combined with simulation, these results provide strong evidence for the creation and annihilation of vortex-antivortex core pairs during the excitation of the initial vortices. This lends support to the many theories suggesting that a vortex-antivortex core pair is created and annihilated during the switching of vortex core polarity.

It is found that large torques applied at the local area of the vortex cores, driven by the large exchange fields in the core region during their dynamic motion and collapse, induce a rapid energy dissipation into the surrounding areas through the spin-wave excitation and subsequent propagation.
