A dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> was recently approved, {{and the effects}} of food on absorption and bioavailability of the <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> versus capsules were compared in an open-label, single-dose, 3 -period crossover study. Healthy volunteers were randomized to either dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> 4. 25 mg (fed) or dronabinol capsule 5 mg (fed or fasted). Dosing was separated by a 7 -day washout period. Plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated for dronabinol and its major metabolite, 11 -hydroxy-delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (11 -OH-∆ 9 -THC). Pharmacokinetic data were available for analysis in 54 volunteers. In the fed state, initial dronabinol absorption was faster with <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> versus capsule (mean time to the first measurable concentration, 0. 15 vs 2. 02 hours, respectively), with 100 % and 15 % of volunteers, respectively, having detectable plasma dronabinol levels 30 minutes postdose. There was less interindividual variability in plasma dronabinol concentration during early absorption with <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> versus capsule. Compared with the fasted state, mean area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0 -t) increased by 2. 1 - and 2. 4 -fold for dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> and capsule, respectively, when taken with food. Mean time to maximum plasma concentration was similarly delayed for dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> with food (7. 7 hours) and capsule with food (5. 6  hours) versus capsule with fasting (1. 7  hours). Under fed conditions, AUC 0 –t and area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity were similar for the <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> versus capsule based on 11 -OH-∆ 9 -THC levels. An appreciable food effect was observed for dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> and capsules. Dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> may offer therapeutic benefit to patients, given its rapid and lower interindividual absorption variability versus dronabinol capsule.

40|$|AbstractPurposeCrushed tablet and {{solution}} {{formulations of}} apixaban administered orally or via a nasogastric tube (NGT) {{may be useful}} in patients unable to swallow solid dose formulations. It is important to understand whether new formulations and/or methods of administration impact apixaban bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. These studies evaluated the relative bioavailability (Frel) of apixaban <b>solution</b> administered orally; <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> administered via NGT flushed with either 5 % dextrose in water (D 5 W) or with infant formula; <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> via NGT with a nutritional supplement; and crushed tablet suspended in D 5 W and administered via NGT. MethodsThree open-label, randomized, crossover studies were conducted in healthy adults (study 1 : apixaban 10 -mg tablet [reference] versus <b>oral</b> <b>solution,</b> both administered PO; study 2 : apixaban 5 -mg <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> PO [reference] versus <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> via NGT flushed with either D 5 W or infant formula; study 3 : apixaban 5 -mg <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> PO [reference] versus apixaban 5 -mg <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> via NGT with a nutritional supplement and versus crushed tablet suspended in D 5 W and administered via NGT). Point estimates and 90 % CIs of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs; test/reference) were generated for Cmax and AUC. Adverse events were recorded throughout each study. FindingsFrel of the <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> was 105 % versus tablet, and Frel for <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> via NGT with D 5 W flush, infant formula flush, nutritional supplement, and crushed tablet via NGT versus <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> administration were 96. 7 %, 92. 2 %, 81. 3 %, and 95. 1 %, respectively. The 90 % CIs of the GMRs of all AUCs met the bioequivalence criterion except that of the nutritional supplement (0. 766 – 0. 863). The corresponding GMRs for Cmax were 0. 977, 0. 953, 0. 805, 0. 682, and 0. 884. For the solution via NGT flushed with D 5 W and for the crushed tablet, the 90 % CIs of the Cmax GMRs met the bioequivalence criterion. Apixaban was well tolerated in all 3 studies; most adverse events were mild. ImplicationsComparable Frel was observed for <b>oral</b> apixaban <b>solution,</b> tablet, NGT administration of solution flushed with D 5 W and infant formula, and NGT administration of crushed tablet suspension. Exposure was less when <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> was administered via NGT with nutritional supplement.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this open-labeled, multiple-dose, three-way-crossover trial were {{to evaluate the}} safety and tolerance of zidovudine (<b>Retrovir)</b> <b>oral</b> syrup and to assess the bioequivalence of this formulation relative to zidovudine solution and capsule formulations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Over the 7 -day study, 12 adult male subjects received 12 administrations each of the capsule, solution, and syrup formulations every 4 h (six times daily) in a randomized sequence. Frequent blood samples were collected over the 4 -h period after dose 12 was administered. Zidovudine concentrations in plasma were determined by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay. Results from statistical analyses indicated that all three formulations were bioequivalent with respect to systemic availability (area under the time-concentration curve) and that the syrup was also equivalent to the solution {{with respect to the}} maximum peak concentration in serum. The lower relative maximum peak concentration in serum (approximately 81 %) and small delays in time to peak concentration (less than 30 min) of the capsule formulation as compared with the liquid formulations are thought to be due to the additional processes of disintegration and dissolution associated with capsule administration.

This study evaluated the bioavailability {{of a new}} formulation, dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution,</b> versus a dronabinol capsule formulation. Methods: In an open-label, four-period, single-dose, crossover study, healthy volunteers {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two treatment sequences (T-R-T-R and R-T-R-T; T = dronabinol 4. 25  mg <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> and R = dronabinol 5  mg capsule) under fasted conditions, with a minimum 7 -day washout period between doses. Analyses were performed on venous blood samples drawn 15  minutes to 48  hours postdose, and dronabinol concentrations were assayed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Fifty-one of 52 individuals had pharmacokinetic data for analysis. The 90 % confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio (oral solution/capsule) for dronabinol was within the 80 %– 125 % bioequivalence range for area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to last measurable concentration (AUC 0 –t) and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC 0 –∞). Maximum plasma concentration was also bioequivalent for the two dronabinol formulations. Intraindividual variability in AUC 0 –∞ was > 60 % lower for dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> 4. 25  mg versus dronabinol capsule 5  mg. Plasma dronabinol concentrations were detected within 15  minutes postdose in 100 % of patients when receiving <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> and in < 25 % of patients when receiving capsules. Conclusion: Single-dose dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> 4. 25  mg was bioequivalent to dronabinol capsule 5  mg under fasted conditions. Dronabinol <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> formulation may provide an easy-to-swallow administration option with lower intraindividual variability as well as more rapid absorption versus dronabinol capsules.

According to the United States Pharmacopeia, extemporaneous <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> has an expiration of 14 days {{if there is no}} stability test data. However, outpatients usually need 4 -week medications. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the beyond-use date of extemporaneous morphine hydrochloride (HCl) <b>oral</b> <b>solution.</b> Extemporaneous 0. 1 % morphine HCl <b>oral</b> <b>solutions</b> were prepared in an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Class 8 compounding room, and bottled in 500 -mL high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene caps. Twelve bottles were divided into 2 groups (sealed or opened daily) and stored under refrigeration or at room temperature to determine the chemical and microbial stabilities. Stability tests of the “sealed” group were performed after 4 weeks, while for the group in which the bottles were shaken and opened twice daily, stability tests were performed weekly. Chemical stability was determined by high performance liquid chromatography and pH, and microbial stability was determined by microbial limit tests according to pharmacopeias. In both groups, all the morphine HCl <b>oral</b> <b>solutions</b> retained more than 90 % of the original concentration after 4 weeks, irrespective of whether they were stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. The pH values were maintained at around 5 during the 4 -week study period. All the refrigerated solutions passed the microbial limit tests within 4 weeks, regardless of whether they were sealed or opened twice daily. All the solutions stored at room temperature retained their microbial stability in the 1 st week. However, mold and yeast counts exceeded the limits during the 2 nd week in the “opened daily” group. Extemporaneous 0. 1 % morphine HCl <b>oral</b> <b>solutions</b> prepared in an ISO Class 8 clean room have a beyond-use date of 4 weeks in HDPE bottles when refrigerated.
