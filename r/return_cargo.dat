5|$|The Action of 10 February 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, in which a British Royal Navy squadron chased and captured the French frigate Junon in the Caribbean Sea. Junon was {{on a mission to}} carry trade goods from the Îles des Saintes near Guadeloupe back to France and was part of a succession of French warships sent during 1808 and the early months of 1809 in an effort to break the British blockade of the French Caribbean, which was destroying the economies and morale of the islands. Having landed supplies, Junons <b>return</b> <b>cargo</b> was intended to improve the economic situation on Guadeloupe with much needed oceanic trade.|$|E
5|$|By 1904 {{the line}} was {{operating}} fourteen steamships of between four and seven thousand tons, several built by the associated Furness Withy shipyards. Services to ports in eastern Canada were supplemented by regular sailings to Boston, Philadelphia, and the southern US cotton ports of New Orleans and Galveston. Between 1904 and 1908 ML deployed three vessels including the Manchester City to the River Plate route, serving other UK ports as well Manchester. The main <b>return</b> <b>cargo</b> was frozen and chilled meat, and the City set a record for the largest meat consignment up to that time. Lord Furness, as he had become, died in 1912 and was succeeded as ML's chairman by R. B. Stoker {{until his death in}} 1919. ML's fleet was maintained at 14vessels during the last few years before the First World War. Eleven of their ships were deployed on the Canadian routes, carrying mainly manufactured goods outwards and meat and grain inbound.|$|E

25|$|After the World War I, the {{economics}} of transpacific lumber trade changed. On one hand, the evolution in shipbuilding gave the advantage to steam-powered vessels, thus gradually rendering {{the concept of a}} sailing lumber schooner archaic. The building of sailing ships effectively ceased after 1905, and moreover, the end of the World War I has flooded the ship market with a fleet of steamers no longer needed for hostilities. On the other hand, Hawaiian sugar industry has switched from coal to oil, and it was less and less profitable to carry coal as a <b>return</b> <b>cargo</b> from Australia.|$|E

Departing for France on 10 November—the day before Armistice Day—West Gotomska arrived at Quiberon Bay, France on the 25th where she unloaded her cargo.

25|$|Tunisia {{under the}} early Hafsids, {{as well as}} the entire Maghrib, enjoyed a general {{prosperity}} due to the rise of the Saharan-Sudanese trade. Perhaps more important was the increase in Mediterranean commerce including trade with Europeans. Across the region, the repetition of buy and sell dealings with Christians led to the eventual development of trading practices and structured shipping arrangements that were crafted to ensure mutual security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick-up the <b>return</b> <b>cargo</b> in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city-of-origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities (a funduq) in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to take a small number of invalid French officers to a French port where he might find a <b>return</b> <b>cargo</b> for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would decide what to do with the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve was nowhere in sight, Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E

25|$|The entire Maghrib, {{as well as}} Tunisia {{under the}} early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of {{prosperity}} due {{to the rise of}} Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe. Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians {{led to the development of}} practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. The principal customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (in modern Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Bejaia), and Bône (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and Tripoli (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often a member of the ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and would act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners. The amount of the duties varied, usually five or ten percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick up the <b>return</b> <b>cargo</b> in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city–of–origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.|$|E
500|$|For {{much of the}} 19th century, it was {{particularly}} cheap to transport ice from New England and other key ice producing centres, helping to grow the industry. The region's role as a gateway for trade with {{the interior of the}} U.S. meant that trading ships brought more cargoes to the ports than there were cargoes to take back; unless they could find a <b>return</b> <b>cargo,</b> ships would need to carry rocks as ballast instead. Ice was the only profitable alternative to rocks and, as a result, the ice trade from New England could negotiate lower shipping rates than would have been possible from other international locations. Later in the century, the ice trade between Maine and New York took advantage of Maine's emerging requirements for Philadelphia's coal: the ice ships delivering ice from Maine would bring back the fuel, leading to the trade being termed the [...] "ice and coaling" [...] business.|$|E

In Captain Meyer's attempt to provide the Fortuna, [...] with a good <b>return</b> <b>cargo,</b> the governor took but an indifferent interest, and as to the Esmits' returning on the Fortuna, he {{would have none of}} it. Just why he should deliberately keep with him persons who could not but be a source of trouble {{as long as they were}} near, is difficult to explain on other grounds than cupidity. Milan had been unable to lay his hands on Esmit's gains. In his relations with his council, he showed his arbitrariness and wilfulness. In place of Lieutenant Heins, who happened to be absent on the company's business when Milan arrived, the governor promptly appointed his son, Felix. Instead of selecting permanent councilors from among the planters as he had been instructed to do under certain specified conditions, he put in now one, now another, until fourteen planters had taken part in the government with him.|$|E
