However, some segments Of the population continue to have unacceptable levels of lead exposure and elevaWd blood lead concenations. In addition, virtually all residents of industrialized countries have bone lead stores that are sveral orders of magnitude ater than those of our preindu ancestors. <b>Re</b> <b>cen</b> nstudiessuge that these skeetal led stores adv ely ect health and can contribute to reduced birth weights, agive behavior in children, and anemia, hypertension, and kidney disease in adults. Evidence is decribed tht demonstrates that an increase in dietary calcium consumption can reduce lead absorption and toxicity from cxogenous and endogenous lead exposure. A tly p and effectiw {{way to reduce the}} substial morbidity that will result firm widespread lead exposure is by ftificton of a vriety of fiods with low levels of calcium.

Transport electron/phonon coupling parameters lambda(tr) vary from 1. 11 for ZrN to 0. 82 for HfN, 0. 73 for TiN, and 0. 44 for CeN. The small variation in lambda(tr) among the TM nitrides and the weak coupling in CeN {{are consistent with}} measured superconducting transition temperatures 10. 4 (ZrN), 9. 18 (HfN), 5. 35 (TiN), and andlt; 4 K for CeN. The Eliashberg spectral function describes the strength and energy spectrum of electron/phonon coupling in conventional superconductors. Spectral peaks in alpha F- 2 (andlt;(h) over barandgt;omega), corresponding to regions in energy-space for which electrons couple to acoustic (h) over bar omega(ac) and optical (h) over bar omega(op) phonon modes, are centered at (h) over bar omega(ac) = 33 and (h) over bar omega(op) = 57 meV for TiN, 25 and 60 meV for ZrN, 18 and 64 meV for HfN, and 21 and 39 meV for CeN. The acoustic modes soften with increasing cation mass; optical mode energies remain approximately constant for the TM nitrides, but are significantly lower for the RE nitride due to a lower interatomic force constant. Optical/acoustic peak-intensity ratios are 1. 15 +/- 0. 1 for all four nitrides, indicating similar electron/phonon coupling strengths alpha(tr) ((h) over bar omega) for both modes.
