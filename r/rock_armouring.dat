40|$|The authors present key design, {{construction}} and ecological enhancement criteria for sustainable coastal defence structures at Hartlepool, UK, a high-energy wave climate. Such ‘ecologically favourable’ coastal defences fulfil the habitats directive and key engineering and cost criteria. Bird, rocky intertidal ecological and biogeomorphological data underpin recommendations for ‘passive’ enhancement mitigation to maximise ecological potential involving <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> material choice (partially enhanced) and its smart positioning (enhanced). Within 12 – 18 months of installation, key intertidal species (e. g. limpets, barnacles, fucoid seaweeds) had successfully colonised the rock revetment, matching the initial baseline biotope. However, species abundance and overall mobile and sessile species {{were not significantly}} different between the two enhanced treatments after 12 – 18 months. Importantly, key prey species (the limpet, Patella vulgata) on enhanced <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> showed statistically significant abundances similar to the baseline shore platform and significantly higher than partially enhanced <b>rock</b> <b>armour.</b> These preliminary data show that well-chosen <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> material and boulder enhancement using positioning can match baseline biotope conditions in 12 – 18 months and that for some key prey species, positioning-enhanced <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> rapidly matches baseline conditions.

40|$|The {{offshore}} wind {{sector in the}} UK is expanding rapidly and is set to occupy significant areas of the coastal zone, making it necessary to explore the potential for co-location with other economic activities. The presence of turbine foundations introduces hard substrates into areas previously dominated by soft sediments, implying that artificial reef effects may occur, with potential benefits for fisheries. This review focuses on the possibilities for locating fisheries for two commercially important decapods, the brown crab Cancer pagurus and the European lobster Homarus gammarus, within {{offshore wind}} farms. Existing understanding of habitat use by C pagurus and H. gammarus suggests that turbine foundations {{have the potential to}} act as artificial reefs, although the responses of these species to noise and electromagnetic fields are poorly understood. Offshore wind farm monitoring programmes provide very limited information, but do suggest that adult C pagurus associate with turbine foundations, which may also serve as nursery areas. There was insufficient deployment and monitoring of <b>rock</b> <b>armouring</b> to draw conclusions about the association of H. gammarus with offshore wind farm foundations. The limited information currently available demonstrates the need for further research into the ecological and socioeconomic issues surrounding fishery co-location potential...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} a {{monitoring}} carried out {{on the shore of}} Marina di Pisa (Tuscany, ltaly) are presented in this work: Marina di Pisa has been the centre of an impressive coastal defence project. This project has got started in the autumn of 2006 and will come to an end in the spring of 2008 : it has been necessary due to the poor conditions of this area, stili struck by lingering episodes of erosion. In fact, dating back to the late XIXth century the Pisan shore experienced first erosive phenomena (due t o a strong decrease of River Arno sediments discharge caused, amongst others, by an uncontrolled excavation of the riverbed), progressively worsened up to seriously menace the city centre of Marina di Pisa. The defence of buildings and houses had become a pressing priority and it was realized by the accomplishment of hard protection systems like sea walls (<b>rock</b> <b>armouring</b> in particular) : these sea walls solved the problem they were built for, but they caused the complete erosion of the fronting sand beaches as well. Subsequent forms of defence (breakwaters 80 m off the coast-line and grave l replenishments) were carried out, but with no particular gain even by an environmental impact standpoint. The above mentioned defence project has been put into execution in such a worrying situation: i t consists of the enlargement of few pre-existent groynes (subsequently linked at the head by submerged breakwaters) and of a huge gravel replenishment. A series of big cells will form that way, characterized by better water ctrculattOn, lessened envtronmental tmpact and wider gravel beaches. The monitoring ai m is to contro l the shore evolution in order to better define the processes acting on that sector of the littoral zone and, moreover, the need of integration and/or variations to the project. Besides, the monitoring has been extended to a beach (named Gorgona) one kilometre south of the cells where larger works h ave bee n executed: gravel replenishments have been realized a Iso on this beach, but the difference lies in the absence of offshore breakwaters. Therefore, it w ili be possible verifying the evolution of both these beaches given the sa me sea weather and w ave motion conditions. Thus beach profile and coast-line surveys have been accomplished at Gorgona beach using GPS technologies during various climatic conditions: so it has been possible keeping under contrai the beach evolution without the interference of any offshore structures parallel to the shoreline. At the same time sampling along transects going from the backshore to the shoreface have been made to define the grain-size variations normal to the coast-line. This observation has been particularly interesting because further shows that gravel and pebbles assume a dimensionai zonation on the backshore, while their diffusion under water is probably limited to the step, that is the limit foreshore-upper shoreface. Grain-size analysis has been conducted on every sample; the coarsest ones have undergone morphometric analysis as well j ust to better locate the mentioned zonation. Considering the remarkable peculiarity of the area in which this project has been rea lized (so much peculiar to probably make Marina di Pisa the only case of such a type), the obtained resu lts will be very useful not only to better understand processes acting on a gravel beach, but even to sort of deal with this kind of coastal defence works by improving the approach with which they are studied {{and at the same time}} to optimize them in the future...|$|E

50|$|In February 1967 {{there was}} a major fall of rock onto the road south of Glenarm, and in May 1967 {{there was a}}nother which {{completely}} blocked the road. At this point the cliffs are about 330 ft high so Antrim County Council decided to build a new road 100 ft on the seaward side of the old one. The Council did the work largely by direct labour and started to acquire the plant and equipment needed for the job. The council opened a quarry and began to build a new embankment, but on the night of 31 October 1968 there was a one in 70-year storm that washed away the part of the causeway that had not yet been protected by <b>rock</b> <b>armour.</b> The work resumed in 1969 and a reinforced concrete sea wall was built, again by direct labour.

50|$|As design wave heights get larger, {{rubble mound}} breakwaters require larger armour units {{to resist the}} wave forces. These armour units can be formed of {{concrete}} or natural rock. The largest standard grading for <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> units given in CIRIA 683 'The Rock Manual' is 10-15 tonnes. Larger gradings may be available, but the ultimate size is limited in practice by the natural fracture properties of locally available <b>rock.</b> Shaped concrete <b>armour</b> units (such as Dolos, Xbloc, Tetrapod, etc.) can be provided in up to approximately 40 tonnes (e.g. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco), before they become vulnerable to damage under self weight, wave impact and thermal cracking of the complex shapes during casting/curing. Where the very largest armour units are required for the most exposed locations in very deep water, armour units are most often formed of concrete cubes, which have been used up to ~195 tonnes for {{the tip of the}} breakwater at Punta Langosteira near La Coruña, Spain.|$|R

30|$|The {{production}} of RPCBs {{will also be}} heavily influenced by the condition of adjacent coral reefs. Clearly, where fringing reefs are poorly developed, the quarrying of new clasts during HEMI events will be limited. Coral diseases {{on the other hand}} may enhance sediment availability [29]. If the time interval between successive geomorphic disturbances is less than the time required for coral reefs to recover, then less clastic material may be produced [30]. Elsewhere, deliberate human interference may be important: on fringing reefs near Nha Trang in Vietnam, the scarcity of coral boulders has been attributed to local cement factories “harvesting” them as a convenient source of limestone. Another reason for boulder collection is for use as <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> in shoreline revetments.|$|R
40|$|The {{permeability}} of a breakwater is {{of great}} importance for {{the stability of the}} armour layer.

However, for single layer interlocking armour units the influence core permeability is rather unfamiliar. The goal of this research is to extend the knowledge on the failure mechanism of the armour layer for different structural permeability. To achieve this goal, model tests are conducted in the permeameter of the Technical University of Delft and in the wave flume of Delta Marine Consultants, Utrecht. The tests show that the stability of the armour layer decreases with increasing and decreasing core permeability. Coastal engineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|A {{soil erosion}} {{study of the}} beach at Rossnowlagh, known officially as Belalt Strand, has been made. The area {{consists}} mainly of sandy beach, but also rocky shore platform, sand dunes, grassland, boulder clay cliffs and rock cliffs. Over the last 60 years it has been determined that the central section of the dune front has been eroding at rates up to 0.6 metres (2 ft) per year, with the highest erosion rate between 1951 and 1977. Starting in 1972, short lengths of <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> were constructed at first {{in front of the}} Sandhouse Hotel and with further additions along the shore-line; this stopped the erosion in protected parts but the dune front has a ragged appearance with up to 35 m of erosion where half of the sandy shoreline has no protection.|$|R
50|$|The Buddon Ness is a {{triangle}} of land around 11 km2. Its {{position at the}} estuary of the River Tay makes it prone to erosion, and the position of both the west and east facing shores have changed considerably since the founding of Carnoustie. Comparison of Ordnance Survey maps from the mid-19th century with present-day maps show the shoreline retreating on the west shore and advancing on the east shore. This is supported by comparison of old photographs of Carnoustie links with the present day {{situation in which the}} foreshore is now much further from the Beach Pavilion (now the Rugby Club) than it was 80 years ago. The concern latterly has been of the shoreline eroding from this part of the beach and <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> was placed at the shoreline in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the beach has changed {{considerably}} in the last decade. In the mid-1990s, an extensive programme of enhancement to the sea defences was carried out, with the installation of <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> {{along the length of}} Lagoon Walk. This provided a barrier against the sea's tremendous power, but consequently the highest tides were forced southwards. The Environment Agency predicted that the sea would destroy Skegness Boating Club's boat compound and possibly wipe out a grassed picnic area just behind it. As the tides shifted, the boat compound was indeed flattened by the sea. Sand dunes were washed away and significant new creeks were carved into the beach, but so far the picnic area remains intact. The boating club now has a new compound just off the Princes Parade car park.|$|R

Displacements of <b>armour</b> units and <b>rocking</b> were monitored and have been applied as indicators for the armour layer stability on the crest, front and rear slope. The effect of freeboard, packing density and wave steepness on the armour layer stability have been investigated. The stability of interlocking concrete armour units on low crested and submerged structures is qualitatively different from <b>rock</b> <b>armour.</b> About 40 % to 50 % larger armour units are required on the seaward slope and crest of low crested structures (as compared to conventional high crested breakwaters).

40|$|Although a lot {{is known}} {{nowadays}} about the run-up on smooth and impermeable slopes {{as well as the}} run-up on slopes covered with a <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> layer, the physical properties of the armour layer of a rubble mound breakwater are not incorporated in the relations describing the run-up on a breakwater’s slope. The roughness of a slope and its permeability, which can be described by a characteristic diameter of the armour unit and the porosity of the layer, are not used in the description of the run-up. This report is an attempt to get insight into the influence that the roughness and the permeability of a slope have on the run-up on this slope. In order to achieve this goal, non-dimensional parameters are derived describing the roughness of a slope and its permeability. Firstly, the framework of the design of a breakwater is given in order to place the run-up on a rough, permeable slope. The run-up itself is dealt with separately. Experiments were performed in order to obtain data {{that can be used to}} quantify the influence of the roughness of the slope and its permeability. The experiments were performed leaving the permeability of the whole structure out of consideration. To achieve a difference in porosity of the <b>armour</b> layer, <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> units were used as well as tetrapod armour units. Two approaches of data analysis are applied on the data obtained from these experiments. This first approach describes the run-up on a rough, permeable slope by a combination of a roughness parameter, a permeability parameter and the breaker parameter. The roughness parameter and the permeability parameter are derived by forming non-dimensional parameters that describe roughness and permeability. The run-up, usually made non-dimensional using the wave height (H) is made non-dimensional here using the nominal diameter. This gave better results in combination with the derived parameters describing the roughness and the permeability of a slope. The second approach describes the run-up on a rough, permeable slope by using the relative run-up Ru/H and a newly derived non-dimensional parameter resembling the Iribarren parameter, but incorporating the influence of the permeability of the armour layer. When the relative run-up is put against the Iribarren parameter and is put against the newly derived non-dimensional parameter, the appearing scatter is less in the latter case. In both approaches, two relations describing the run-up on a rough permeable slope are derived. One for breaking waves and one for non-breaking waves. For the second approach, the found relations have a significant resemblance with the known formulae for run-up on a slope covered with <b>rock</b> <b>armour</b> units, derived by van der Meer and Stam. When the relations derived following the both approaches are compared, the relations derived by the second approach are the relations that give the best feeling with the physical processes as they occur. The relation for non-breaking waves, derived using the first approach, is applied on data obtained from physical model tests on a breakwater covered with tetrapod armour units. The calculated nondimensional run-up is compared with the measured non-dimensional run-up. The results show that the permeability of the whole structure can not be neglected, especially in the case of non-breaking waves. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
