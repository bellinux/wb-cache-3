The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E

He then became known to his followers as Hermano Pule (Brother Pule). The brotherhood fostered the practice of Christian virtues centered around the cults of Saint Francis of Assisi and the Virgin of Antipolo. They also incorporated elements of pre-colonial pagan beliefs {{such as the use}} of anting-anting (talismans). Most of its adherents were from Tayabas, Laguna, Cavite, and Batangas, and some were from Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur. The cofradía prohibited Spaniards and mestizos from joining without Pule's permission as a form of retaliation against the Church for discriminating against natives. Hermano Pule continued to work at the San Juan de Dios Hospital and regularly corresponded with his followers through letters, which were <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> the cofradía members. Some cofradía members also found time to visit Pule in Manila. In Pule's absence, the cofradía was led by hermano mayor Octavio Ygnacio [...] "Purgatorio" [...] de San Jorge and Br.

500|$|James M. Redfield, a {{classics}} {{professor at}} the University of Chicago, in his article [...] "An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet" [...] finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's Poetics, with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes {{the outcome of the}} plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet [...] "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is [...] "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> a child ("This is the mouse..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing [...] "us that teasing is a kind of loving when {{it is a kind of}} teaching.

He commented {{that there was}} [...] "so much gothic atmosphere in Ravenloft that if it had any more, it'd flap its pages and fly away", and stated {{that the bulk of}} the adventure involving a search of Castle Ravenloft was [...] "not too interesting" [...] with encounters few and far between, and that the mechanic of using a regular deck of cards to simulate a gypsy fortune teller was [...] "silly and the results are too arbitrary" [...] but concluded that [...] "Ravenloft is such a refreshing change that even with its problems, it's recommended." [...] In the July 1984 issue of White Dwarf magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 overall, with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive, and its complexity as a negative. It was likened to a Hammer horror production and praised as enjoyable, although the reviewer said the game's puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere. White Dwarf reviewer Dave Morris said it [...] "should {{be a lot of fun}} – 'light, relief' of a nerve-wracking and deadly sort" [...] and concluded that Ravenloft is [...] "full of clever touches", and [...] "features some first-class illustration and graphics". In a review for the January 1984 issue of Dragon magazine (published by a subsidiary of TSR), game designer Ken Rolston argued that, despite its design innovations, Ravenloft was still in essence a dungeon-style adventure. Rolston praised the randomization, the maps, and the player text (which is <b>read</b> <b>aloud</b> <b>to</b> the players by the DM). He said the player text [...] "consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay." [...] Despite this, Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone. He singles out its use of common monsters in D, an abundance of traps, and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure's spookiness by interrupting the module's flow. Ultimately, he felt that in [...] "AD terms it is a masterpiece", but not a work of [...] "Gothic horror". Tracy Hickman stated in 1998, [...] "I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them." ...|$|E
