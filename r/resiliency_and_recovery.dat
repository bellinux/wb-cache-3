40|$|Seed {{germination}} and seedling establishment {{directly affect}} the resiliency of seagrasses to disturbance or environmental stress. The objectives {{of this study}} were to compare maximum seed germination, time to germination, nongerminated seed viability, and initial seedling biomass between mixed-annual and perennial Zostera marina seed populations in coarse (> 90 % sand) and fine (< 50 % sand) sediments and at shallow (1 cm) and deep (5 cm) burial depths. Perennial seeds collected from Virginia and North Carolina had greater maximum germination, shorter time to germination, and greater seedling biomass compared to mixed-annual seeds collected from North Carolina. For both mixed-annual and perennial seeds, maximumgermination and seedling biomass were the greatest in shallow fine sediments. Mixed-annual seeds buried at 1 cm had a shorter time to germination than in the deep treatments; however, sediment type did not affect mean time to germination. Perennial seeds had a shorter time to germination in shallow compared to deep burial depths and in fine compared to coarse sediments. Cues for germination were present at the deeper depths; however, the cotyledon failed to emerge from the sediment surface resulting in mortality at depths of 5 cm. The greater performance of perennial compared to mixed-annual seeds and seedlings demonstrate the trade-offs which can occur between Z. marina reproductive strategies. Reduced germination of Z. marina seeds buried ≥ 5 cm and in coarse sediments may represent a possible bottleneck in successful sexual reproduction, feasibly affecting the <b>resiliency</b> to <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> from disturbance for both perennial and mixed-annual Z. marina beds...|$|R

In particular, the memo explores issues of error <b>resiliency</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> In particular, the paper considers two questions. First, given N consecutive frame erasures (due to packet losses), how long does the decoder take to resynchronize its state with the encoder? What is the strength of the resulting error signal, both in terms of objective and subjective measures? The second issue explores which particular factors contribute to the strength of the error signal: the distortion of the speech due to the incorrect concealment of the erasures, or the subsequent distortion due to the loss of state synchronization, even though correct packets are being received. Both objective and subjective measures are used to characterize the importance of each of these two factors...|$|E

These include gender, developmental factors, social support and personality factors. Psychological factors associated with maintenance of chronic PTSD are also briefly reviewed. This material is used as a basis for reconsidering the case examples. Each case is formulated within a framework based on sources of vulnerability and qualities of resilience.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} recovery-conscious {{framework}} for improving the fault <b>resiliency</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> efficiency of highly concurrent embedded storage software systems. Our framework consists of a three-tier architecture and a suite of recovery conscious techniques. In the top tier, we promote fine-grained recovery at the task level by introducing recovery groups to model recovery dependencies between tasks. At the middle tier we develop highly effective mappings of dependent tasks to processor resources through careful tuning of recovery efficiency sensitive parameters. At the bottom tier, we advocate the use of recovery-conscious scheduling by careful serialization of dependent tasks, which provides high recovery efficiency without sacrificing system performance. We develop a formal model to guide the understanding {{and the development of}} techniques for effectively mapping fine-grained tasks to system resources, aiming at reducing the ripple effect of software failures while sustaining high performance even during system recovery. Our techniques have been implemented on a real industry-standard storage system. Experimental results show that our techniques are effective, non-intrusive and can significantly boost system resilience while delivering high performance...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{recovery}} conscious framework for multi-core architectures and {{a suite of}} techniques for improving the <b>resiliency</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> efficiency of highly concurrent embedded storage software systems. Our techniques aim at providing continuous availability and performance during recovery while minimizing the time to recovery {{and the need for}} rearchitecting the system (legacy code). The main contributions of our recovery conscious framework include (1) a task-level recovery model, which consists of mechanisms for classifying storage tasks into recovery groups and dividing the overall system resources into recovery-oriented resource pools, and (2) the development of recovery-conscious scheduling, which enforces some serializability of failuredependent tasks {{in order to reduce the}} ripple effect of software failure and improve the availability of the system. We present three alternative recoveryconscious scheduling algorithms; each represents one way to trade-off between recovery time and system performance. We have implemented and evaluated these recovery-conscious scheduling algorithms on a real industry-standard storage system. Our experimental evaluation results show that the proposed recovery conscious scheduling algorithms are nonintrusive and can significantly improve (throughput by 16. 3 % and response time by 22. 9 %) the performance of the system during failure recovery. ...|$|E
40|$|Research on <b>resiliency</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> in {{forensic}} psychiatric {{patients is}} still limited. Information pertaining to {{factors associated with}} successful community reintegration would contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of functioning and informed treatment planning that fits within a recovery approach of service provision. Using a retrospective design involving file reviews and a 3 -year follow-up period, the authors investigated the rate of successful/unsuccessful community reintegration (defined by {{the presence or absence}} of an absolute discharge/readmission to hospital) in female forensic psychiatric patients (N= 48). The study evaluated the extent to which the risk and protective factors captured in the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) predicted a range of positive and negative outcomes in the study sample. Results showed that 47. 9 % of the women qualified as having successfully reintegrated into the community, with the remaining 52. 1 % qualifying as still being in recovery. Successful individuals possessed significantly more protective factors and significantly fewer risk factors than individuals still in recovery. Furthermore, both the vulnerability and the strength scale of the START demonstrated good predictive validity, however we did not find evidence of incremental validity of the strength scale.

40|$|Health {{and social}} {{problems}} are usually studied by examining their sources, patterns and consequences. The rationale for {{this approach is that}} understanding such factors will lead to effective prevention and intervention strategies. While this approach has led to remarkable breakthroughs in certain areas of medicine (e. g., infectious disease), the promises of similarly striking breakthroughs in understanding and treating historically intractable problems like addiction remain unfulfilled. Since Benjamin Rush’s 1784 treatise on chronic intoxication, generations of addictionologists have authored texts and articles about the pathology of addiction. Studying addictive drugs and why people use them, generating speculative essays on why some people can’t stop using them, and describing and evaluating countless efforts to punish or treat those with alcohol and other drug problems {{are all part of the}} multi-billion dollar, problem-focused addiction industry. There is another approach–one that focuses not on the sources of addiction, but on the successful solutions that already exist in the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals, families and communities. These solutions are of two types: people with great access to alcohol and other drugs who do not use such substances or who use but do not develop alcohol- or other drug-related (AOD) problems, and people who have achieved a sustained resolution of AOD problems across a wide spectrum of problem severity. This second approach assumes that the study of <b>resiliency</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> may hold the key to more effective strategies for preventing and managing AOD problems–strategies quite different than those flowing from the pathology perspective.
