25|$|Eight years later, comparatist Irina Georgescu {{assessed}} {{that interest}} in the more unknown aspects of Fondane's work had been rekindled by public conferences and new monographs (among which she cites the contributions of scholars Mariana Boca, Nedeea Burcă and Ana-Maria Tomescu). Le Féstin de Balthazar was performed in its <b>Romanian</b> <b>version</b> (Ospățul lui Baltazar), directed by Alexandru Dabija for the Nottara Theater company. The 65th commemoration of Fondane's death was marked locally with several events, including the premiere of Andreea Tănăsescu's Exil în pământul uitării ("Exile to the Land of Oblivion"), a contemporary ballet and performance art show loosely inspired by his poetry. In 2006, the Romanian Cultural Institute set up the Benjamin Fondane International Award for Francophone literature in countries outside France.

2500|$|The primitivists' {{activity}} in the visual realm {{is linked to the}} emergence of unconventional writers and the more radical manifestations of Romanian Symbolist culture—commentators note their kinship with poet Adrian Maniu (Rodica Maniu's brother) or with the minor Symbolists Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, N.

The group, joined by sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, found itself marginalized inside the exhibit, but received support in the Symbolist press.

The same year, the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania published an anthology of his texts, Strigăt întru eternitate ("A Shout unto Eternity"), and Editura Echinox a concordance dictionary of his poetry (one of several such projects initiated by linguist Marian Papahagi). In 2004, Mircea Martin and Ion Pop also collected Fondane's political essays as Scriitorul în fața revoluției (titled after the <b>Romanian</b> <b>version</b> of L'Écrivain devant la révolution).

2500|$|Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu {{is noted}} for its {{numerous}} cultural references, and especially for using {{a wide range of}} metaphors. Such aspects have been reviewed negatively by modern critics. Tudor Vianu writes: [...] "the poet makes such waste of gemstones that we feel like saying some of them must be false", while Călinescu, who notes that some fragments reveal [...] "an incomparable artist" [...] and [...] "a professional metaphorist", notes that [...] "in the end, such virtuosities become a bore." [...] According to Manuela-Delia Suciu, Thalassa is [...] "prolix" [...] and [...] "too polished", traits believed by Zamfir to be less irritating in the <b>Romanian</b> <b>version.</b> Critic Cornel Moraru found that, in the background, Thalassa, a [...] "great Symbolist novel", confronts Ancient Greek and Christian mythology, but [...] "abuses" [...] the religious vocabulary.

2500|$|Particularly {{during the}} 1890s, Macedonski was a {{follower}} of Edgar Allan Poe and of Gothic fiction in general, producing a <b>Romanian</b> <b>version</b> of Poe's Metzengerstein story, urging his own disciples to translate other such pieces, and adopting [...] "Gothic" [...] themes in his original prose. Indebted to Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, Macedonski also wrote a number of science fiction stories, including the 1913 Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought, which depicts civilization {{on the verge of}} a crisis. The gigantic commercial ship is maintained by a banker's union, and designed to grant travelers access to every pleasure imaginable; this causes the working-class inhabited cities on the continent to fall into a state of neglect and permanent violence, the climax of the story occurring with the bankers' decision to destroy their creation. Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought is noted for anticipating television, the ship being equipped with electrically-operated [...] "large and clear mirrors" [...] that display [...] "images from various parts of the Earth". Macedonski was by then interested in the development of cinema, and authored a silent film screenplay based on Comment on devient riche et puissant.|$|E
2500|$|Bible Student groups first {{appeared}} in present-day Romania through Hungarian missionaries in Transylvania. In particular, two emigrants who in 1911 returned from the United States to their hometown of Târgu Mureș (Marosvásárhely) managed to convert local Hungarians to their creed. They published {{the first edition of}} The Watchtower in Hungarian in 1914, with the first <b>Romanian</b> <b>version</b> coming out two years later, also in Târgu Mureș. Similar groups were also active in the Romanian Old Kingdom prior to World War I, and there remain groups under the [...] "Bible Student" [...] name in Romania today. In 1920, Ioan B. Sima, a former Greek-Catholic, was sent from the United States to organise the community, which was divided into four groups in the 1930s. After the Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918, the headquarters moved to Cluj, with the first Watch Tower Society set up there two years later, its congregation mainly Hungarian. The society functioned as a regional hub, coordinating activities for Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania. Following a leadership dispute in the Bible Student movement in the United States, those who remained associated with the Watch Tower Society became known as Jehovah's witnesses in 1931.|$|E

His criticism, modeled on Villemain, Sainte-Beuve and Taine, was perceived as refined in its context, but later enlisted objections for its pedantry and amateurism.
