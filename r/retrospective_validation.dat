Specifically, this report describes {{the development and implementation}} of wind-turbine add-ons to an open-source distribution-network simulation and analysis tool called Gridlab-D. The additions include single- and multiple-turbine simulation objects that estimate power generation based on climate data (an existing part of the simulation tool) and user-defined turbine parameters. The resulting software was verified by comparing the expected and observed power output for each turbine model.

The aim of this study is to perform an external validation of the Glasgow-Blatchford Scoring System and to establish the best cutoff for predicting mortality in upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a hospital of Lima, Peru. Methods: This was a longitudinal, <b>retrospective,</b> analytical <b>validation</b> study, with data from patients with a clinical and endoscopic diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding treated at the Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage Unit of the Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins between June 2012 and December 2013. We calculated the area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic of the Glasgow-Blatchford Scoring System to predict mortality with a 95 % confidence interval.

International Classification of Diseases Program for Injury Categorisation (ICDPIC), a statistical program available through Stata, is a powerful tool that can extract injury severity scores from ICD- 9 -CM codes. We conducted a validation study for use of the ICDPIC in trauma research. METHODS: We conducted a <b>retrospective</b> cohort <b>validation</b> study of 40, 418 patients with injury using a large regional trauma registry. ICDPIC-generated AIS scores for each body region were compared with trauma registry AIS scores (gold standard) in adult and paediatric populations. A separate analysis was conducted among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) comparing the ICDPIC tool with ICD- 9 -CM embedded severity codes. Performance in characterising overall injury severity, by the ISS, was also assessed. RESULTS: The ICDPIC tool generated substantial correlations in thoracic and abdominal trauma (weighted κ 0. 87 - 0. 92), and in head and neck trauma (weighted κ 0. 76 - 0. 83). The ICDPIC tool captured TBI severity better than ICD- 9 -CM code embedded severity and offered the advantage of generating a severity value for every patient (rather than having missing data). Its ability to produce an accurate severity score was consistent within each body region as well as overall. CONCLUSIONS: The ICDPIC tool performs well in classifying injury severity and is superior to ICD- 9 -CM embedded severity for TBI. Use of ICDPIC demonstrates substantial efficiency and may be a preferred tool in determining injury severity for large trauma datasets, provided researchers understand its limitations and take caution when examining smaller trauma datasets...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} risks for clients lies in paying for work in progress. In an age of digital technology {{the development of a}} universal approach to the management of fair payments to subcontractors in Australia remains a challenge. Location Based Management (LBM) micromilestones has been suggested as an innovative solution to reducing the risk in progress payments. The location-based solution proposed focuses on work completion micromilestones to build process reference models for auto-generation of subcontractor certification and payment. Sub-contractors are vital for construction. Studies show that subcontracting for unique construction projects is both efficient and economical simply because general contractors are less skilled and more expensive than subcontractors.

The risk of such infection in the absence of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500 /μL) is not well established and a validated prediction model for blood stream infection (BSI) risk offers clinical usefulness. METHODS: A 6 -site <b>retrospective</b> external <b>validation</b> was conducted using a previously published risk prediction model for BSI in febrile pediatric oncology patients without severe neutropenia: the Esbenshade/Vanderbilt (EsVan) model. A reduced model (EsVan 2) excluding 2 less clinically reliable variables also was created using the initial EsVan model derivative cohort, and was validated using all 5 external validation cohorts. One data set was used only in sensitivity analyses due to missing some variables. RESULTS: From the 5 primary data sets, there were a total of 1197 febrile episodes and 76 episodes of bacteremia. The overall C statistic for predicting bacteremia was 0. 695, with a calibration slope of 0. 50 for the original model and a calibration slope of 1. 0 when recalibration was applied to the model. The model performed better in predicting high-risk bacteremia (gram-negative or Staphylococcus aureus infection) versus BSI alone, with a C statistic of 0. 801 and a calibration slope of 0. 65. The EsVan 2 model outperformed the EsVan model across data sets with a C statistic of 0. 733 for predicting BSI and a C statistic of 0. 841 for high-risk BSI. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this external validation demonstrated that the EsVan and EsVan 2 models are able to predict BSI across multiple performance sites and, once validated and implemented prospectively, could assist in decision making in clinical practice.

40|$|To reduce and/or {{replace the}} Draize test, testing schemes {{combining}} strengths of particular in vitro assays were proposed during a 2005 ECVAM expert meeting. The testing scheme proposes, based on expected irritancy {{of the test}} substance, a Bottom-Up approach, beginning with test methods that accurately identify non-irritants, or a Top-Down approach, beginning with test methods that accurately identify severe irritants before progression of further in vitro testing. Furthermore as its core activity, ECVAM participated in the <b>retrospective</b> <b>validation</b> of and has peer reviewed scientific validity of four organotypic assays, and undertook <b>retrospective</b> <b>validation</b> of four cell function/cytotoxicity assays. The BCOP and ICE organotypic assays were ICCVAM and ESAC endorsed as scientifically valid for identifying severe irritants, and OECD Test Guidelines are under adoption. NRR, FL and CM cell function/cytotoxicity assays were recommended by an ECVAM Validation Management Group for identification of non-irritants or severe eye irritants in the Bottom-Up/Top-Down approaches. These assays were peer reviewed by ESAC during 2009.

We constructed a simplified version of the PESI. METHODS: The study retrospectively developed a simplified PESI clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of 30 -day mortality in a derivation cohort of Spanish outpatients. Simplified and original PESI performances were compared in the derivation cohort. The simplified PESI underwent <b>retrospective</b> external <b>validation</b> in an independent multinational cohort (Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Tromboembólica [RIETE] cohort) of outpatients. RESULTS: In the derivation data set, univariate logistic regression of the original 11 PESI variables led to the removal of variables that did not reach statistical significance and subsequently produced the simplified PESI that contained the variables of age, cancer, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and oxyhemoglobin saturation levels. The prognostic accuracy of the original and simplified PESI scores did not differ (area under the curve, 0. 75 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 69 - 0. 80]). The 305 of 995 patients (30. 7 %) who were classified as low risk by the simplified PESI had a 30 -day mortality of 1. 0 % (95 % CI, 0. 0 %- 2. 1 %) compared with 10. 9 % (8. 5 %- 13. 2 %) in the high-risk group. In the RIETE validation cohort, 2569 of 7106 patients (36. 2 %) who were classified as low risk by the simplified PESI had a 30 -day mortality of 1. 1 % (95 % CI, 0. 7 %- 1. 5 %) compared with 8. 9 % (8. 1 %- 9. 8 %) in the high-risk group.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive work on computerised analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) features, including feature extraction, feature selection, analysis of influencing factors and setting up/validation of a computerised decision support system. Firstly, a novel feature – pattern readjustment – was extracted and tested. Clinical data {{were used to}} train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect pattern readjustment. Then, the association of pattern readjustment and adverse labour outcome was investigated. The validation results with clinical experts show that the pattern readjustment can be accurately detected, while the study on labour outcome shows that the feature is related to fetal acidemia at birth. Secondly, Genetic Algorithms were employed as a feature selection method to select a best subset of FHR features and {{to use them to}} predict fetal acidemia with linear and nonlinear SVM. The diagnostic power of the classifier output using selected features was tested on the total set of 7, 568 cases. As the classifier output increases, there is a consistent increase of the risk of fetal acidemia. Thirdly, an important influencing factor on FHR features - signal loss – was investigated. A bivariate model was built to estimate error based on signal loss. Validation results show that the bivariate model can accurately predict the error generated by signal loss. The influence of signal loss on labour outcome classification was also investigated. Finally, a computerised decision support system to estimate the risk of fetal acidemia was set up based on the above studies. The system was validated using new <b>retrospective</b> data. <b>Validation</b> results show that the system is capable of predicting adverse labour outcome and providing timely decision support. It is the first time an intrapartum computerised FHR decision support system has been built and validated on this size of dataset. With further improvements, such a system could be implemented clinically in the long term. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Interspecies {{comparisons}} {{are important for}} deciphering the functional content and evolution of genomes. The expansive array of > 70 public vertebrate genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries can provide a means of comparative mapping, sequencing, and functional analysis of targeted chromosomal segments that is independent and complementary to whole-genome sequencing. However, at the present time, no complementary resource exists for the efficient targeted physical mapping {{of the majority of}} these BAC libraries. Universal overgo-hybridization probes, designed from regions of sequenced genomes that are highly conserved between species, have been demonstrated to be an effective resource for the isolation of orthologous regions from multiple BAC libraries in parallel. Here we report the application of the universal probe design principal across entire genomes, and the subsequent creation of a complementary probe resource, Uprobe, for screening vertebrate BAC libraries. Uprobe currently consists of whole-genome sets of universal overgo-hybridization probes designed for screening mammalian or avian/reptilian libraries. <b>Retrospective</b> analysis, experimental <b>validation</b> of the probe design process on a panel of representative BAC libraries, and estimates of probe coverage across the genome indicate that the majority of all eutherian and avian/reptilian genes or regions of interest can be isolated using Uprobe. Future implementation of the universal probe design strategy will be used to create an expanded number of whole-genome probe sets that will encompass all vertebrate genomes...|$|R
40|$|To date, most {{treatment}} {{decisions for}} adjuvant chemotherapy {{in breast cancer}} are sed on conventional clinicopathological criteria. Since breast cancer tumors with similar clinicopathological characteristics can have strikingly different outcomes, the current selection for adjuvant chemotherapy is far from accurate. Using high-throughput microarray analysis, a 70 -gene signature was identified which can accurately select early stage breast cancer patients who are highly likely to develop distant metastases, and therefore, may benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy. This review describes {{the development of the}} 70 -gene profile (Mammaprint), its <b>retrospective</b> <b>validation</b> and feasibility studies, and its prospective validation in the large adjuvant MINDACT (Microarray In Node-negative Disease may Avoid ChemoTherapy) clinical trial.

40|$|A <b>retrospective</b> <b>validation</b> {{study was}} {{implemented}} {{to identify the}} defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis Alteration in Comfort-Pain, specifically chest pain. The interventions instituted by coronary care nurses to relieve the chest pain were also explored. Fifty-two records were reviewed. A Demographic Instrument (DI) and Alteration in Comfort-Pain (Chest Pain) Intervention Instrument (ACPII) were developed for the study and the Alteration in Comfort-Pain Assessment Tool for Chest Pain (ACPAT-CP) was revised from the Alteration in Comfort-Pain Assessment Tool (ACPAT) for the study. The three instruments were assessed for content validity and reliability. The critical defining characteristic {{was determined to be}} a verbal complaint of chest pain with or without a specific descriptor and nurses made the appropriate nursing diagnosis for chest pain in the majority of the records reviewed. Nursing interventions documented for the relief of chest pain were interdependent interventions, specifically monitoring and an electrocardiogram.

40|$|ObjectiveThe PREVENT III (PIII) {{critical}} limb ischemia (CLI) {{risk score}} is a simple, published tool {{derived from the}} PIII randomized clinical trial {{that can be used}} for estimating amputation-free survival (AFS) in CLI patients considered for infrainguinal bypass (IB). The current study sought to validate this risk stratification model using data from the prospectively collected Vascular Study Group of Northern New England (VSGNNE). MethodWe calculated the PIII CLI risk score for 1166 patients undergoing IB with autogenous vein by 59 surgeons at 11 hospitals between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007. Points (pts) were assigned to each patient for the presence of dialysis (4 pts), tissue loss (3 pts), age ≥ 75 (2 pts), and coronary artery disease (CAD) (1 pt). Baseline hematocrit was not included due to a large proportion of missing values. Total scores were used to stratify each patient into low-risk (≤ 3 pts), med-risk (4 - 7 pts), and high-risk (≥ 8 pts) categories. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate AFS for the three risk groups. Log-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons. To assess validation, comparison to the PIII derivation and validation sets was performed. ResultStratification of the VSGNNE patients by risk category yielded three significantly different estimates for 1 -year AFS (86. 4 %, 74. 0 %, and 56. 1 %, for low-, med-, and high-risk groups). Intergroup comparison demonstrated precise discrimination (P <. 0001). For a given risk category (low, med, or high), the 1 -year AFS estimates in the VSGNNE dataset were consistent with those observed in the previously published PIII derivation set (85. 9 %, 73. 0 %, and 44. 6 %, respectively), PIII validation set (87. 7 %, 63. 7 %, and 45. 0 %, respectively), and <b>retrospective</b> multicenter <b>validation</b> set (86. 3 %, 70. 1 %, and 47. 8 %, respectively). ConclusionThe PIII CLI risk score has now been both internally and externally validated by testing it against the outcomes of 3286 CLI patients who underwent autogenous vein bypass at 94 institutions by a diverse array of physicians (three independent cohorts of patients). This tool provides a simple and reliable method to risk stratify CLI patients being considered for IB. At initial consultation, calculation of the PIII CLI risk score can reliably stratify patients according to their risk of death or major amputation at 1 year...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims: We {{analysed}} {{for the first}} time whether recipient perioperative serum total cholesterol (sTC) concentration is associated with liver transplantation outcome. Methods: We studied noncholestatic cirrhotics submitted to primary deceased-donor liver transplantation in a prospective group (n = 140) from Rome and in a <b>validation</b> <b>retrospective</b> cohort (n = 157) from Udine, Italy. Pre-ischaemia and post-reperfusion cholesterol metabolism gene mRNA was measured by RT-PCR in 74 grafts of the study group. Results: At Cox regression analysis, independently from confounders including recipient MELD score, the recipient pre-operative sTC pooled quintiles 2 - 5, compared with the lowest quintile showed HR (95 % CI) and significances for overall graft loss (GL) of 0. 215 (0. 104 - 0. 444) P < 0. 001 in the study group and 0. 319 (0. 167 - 0. 610) P = 0. 001 in the validation cohort. Analysing sTC as a continuous variable, the risk of overall GL for every 10 -mg/dl decrease in pre-operative sTC increased by 13 % and by 9 % in the study group and in the validation cohort respectively. In the study group, independent associations at multivariate analyses were: (a) high graft pre-ischaemia expression of INSIG- 1, which indicates hepatocellular cholesterol depletion, with post-reperfusion graft necrosis; (b) GL with inadequate graft post-reperfusion response to cholesterol depletion, shown by a failure to reduce the PCSK 9 to LDLR expression ratio; (c) GL with a relative increase of sTC on post-operative day- 7, selectively because of the LDL fraction, which indirectly suggests poor cholesterol uptake from blood. Conclusions: Low recipient pre-transplant sTC concentration, its post-operative day- 7 increase and a genetically determined low graft cholesterol availability predict poor liver transplant outcome. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Validation {{of a novel}} gene {{expression}} signature in independent data sets is a critical step {{in the development of}} a clinically useful test for cancer patient risk-stratification. However, validation is often unconvincing because the size of the test set is typically small. To overcome this problem we used publicly available breast cancer {{gene expression}} data sets and a novel approach to data fusion, in order to validate a new breast tumor intrinsic list. Results A 105 -tumor training set containing 26 sample pairs was used to derive a new breast tumor intrinsic gene list. This intrinsic list contained 1300 genes and a proliferation signature that was not present in previous breast intrinsic gene sets. We tested this list as a survival predictor on a data set of 311 tumors compiled from three independent microarray studies that were fused into a single data set using Distance Weighted Discrimination. When the new intrinsic gene set was used to hierarchically cluster this combined test set, tumors were grouped into LumA, LumB, Basal-like, HER 2 +/ER-, and Normal Breast-like tumor subtypes that we demonstrated in previous datasets. These subtypes were associated with significant differences in Relapse-Free and Overall Survival. Multivariate Cox analysis of the combined test set showed that the intrinsic subtype classifications added significant prognostic information that was independent of standard clinical predictors. From the combined test set, we developed an objective and unchanging classifier based upon five intrinsic subtype mean expression profiles (i. e. centroids), which is designed for single sample predictions (SSP). The SSP approach was applied to two additional independent data sets and consistently predicted survival in both systemically treated and untreated patient groups. Conclusion This study validates the "breast tumor intrinsic" subtype classification as an objective means of tumor classification that should be translated into a clinical assay for further <b>retrospective</b> and prospective <b>validation.</b> In addition, our method of combining existing data sets can be used to robustly validate the potential clinical value of any new gene expression profile. </p...|$|R
