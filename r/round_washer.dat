40|$|AbstractThis article explores self-oscillations in a <b>round</b> <b>washer</b> {{interacting}} with a rotating elastic rod. It demonstrates that natural frequencies {{of the system}} are not equidistant. The internal friction in the washer material described by the Voigt model, limits the frequency range of excited oscillations. Quasi-harmonic self-oscillations with a limited range are excited in the washer due to the friction motion. Therefore, fluctuations apply to processes in the bearing outer race of a machine in the rotary mode...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The current {{research}} experimentally quantifies and maps the behaviour of various thrustwasher configurationsundervariousconditions. Thebearingsare testedat controlled loads and speeds for a governed {{period of time}} (up to 14 h) or until failure. The experimental results show that at some loads and speeds the bearing operates with a near full hydrodynamic film and under more harsh conditions it operates in the boundary lubrication regime. The experimental results indicate that coatings enhance performance by decreasing friction and thus decreasing the heat generated. By decreasing the generated heat, the physical mechanisms of thermoelastic instability and thermoviscous distress {{are less likely to}} occur. Using bronze will decrease the frictionbetween thebearings, although itmayalsodecrease the life of thebearing. However, using more than one <b>round</b> <b>washer</b> appears to not significantly benefit washer-bearing performance...|$|E

Lag screw timber joints with steel side plates {{were subjected to}} tightening tests using a bolt force tester (NST- 500 NM: Japan Instrumentation System Co., Ltd, Nara, Japan). Test specimens were composed of three parts: a main wooden member, a <b>round</b> <b>washer,</b> and a lag screw (Fig.  1). Main members were created from three conifers: Cryptomeria japonica, Chamaecyparis obtusa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Dimensions of the main member were 60 (Longitudinal direction)[*]×[*] 45 [*]×[*] 60  mm. Specimens were tested after curing in the laboratory for approximately 2 months at 20 [*]±[*] 2  °C. A pilot hole of φ 7.5 and 55  mm deep was drilled in the main member. The relative humidity of the conditioning room ranged from 32 to 53 % during the conditioning period (relative humidity was not strictly controlled). The density and moisture content of each specimen are shown in Table  1. The dimensions of the <b>round</b> <b>washer</b> were φ 32 [*]×[*] 3.2  mm: its surface was galvanized then chromate treated. M 12 lag screws were used, having a length of 150  mm, pitch of 5.0  mm and thread half angle of 30 °. (Detailed dimensions : see Fig.  2). During the tests, specimens were first {{set up in the}} testing device. Clamp force and thread torque were measured by means of a load cell wedged between the steel side plate and the main member, where load cell which have strain gages can be measured clamp force and torsional load. The tightening angle and tightening torque of the screw head were also measured. The screw was inserted into the wood perpendicular to the grain (from radial surface). The main member was held by a rotation-stopping component to limit any rotation due to tightening torque. The lag screw was tightened using a torque wrench until the screw head pressed against the round washer: i.e., until the axial force reached 15 – 40  N. Screws were tightened at a speed of 1, 4, 10 and 20  rpm until a reduction in clamp force was observed. Six specimens were tested in each condition.|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyThe {{vigilance}} decrement {{has been}} a well-studied human factors problem since World War II (Mackworth, 1948). A more recently discovered and fundamentally similar problem is the low-prevalence effect in visual search (e. g., Lau & Huang, 2010). Both circumstances typically produce substantial misses of critical signals, whether from a vigilance activity requiring sustained attention to a single information source for a prolonged period of time (See, Howe, Warm, & Dember, 1995), or from a visual search for rare targets in difficult displays (Wolfe, Horowitz, & Kenner, 2005). Furthermore, efforts {{have been made to}} apply some of the practices from the gaming industry towards non-gaming environments to increase task engagement and improve performance, a practice known as gamification (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, 2011; Hamari, Koivisto, & Sarsa, 2014). The present project investigates the potential benefits of gamification in a low-prevalence vigil. A simulated inspection task featuring images of <b>round</b> metal <b>washers</b> as search stimuli was created for this study. Five total experiments were conducted: the initial four each assessed the impact of an individual gaming element on performance and experience (badges, a points-based challenge during a brief burst of high prevalence, storytelling, and points-based feedback throughout the task). Badges and points-based feedback throughout the task were ineffective at improving performance while the points-based challenge and storytelling were. The final experiment assessed gamified training as a practical way to integrate gamification in a low-prevalence vigil. Gamified training did not produce any significant benefits compared to traditional or no-intervention training. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed...|$|R
