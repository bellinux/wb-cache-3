5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for <b>renal</b> <b>impairment</b> when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or <b>renal</b> <b>impairment.</b> Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Renal</b> {{function}} <b>impairment</b> {{is common}} after solid organ transplantation, {{due to the}} nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine, Moreover, in patients with severe respiratory failure, renal function is often impaired, This <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> may predispose patients to further <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> after lung transplantation, Therefore, renal hemodynamics were measured in 44 patients before lung transplantation and 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after transplantation. After transplantation, a decline in renal function occurred, with a progressive fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 33 +/- 4 % at 12 months and 42 +/- 9 % at 30 months, Effective renal blood flow fell by 22 +/- 5 % at 12 months and remained stable thereafter, Changes in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were less pronounced than those of effective renal blood flow, due to a fall in hematocrit after transplantation. Blood pressure and renal vascular resistance increased significantly, consistent {{with the effects of}} cyclosporine, Prior to transplantation, <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> with intense <b>renal</b> vasoconstriction had been found in a subset of the patients, Remarkably, the decrease in renal function after transplantation was less pronounced in patients with <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> prior to transplantation, as indicated by significant negative correlations between pretransplantation GFR and the percentage change in GFR after transplantation, and pretransplantation ERPF and the percentage change in ERPF after transplantation. This suggests that the net course of renal hemodynamics after lung transplantation {{is the result of the}} opposed effects of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity and the favorable effects of the normalization of respiratory status, In conclusion, after lung transplantation a decline in renal function occurs that is less pronounced in patients with <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> and intense <b>renal</b> vasoconstriction prior to transplantation. Such a <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment,</b> therefore, should not be considered a contraindication to lung transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Posterior {{urethral}} valves are {{the most}} common cause of congenital obstructive uropathy leading to renal failure in childhood. We investigate the influence of bladder dysfunction on <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment.</b> Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 116 patients with posterior urethral valves. After valve ablation urodynamic studies were performed in all patients. The presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), renal dysplasia, serum creatinine during followup as well as urodynamic abnormalities were recorded. Mean followup was 10. 3 years after valve ablation. Results: All patients underwent, endoscopic valve ablation and urinary diversion was performed in 32. Renal dysplasia was found in 9 patients. <b>Renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> at the end of followup was present in 35 patients. Urodynamic studies showed poor compliance in 30 boys, detrusor overactivity in 44, and poor compliance and detrusor overactivity in 17. Bilateral VUR was found in 17 boys at the time of diagnosis. Urodynamic studies were normal in 23 (20 %) patients, of whom 4 had renal failure. Univariate analysis showed that poor compliance and detrusor overactivity had a significant correlation to <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> in addition to bilateral VUR and renal dysplasia. In a multivariate analysis bilateral VUR was an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis. Conclusions: Bladder dysfunction may contribute to <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> eventually but normal urodynamic findings do not preclude renal deterioration. It is likely that loss of compliance and detrusor overactivity would actually result in a valve bladder reaching its end point function...|$|R

40|$|Objective - In {{patients}} with coronary artery disease, the concomitant presence of <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> {{is associated with}} decreased survival. We aimed to assess whether in coronary artery diseased patients <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> is associated with systemic vascular function, functional parameters of the renin-angiotensin system, or inflammation as potential mediators for cardiovascular risk. Methods and Results - We studied 125 patients, 87 % male, {{with a mean age}} of 62. 2 +/- 8. 2 years; 72 % had 3 -vessel disease, and mean renal function was 74 +/- 13 mL/min per 1. 73 m(2). Internal thoracic artery rings were sampled during coronary bypass surgery and used for in vitro vascular measurements. We could not establish an association between endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (response to methacholine) and renal function. In addition, vascular response to potassium chloride, phenylephrine, and angiotensin II were not associated with renal function. Finally, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, usage of ACE inhibitors, C-reactive protein, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were not related to renal function. Conclusions - In coronary artery disease patients, mild <b>renal</b> function <b>impairment</b> is not associated with systemic vasomotor responsiveness, inflammation, or functional systemic parameters of the renin-angiotensin system.
