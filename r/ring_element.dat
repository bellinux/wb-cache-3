These strands are highly isomorphic to macromolecular structures, previously described for Myxococcus fulvus (Lünsdorf and Reichenbach, J. Gen. Microbiol. 135 : 1633 - 1641, 1989).

The <b>ring</b> <b>elements</b> are linked by two parallel strings of filamentous proteins, called elongated elements, which keep the <b>ring</b> <b>elements</b> at a constant distance.
