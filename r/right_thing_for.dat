And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was devastated}} by the trial results, later saying, [...] "It was the most empty feeling in the world." [...] He went home to Knoxville to reflect on {{swimming}} and life in general. He told his parents {{that he could not}} stand hearing coverage of the Olympics, so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica. After returning home, Tarwater's uncle, Richmond Flowers Jr., was able to help him through the experience. [...] In 1968, Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trials. [...] "I think he knew the pain I was feeling and the disappointment I was feeling, because he felt same thing," [...] Tarwater recalled. Flowers offered perspective, instead of comfort: [...] "I believe there is a God who created this, and it ain't no accident. [...] He's got a plan... maybe it just wasn't the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> you." [...] Soon after, Tarwater met pastor Doug Banister of All Souls Church in Knoxville. After several [...] "really tough conversions" [...] with Banister, Tarwater decided to [...] " [...] life to Christ and basically relinquished control." ...|$|E

[...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E

500|$|Picard orders return fire, and the Enterprise {{appears to}} disable the Borg ship. Against Guinan's advice, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) takes an away {{team to the}} immense Borg cube where they find mostly dormant Borg drones and a Borg nursery. [...] Worf discovers that the Borg ship is {{regenerating}} and repairing the damage made by the [...] Enterprise. [...] The away team is beamed directly to the bridge, and Picard orders that they depart at maximum warp. The Borg ship immediately reactivates and begins pursuit, gaining on the Enterprise. Q appears on the bridge and warns Picard that the Borg will never stop chasing them, and cannot be defeated. Picard attempts to fight back against the Borg to no avail, and finally admits he needs Q's help. Q obliges, returning the Enterprise to its last position in Federation space. Picard, though thankful for Q's lesson, blames Q {{for the deaths of}} his crew. Q disappears, but not before reminding them again of their ill-preparedness. Guinan warns Picard that now that the Borg are aware of the Federation's presence, they will be coming. Picard reflects that perhaps Q did the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the wrong reasons by bringing forward their encounter with the Borg, as it has informed the Federation for what lies ahead of them as they continue to explore.|$|E
500|$|Donald P. Baker of The Washington Post {{commented that}} Mathias' lasting {{reputation}} {{would be that}} of a maverick. Though {{he was elected to}} the House in 1960 as a moderate/conservative, his life in the Congress moved him to the center, and he frequently deviated from the party line and sided with Democrats. The fact that he [...] "went out of his way to disassociate himself from [...] " [...] in the 1980 elections had hindered his chances at a chairmanship. Mathias also established a record on civil rights, having played an important role in passing a fair housing bill while he was in the House, and also in establishing a national holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. He held liberal views on abortion, defense spending, and the Equal Rights Amendment, and, along with Senator John Warner of Virginia, was one of the sponsors of a bill to authorize the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. In discussing Mathias' retirement, Tom Wicker of The New York Times commented that [...] "he was fair, flexible, concerned, able to rise above partisanship but not above responsibility". When Wicker asked him which senators he respected the most, Mathias listed J. William Fulbright (D), Jacob Javits (R), John Sherman Cooper (R), Cliff Case (R), Phil Hart (D), Mike Mansfield (D), and George Aiken (R), because [...] "each one of those people would take an issue on his own responsibility... They'd simply come to the conclusion that this was the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the country." ...|$|E

This paper also deals with Aristotle's unique emphasis on courage as linked to the battlefield, for he considers the concept of courage {{as one of those}} many terms that are ambiguous. His insistence that the mean is a "relative mean" and not an objectively calculated mathematical mean, indicates his inclination towards practicality and empiricism. Developing the virtue, courage, in his view remains the shared responsibility of all citizens. Appears in Phronimon, Volume 5 Number 2 (2004) [URL]...|$|R
