5|$|As {{they had}} not yet been {{approved}} by 11 of the 14 states, the ratification of Article One (<b>ratified</b> by 10) and Article Two (<b>ratified</b> by 6) remained incomplete.

5|$|Article Two, {{initially}} <b>ratified</b> {{by seven}} states through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not <b>ratified</b> by another state for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly <b>ratified</b> it on May 6, 1873 {{in protest of}} an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also <b>ratified</b> the article. Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures. As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) for it to become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment's adoption was certified by Archivist of the United States Don W. Wilson and subsequently affirmed {{by a vote of}} Congress on May 20, 1992.|$|E

However, many prominent mining countries have yet to <b>ratify</b> the Convention. In addition, many <b>ratifying</b> nations differ in the amount of effort put into the relevant agencies.|$|R

The campaign created by the Committee ended with success at the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.|$|R
