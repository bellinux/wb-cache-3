5|$|The castle was redeveloped in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, {{probably}} by the Praters: the windows were enlarged to let in more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a <b>revetment,</b> or terrace, was built around the inside of the moat, leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths {{and the need to}} keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a <b>revetment</b> near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective <b>revetment</b> on the south side of the island.|$|E
40|$|Over 115 {{miles of}} rock <b>revetments</b> that serve to protect river banks have been {{constructed}} in the Willamette Basin. In this study {{the spring and summer}} bird use of Willamette Basin <b>revetments</b> is examined. <b>Revetments</b> that had not been recently cleared of most woody vegetation and blackberries were found to have significantly greater total and breeding bird use than cleared <b>revetments.</b> Possible factors affecting bird use, such as vegetation on <b>revetments</b> and vegetation adjacent to <b>revetments</b> are examined using linear regression analysis. The results of this study are compared with results of previous work in riparian forests along the Columbia River. It is concluded that <b>revetments</b> represent significant avian habitat, especially for 2 ̆ 2 edge species, 2 ̆ 2 and that present maintenance practices involving removal of vegetation adversely affect bird use...|$|R
50|$|<b>Revetments</b> {{are used}} as a {{low-cost}} solution for coastal erosion defence in areas where crashing waves may otherwise deplete the coastline. Wooden <b>revetments</b> are made of planks laid against wooden frames so that they disrupt {{the force of the}} water. Although once popular, the use of wooden <b>revetments</b> has largely been replaced by modern concrete-based defence structures such as tetrapods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Revetments</b> are slanted or upright blockades, built {{parallel}} to the coast, usually towards {{the back of the}} beach to protect the area beyond. The most basic <b>revetments</b> consist of timber slants with a possible rock infill. Waves break against the <b>revetments,</b> which dissipate and absorb the energy. The shoreline is protected by the beach material held behind the barriers, as the <b>revetments</b> trap some of the material. They may be watertight, covering the slope completely, or porous, to allow water to filter through after the wave energy has been dissipated. Most <b>revetments</b> do not significantly interfere with transport of longshore drift. Since the wall absorbs energy instead of reflecting, the surf progressively erodes and destroys the revetment; therefore, maintenance is ongoing, as determined by the structural material and product quality.|$|R
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, Worcester {{first became}} {{the capital of}} the Hwicce kingdom, and later formed part of the wider kingdom of Mercia. Worcester and its defences were reorganised by Ealdorman Æthelred and Æthelflæd and bishop Werferth in the 890s. This {{involved}} creating a burh, a fortified Anglo-Saxon town; in Worcester this took the form of a planned settlement, extending out from the old Roman defences, with the Shambles forming a street running along the wall on the east. Archaeological evidence suggests that the burh had 4,650 feet (1,417 m) of walls in total; documentary evidence from the Burghal Hidage document, written shortly after the creation of the walls, suggests they were 4,960 feet (1,512 m) long, a discrepancy that may be accounted for by changes {{in the course of the}} river since the 10th century. The walls incorporated the old Roman fortifications on the south and south-east side of the city and appear to have included a defensive ditch, with a <b>revetment</b> supporting a wooden palisade.|$|E
5|$|Work {{on the new}} {{fortification}} {{was completed}} in 1068. Probably at first a wooden keep was constructed, which was later replaced with a much stronger stone one. Lincoln Castle is very unusual in having two mottes, the only other surviving {{example of such a}} design being at Lewes. To the south, where the Roman wall stands {{on the edge of a}} steep slope, it was retained partially as a curtain wall and partially as a <b>revetment</b> retaining the mottes. In the west, where the ground is more level, the Roman wall was buried within an earth rampart and extended upward to form the Norman castle wall. The Roman west gate (on the same site as the castle's west gate) was excavated in the 19th century but began to collapse on exposure, and so was re-buried.|$|E
5|$|As soon as MacArthur cleared US {{aircraft}} to enter North Korea, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron sent {{aircraft to}} scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the aircraft had not completed their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group {{took off from}} airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These {{would be the first}} offensive action against North Korea. The aircraft arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of aircraft from North Korea's 1st Air Division parked on the tarmac, caught completely by surprise. The US aircraft subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and <b>revetment</b> areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able to get one aircraft off the ground to oppose the flight, a Yak-3. The aircraft was quickly shot down by Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US aircraft destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and one in the air while suffering no aircraft lost.|$|E
50|$|Three 25-man Prime BEEF {{teams were}} {{organized}} from Air Training Command, Strategic Air Command, and Air Defense Command. Teams were deployed to Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases (all in South Vietnam) to construct aircraft <b>revetments</b> and complete whatever {{work that was}} needed. During their 120-day deployments, the teams constructed over 12,000 ft of <b>revetments,</b> parking aprons, and several miles of roads. The <b>revetments</b> paid for themselves in saved aircraft in just the first six months.|$|R
50|$|Additional harbor {{improvements}} {{were made}} in the 20th century, starting with the extension of the <b>revetments</b> and the addition of concrete reinforcement. Dredging of the channel continued in the 1910s and 1920s. Between 1951 and 1983, sheet steel substructures were set into place along the piers and <b>revetments.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Itchen Navigation {{supports}} a rich flora and fauna, and one {{benefit of the}} 5-year grant-funded restoration project has been the regular monitoring and publishing of reports to document this. Annual reports on the populations of birds, bats, otters, water voles and butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies have been produced, with occasional reports on other aspects, while the Environment Agency has produces fisheries reports. As part of the project, a number of engineering works {{have been carried out}} to stabilise the banks, and trees have been cut back {{to reduce the amount of}} shade and encourage the growth of marginal vegetation. In the case of the water vole survey, this has been concentrated on the sections where work has been carried out, whereas the butterfly, damselfly and dragonfly survey has tended to cover the whole navigation. Vegetated berms containing marginal plants have been placed along the banks. The project has tried to avoid the installation of revetments, as the vertical faces prevent wildlife accessing the banks, but where a <b>revetment</b> is necessary to combat erosion, it has been built of oak and a berm placed in front of it to soften the edge.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans built a stone minaret {{close to}} the narthex. The {{building}} was originally decorated with a marble <b>revetment</b> and mosaics, which disappeared totally. As a whole, Bodrum mosque shows strong analogies with the north church of the Fenari Isa complex.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the inner}} colored marble <b>revetment</b> largely disappeared, the shrine still {{contains}} the restored {{remains of a}} number of mosaic panels, which, while not as varied and well-preserved as those of the Chora Church, serve as another resource for understanding late Byzantine art.|$|E
50|$|The {{structural}} approach attempts to prevent erosion. Armoring involves building <b>revetments,</b> seawalls, detached breakwaters, groins, etc. Structures that run {{parallel to the}} shore (seawalls or <b>revetments)</b> prevent erosion. While this protects structures, it doesn't protect the beach that is outside the wall. The beach generally disappears over a period that ranges from months to decades.|$|R
5000|$|Uzhnyi (also Severnyi) (Южный) was an {{interceptor}} aircraft {{air base in}} Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia located 17 km south of Kaliningrad. A large mile-wide taxiway ring on west side fed a series of aircraft <b>revetments.</b> There were remote bomber or alert <b>revetments</b> for about 5 aircraft. It is abandoned and {{in a state of}} decay as of 2000.|$|R

25|$|For the {{execution}} of its astonishing <b>revetment</b> of marbles inlaid with colored marbles and semi-precious stone, the Grand Ducal hardstone workshop, the Opificio delle Pietre Dure was established. The art of commessi, {{as it was called}} in Florence, assembled jig-sawn fragments of specimen stones to form the designs of the <b>revetment</b> that entirely cover the walls. The result was disapproved of by 18th and 19th century visitors, but has come to be appreciated for an example of the taste of its time. Six grand sarcophagi are empty; the Medici remains are interred in the crypt below. In sixteen compartments of the dado are coats-of-arms of Tuscan cities under Medici control. In the niches that were intended to hold portrait sculptures of Medici, two (Ferdinando I and Cosimo II) were executed by Pietro Tacca (1626–42).|$|E
25|$|The top of {{the rotunda}} wall {{features}} a series of brick relieving arches, visible {{on the outside and}} built into the mass of the brickwork. The Pantheon is full of such devices– for example, there are relieving arches over the recesses inside– but all these arches were hidden by marble facing on the interior and possibly by stone <b>revetment</b> or stucco on the exterior.|$|E
25|$|Nourishment is one {{of three}} {{commonly}} accepted methods for protecting shorelines. The structural alternative involves constructing a seawall, <b>revetment,</b> groyne or breakwater. Alternatively, with managed retreat the shoreline is left to erode, while relocating buildings and infrastructure further inland. Nourishment gained popularity because it preserved beach resources and avoided the negative effects of hard structures. Instead, nourishment creates a “soft” (i.e., non-permanent) structure by creating a larger sand reservoir, pushing the shoreline seaward.|$|E

25|$|Using data {{generated}} by the Thames Archaeological Survey, the Thames Discovery Programme selected twenty key sites across the Greater London area for further recording and on-going monitoring during 2008 - 2011. The first site chosen was Custom House, London; in February 2009, FROG members recorded the causeway, parts of the 1819 riverside wall, the Custom House gridiron, the remains of two vessels partly buried on the foreshore and a multi-phase <b>revetment</b> structure located under Billingsgate Wharf.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} to decorate paintings with clothes or <b>revetment</b> (riza) of precious metals {{may have been}} borrowed from Eastern Orthodox. The clothing of Our Lady is composed of three gilded silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period. The head and shoulders were covered in 1670–90; the chest piece was adapted from a different painting in 1695–1700; {{the bottom of the}} painting was completed by the 1730s. The clothes are richly decorated in floral motifs: roses, tulips, narcissi, carnations, and at least six other species.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{few years}} after Bird's {{description}} of the fruit ships unloading alongside London Bridge, the inner London docks fell into disuse as a result of trade moving to the container port downriver at Tilbury Docks. New Fresh Wharf closed for good in 1970 and in 1973 the warehouse was demolished. Archaeological excavations on the site between 1974 and 1978 uncovered the remains of the Roman quay and <b>revetment.</b> The demolished warehouse was eventually replaced by St Magnus House, an office building designed by Richard Seifert that was constructed in 1978.|$|E

25|$|The inner ditch was of V-section, 3.5 metres {{deep and}} 8.8 metres wide. Postholes for upright beams {{were found at}} the front of the inner rampart. These posts would have held {{horizontal}} timbers forming a wooden <b>revetment</b> to the front of the rampart. The rampart was composed of sand and gravel dug from the ditches, together with a wall of cut and laid turf into which the posts had been recessed. Additional postholes were discovered 5.8 metres behind the front postholes. These presumably held anchor timbers for the front wall, although the 5.8 metre distance between the rows is thought somewhat excessive for simple cross-bracing.|$|E
25|$|The airport {{started off}} as Moret Field, an American {{airfield}} that was constructed from a rather poor Japanese airfield {{just north of}} Zamboanga. Construction was started by Philippine Commonwealth troops just after American forces landed at the present location on March 15, 1945. It was improved by a U.S. Army airfield construction unit using considerable Filipino labor. When completed, the single runway was about 4,500 feet long aligned SW to NE. There were two adjacent taxiways along {{both sides of the}} runway with <b>revetment</b> areas. At the peak of operations in 1945, there were about 300 aircraft flying from the airfield. The vast majority were United States Marine Corps aircraft from Marine Aircraft Group 24 which were supporting U.S. Army infantry operations on Mindanao but also ranging down the Sulu area as far as Borneo.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum is}} located in the town centre. It was built between 1937 and 1940 by {{architect}} Patroklos Karantinos on a site previously occupied by the Roman Catholic monastery of Saint-Francis which was destroyed by earthquake in 1856. The museum's antiseismic building is an important example of modernist architecture and was awarded a Bauhaus commendation. Karantinos applied the principles of modern architecture to the specific needs of a museum by providing good lighting from the skylights above and {{along the top of the}} walls, and facilitating the easy flow of large groups of people. He also anticipated future extensions to the museum. The colours and construction materials, such as the veined polychrome marbles, recall certain Minoan wall-paintings which imitate marble <b>revetment.</b> The two-storeyed building has large exhibition spaces, laboratories, a drawing room, a library, offices and a special department, the so-called Scientific Collection, where numerous finds are stored and studied. The museum shop, run by the Archaeological Receipts Fund, sells museum copies, books, postcards and slides. There is also a café.|$|E
