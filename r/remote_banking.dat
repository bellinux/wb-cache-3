The Suffolk Bank became one of the most profitable in the country and continued to operate under the Suffolk System until 1858, when rival institutions complained of dictatorial practices and eventually national legislation banned state banknotes.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a new {{architecture}} for <b>remote</b> <b>banking</b> and e-commerce applications. The proposed solution {{is designed to be}} low cost and provides some good guarantees of security for a client and his bank issuer. Indeed, the main problem for an issuer is to identify and authenticate one client (a cardholder) using his personal computer through the web when this client wants to access to <b>remote</b> <b>banking</b> services or when he wants to pay on a e-commerce site equipped with 3 D-secure payment solution. The proposed solution described {{in this paper}} is MasterCard Chip Authentication Program compliant and was experimented in the project called SOPAS. The main contribution of this system consists in the use of a smartcard with a I 2 C bus that pilots a terminal only equipped with a screen and a keyboard. During the use of services, the user types his PIN code on the keyboard and all the security part of the transaction is performed by the chip of the smartcard. None information of security stays on the personal computer and a dynamic token created by the card is sent to the bank and verified by the front end. We present first the defined methodology and we analyze the main security aspects of the proposed solution...|$|E

30|$|The above {{concerns}} {{have led to}} issues of surplus liquidity or excess cash in African formal financial institutions (see Saxegaard 2006; Fouda 2009; Asongu 2014 a, p. 70). The authors have suggested measures to curb both the voluntary and involuntary holding of excess liquidity by banks. First, voluntary holding of excess cash can be reduced by: (i) helping banks to track their positions at the central bank {{to prevent them from}} keeping reserves above statutory limits; (ii) consolidating institutions that are favorable to interbank lending; and (iii) improving infrastructure to prevent <b>remote</b> <b>bank</b> branches from holding excess reserves essentially due to transportation problems. Second, involuntary keeping of surplus cash can be kept at minimum by: (i) reducing the incapacity of banks to lend in scenarios where interest rates are regulated; (ii) creating conducive conditions for commercial banks to invest surplus liquidity in bond markets; (iii) increasing investment avenues for regional banks via promotion of regional stock exchange markets; and (iv) reducing lending contraction of banks through instruments that encourage competition and mitigate information asymmetry. This line of inquiry is closest to the final point (iii) of the first strand, regarding the improvement of infrastructure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Facing an {{unfavorable}} economic environment since 2007 the Portuguese banking sector {{has been unable}} to generate profitability levels capable of ensuring the industry's attractiveness to investors.

The widespread diffusion of technological innovation in Portuguese society enhances the use of <b>remote</b> <b>banking</b> access channels such as internet banking service (IB) and the ATM, while the traditional branch channel usage is decreasing. A study conducted in the Lisbon area, with 191 responses obtained, revealed that the channels with greater usage intensity are the ATM and IB. It further revealed that there are behavior dimensions on the IB use with direct effect on customer retention. Satisfaction with IB service, perceived switching costs and favorable price perception affect customer retention in their IB service. The findings of this research also confirm that satisfaction with IB service and perceived service price have a direct effect on repurchase intention...|$|E

The current deployment of videophones drives new opportu-nities for a secured access to <b>remote</b> servers (<b>banking,</b> certification, call centers, etc.). The synchrony of the speech signal and lip movements is a necessary condition to check that the observed talking face has not been manipulated and/or synthesized. This overview addresses face, speaker and talking face verification, as well as face and voice transformation techniques. It is demonstrated that a dedicated impostor needs limited information from a client to fool state of the art audio-visual identity verification systems. ...|$|R
