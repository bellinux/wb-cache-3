50|$|E {{had another}} feature that TECO lacked: <b>random-access</b> <b>editing.</b> TECO was a page-sequential editor that was {{designed}} for editing paper tape on the PDP-1 and typically allowed editing on only one page at a time, {{in the order of}} the pages in the file. Instead of adopting E's approach of structuring the file for page-random access on disk, Stallman modified TECO to handle large buffers more efficiently and changed its file-management method to read, edit, and write the entire file as a single buffer. Almost all modern editors use this approach.|$|E
5000|$|Various approximations of {{non-linear}} editing systems {{were built in}} the '80s using computers coordinating multiple laser discs, or banks of VCRs. One example of these tape & disc-based systems was Lucasfilm's EditDroid, which used several laserdiscs of the same raw footage to simulate <b>random-access</b> <b>editing</b> (a compatible system was developed for sound post-production by Lucasfilm called SoundDroidâ€”one of the earliest digital audio workstations). The LA-based post house Laser Edit (which later merged with Pacific Video as Laser-Pacific) also had an in-house system using recordable random-access laserdiscs. The most popular non-linear system was Ediflex, which used a bank of multiple Sony JVC VCRs for offline editing. Ediflex was introduced in 1983 on the Universal series [...] "Still the Beaver," [...] edited by Herb Dow, A.C.E. By 1985 it was used on over 80% of filmed network programs. In 1985 Cinedco was awarded the Technical Emmy for [...] "Design and Implementation of Non-Linear Editing for Filmed Programs. Adrian Ettlinger, Herb Dow A.C.E., Milt Forman and Andy Maltz shared the award, All were slow, cumbersome, and had problems with the limited computer horsepower of the time, but the mid-to-late-1980s saw a trend towards {{non-linear editing}}, moving away from film editing on Movieolas and the linear videotape method (usually employing 3/4" [...] VCRs).|$|E
