5|$|Poliphilus {{is named}} after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, one of Manutius's most famous books in the Latin alphabet, which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but <b>recut</b> capitals; it was made for the Medici Society, who planned to create an English translation. Blado {{is named after}} the printer Antonio Blado, a {{colleague}} of Arrighi. Morison preferred Bembo's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus. Unlike Bembo, both in metal featured a Greek-influenced Y with a curving head, as in the original.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{his work}} {{inspired}} many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards, {{even though the}} typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499. Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that its influence {{may have been due}} to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume, perhaps created as a small pilot project. De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters, perhaps as an experiment, which included a lower-case p in the same style as the capital letter with a flat top. In 1499, Griffo <b>recut</b> the capitals, changing the appearance of the typeface slightly. This version was used to print Manutius' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.|$|E

Focus is particularly directed at the previously proposed plans to substitute real commercial airliners with pilotless drone aircraft in order to investigate the plausibility of covertly using them as weapons whilst maintaining the cover of an accident.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{different}} edits of the series: Some, but not all, American PBS stations <b>recut</b> the series into seven 30-minute episodes when they began transmitting the episodes nearly two years later, in December 1982. Other PBS stations re-edited the programme into TV movies, broadcasting more than one episode at a time without interruption. The UK videotape release was on two cassettes, each consisting of three episodes edited to run together and also adding some previously unseen material. The soundtrack was remixed into stereo. The North American VHS tape release by CBS-Fox Home Video included this material on a single video cassette.

25|$|Both films occasioned major {{disputes}} between Bogdanovich, who still demanded {{a measure of}} control over his films, and the studios, which controlled the financing and final cut of both films. Mask was released with a song score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich's wishes (he favored Bruce Springsteen), and Bogdanovich has often complained that the version of Texasville that was released was not the film he had intended. A director's cut of Mask, slightly longer and with Springsteen's songs, was belatedly released on DVD in 2006. A director's cut of Texasville was released on laserdisc, and the theatrical cut was released on DVD by MGM in 2005. Around {{the time of the}} release of Texasville, Bogdanovich also revisited his earliest success, The Last Picture Show, and produced a slightly modified director's cut. Since that time, his <b>recut</b> has been the only available version of the film.|$|E
25|$|John Beck {{enlisted the}} help of two Hollywood writers, Paul Mason and Bruce Howard, to write a new screenplay. After having discussions with Beck in regard to how the film would be handled, the two wrote the American version and worked with editor Peter Zinner to remove scenes, <b>recut</b> others, and change the {{sequence}} of several events. Mason and Howard, in order to give the film more of an American feel, {{came up with the idea}} of inserting newly-shot footage of stage and television actor Michael Keith playing newscaster Eric Carter, a UN reporter who spends much of the time commenting on the action from the UN Headquarters via an International Communications Satellite (ICS) broadcast, and Harry Holcombe as Dr. Arnold Johnson, the head of the Museum of Natural History in New York, who tries to explain Godzilla's origin and his and Kong's motivations. The new footage was directed by Thomas Montgomery and shot in three days.|$|E
25|$|Proenneke {{remained}} at Twin Lakes {{for the next}} sixteen months when he left to go home for a time to visit relatives and secure more supplies. He returned to the lakes in the following spring and remained there {{for most of the}} next thirty years, going to the contiguous United States only occasionally to be with his family. He made a film record of his solitary life which was later <b>recut</b> and made into the documentary Alone in the Wilderness. It has aired on PBS numerous times. With a score of 9 out of 10 from the aggregation of nearly 2000 votes at the Internet Movie Database, the documentary is one of the highest rated of all time. In 2011 a sequel was produced after it was discovered that Proenneke had shot enough footage for at least two more programs. Alone in the Wilderness: Part 2 premiered on December 2, 2011.

40|$|Using {{detection}} of ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE), {{we tested the}} hypothesis that xylem blockage by bacteria in rose stems (Rosa hybrida L.) can induce cavitation. In both Madelon and Cara Mia roses, cavitation started when the bacterial count in vase water reached 108 ml- 1, {{although the number of}} cavitations was higher in Cara Mia stems. Following placement in water containing 108 colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria, cavitation occurred immediately, both in Madelon and Cara Mia roses. After removal of the conduits that were opened at harvest (by <b>recutting</b> 25 cm of the stem end under water), prior to placement in the bacterial suspension, no cavitations were observed in stems of Madelon roses. This indicated that cavitation started with the air in xylem conduits that were opened by cutting. In contrast, <b>recutting</b> 25 cm under water from the stems of Cara Mia roses did not reduce the number of cavitations. It is concluded that a bacterial occlusion resulted in a high rate of cavitation, hence in a considerable number of conduits, with air bubbles. These bubbles may further impede water uptak...|$|R
