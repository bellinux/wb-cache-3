40|$|Reflection of a {{microscopic}} particle from a mesoscopic/macroscopic `mirror' generates two-body correlated interference from the incident and <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> substates and their associated mirror substates. The microscopic momentum exchanged generates two mirror substates which interfere to produce fringes {{which do not}} vanish as the mirror mass increases. The small displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible environmental decoherence times. Mirror coherence lengths impose constraints {{on the extent of}} this interference, which are mitigated using interference of the two-body states associated with the particle reflecting from both of the two surfaces of a slab of matter in a manner analogous to the classical interference of a pulse of light reflecting from a `thin film'. This two-body correlated interference is modeled as a particle traversing a finite well with both the particle and well treated quantum mechanically. Such a treatment predicts the expected `thin-film' interference but only as a special case of a more general result. It is also shown that measurements on only the <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> (yielding a marginal probability density function) can act as a probe to reveal the quantum state of the macroscopic reflector. For equal masses, coherence of the particle substate is transferred to the mirror substate, a quantum manifestation of a familiar classical result. Comment: 22 pages 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-body}} quantum correlation {{is calculated}} for a particle and an infinite potential well {{in which it}} is trapped or either a barrier or finite well over which it traverses. Correlated interference results when the incident and <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> substates and their associated well or barrier substates overlap. Measurement of the particle in this region causes a splitting of the well or barrier substate at subsequent times. The joint probability density, which is a function both of the different positions and different times at which the particle and well or barrier are measured, is derived assuming that no interaction occurs between the time each is measured.

40|$|The {{properties}} of 'discontinuous' transitions in a current-carrying plasma are investigated by adopting an approach {{based on the}} two-fluid equations for a plasma. Braginskii's (1965) transport equations for a two-fluid plasma carrying a current are presented, and allowance is made for collisions with a background neutral gas {{as well as for}} effects of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles.</b> The speed of sound in a current-carrying plasma is derived so that the Mach number can be defined correctly as the ratio of the flow speed to the wave phase velocity in such a plasma. The various types of discontinuities permitted by the relevant jump relations in the absence of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> are classified, the effect of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> on such discontinuities is examined, and it is shown that the degree of indeterminacy of a discontinuity can be changed by the presence of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles.</b> Consideration of shocks containing a population of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> and adiabatic transitions indicates that the pressure of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> alone can give rise to both weak and strong transitions.

The inner and outer borders of the chaotic field line region are determined precisely. It is found that the particles confined in the chaotic field line region are classified into two groups that are passing <b>particles</b> and <b>reflected</b> <b>particles.</b> Passing particles have long lifetime, because of the long connection length of the chaotic field line. <b>Reflected</b> <b>particles</b> are confined because they are trapped by the magnetic mirror in the chaotic field line region due to the strong adiabaticity.

25|$|If the {{collisions}} of body A and the gravific {{particles are}} fully elastic, {{the intensity of}} the <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> would be as strong as of the incoming ones, so no net directional force would arise. The same is true if a second body B is introduced, where B acts as a shield against gravific particles in the direction of A. The gravific particle C which ordinarily would strike on A is blocked by B, but another particle D which ordinarily would not have struck A, is re-directed by the reflection on B, and therefore replaces C. Thus if the collisions are fully elastic, the <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> between A and B would fully compensate any shadowing effect. In order to account for a net gravitational force, it must be assumed that the collisions are not fully elastic, or at least that the <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> are slowed, so that their momentum is reduced after the impact. This would result in streams with diminished momentum departing from A, and streams with undiminished momentum arriving at A, so a net directional momentum toward the center of A would arise (P3). Under this assumption, the <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> in the two-body case will not fully compensate the shadowing effect, because the reflected flux is weaker than the incident flux.|$|R

A good frame-work to study it, both experimentally and theoretically, are atom-surface interac-tions.

The method is tested {{by comparing the results}} to numerical calculations within the time-independent Schrödinger equation. Consequently, a dynamically influenced process is studied: {{the reflection of}} a particle on a har-monically oscillating surface.

The magnetic axis shift is rather large in collisional equilibriurn in the reference QAS configuration. On the other hand, in collisionless equilibrium, the bootstrap current is evaluated self-consistently and its crucial role on reduction of magnetic axis shift is shown. The effects of important boundary harmonics on the magnetic configuration are considered, in particular, plasma boundary control has been investigated for reducing the Pfirsch-Schluter current.

Amplification of the magnetic field by several orders of magnitude has also been suggested by observations of gamma-ray bursts afterglows, both in downstream and upstream plasmas. This paper addresses this issue of magnetic field generation in a relativistic shock precursor through micro-instabilities. In a generic superluminal configuration, the level of magnetization of the upstream plasma {{turns out to be}} a crucial parameter, notably because the length scale of the shock precursor is limited by the Larmor rotation of the accelerated particles in the background magnetic field and by the speed of the shock wave. We discuss in detail and calculate the growth rates of the following beam plasma instabilities seeded by the accelerated and <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> populations: for an unmagnetized shock, the Weibel and filamentation instabilities, as well as the Čerenkov resonant instabilities with electrostatic modes; for a magnetized shock, the Weibel instability and the resonant Čerenkov instabilities with the longitudinal electrostatic modes, as well as the Alfvén, Whisler and extraordinary modes.

40|$|A {{two-body}} quantum correlation {{is calculated}} for a particle reflecting from a moving mirror. Correlated interference results when the incident and <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> substates and their associated mirror substates overlap. Using the Copenhagen interpretation of measurement, an asynchronous joint probability density (PDF), {{which is a}} function both of the different positions and different times at which the particle and mirror are measured, is derived assuming that no interaction occurs between each measurement. Measurement of the particle first, in the correlated interference region, results in a splitting of the mirror substate into ones which have and have not reflected the particle. An analog of the interference from the Doppler effect for only measurements of the particle (a marginal PDF), in this two-body system, is {{shown to be a}} consequence of the asynchronous measurement. The simplification obtained for a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic or macroscopic mirror is used to illustrate asynchronous correlation interferometry. In this case, the small displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible environmental decoherence times. In addition, interference of these mirror states does not vanish in the limit of large mirror mass due to the small momentum exchange in reflecting a microscopic particle.

40|$|One of {{the driving}} forces for {{research}} in medical sciences is to develop more effective and less intrusive treatments. High Intensity Ultrasound (HIU) is a technique that uses the acoustic field produced by a transducer to induce thermal effects in soft tissue for therapeutic purposes like tissue ablation for cancer treatment, localized drug delivery, sonoporation, among others. The bioeffects induced in soft tissue by HIU, particularly close to solid (bone) interfaces, are not yet fully understood. The objective of this thesis work is to gain further understanding of the effects that the waves reflected by bone have on the treatment outcome. This study presents the experimental validation of a simple and efficient method to calculate the acoustic field generated by a high intensity ultra- sound (HIU) transducer that {{is used in the}} vicinity of a solid interface. The model takes into account the interaction between the forward and the re- flected wave generated at the boundary between a fluid and a solid.

40|$|Abridged) This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} magnetic field generation in a relativistic shock precursor through micro-instabilities. The level of magnetization of the upstream plasma {{turns out to be}} a crucial parameter, notably because the length scale of the shock precursor is limited by the Larmor rotation of the accelerated particles in the background magnetic field and by the speed of the shock wave. We discuss in detail and calculate the growth rates of the following beam plasma instabilities seeded by the accelerated and <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> populations: for an unmagnetized shock, the Weibel and filamentation instabilities, as well as the Cerenkov resonant longitudinal and oblique modes; for a magnetized shock, the Weibel instability and the resonant Cerenkov instabilities with the longitudinal electrostatic modes, as well as the Alfven, Whisler and extraordinary modes. All these instabilities are generated upstream, then they are transmitted downstream. The modes excited by Cerenkov resonant instabilities take on particular importance with respect to the magnetisation of the downstream medium since, being plasma eigenmodes, they have a longer lifetime than the Weibel modes. We discuss the main limitation of the wave growth associated with the length of the precursor and the magnetisation of the upstream medium for both oblique and parallel shock waves. We also characterize the proper conditions to obtain Fermi acceleration. We recover some results of most recent particle-in-cell simulations and conclude with some applications to astrophysical cases of interest, pulsar winds and gamma-ray burst external shock waves in particular.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} in {{addition}} to the (full) wave function to describe the whole quantum ensemble of particles tunneling through an one-dimensional potential barrier there are solutions to the Schrödinger equation, which describe separately transmission and reflection: they are orthogonal and their sum yields the full wave function; in the limit of large times one of the subensemble's wave packets approaches the transmitted wave packet, but another does the reflected packet. For each subensemble of particles 1) the average momentum of particles is the same, before and after the scattering event; 2) the average starting points differ, for wave packets of an arbitrary width, from that for the whole ensemble. We find that for symmetric potential barriers the domain of the motion of <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> is bounded by the midpoint of the barrier region. We define exact and asymptotic tunneling times to describe separately the duration of passing the average positions of transmitted and <b>reflected</b> <b>particles</b> through the barrier region.

40|$|The {{research}} efforts {{funded by the}} Uranus Data Analysis Program (UDAP) grant to the Bartol Research Institute (BRI) involved the study of magnetic field waves associated with the Uranian bow shock. Upstream wave studies are motivated as {{a study of the}} physics of collisionless shocks. Collisionless shocks in plasmas are capable of 'reflecting' a fraction of the incoming thermal particle distribution and directing the resulting energetic particle motion back into the upstream region. Once within the upstream region, the backward streaming energetic particles convey information of the approaching shock to the supersonic flow. This particle population is responsible for the generation of upstream magnetic and electrostatic fluctuations known as 'upstream waves', for slowing the incoming wind prior to the formation of the shock ramp, and for heating of the upstream plasma. The waves produced at Uranus not only differed in several regards from the observations at other planetary bow shocks, but also gave new information regarding the nature of the <b>reflected</b> <b>particle</b> populations which were largely unmeasurable by the particle instruments. Four distinct magnetic field wave types were observed upstream of the Uranian bow shock: low-frequency Alfven or fast magnetosonic waves excited by energetic protons originating at or behind the bow shock; whistler wave bursts driven by gyrating ion distributions within the shock ramp; and two whistler wave types simultaneously observed upstream of the flanks of the shock and argued to arise from resonance with energetic electrons.

40|$|Abstract A new {{measurement}} technique allowing a direct {{assessment of a}} three-dimensional shear stress field is proposed. The method is based on liquids exhibiting the optical effect of streaming birefringence that is visualized using the apparatus called polariscope. Spherical <b>reflecting</b> <b>particles</b> are added into the birefringent fluid and illuminated with a polarized, monochromatic light sheet. Three kinds of the light sources were tested: CW-Laser diode, low-pressure sodium lamps and light emitting diodes. In order to resolve a 3 D shear stress field, a test volume is scanned {{by a set of}} parallel light sheets. Each sheet is acquired by two identical synchronized cameras from opposite directions that results in two different images. The light intensity in each image {{is a measure of the}} optical effect of streaming birefringence on the way of the light from <b>reflecting</b> <b>particles</b> to the sensor chip of each camera. By a combination of two images for one light sheet and one final image with a light transmission through the test volume an optical effect of the birefringence on the way between light sheet and camera may be separated and a 3 D resolution of the effect in a test volume may be solved.
