50|$|Brest and Rossow 1992, and {{the updated}} {{methodology}} et al., 1997, {{put forth a}} robust method for calibration monitoring of individual sensors and normalization of all sensors to a common standard. The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) method begins with the detection of clouds and corrections for ozone, <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter,</b> and seasonal variations in irradiance to produce surface reflectances. Monthly histograms of surface reflectance are then produced for various surface types, and various histogram limits are then applied as a filter to the original sensor observations and ultimately aggregated to produce a global, cloud free surface reflectance.|$|E
50|$|In <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> based {{distributed}} {{fiber optic}} sensing, a coherent laser pulse is sent along an optic fiber, and scattering sites within the fiber cause the fiber {{to act as}} a distributed interferometer with a gauge length approximately equal to the pulse length. The intensity of the reflected light is measured as a function of time after transmission of the laser pulse. This is known as Coherent Rayleigh Optical Domain Reflectometry (COTDR) When the pulse has had time to travel the full length of the fiber and back, the next laser pulse can be sent along the fiber. Changes in the reflected intensity of successive pulses from the same region of fiber are caused by changes in the optical path length of that section of fiber. This type of system is very sensitive to both strain and temperature variations of the fiber and measurements can be made almost simultaneously at all sections of the fiber.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is a {{measurement}} technique applicable for {{the determination of}} density distributions in various technical or natural flows. The current sensitivity limits of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> technique were investigated experimentally. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to measure density oscillations caused by acoustic pressure oscillations noninvasively and directly. Acoustical standing waves in a rectangular duct were investigated using <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> and compared to microphone measurements. The comparison showed a sensitivity of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> technique of 75 Pa (7 · 10 ^(− 4) kg∕m 3) and a precision of 14 Pa (1 · 10 ^(− 4) kg∕m 3). Therefore, it was also shown that <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is applicable for acoustic measurements...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the laser}} <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> signal in a flow to {{determine}} density and temperature have been commonly employed in open flames and in wind tunnel environments. In these measurements, the density or reciprocal temperature is correlated with the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> signal intensity. A major advantage of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> for these applications is the simple experimental arrangement allowed by this technique. Intensity-based <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> measurements of density and temperature have been limited to relatively clean flows in open environments so that interference from particle scattering and laser scattering is minimal. A new approach, using dual-line detection <b>Rayleigh</b> (DLDR) <b>scattering</b> extends the applicability of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> measurements of density and temperature to enclosed environments where surface scattering interference is high. Depending on particle size and optical properties, this approach may also reduce interference from particle scattering...|$|R
50|$|It can be {{seen from}} the above {{equation}} that <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is strongly dependent upon the size of the particle and the wavelengths. The intensity of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.|$|R
50|$|Distributed {{acoustic}} sensing {{relies on}} light which is Rayleigh backscattered from small {{variations in the}} refractive index of the fiber. The backscattered light has the same frequency as the transmitted light. There {{are a number of}} other distributed fiber sensing techniques that rely on different scattering mechanisms and can be used to measure other parameters.Brillouin scatter occurs due to the interaction between the light and acoustic phonons travelling in the fiber. As the light is scattered by a moving phonon, its frequency is shifted by the Doppler effect by around 10 GHz. Light is generated at both at above (anti-Stokes shift) and below (Stokes shift) the original optical frequency. The intensity and frequency shifts of the two components are dependent on both temperature and strain and by measuring the shifts, absolute values of the two parameters can be calculated using a distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) system. Brillouin scatter is much weaker than <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> and so the reflections from a number of pulses must be summed together to enable the measurements to be made. Therefore, the maximum frequency at which changes can be measured using Brillouin scatter is typically a few tens of Hz.Raman scatter occurs when light is scattered in interaction with molecular vibrations in the fiber. As with Brillouin scattering, both Stokes and anti-Stokes components are produced and these are shifted from the wavelength of the incident light by several tens of nanometers. By measuring the ratio in intensity between the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, an absolute value of temperature can be measured by a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system. The larger wavelength shifts compared to Brillouin scatter mean that it is easier to separate the scattered Raman light from the un-shifted Rayleigh scattered component. However the intensity of the Raman scatter is even lower than the Brillouin scatter and so it is normally necessary to average for many seconds or even minutes in order to get reasonable results. Therefore, Raman-based systems are only suitable for measuring slowly varying temperatures.|$|E

With both streams beeing subsonic, the same two-dimensional large-scale Brown-Roshko structures have been found as in the Schlieren pictures from earlier experiments conducted in the same facility. These structures disappear from the Schlieren pictures when the high speed stream becomes supersonic, but for low M sup (i) c 1 they are still visible in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> images. At higher compressibility levels the interface between the stream becomes very irregular in the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> images. No strong shocks have been found inside the shear layer...|$|E

This multi-dimensional fluorescence–Raman microscopy platform enables rapid imaging along the fluorescence emission and/or <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> dimensions. It is shown that optical contrast in these {{images can be}} used to select an area of interest prior to subsequent investigation with high spatially and spectrally resolved Raman imaging. This new microscopy platform combines the strengths of Raman ‘chemical’ imaging with light scattering microscopy and fluorescence microscopy and provides new modes of correlative light microscopy.

40|$|Molecular <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> {{offers a}} means to measure gas flow {{parameters}} including density, temperature, and velocity. No seeding of the flow is necessary. The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> power {{is proportional to the}} gas density, the spectral width is related to the gas temperature, and the shift in the frequency of the spectral peak is proportional to one component of the fluid velocity. Velocity measurements based on <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> are more suitable for high-speed flow, where the bulk fluid velocity is on the order of, or larger than, the molecular thermal velocities. Use of ultraviolet wavelengths for <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> diagnostics is attractive for two reasons. First, the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> cross section is proportional to the inverse 4 th power of the wavelength. And second, the reflectivity of metallic surfaces is generally less than it is at longer wavelengths. This is of particular interest in confined flow situations, such as in small wind tunnels and aircraft engine components, where the stray laser light scattered from the windows and internal surfaces in the test facility limits the application of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> diagnostics. In this work at the NASA Lewis Research Center, molecular <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> of the 266 -nm fourth harmonic of a pulsed, injection seeded Nd:YAG (neodymium:yttriumaluminum- garnet) laser was used to measure velocity in a supersonic free air jet with a 9. 3 - mm exit diameter. The frequency of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> light was analyzed with a planar mirror Fabry-Perot interferometer used in a static imaging mode, with the images recorded on a cooled, high-quantum-efficiency charge-coupled discharge (CCD) camera. In addition, some unshifted light from the same laser pulse was imaged through the interferometer to generate a reference. Data were obtained with single laser pulses at velocities up to Mach 1. 3. The measured velocities were in good agreement with velocities calculated from isentropic flow relations. Our conclusion from this study was that ultraviolet <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is preferable in confined flow situations because of the increase in the ratio of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> signal to stray laser light. On the other hand, in open flows, such as free jets and larger wind tunnels where stray laser light can be controlled, visible <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is preferable...|$|R
40|$|We are {{currently}} developing a velocimeter based on modulated filtered <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> (MFRS), utilizing diode lasers to make measurements in an unseeded gas or flame. MFRS {{is a novel}} variation of filtered <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering,</b> utilizing modulation absorption spectroscopy to detect a strong absorption of a weak <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> signal. A rubidium (Rb) vapor filter is used to provide the relatively strong absorption and semiconductor diode lasers generate the relatively weak <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattered</b> signal. Alkali metal vapors have a high optical depth at modest vapor pressures, and their narrow linewidth is ideally suited for high-resolution velocimetry; the compact, rugged construction of diode lasers makes them ideally suited for microgravity experimentation. Molecular <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> of laser light simplifies flow measurements as it obviates the complications of flow-seeding. The MFRS velocimeter should offer an attractive alternative to comparable systems, providing a relatively inexpensive means of measuring velocity in unseeded flows and flames...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is {{a result}} of an {{interaction}} of photons with bound electrons. <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> is mostly neglected in calculations of hot star model atmospheres because most of the hydrogen atoms are ionized and the heavier elements have a lower abundance than hydrogen. In atmospheres of some chemically peculiar stars, helium overabundant regions containing singly ionized helium are present and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> can be a significant opacity source. We evaluate the contribution of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scattering</b> by neutral hydrogen and singly ionized helium in the atmospheres of hot stars with solar composition and in the atmospheres of helium overabundant stars. We computed several series of model atmospheres using the TLUSTY code and emergent fluxes using the SYNSPEC code.

The ability of WDXRF spectroscopic technique to predict the levels of adulteration of paprika and sweet pepper suspected to be adulterated with Sudan I-IV, Para Red and Sunset Yellow FCF dyes was investigated in this study. Logistic regression and discriminant analysis classification models were developed to predict the type of adulteration using WDXRF spectral features such as the Compton and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> intensities and the Compton and Rayleigh ratios. Prediction of the levels of adulteration was assessed by using multiple regression analysis. 83 % of the 210 adulterated samples were correctly classified by the logistic regression with 90 % sensitivity, 75 %specificity with a prediction power of 92 % into respective adulteration groups. 86 % and 90 % correct prediction were obtained for discriminant analysis models with 94 % sensitivity and 74 % specificity.

40|$|Parallel factor {{analysis}} (PARAFAC) {{is a widespread}} method for modeling fluorescence data {{by means of an}} alternating least squares procedure. Consequently, the PARAFAC estimates are highly influenced by outlying excitation-emission landscapes (EEM) and element-wise outliers, like for example Raman and <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter.</b> Recently, a robust PARAFAC method that circumvents the harmful effects of outlying samples has been developed. For removing the scatter effects on the final PARAFAC model, different techniques exist. Newly, an automated scatter identification tool has been constructed. However, there still exists no robust method for handling fluorescence data encountering both outlying EEM landscapes and scatter. In this paper, we present an iterative algorithm where the robust PARAFAC method and the scatter identification tool are alternately performed. A fully automated robust PARAFAC method is obtained in that way. The method is assessed by means of simulations and a laboratory-made data set.

40|$|Abstract. The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distributions of density structure in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere (40 to 80 km altitude) are observed by <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>scatter</b> lidar at USU. We utilize advanced two dimensional Fourier filter techniques to derive estimates of the temporal and spatial (altitude) power spectral densities for the altitude-binned and time-binned structure, and of the 2 -D spacetime structure of an entire observing period (e. g., 8 hours). Coherent, wavelike spectra are observed in both altitude and time, and appear to be superimposed upon a background of continuous spectral power which may be characteristic of unsaturated turbulence. We observe upwardly propagating gravity waves having (downward) vertical phase velocities in the approximate range 0. 15 to 1 meter/second (0. 5 to 4 km/hr.). Wave structures are often not apparent in the raw density fluctuation data, but are brought out clearly {{by means of a}} 2 -D Parzen filter in Fourier space followed by appropriate reconstruction of the density fluctuations in altitude-time coordinates. ...|$|E
