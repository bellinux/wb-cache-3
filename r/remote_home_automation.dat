40|$|Dependability and {{extensibility}} {{are two of}} the {{key requirements}} to successful home networking. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a software development toolkit for building dependable and extensible home networking applications. A reliable Soft-State Store (SSS) is implemented as a shared infrastructure to simplify robust distributed programming against device and object failures. SSS supports multi-timescale refreshes and selectively uses persistence to accommodate the battery power and network bandwidth constraints in the home networking environment. A publish/subscribe event system allows any changes in the SSS to be propagated to interested subscribers, which then perform appropriate adaptive, corrective, alerting, or cleanup actions. An Attribute-Based Lookup Service (ABLS) and a Name-Based Lookup Service (NBLS), both implemented on top of the SSS for robustness, provide a level of indirection for supporting extensibility as well as allowing userfriendly, natural language-based access. We demonstrate the use of the toolkit for building a home networking system in an actual deployment.

40|$|Background: We {{propose a}} virtual reality (VR) model, {{reproducing}} a house environment, where color modification of target places, obtainable by home automation {{in a real}} ambient, was tested {{by means of a}} P 3 b paradigm. The target place (bathroom door) was designed to be recognized during a virtual wayfinding in a realistic reproduction of a house environment. Different color and luminous conditions, easily obtained in the real ambient from a <b>remote</b> <b>home</b> <b>automation</b> control, were applied to the target and standard places, all the doors being illuminated in white (W), and only target doors colored with a green (G) or red (R) spotlight. Three different Virtual Environments (VE) were depicted, as the bathroom was designed in the aisle (A), living room (L) and bedroom (B). EEG was recorded from 57 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy subjects in the 60 – 80  year age range (O—old group) and 12 normal cases in the 20 – 30  year age range (Y—young group). Results: In Young group, all the target stimuli determined a significant increase in P 3 b amplitude on the parietal, occipital and central electrodes compared to frequent stimuli condition, whatever was the color of the target door, while in elderly group the P 3 b obtained by the green and red colors was significantly different from the frequent stimulus, on the parietal, occipital, and central derivations, while the White stimulus did not evoke a significantly larger P 3 b with respect to frequent stimulus. Discussion: The modulation of P 3 b amplitude, obtained by color and luminance change of target place, suggests that cortical resources, able to compensate the age-related progressive loss of cognitive performance, need to be facilitated even in normal elderly. The event-related responses obtained by virtual reality may be a reliable method to test the environmental feasibility to age-related cognitive changes...|$|E
30|$|The P 3 b {{paradigm}} {{was designed}} {{in order to}} test the best features of a target place to be recognized in a virtual ambient reproducing a real house. We selected the bathroom door as target stimulus, for its presence in all houses and health facilities, where an elderly subject could have difficulty in moving toward this room essential for daily living abilities. In the virtual environment, that simulates a home, all rooms that were different from the bathroom were identified as frequent stimuli (F) while the rare stimulus was assigned to the bathroom room itself. To differentiate the target stimulus from the frequent ones, and to understand the better features for target room doors recognition, bathroom doors were semi-opened, in order to allow the recognition of the typical furniture. In addition, different color and luminous conditions, easily obtained in the real ambient from a <b>remote</b> <b>home</b> <b>automation</b> control, were applied. Bathroom doors were illuminated in white, like the other non-target doors (W), or colored with a green (G) or red spotlight (Fig.  2). Subjects were informed that they would perform a virtual walking through an apartment, looking for the bathroom door, and were requested to press a button as soon as the bathroom door appeared in the field of view. To make the experiment easier, navigation inside the environment was automatically controlled and with a fixed duration; in this way, rare and frequent stimuli were proposed in succession and in a controlled number. In order to examine the best bathroom position for being recognized within the virtual house, three different Virtual Environments (VE) were depicted, as the bathroom was designed in the aisle (A), living room (L) and bedroom (B). Each VE constitutes a single block (Fig.  1), where each block included 30 rare stimuli (10 for each color spotlight) and 120 frequent ones (all other rooms doors). Thanks to the anchors inserted in VE, the system computed random virtual paths that, alternatively, started from the bathroom, end up to another place of the house and vice versa, {{in order to have a}} rare stimulus followed by a certain number of frequent ones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In <b>home</b> <b>automation</b> {{there is}} often a need for control of devices that have a {{built-in}} receiver for infrared communication with a remote controller. When trying to integrate such devices in a single control system, it is possible to substitute the remote controller with another infrared transmitter which automatically controls the device. This paper suggests a solution with an infrared transceiver which is connected to a computer via the USB interface. The receiving part records commands from the remote controller, while the transmitting part takes the role of the remote controller, and provides direct device control from the computer, or indirect control through the computer network. This system provides efficient and simple control of the home devices {{in the absence of the}} user.

40|$|The {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) {{is one of the}} most important technologies of the 21 st century. Most researchers and technical analysts believe that in the near future, these micro-sensors will be integrated into the environment of our daily lives. In recent years, the IoT (Internet of Things) and WoT (Web of Things) technologies also have great forwarding. Especially, the IPv 6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6 LoWPAN) protocol has allowed the use of IPv 6 protocol stack in the field of WSN, thanks to its encapsulation and compression mechanisms in IPv 6 packet header. Moreover, the RPL (IPv 6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Network) provides such a powerful routing function that can be applied for a variety of application scenarios. These two key standards of IoT and WoT technologies for WSN can be used in an IPv 6 stack, and they will successfully achieve the connection between Internet and micro-sensors. Thus, due to the availability of IPv 6 address (128 -bit), all the communicating objects, such as smart device, sensor, and actuator, can be connected to the Internet. That is the greatest advantage brought by the IoT. Although the progress of these techniques is extremely fast, several issues caused by resource constraints of micro-sensor (limited processing power, bandwidth and lossy connection link, and energy), such as QoS, energy efficient, robustness and lifetime of WSN, and the most important, the special requirement of agricultural applications. Notice that Precision Agriculture is are still very challenging and waiting to be solved. Essentially, these open questions would dabble in the aspects like telemedicine, <b>remote</b> <b>home</b> <b>automation,</b> industrial control etc. Thus, the results obtained in this work will have a significant impact on both economic and scientific. Economically, it can offer a solution for WSN to support sustainable development in the field of agriculture automation. While scientifically, we will contribute to the routing protocol standardization of wireless micro-sensors in the domain of environmental monitoring. Les Réseaux de Capteurs Sans Fil (RCSF ou Wireless Sensor Network - WSN) sont l'une des technologies les plus importantes du 21 ème siècle. La plupart des chercheurs et les analystes estiment que, dans un proche avenir, ces micro-capteurs seront intégrés partout dans l’environnement de notre vie quotidienne. Ces dernières années, l'Internet des Objets (Internet of Things - IoT) est également une des technologies émergentes qui se développe rapidement. Deux nouveaux standards permettent de déployer des réseaux sans fil de faible consommation énergétique connectés à internet : le protocole 6 LowPAN (Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) qui permet notamment d’apporter l’adressage IPv 6 aux capteurs grâce à l’encapsulation et la compression des données et le protocole de routage RPL (IPv 6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy network) qui permet à l’information de circuler dans les WSN de proche en proche à un faible coût énergétique. Bien que le développement de ces techniques soit extrêmement rapide, plusieurs problèmes causés principalement par le manque de ressources des micro-capteurs (puissance limitée de traitement, problèmes de bande passante et de connexion des liens avec perte de données, problème de ressource énergétique limitée) demeurent et doivent être résolus, notamment pour les applications agro-environnementales...|$|E
