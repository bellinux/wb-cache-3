25|$|As {{soon as it}} {{was created}} in 1967, the French company ELF, which became Total thereafter, is {{immediately}} above the law and depends on the <b>right</b> <b>line</b> of the Palais de l'Élysée.

25|$|This {{striving for}} {{perfection}} is very {{evident in his}} portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush for just the <b>right</b> <b>line</b> for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with an unrivalled mastery.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the <b>right</b> <b>line</b> from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} play from scrimmage, the Steelers {{got a taste of}} what lay in store as Pats quarterback Drew Bledsoe {{completed}} a 53-yard pass to Terry Glenn that set up Curtis Martin's 2-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh was quickly forced to punt, and New England took just four plays to score again, the last a 34-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Bledsoe to fullback Keith Byars, giving the team a 14-0 lead just over seven minutes into the first quarter. Then on {{the first play}} of the second quarter, Martin burst {{through a hole in the}} <b>right</b> <b>line,</b> dodged a tackle attempt by Carnell Lake, and raced 78 yards for a touchdown, the second longest scoring run in NFL postseason history. Near the end of the half, Steelers defensive back Willie Williams intercepted a pass from Bledsoe to give his team a chance to get back in the game. But Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs on the Pats 24-yard line and the score remained 21-0 going into halftime.|$|E

2500|$|A right-arm off spinner, Ajmal's stock {{delivery}} {{turns into}} right-handed batsman {{but he also}} frequently uses the doosra which turns the other way, and he generally bowls flatter than most off spinners. The doosra has been an effective tool for Ajmal as batsmen have often failed to pick it. Explaining his bowling style in 2012, Ajmal said [...] "If I bowl with flight I cannot bowl well. If I bowl at a quicker speed I can then use variations in pace. If I take 70% of my wickets with the doosra why should I not bowl it? Whether you bowl a doosra or an offbreak, the ball should be bowled on the <b>right</b> <b>line</b> and one should take a wicket with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of [...] "unsporting behaviour" [...] in {{the battle}} for the race lead. The {{accusation}} arose from Coulthard's minor collision with the Ferrari driver. Michael Schumacher believed that Coulthard was driving dangerously: [...] "He [...] ran in a way that he thought it [...] could happen, and he didn't try to avoid that, that's pretty simple. As he is not fighting for the championship.....I {{just want to make sure}} that we don't see teammates helping the drivers fighting for the championship in the way which is not appropriate." [...] Coulthard denied any wrongdoing: [...] "I could have easily pushed him off the circuit. But I didn't and I won't in the future because it is not sporting and it is not the way I do things." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between Trulli and Button after their collision on lap two. Trulli called the Williams driver an [...] "idiot" [...] and accused him of [...] "driving like a crazy". Button defended his actions and suggested that Trulli had moved slightly towards him although he believed he took the <b>right</b> <b>line.</b> He also believed Trulli moved towards him under braking.|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, his highest {{score and}} both his {{best and worst}} bowling {{performances}} against West Indies occurred in the same match at Lord's in 1984. Clive Lloyd won the toss and, perhaps mistakenly, elected to field. The first day was rain-affected and England, 167 for two overnight, scored 286 thanks to a century by Graeme Fowler; Botham scored a useful 30. West Indies lost three quick wickets, {{all of them to}} Botham who was a [...] "reminder of his old self" [...] in the words of Wisden, but recovered to reach 119 for three at the close of play on day two. In the third morning, Viv Richards was dismissed by Botham under dubious circumstances but Botham was inspired by the capture of his great friend's wicket and went on to take eight for 103, dismissing West Indies for 245 and for once giving England a chance of victory against the world's best team, with a first innings lead of 41. This was Botham's best-ever bowling performance against West Indies by some distance. England began their second innings and had been reduced to 88 for four when Botham joined Allan Lamb. They reached 114 for four at day three close. There was no Sunday play and England resumed on the Monday 155 runs ahead with six wickets standing. Botham and Lamb added 128 for the fifth wicket before Botham was out for 81, including nine fours and one six, easily his highest score and best innings against West Indies. Lamb made a century and England were all out on the Tuesday morning (final day) for exactly 300. West Indies needed 342 to win in five and a half hours. They lost Desmond Haynes to a run out at 57 for 0, whereupon Larry Gomes (92 not out) joined Gordon Greenidge (214 not out) and West Indies went on to win by nine wickets with 11.5 of the last twenty overs to spare. Although Wisden does not name Botham except as an [...] "inattentive" [...] fielder who dropped a catch, it describes the England bowlers [...] "looking second-rate and nobody but Willis bowling the <b>right</b> <b>line</b> or setting the right field to the powerful and phlegmatic Greenidge". Botham bowled the most overs, 20, and with nought for 117 he conceded almost a run a ball (Willis had nought for 48 from 15 overs). In mitigation, Wisden conceded that Greenidge played [...] "the innings of his life, and his ruthless batting probably made the bowling look worse that it was".|$|E

And as often the sweetest music is so low and {{continuous}} as to approach a monotone; and as often the sweetest gradations so delicate and subdued as to approach to flatness, so the finest curves are apt to hover about the <b>right</b> <b>line,</b> nearly coinciding with {{it for a long}} space of their curve; never absolutely losing their own curvilinear character, but apparently every moment on the point of merging into the <b>right</b> <b>line.</b> When this is the case, the line generally returns into vigorous curvature at some part of its course, otherwise it is apt to be weak, or slightly rigid; multitudes of other curves, not approaching the <b>right</b> <b>line</b> so nearly, remain less vigorously bent in the rest of their course; so that the quantity[88] of curvature is the same in both, though differently distributed.|$|E
