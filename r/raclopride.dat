25|$|Ketamine {{has been}} found to act as a potent partial agonist of the high-affinity state of the human and rat {{dopamine}} D2 receptors in multiple studies. Its apparent potency for this action {{is similar to that of}} its NMDA receptor antagonism. However, there are also contradictory data, with studies finding an affinity of ketamine of >10,000nbsp&nM for the regular human and rat D2 receptors, and direct interactions with the D2 receptor are controversial. Moreover, whereas D2 receptor agonists like bromocriptine are able to rapidly and powerfully suppress prolactin secretion, subanesthetic doses of ketamine have not been found to do this in humans and in fact have been found to significantly and dose-dependently increase prolactin levels. Imaging studies have shown mixed results on inhibition of striatal <b>raclopride</b> binding by ketamine in humans, with some studies finding a significant decrease and others finding no such effect. However, changes in <b>raclopride</b> binding may be due to changes in dopamine concentrations induced by ketamine rather than binding of ketamine to the D2 receptor.|$|E

The experiments suggested a relation to dopamine D1 receptors, and also to opioid receptors in the reinforcement produced by fencamfamin, as place preference was blocked by the selective dopamine D1 antagonist SCH 23390 and by the opioid antagonist naloxone. A similar place preference, which was blocked by naloxone and by SCH 23390 and by <b>raclopride,</b> has been seen in a study on rats with drinking water. Animals treated with naloxone before the conditioning sessions showed a place aversion instead of the place preference found in saline-treated animals. Naloxone also reduced drinking. It was proposed that naloxone induced a state of frustrative nonreward. It was suggested that both dopamine and (endogenous) opioids are important for water-induced reinforcement.

5000|$|Giving a {{more precise}} {{explanation}} of this discrepancy in D2 receptor has been attempted by a significant minority. Radioligand imaging measurements involve the monomer and dimer ratio, and the 'cooperativity' model. Cooperativitiy is a chemical function {{in the study of}} enzymes. Dopamine receptors interact with their own kind, or other receptors to form higher order receptors such as dimers, via the mechanism of cooperativity. Philip Seeman has said: [...] "In schizophrenia, therefore, the density of 11C methylspiperone sites rises, reflecting an increase in monomers, while the density of 11C <b>raclopride</b> sites remains the same, indicating that the total population of D2 monomers and dimers does not change." [...] (In another place Seeman has said methylspiperone possibly binds with dimers) With this difference in measurement technique in mind, the above-mentioned meta-analysis uses results from 10 different ligands. [...] Exaggerated ligand binding results such as SDZ GLC 756 (as used in the figure) were explained by reference to this monomer-dimer equilibrium.|$|E

The administration of repeated doses of <b>raclopride</b> showed linear pharmacokinetics based on parameter values which are either constant (effective elimination half-life, total plasma clearance, and dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve) or varying proportionally (trough plasma concentration, peak plasma concentration, average plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a dosage interval at steady state) with the doses.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Raclopride</b> is a {{selective}} antagonist of the dopamine D 2 receptor. It {{is one of}} the most frequently used in vivo D 2 tracers (at low doses) for assessing drug-induced receptor occupancy (RO) in animals and humans. It is also commonly used as a pharmacological blocker (at high doses) to occupy the available D 2 receptors and antagonize the action of dopamine or drugs on D 2 in preclinical studies. The aims of this study were to comprehensively evaluate its pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in different brain compartments and to establish a PK-RO model that could predict the brain distribution and RO of <b>raclopride</b> in the freely moving rat using a LC-MS based approach. METHODS: Rats (n= 24) received a 10 -min IV infusion of non-radiolabeled <b>raclopride</b> (1. 61 μmol/kg, i. e. 0. 56 mg/kg). Plasma and the brain tissues of striatum (with high density of D 2 receptors) and cerebellum (with negligible amount of D 2 receptors) were collected. Additional microdialysis experiments were performed in some rats (n= 7) to measure the free drug concentration in the extracellular fluid of the striatum and cerebellum. <b>Raclopride</b> concentrations in all samples were analyzed by LC-MS. A population PK-RO model was constructed in NONMEM to describe the concentration-time profiles in the unbound plasma, brain extracellular fluid and brain tissue compartments and to estimate the RO based on raclopride-D 2 receptor binding kinetics. RESULTS: In plasma <b>raclopride</b> showed a rapid distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase. The striatum tissue concentrations were consistently higher than that of cerebellum tissue throughout the whole experimental period (10 -h) due to higher non-specific tissue binding and D 2 receptor binding in the striatum. Model-based simulations accurately predicted the literature data on rat plasma PK, brain tissue PK and D 2 RO at different time points after intravenous or subcutaneous administration of <b>raclopride</b> at tracer dose (RO 30 %). CONCLUSION: For the first time a predictive model that could describe the quantitative in vivo relationship between dose, PK and D 2 RO of <b>raclopride</b> in non-anesthetized rat was established. The PK-RO model could facilitate the selection of optimal dose and dosing time when <b>raclopride</b> is used as tracer or as pharmacological blocker in various rat studies.

40|$|Purpose: Modafinil is a vigilance-enhancing drug {{licensed}} for narcolepsy. The use of modafinil {{leads to}} various neuromodulatory effects with very low abuse potential.

This {{study was designed to}} evaluate whether modafinil could improve motor dysfunction in the 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -induced rat model of Parkinson’s disease. Methods: Male Wistar rats (180 - 220 g, n= 98) were used in this study. Parkinsonism was induced by injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine (10 μg/ 2 μl in 0. 2 % ascorbic acid-saline) into the right striatum. Parkinsonian rats received intraperitoneal (ip) injections of modafinil (50, 75, and 100 mg/kg) and catalepsy-like immobility was assessed by the bar test (BT). Furthermore, involvement of dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors in modafinil’s anti-parkinsonian effects was studied.

40|$|Various {{hypothesis}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the properties of atypical as compared to classical antipsychotics (APDs) : blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors, high dissociation rate of drug - D 2 receptor complex, mesolimbic selectivity, etc. We hypothesized that the atypical properties of different classes of APDs {{are the result of}} different mechanisms not only pharmacodynamic but also pharmacokinetic in nature. In order to test this hypothesis, we first studied by in vivo microdialysis the effects of various APDs on the extracellular dopamine (DA) in different areas of the rat brain: the prefrontal cortex (PFCX), the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and the NAc core. We administered different doses of haloperidol, clozapine, <b>raclopride,</b> chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine amisulpride and levosulpiride. All the typical and atypical APDs tested significantly and dose dependently increased extracellular DA output in dialysates from the NAc shell, but after atypical APDs the increase was preferential or depending on the drug selective in the NAc shell as compared to the NAc core. All atypical APDs, except the benzamides <b>raclopride,</b> amisulpride and levosulpiride, increase DA output in dialysates from the PFCX. The benzamides also showed major differences in the time-course of the effects: while <b>raclopride</b> produced a sharp but short lasting increase of DA, levosulpiride and amisulpride elicited long lasting increase, producing the latter a slower effect. These observations suggest that different mechanisms might underlie the atypical properties of ADPs. Among drugs with rapid penetration into the brain compartments, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine and <b>raclopride,</b> atypical properties, {{as in the case of}} clozapine and quetiapine, critically depend from rapid D 2 receptor dissociation. Conversely, among drugs with slow D 2 receptor dissociation, as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine, <b>raclopride,</b> amisulpride and levosulpiride, atypical properties depend from slow penetration of the blood brain barrier. Within this frame, blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors may be important for atypical aspect unrelated to extrapiramidal side effects and to clinical positive symptoms. Moreover, in order to evaluate the effects on motor behavior, we tested the antipsychotics in an animal model for motor coordination disturbances. Thus, we administered drugs to rats trained on a rotarod (8, 12, 16 rpm) and evaluated the latency to fall. No differences in vehicle, clozapine or amisulpride treated rats were observed whereas haloperidol and <b>raclopride</b> elicited significant deficits after all rpm and doses tested. ...|$|E

The specific dopamine D- 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and the specific dopamine D- 2 /D- 3 receptor antagonist <b>raclopride</b> reduced or even abolished the behavioural stimulation induced by lower doses of BW 373 U 86 and SNC 80. When higher doses of BW 373 U 86 were used (2. 5 mg/kg), however, <b>raclopride,</b> even at high cataleptic doses (6. 0 mg/kg), only partly prevented the behavioural stimulation induced by the delta-opioid receptor agonist. The behavioural stimulation remaining after high doses of <b>raclopride</b> was abolished by the administration of SCH 23390. These results show that delta-opioid receptor stimulation elicits dopamine-dependent behavioural activation in the rat that depends on dopamine receptors, particularly of the D- 1 subtype...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: The {{combination}} of idazoxan, a specific alpha(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist with <b>raclopride,</b> a selective D- 2 /D- 3 receptor antagonist, has been recently proposed {{to produce an}} atypical antipsychotic profile {{comparable to that of}} clozapine, based on an animal study which analysed dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex and the preclinical test of conditioned avoidance response (CAR) for evaluation of antipsychotic potential. Accordingly, the {{combination of}} a typical antipsychotic with idazoxan has been proposed as an augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although its therapeutic potential remains difficult to predict. Objectives: Given the momentum stimulated by these reports, the present study investigated whether the combination of idazoxan with <b>raclopride</b> is indeed sufficient to mimic the ability of clozapine to reverse prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in rats, a behavioral paradigm that models PPI deficits observed in the schizophrenia spectrum, and currently the only test which reliably appears to distinguish between typical antipsychotics and compounds with atypical antipsychotic potential. Methods: The effects of the combination idazoxan/raclopride were examined in two PPI paradigms: 1) phencyclidine (PCP) -induced disruption of PPI, which {{has been shown to be}} preferentially reversed by atypical antipsychotics; 2) apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI which can be reversed by either typical high-potency D- 2 dopamine antagonists or atypical antipsychotics. Results: In contrast to clozapine, combining idazoxan with <b>raclopride</b> failed to reverse PCP-induced deficits in PPI In addition, there was no evidence of an enhancing effect of idazoxan on the blockade of apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI by <b>raclopride.</b> Conclusion: The present results challenge the hypothesis that simple alpha(2) /D- 2 blockade is sufficient to produce clozapine-like atypical antipsychotic activities, and support the consensus that the PPI paradigm represents the most sophisticated behavioral preclinical test for detecting selective atypical profile of antipsychotics...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with advanced Parkinson disease (PD) who are undergoing long-term treatment with a dopaminergic medication, a down-regulation of striatal dopamine D 2 receptor expression {{has been demonstrated}} and interpreted {{as a consequence of}} either the disease itself or dopaminergic drug administration. OBJECTIVE: To compare, using positron emission tomography, the striatal binding of <b>raclopride</b> carbon C 11, a dopamine D 2 receptor ligand, in PD patients who completely discontinued dopaminergic therapy (off drug) with that in PD patients who continued receiving dopaminergic therapy (on drug) after undergoing subthalamic nucleus stimulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The positron emission tomographic data were acquired in off-stimulation and, for 12 hours, off-medication conditions. Five off-drug PD patients, 7 on-drug PD patients, and 8 healthy subjects participated. RESULTS: In off-drug PD patients, the putaminal <b>raclopride</b> C 11 binding was 24 % higher than in on-drug PD patients. The same tendency was noted for the caudate nucleus, but was not significant (P=. 07). Compared with control subjects, the putaminal <b>raclopride</b> C 11 binding was increased by 21 % in off-drug and was normal in on-drug PD patients. Compared with controls, the caudate <b>raclopride</b> C 11 binding was reduced by 23 % in on-drug and was normal in off-drug PD patients. Further analysis using statistical parametric mapping showed a significant increase of binding bilaterally in the caudate nucleus and putamen in off-drug compared with on-drug PD patients (P=. 002 at cluster level). CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of dopamine D 2 receptors probably relates to the long-term and intermittent administration of dopaminergic treatments rather than to disease progression. This phenomenon is reversed by the complete withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs. Furthermore, an up-regulation of putaminal dopamine D 2 receptors is demonstrated in late-stage PD after dopaminergic drug withdrawal...|$|E
40|$|The neural {{mechanisms}} mediating one-trial and multi-trial behavioral sensitization {{during early}} ontogeny are poorly understood. The {{purpose of this}} thesis {{was to assess the}} importance of D 2 -like receptors for the induction of cocaine- and methamphetamine-induced one-trial and multi-trial behavioral sensitization during the middle and late preweanling period. In a series of four experiments, rats were injected with saline or the selective dopamine D 2 -like receptor antagonist <b>raclopride</b> 15 min prior to treatment with the indirect dopamine agonists cocaine or methamphetamine. Acute control groups received two injections of saline. The pretreatment regimens occurred on either PND 16 or PND 20 (one-trial behavioral sensitization) or PND 13 - 16 or PND 17 - 20 (multi-trial behavioral sensitization). On PND 17 or PND 21, rats were challenged with either cocaine or methamphetamine and sensitized responding was assessed. With only a single exception, both one -trial and multi-trial cocaine- and methamphetamine-induced sensitization was evident on PND 17 and PND 21. Importantly, the D 2 -like receptor antagonist <b>raclopride</b> did not prevent the induction of cocaine- or methamphetamine-induced one-trial behavioral sensitization. In regards to multi-trial behavioral sensitization, <b>raclopride</b> failed to inhibit cocaine -induced sensitized responding on PND 17 and PND 21. Interestingly, higher doses of <b>raclopride</b> (0. 5 and 1 mg/kg) were able to prevent the induction of multi-trial methamphetamine-induced sensitization on PND 17. Therefore, D 2 -like receptor antagonism differentially affected methamphetamine -induced behavioral sensitization depending on whether a one-trial or multi-trial paradigm was employed. When considered together, these results suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying the methamphetamine -induced behavioral sensitization of preweanling rats differs {{depending on the type of}} experimental paradigm (one- vs multi-trial) being used. Other potential explanations (i. e., nonspecific antagonist effects, impact of contextual conditioning, etc.) for this interesting effect are presented in the Discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to assess the role of excitatory amino acid and dopamine receptors on associative functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the rat. Spatial delayed alternation {{was used as a}} PFC-sensitive cognitive task. In addition, in vivo microdialysis was used to assess the release of dopamine in the PFC. The noncompetitive NMDA antagonists ketamine (lo- 30 mg/kg) and MK- 801 (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg) dose-dependently impaired the spatial delayed alternation performance compared with the saline-treated control group. Administration of the dopamine antagonists <b>raclopride</b> (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/kg), SCH- 23390 (0. 1 mg/kg), or haloperidol(O. 1 mg/kg) was without a significant effect. However, haloperidol and <b>raclopride</b> (but not SCH- 23390) re-versed the disruptive effect of 30 mglkg ketamine on spatial delayed alternation performance. Microdialysis studies reveale...|$|E

30|$|Homologues with {{a shorter}} fluoroalkyl chain {{consistently}} showed greater D 2 / 3 R-specific-to-total binding ratios in the striatum {{than those with}} longer chains. The fluoroethoxy homologue of AMC 13 ([18 F]FEt-AMC 13) demonstrated the highest degree of D 2 / 3 R-specific binding among the evaluated tracers: mean striatum-to-cerebellum uptake ratio reached 4.4 in vitro and 2.1 / 2.8 in vivo/ex vivo (PET/autoradiography). Striatal binding potential (BPND) relative to cerebellum was 0.51 – 0.63 depending on the estimation method. Radiometabolites of [18 F]FEt-AMC 13 did not enter the brain. In vitro, application of 10  μmol/L <b>raclopride</b> reduced D 2 / 3 R-specific binding of [18 F]FEt-AMC 13 in the striatum by 81  %. In vivo, pre-treatment with 1  mg/kg (2.9  μmol/kg) <b>raclopride</b> led to 17 – 39  % decrease in D 2 / 3 R-specific binding in the striatum.|$|E
40|$|Dopamine {{is known}} to {{regulate}} several behavioral phenomena, including sensorimotor gating and aspects of motor activity. The roles of dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors in these behaviors have been documented in the rat literature, but few reports exist on their role in mice. We used dopamine transporter (DAT) (2 / 2) mice to examine the behavioral consequences of a chronically hyperdopaminergic state, challenging them with the preferential dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist <b>raclopride</b> and D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390. At baseline, DAT (2 / 2) mice exhibited deficient sensorimotor gating as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, exhibited non-focal perseverative patterns of locomotion, and were hyperac-tive in a novel environment. Pretreatment with <b>raclopride</b> sig-nificantly increased PPI in the DAT (2 / 2) mice, whereas SCH 23390 had no significant effect. Blockade of D 2 receptor...|$|E
