Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, condemned the action as an assault on freedom of speech. A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry threatened <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> against American journalists.|$|E
25|$|During Laurel's {{tenure as}} President, hunger {{was the main}} worry. Prices of {{essential}} commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring consumers' goods under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of it all. On the other hand, guerrilla activities and Japanese <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.|$|E
25|$|The PRC is {{a member}} of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and a {{signatory}} to all United Nations treaties and conventions on space, with the exception of the unpopular 1979 Moon Treaty. The United States government has long been resistant to the use of PRC launch services by American industry due to concerns over alleged civilian technology transfer that could have dual-use military applications to countries such as North Korea, Iran or Syria, and announced an official embargo against the PRC in 2000. Thus, financial <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> have been taken on many occasions against several Chinese space companies.|$|E

50|$|This changes when Dixon's wife {{is killed}} in a car bomb {{explosion}} as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> by Arvin Sloane for Dixon's accidental shooting of Sloane's wife, Emily, on what would have been his last CIA field mission. Initially suicidal over the loss, Dixon eventually channels his grief into his field work. Dixon's two children, Robin and Steven, were once kidnapped by The Covenant in an attempt to forcefully extract an artifact created by eccentric 15th century inventor, Milo Rambaldi.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{also carried}} {{chemical}} weapons as they swept through Southeast Asia towards Australia. Some {{of these items}} were captured and analyzed by the Allies. Historian Geoff Plunkett has recorded how Australia covertly imported 1,000,000 chemical weapons from the United Kingdom from 1942 onwards and stored them in many storage depots around the country, including three tunnels in the Blue Mountains {{to the west of}} Sydney. They were {{to be used as a}} <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> if the Japanese first used chemical weapons. Buried chemical weapons have been recovered at Marrangaroo and Columboola.|$|R
25|$|On December 30, 2016, {{commenting on}} his {{eventual}} decision {{to refrain from}} <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> to actions by the U.S. on December 29, Putin released a published statement that his government, while reserving its legitimate right to respond adequately, would not take action at that time; he also invited all {{the children of the}} U.S. diplomats accredited in Russia to New Year's and Christmas celebrations at the Kremlin. The statement {{went on to say that}} further steps for restoring Russian-American relations would be built on the basis of the policies developed by the Trump administration. In May 2017, Russian banker Andrey Kostin, an associate of President Vladimir Putin, said the Washington elite was purposefully disrupting the presidency of Donald Trump.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{thanks to}} the {{importance}} of the French market to the Dutch, {{and the fact that the}} Dutch had less possibilities of imposing counter-pressure than they had in their conflicts with the English, the Dutch government at first tried to ignore the hostile policies of Colbert. Its inaction was also caused by differences of opinion about how best to proceed within the States Party. Amsterdam, and especially the Amsterdam diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen, argued in favor of firm economic counter-measures against the French economic policies, paired with the forming of a defensive alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. De Witt, however, preferred avoiding such foreign entanglements, and a conciliatory approach in the economic sphere. As their economic interests were severely damaged by the French protectionism, the industrial cities of Leiden and Haarlem, however, teamed up with Amsterdam to support a more belligerent diplomacy. After the Rotterdam regents were promised compensation for the damage to their wine trade, to get their assent, the States of Holland decided in 1671 on severe <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> against French imports, in effect banning French wine, vinegar, paper, and sail-canvas. The stage was now set for war.|$|E
500|$|The Turkish {{military}} immediately threatened <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures,</b> including closing Turkish airspace to US military flights, {{stopping the}} use of the southern Incirlik Air Base and sending more troops into northern Iraq. [...] A delegation of Turkish military and diplomatic officials immediately left for Sulaymaniyah on Saturday to discuss the matter with the Americans, but according to the Turks most of the American commanders were off celebrating Independence Day. [...] Following direct protests by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to US Vice President Dick Cheney, as well as by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül to US Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Turkish soldiers were released after sixty hours in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Most {{countries}} {{included in}} the Priority Watch List and Watch List between 1996 and 2000 were requested by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or International Intellectual Property Alliance. For example, Finland was blacklisted in retaliation to unanimously adopted legislation requiring the tax-funded Social Insurance Institution to reimburse the cost of medications only up {{to the price of}} the cheapest generic. Intellectual property is not violated, as this affects all manufacturers equally; nevertheless, this <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> has had a negative impact on investment decisions unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R
50|$|Washington's Continental Army {{had been}} encamped {{primarily}} at Morristown, New Jersey, {{although there was}} a forward base at Bound Brook, only {{a few miles from the}} nearest British outposts. In part as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> against the ongoing skirmishes, General Charles Cornwallis executed a raid against that position in April 1777, in which he very nearly captured the outpost's commander, Benjamin Lincoln. In response to this raid, Washington moved his army forward to a strongly fortified position at Middlebrook in the Watchung Mountains that commanded likely British land routes toward Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|Hamas has defended {{suicide attacks}} as a {{legitimate}} aspect of its asymmetric warfare against Israel. In 2003, according to Stephen Atkins, Hamas resumed suicide bombings in Israel as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> after the failure of peace talks and an Israeli campaign targeting members of the upper echelon of the Hamas leadership., but they are considered as crimes against humanity under international law. In a 2002 report, Human Rights Watch stated that Hamas leaders [...] "should be held accountable" [...] for [...] "war crimes and crimes against humanity" [...] committed by the al-Qassam Brigades.|$|R
2500|$|Another early {{landmark}} {{case was}} Commission v Luxembourg & Belgium (1964), the [...] "Dairy Products" [...] case. In that decision the Court comprehensively ruled out any {{use by the}} Member States of the <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> commonly permitted by general international law within the European Economic Community. That decision is often {{thought to be the}} best example of the European legal order's divergence with ordinary international law. Commission v Luxembourg & Belgium also has a logical connection with the nearly contemporaneous Van Gend en Loos and Costa v ENEL decisions, as arguably it is the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy that allow the European legal system to forego any use of retaliatory enforcement mechanisms by the Member States.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2016, {{during the}} first presidential debate, Trump said he doubted whether anyone knew who hacked the DNC, and disputed Russian interference. During the second debate, Trump said there {{might not have been}} hacking at all, and {{questioned}} why accountability was placed on Russia. During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump. After the election, Trump rejected the CIA analysis and asserted that the reports were politically motivated to deflect from the Democrats' electoral defeat. Trump's transition team said in a brief statement: [...] "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction." [...] However, the intelligence analysts involved in monitoring Russian activities are different from those who assessed that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, while post–Iraq War reforms have made it less likely for similar errors to reach {{the highest levels of the}} U.S. intelligence community. Trump dismissed reports of Russia's interference, calling them [...] "ridiculous"; he placed blame on Democrats upset over election results for publicizing these reports, and cited Julian Assange's statement that [...] "a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta." [...] After Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and announced further sanctions on Russia, Trump commended Putin for refraining from <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> against the United States until the Trump administration would lay out its policy towards Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1255 and 1256 {{the people}} of lower Gwynedd were chafing under the heavy tax burden imposed by Geoffrey of Langley, a royal {{favorite}} and lieutenant in the region who sought to extend the English shire system there. Prince Edward made a tour of his holdings of Chester as its earl, and then progressed into the Perfeddwlad to inspect his castles of Diserth and Deganwy. After Edward's departure, {{when it became clear}} to the Welsh of the region that the English prince was not inclined to intervene on their behalf over Langley’s ‘tyrannous exactions,’ they rose in revolt and appealed to Llywelyn II for aid. Furthermore, Prince Edward appointed Patrick Chaworth as Steward of Carmarthen, an appointment that [...] "could hardly be tolerated by Llywelyn who was already bitter and resentful" [...] over the conditions in lower Gwynedd, whose people appealed for his deliverance. Having reconciled with Dafydd, Llywelyn II released his brother who he thought would be a valuable lieutenant, then gathered an army and crossed the river Conwy. Within one week Llywelyn II swept eastwards almost as far as Chester itself, stretching Gwynedd’s princely domain [...] "to its old bounds," [...] wrote Lloyd. Only the castles at Deganwy and Diserth were left as islets under siege in what was now [...] "purely Welsh country" [...] again. Prince Edward and his lieutenant Geoffrey of Langley, who had been in England during the week of Llywelyn’s campaign, were powerless to respond as they, and the English crown, lacked any treasury for <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> against the Welsh prince. And the English crown was abandoned of yet another ally against Llywelyn, the Marcher lords, who [...] "sympathized with the insurgents as victims of a common tyranny, and the very barons of the March, hereditary foes of the Welsh, viewed their rebellion with toleration, if not actual friendliness," [...] wrote Lloyd. The Marcher lords were suspicious of growing royal authority over the March since the Peace of Woodstock. The inability of the crown to launch any response and the ambivilance so far expressed by other Marcher lords emboldened Llywelyn towards further campaigns. First, he recovered Meirionydd, recovered for Gwynedd the royal holdings of Lanbadarn and Builth, then took Gwerthrynion from his cousin Roger II Mortimer. In South and West Wales, Llywelyn ejected Rhys Fychan from the Ystrad Tywi region and restored Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg to both Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychan. Llywelyn held his 1256 Christmas court at Aber, one which was [...] "certainly not wanting in elements of festivity," [...] wrote Lloyd. In January 1257 Llywelyn harassed Powys Fadog, already ravaged from the prior year's campaigns, and then conquered Powys Wynwynwyn as far as Pool, driving out Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Pushing into Glamorgan, Llywelyn campaigned between the rivers Towy and Tawe where he enlisted the Welsh of the Gower, Kidwelly, and Carnwyllion to his side, thereby undermining the Marcher authority of the barons Patrick Chaworth and William de Braose. A hapless King Henry III sought the aid of his brother Richard, who had just been elected as Holy Roman Emperor, but though Llywelyn II and the emperor exchanged courteous and amicable correspondence, Llywelyn II refused to yield any of his conquests, but agreed to a long truce, one which allow Llywelyn to consolidate his gains. Before Easter 1257, Llywelyn was home in Gwynedd.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 February 1957, a {{thirteen}} country–sponsored resolution (Bolivia, Burma, Ceylon, Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Yugoslavia) {{calling for}} the United Nations to appoint a [...] "good offices commission" [...] for West New Guinea was submitted to the UN General Assembly. Despite receiving a plural majority (40-25-13), this second resolution failed to gain a two-thirds majority. Undeterred, the Afro-Asian caucus in the United Nations lobbied for the West New Guinea dispute to be included on the UNGA's agenda. On 4 October 1957, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio warned that Indonesia would embark on [...] "another cause" [...] if the United Nations failed {{to bring about a}} solution to the dispute that favoured Indonesia. That month, the Indonesian Communist Party and affiliated trade unions lobbied for <b>retaliatory</b> economic <b>measures</b> against the Dutch. On 26 November 1957, a third Indonesian resolution on the West New Guinea dispute was put to the vote but failed to gain a two-thirds majority (41-29-11). In response, Indonesia took <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> against Dutch interests in Indonesia.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the Cambodian decision, troops from both nations had clashed over {{territory}} claimed by both countries immediately adjacent to Cambodia's Preah Vihear temple, leading to a deterioration in relations. [...] At 8:30 pm local time on 5 November Cambodia announced that it was withdrawing their ambassador from Thailand as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure.</b> Sok An, a member of the Council of Ministers and Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, said that the appointment of Thaksin is a decision internal to Cambodia and that it [...] "conforms to international practice". [...] The mutual withdrawal of ambassadors is the most severe diplomatic action to have occurred between the two countries.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the PAP {{decided to}} {{challenge}} {{the policies of the}} Central Government directly, both as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> and to further its ideological grounds. It ran in the April 1964 Malaysian federal elections in coalition with other parties under the Malaysian Solidarity Council. The PAP was now a legitimate opposition party in the federal elections, and campaigned on a platform of eliminating racialism and a Malaysian Malaysia. Their rallies attracted large crowds. They decided to contest a minority of the seats however, to avoid any perception that they were trying to undermine the ruling party or being seen as agents of instability. The PAP only won one seat and 2.05% of the vote.|$|R

When they think they have located the seat of government, they throw bombs. This inconveniences him, but so far they have not come within ten miles of him. The Asiatic air-fleet is at present scattered all over the Eastern States, seeking out and destroying gas-works and whatever seems conducive to the building of airships or the transport of troops.

6000|$|In the Estates (July 1704), {{after months}} passed in {{constitutional}} chicanery, the last year's Act of Security was passed and touched with the sceptre; and the House voted Supply for six months. But owing to a fierce dispute on private business--namely, {{the raising of}} the question, [...] "Who were the persons accused in England of being engaged in the 'Scottish Plot'?"--no hint of listening to proposals for Union was uttered. Who could propose, as Commissioners to arrange Union, men who were involved--or in England {{had been accused of}} being involved--in the plot? Scotland had not yet consented that whoever succeeded Anne in England should also succeed in Scotland. They retained a means of putting pressure on England, the threat of having a separate king; they had made and were making military preparations (drill once a-month!), and England took up the gauntlet. The menacing attitude of Scotland was debated on with much heat in the English Upper House (November 29), and a Bill passed by the Commons declared the <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measures</b> which England was ready to adopt.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the former}} Article 19 of the 1955 Citizenship Law (No. 3370), a person of non-Greek ethnic origin leaving Greece without the {{intention}} of returning may be declared as having lost Greek nationality. According to the Greek government, between 1955 and 1998, approximately 60,000 Greek Muslim individuals, predominantly Turkish, were deprived of their citizenship under Article 19. Of these 60,000, approximately 7,182 lost their citizenship between 1981 and 1997. The application of this law to the Turks of Western Thrace was a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> {{in response to the}} devastating state-sponsored pogrom which targeted the Greeks of Istanbul in September 1955. The pogrom precipitated an exodus of ethnic Greeks from Turkey. Article 19 was repealed in 1998, though not retroactively.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{through their}} privateering activities, which {{apparently}} did not spare neutral powers, the Hollanders had come into conflict with the rich and very influential trade city of Hamburg, which confiscated a fleet of 52 Hollandic ships as a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> {{in the autumn of}} 1399. Holland regarded this as a declaration of war, and the situation on the seas this resulted in, brought trade along the North Sea coast virtually to a standstill. In the spring of 1401 Hamburg fitted out a large fleet, apparently to take the war to the coasts of Holland. That it did not come to that was due to mediation by the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Thorn, and Stralsund, who negotiated a truce, which eventually led to a peace that went into effect in 1403, after arbitration by the Flemish city of Ghent.|$|R
25|$|On November 6, 2017, Stephenson {{met with}} Makan Delrahim, {{assistant}} Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, to discuss antitrust and concentration of media ownership concerns surrounding the acquisition, and possible options for satisfying them.

The Financial Times went further, stating that it had specifically demanded the divestment of CNN. Stephenson denied these reports, stating that he never offered to, nor had any intentions to sell CNN. CNN's media analyst Brian Stelter noted that media outlets were interpreting the alleged recommendations as being either a genuine concern for AT's scale following the merger, or a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> by the Trump administration against CNN.|$|R

2500|$|During {{all parts}} of the war, use of {{chemical}} and biological weapons were extremely limited, by both sides, [...] Italy used mustard gas and phosgene during the short Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Germany employed chemical agents such as Zyklon B against Jews, political prisoners and other victims in extermination camps during the Holocaust, and Japan employed chemical and biological weapons in China. In 1943 a U.S. ship carrying [...] a secret Chemical Warfare Service cargo of mustard gas as a precationary <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> was sunk in an air raid in Italy, causing 83 deaths and about 600 hospitalized military victims plus a larger number of civilian casualties. Generally speaking, World War II was conducted (1939–1945) without use of chemical or biological weapons on the conventional battlefield, and certainly not on the scale of the use of poison gas during World War I.|$|R

On 1 October and 2 October 1944, 661 men and boys, the {{majority}} of the male population, were deported from the town and 602 of them were sent to work in concentration camps such as Neuengamme and Birkenau. Five hundred and forty of them died in concentration camps and only 49 survived to return after the war. Following the war, two of the responsible German officers were tried and convicted for this action. The raids were a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>measure</b> for an attack by the local resistance, that killed one Wehrmacht officer near Nijkerk. The first and second of October are commemorated every year.

The country formally became a vassal to the Ottoman Empire in 1538; it almost completely preserved its self-rule but needed to pay an ever-increasing annual tribute. During this failed military campaign, Bălţi, due to its crossroads location, served as a major headquarters of the Russian army and parts of the Moldavian armies.
