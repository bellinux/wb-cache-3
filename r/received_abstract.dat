This association is shown to yield a bijection between (the isomorphism classes, on both sides, of) such objects. Keywords. Throughout this paper, the symbol k will always denote an algebraically closed field and H = (H,μ, η,,, S) will always denote a semisimple and cosemisimple (necessarily finite-dimensional) Hopf algebra over k. We associate to H, a planar algebra over the field k which is an analogue of the construction in [KdyLndSnd] of the ‘subfactor plana...|$|E

First, we derive the asymptotic biases of the sample autocorrelations of squared observations generated by stationary processes and show that the properties of some conditional homoscedasticity tests can be distorted. Second, we obtain the asymptotic and finite sample biases of the oridnary least square (OLS) estimator of ARCH(p) models. The finite sample results are extended to generalized least square (GLS), maximum likelihood (ML) and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimators of ARCH(p) and GARCH(1, 1) models. Finally, we show that the estimated asymptotic standard deviations are biased estimates of the sample standard deviations...|$|E

A class of prima facie ergative-absolutive languages is identified wherein intransitive subjects <b>receive</b> <b>abstract</b> nominative Case and transitive objects <b>receive</b> <b>abstract</b> accusative Case; these are realized through a morphological default, which is often mislabeled as absolutive.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether communication via mediated hand pressure during a remotely shared experience (watching an amusing video) can (1) enhance recovery from sadness, (2) enhance the affective {{quality of the}} experience, and (3) increase trust towards the communication partner. Thereto participants first watched a sad movie clip to elicit sadness, followed by a funny one to stimulate recovery from sadness. While watching the funny clip they signaled a hypothetical fellow participant every time they felt amused. In the experimental condition the participants responded by pressing a hand-held two-way mediated touch device (a Frebble), which also provided haptic feedback via simulated hand squeezes. In the control condition they responded by pressing a button and they <b>received</b> <b>abstract</b> visual feedback. Objective (heart rate, galvanic skin conductance, number and duration of joystick or Frebble presses) and subjective (questionnaires) data were collected to assess the emotional reactions of the participants. The subjective measurements confirmed that the sad movie successfully induced sadness while the funny movie indeed evoked more positive feelings. Although their ranking agreed with the subjective measurements, the physiological measurements confirmed this conclusion only for the funny movie. The results show that recovery from movie induced sadness, the affective experience of the amusing movie, and trust towards the communication partner did not differ between both experimental conditions. Hence, feedback via mediated hand touching did not enhance either of these factors compared to visual feedback. Further {{analysis of the data}} showed that participants scoring low on Extraversion (i. e., persons that are more introvert) or low on Touch Receptivity (i. e., persons who do not like to be touched by others) felt better understood by their communication partner when receiving mediated touch feedback instead of visual feedback, while the opposite was found for participants scoring high on these factors. The implications of these results for further research are discussed, and some suggestions for follow-up experiments are presented...|$|E

40|$|Agrammatic {{speech is}} {{characterized}} by the omission and substitution of grammatical morphemes. Some recent papers suggest that certain patterns of omission and substitution are ruled by linguistic, that is, syntactic processes (e. g., Hagiwara, 1995; Friedmann & Grodzinsky, 1997; Bastiaanse & Van Zonneveld, 1998). In the present paper, the omission pattern of case markers in the spontaneous speech of Dutch and German speakers with agrammatic aphasia is analyzed within the framework of Chomsky's (1986) case theory, which says that every phonetically realized NP must <b>receive</b> (<b>abstract)</b> case. The inflected verb (I) assigns nominative case to the subject in the sentence, and the verb (V) assigns dative and accusative case to the indirect and direct object respectively This, in combination with the knowledge that verbs and verb inflections are notoriously difficult for speakers with agrammatism, served as the basis for this study. We hypothesize that, if no case assigner is produced, the noun will receive nominative case by default or the case marking morpheme (i. e., the determiner) will be omitted. This hypothesis has been tested and was supported by the data...|$|R

This conference has made a long way from its first meeting in Dubrovnik (now in Croatia) in 1985, organized by Tomaˇz Pisanski, the “father ” of Graph Theory in Slovenia whose 50 th anniversary along with the 70 th anniversary of Gert Sabidussi we will celebrate during this week. The second meeting was held at Bled in 1991 and coincided with the declaration of Slovenian independence. This caused a slight inconvenience to the 30 participants but the meeting will be remembered as a successful albeit adventurous event. In 1995 the number of participants more than tripled and the number of registered participants for the Fourth Slovenian Conference is more than hundred.

Psychologically, the model is underspecified: it is not Figure 2 : details of the attentional system resource control mechanisms inference mechanisms working store intended to capture long-term learning, that is the accretion of information into the memory system or the migration of information between its components. However, we recognise that temporarily activated information within the memory system {{is a form of}} transitory storage (an effective extension of the working store), and that such information may have been recently added to the memory system. The action system is responsible for detailed control of output via the musculature. It has no conceptual planning abilities, rather its activity is determined in two ways. It can <b>receive</b> <b>abstract</b> commands from the attentional system, such as "log on", requiring a complex sequence of actions; it can also be triggered directly by external input received via the recognition component of the memory system (both input and resulting action plan can be complex [...] - a skilled user might detect and correct a spelling mistake while engrossed in a conversation). The translation from command to action sequence relies heavily upon procedural schemas (action plans) held in the memory system, and includes provision for the automatic processing of external information and feedback. Thus the task of logging on requires the cognitive system to recognise both internal and external feedback from key presses, and perhaps also visual prompts from the display, information which the action system will use as triggers for further action. These two alternative means of accessing the action system are a fundamental feature of the model, and, following Schneider, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Education campaigns {{conducted}} by water management agencies {{are intended to}} motivate people to conserve water. However, {{there has been little}} research to determine what kind of information best achieves this goal. Four types of information partly based on Stem, Dietz and Kalof 2 ̆ 7 s (1993) social-psychological model of environmental value orientations were examined in this study: action information about ways to conserve water; abstract factual information about water and its use; anthropocentric information about how people are affected by water use; and ecocentric information about how the environment is affected by water use. Using cluster sampling techniques 160 participants were selected from four Perth suburbs (two upper-middle income suburbs, and two lower-middle income suburbs). Brochures containing the four different types of information (all including action information) were randomly distributed to participants who were then asked to rate the perceived importance of each information item. Three weeks after distribution participants were assessed on their memory of the information, and on their self-reported water conservation behaviours. There was an interaction of information with income on importance ratings, with the lower-middle income group rating ecocentric information as relatively important, while the upper-middle income group rated it as relatively unimportant. There was a main effect for memory, with post hoc tests indicating that abstract information was remembered significantly better than anthropocentric information. In addition to having higher memory scores, people <b>receiving</b> <b>abstract</b> information reported the most behaviour change. However, post hoc tests revealed that this was significantly different only from ecocentric information, for which people reported the least behaviour change. The relative effectiveness of the abstract information may be explained by the simple and novel nature of many of the items. The failure of ecocentric information to lead to behaviour change appears inconsistent with previous findings that suggest environmental concern motivates conservation behaviour. This failure was not surprising in the upper middle income group which found the information relatively unimportant. For people in the lower-middle income group it is possible that a) they feel helpless in the face of environmental problems, or b) their perceived importance ratings were based on symbolic attitudes which have little influence on behaviour when self-interests also prevail...|$|R
