40|$|A novel compact R 718 {{water chiller}} with {{integration}} of a centrifugal compressor stage and two phase ejectors {{as a second}} stage compression device is proposed. The paper describes the investigations of this R 718 refrigerating cycle. The limitations of the R 718 centrifugal compressor stage pressure ratio are discussed, and possibilities for introduction of two-phase ejectors in the R 718 <b>refrigerating</b> <b>systems</b> with direct evaporation and condensation are analyzed. The complex thermal and flow phenomena connected with additional compression, desuperheating and condensation inside the two-phase ejector flow field are investigated and performance characteristics are estimated. The thermodynamic processes are shown in pressure – enthalpy and temperature – entropy diagrams. Based on the described thermodynamic model, a computational procedure was generated to evaluate the performance characteristics of this R 718 refrigerating unit. The implementation of the two-phase ejector in the R 718 centrifugal compressor <b>refrigerating</b> <b>systems</b> causes simplification of the R 718 unit, and reduction of their size and cost.

Depending upon the requirement, such a system incorporates conventionally either a water cooled or air cooled condenser. The total operating cost of a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>system</b> with a water cooled condenser comprises the cost of water {{and the cost of}} electricity needed to drive the compressor(s). There is enough potential for research in finding out the ways to achieve maximum coefficient of performance and the least operating cost simultaneously for multistage azeotropic system. However, to avoid overloading of sewage facilities and to comply with municipal codes for the use of water, the water flow rate required in <b>refrigerating</b> <b>system</b> should be minimized. In the present investigation, economic water rates for two stage refrigerating systems, operating on most commonly used azeotropes R- 500 and R- 502, have been searched out over a wide range of operating limits.
