500|$|Many of {{the firefighters}} {{appearing}} as extras in [...] "Subway" [...] were Baltimore firefighters. Yoshimura {{said that the}} firefighters {{who appeared to be}} running in the episode were actors, while the real firefighters walked slowly because, based on their real-life experience, they knew {{that there would be no}} need to rush in a situation involving a fatality. Although power on the railings were turned off during shooting, the crew and producers were not aware that some residual electricity continues to run through the cars even after the tracks have been shut down. At one point during the shooting, D'Onofrio felt a charge of that electricity run through him and said, [...] "I'm really feeling something strange here." [...] The crew initially believed D'Onofrio to be ad-libbing a line of dialogue in character, but eventually realized he was being electrified. When the MTA explained about the residual electricity, the crew installed <b>rubber</b> <b>insulation</b> so that D'Onofrio would not touch the metal of the train and experience any electricity.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, the tensile {{strength}} {{on the surface}} parts of the silicone <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing are significantly {{lower than those of}} internal parts. The change in the bottom part is the most obvious. In the case of the bottom part of the silicone <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing, the tensile strength decreases remarkably from 2.88 to 1.87  MPa when S 2 (internal sample) compared with S 1 (surface sample). Similarly, the tensile strength decreases from 2.55 to 2.08  MPa when S 4 compared with S 3, and the tensile strength decreases from 2.66 to 2.60  MPa when S 6 compared with S 5. The elongation at break of the silicone <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing sharply decreases from 267 to  217  % when the comparison is made between the internal sample (S 2) and surface sample (S 1). Whereas for S 3 compared with S 4, and S 5 compared with S 6, elongation at break values almost do not change. During the ageing course of polymer materials, chain scission, degradation, and cross-linking reactions may occur. In general case, tensile strength and elongation at break of polymer materials could decline after ageing. In this article, fracture and degradation of the side-chain groups and backbone of the silicone rubber result in reduction in tensile strength. When polymer materials are cross-linked, elongation at break will increase with the improvement of cross-linkage degree. If the degree of cross-linking continues to improve, excessive cross-linking will result in a decline in the elongation at break. The elongation at break of S 1 is greatly reduced compared with S 2, whereas S 3 between S 4 and S 5 between S 6 show little change, which illustrate that the degree of cross-linking of S 1 is the maximum. Mechanical test results show that the surface parts of the silicone <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing have undergone serious ageing, ageing extent of S 1 is the most severe. These results are in accordance with the FTIR results.|$|R

50|$|By careful treatment, {{extremely}} {{thin wire}} can be produced. Special purpose wire is however made from other metals (e.g. tungsten wire for light bulb and vacuum tube filaments, {{because of its}} high melting temperature).

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} the TG curves of the {{silicone}} <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing samples in Fig.  4, the thermal degradation of silicone rubber system takes two mass loss steps. The first step during the temperature range from 370 to 650  °C is attributed to the thermal decomposition of the side-chain groups of the silicone rubber. The other might be ascribed to the thermal degradation of the backbone during 650 – 800  °C. The decomposition process is characterized by the initial and maximum degradation temperatures, as summarized in Table  3. Tonset is the initial decomposition temperature, Tmax is the temperature of the maximum rate of decomposition. Below 420  °C, inner parts of the silicone rubber have not exhibited weight loss, indicating that the molecular structure has not changed and ageing has not happened. For the surface parts of the silicone rubber, decomposition begins from 370  °C, it might be attributed to the thermal degradation of small molecules derived from side-chain groups. For instance, Tonset (375.1  °C) and Tmax (425.2  °C) of S 1 is lower than that of S 2 (427.2, 665.2  °C respectively), indicating that surface parts of the silicone rubber have suffered to ageing worse than the internal samples. Table  3 also lists the residues at 800  °C, the values of the surface parts are higher than those of the inner parts. This is because surface parts of the silicone <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing have suffered to ageing due to sun exposure, ultraviolet radiation, corona discharge, and high leakage current in 8  years’ service duration. For the surface parts of the silicone <b>rubber</b> CT <b>insulation</b> bushing, a certain amount of organic materials had already been decomposed in long service time, they were lost as CO 2 and H 2 O, remaining a large amount of inorganic filler materials in solid state and unchanged on heating. So the weight loss of surface parts in TG analysis should be smaller. Also TGA results are consistent with the results of mechanical properties and FTIR analysis.|$|R

50|$|Over time, rubber-insulated cables become brittle {{because of}} {{exposure}} to atmospheric oxygen, so they must be handled with care and are usually replaced during renovations.

50|$|Physically, an {{electrical}} cable is an assembly consisting {{of one or more}} conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual covering(s), assembly protection and protective covering(s). Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. Bunching small wires before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. Copper wires in a cable may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often tin but sometimes gold, silver or some other material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to oxidation than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes soldering easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands. Tinning was used to help removal of <b>rubber</b> <b>insulation.</b> Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA - as in telephone handset cords).|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} now {{supported}} at just three not four points using special <b>rubber</b> <b>insulation</b> to control noise and vibration.

A further convenience was an optional extra power-controlled or automatic clutch. A Startix automatic engine starter was fitted. Startix was activated when the ignition was switched on and, in addition, operated automatically if the engine stalled. The new change-speed system meant gears might be changed after a slight easing of the accelerator without using the clutch yet making no noise. A knob on the instrument panel switched of the freewheel and returned the gearbox to orthodox. The half-elliptic spring on both axles are controlled by hydraulic shock-absorbers. The freewheel was to remain a feature of Rovers for more than 20 years.|$|E
40|$|Four {{materials}} {{used on the}} inertial upper state (IUS) were subjected to vacuum conditions and heated to near-operational temperatures (93 to 316 C), releasing volatile materials. A fraction of the volatile materials were collected on 25 C solar cells, optical solar reflectors (OSR's) or aluminized Mylar. The contaminated surfaces were exposed to 26 equivalent sun hours of simulated solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Measurements of contamination deposit mass, structure, reflectance and effects on solar cell power output were made before and after UV irradiation. Standard total mass loss - volatile condensible materials (TML - VCM) tests were also performed.

The results showed that both the average values of the tensile modulus and tensile strength were reduced by 25 %. The average value of elongation at break not only increased by 33 % before thermal aging, but also reduced by 33 % after thermal aging. The maximum value of swelling was 324 %. Moreover, the lowest value of thermal conductivity was 0. 040  W/m/K. Therefore, the optimum concentration of the BSH was 6  phr which had optimum properties for thermal insulation...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to assess the aging degradation and loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) behavior of electrical cables subjected to long-term aging exposures. Four different cable types were tested in both the U. S. and France: (1) U. S. 2 conductor with ethylene propylene <b>rubber</b> (EPR) <b>insulation</b> and a Hypalon jacket. (2) U.
