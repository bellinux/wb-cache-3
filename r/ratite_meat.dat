50|$|The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) began a voluntary, {{fee-for-service}} ratite inspection {{program in}} 1995 {{to help the}} fledgling industry improve the marketability of the meat. A provision in the FY2001 USDA appropriations act (P.L. 106-387) amended the Poultry Products Inspection Act to make federal inspection of <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> mandatory as of April 2001 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years a growing demand for <b>ratite</b> <b>meat,</b> {{including}} ostrich, emu, and rhea has been observed in the world. <b>Ratite</b> <b>meat</b> is recognised as a dietetic product because of low level of fat, high share of PUFA, favourable n 6 /n 3 ratio, and higher amounts of iron content in comparison with beef and chicken meat. The abundance of bioactive compounds, e. g. PUFA, makes <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> highly susceptible to oxidation processes. Moreover, pH over 6 creates favourable environment for fast microbial growth during storage conditions affecting its shelf life. However, availability of information on <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> shelf life among consumers and industry is still limited. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present review is to provide current information about the effect of <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> packaging type, i. e. air packaging, vacuum packaging with skin pack, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on its shelf life quality during storage, including technological and nutritional properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{growing demand for}} <b>ratite</b> <b>meat,</b> {{including}} ostrich, emu, and rhea has been observed all over the world. However, consumers {{as well as the}} meat industry still have limited and scattered knowledge about this type of meat, {{especially in the case of}} emu and rhea. Thus, the aim of the present review is to provide information on technological and nutritional properties of ostrich, emu, and rhea meat, including carcass composition and yields, physicochemical characteristics, and nutritive value. Carcass yields and composition among ratites are comparable, with the exception of higher content of fat in emu. Ostrich, emu, and rhea meat is darker than beef and <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> acidification is closer to beef than to poultry. <b>Ratite</b> <b>meat</b> can be recognised as a dietetic product mainly because of its low level of fat, high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), favourable n 6 /n 3 ratio, and high iron content in comparison with beef and chicken meat. <b>Ratite</b> <b>meat</b> is also rich in selenium, copper, vitamin B, and biologically active peptides such as creatine (emu) and anserine (ostrich), and has low content of sodium (ostrich). The abundance of bioactive compounds e. g. PUFA, makes <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> highly susceptible to oxidation and requires research concerning elaboration of innovative, intelligent packaging system for protection of nutritional and technological properties of this meat...|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises {{research}} on farmed ratites and their industries {{over the past}} 100 years. Commercial <b>ratite</b> products include <b>meat,</b> skins, feathers and oil. Research on ratites has attempted to enhance {{the quantity and quality}} of these products by focusing on the disciplines of breeding and genetics, reproduction and incubation, assisted reproduction, nutrition and animal welfare. Advances in these disciplines are discussed, and directions for future research are provided. © 2012 World's Poultry Science Association...|$|R
40|$|Emu and ostrich meats were {{compared}} with beef to identify and quantify their sensory attributes. A sensory panel {{was used to compare}} U. S. Department of Agriculture Choice top sirloin beef with emu and ostrich meat, both ground and intact forms. Comparisons of sensory quality and acceptability were made after zero, two, four and six months of frozen storage. Differences in flavor, juiciness and texture were detected between ratite meats and beef (the control). The differences were more pronounced for intact cuts than ground meat, with <b>ratite</b> <b>meat</b> usually being rated inferior to beef. Some differences in sensory acceptability across the sic-month storage period were revealed. Implications for marketing the ratite meats are made based upon the study.
