30|$|The patent {{literature}} [6, 17] {{claims that}} contacting asphaltenes with an oxygen-containing gas, e.g., air, at temperatures below 100  °C produces liquid products. It {{was reported that}} the liquid yield of pentane extractable materials increased after oxidation, with liquid yields {{of the order of}} 15  wt% being achieved [17].

In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} air saturated with water vapor is a significantly better oxidizing agent able to increase the liquid yield [17]. The oxidation can be performed using a force draft oven or a packed-bed reactor. Under these premises, it seems that low-temperature oxidation of asphaltenes might be possible and that at least part of the asphaltenes can be transformed from a low-value solid to a higher value petrochemical feedstock, before the asphaltenes is further upgraded using conventional technologies.|$|R

50|$|Improvement in {{filtration}} {{technologies and}} processes has now made recycling {{a viable option}} (with rising price of base stock and crude oil). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated {{much the same as}} virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock</b> to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (distilling, isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.|$|E
50|$|PADD 1 {{covers the}} East Coast of the United States. Due to their location, {{refineries}} {{in the central}} US have enjoyed cheap domestic tight oil and discounted oil sands production from Canada. Meanwhile, refineries on the East Coast {{have been forced to}} buy oil from overseas at higher world prices due to North American pipeline bottlenecks. Five refineries on the US East Coast have been forced to close since 2010, and three more were threatened with closure before they sold at discounted prices. Pipelines are the cheapest and safest method of oil transportation in North America. However, {{due to the lack of}} pipelines, East Coast refineries must bring in domestic North Dakota Bakken oil and imported Western Canadian oil sands production by rail. Imports account for the vast majority of PADD 1 <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock,</b> but only a small portion of it comes from Canada, mostly Canadian Atlantic offshore production. Very little comes from the Canadian oil sands. Most of the refineries can handle only sweet, light crude oil, so even heavy, sour Western Canadian Select would not be a good feedstock. Imports of heavy oil from Western Canada could rise in the next few years via deliveries by rail, but it is unlikely that much oil sands production will be processed there.|$|E

40|$|A novel direct coal {{liquefaction}} technology {{is being investigated}} in a program being conducted by CONSOL Inc. with the University of Kentucky, Center for Applied Energy Research and LDP Associates under DOE Contract DE-AC 22 - 95 PC 95050. The novel concept consists of {{a new approach to}} {{coal liquefaction}} chemistry which avoids some of the inherent limitations of current high-temperature thermal liquefaction processes. The chemistry employed is based on hydride ion donation to solubilize coal at temperatures (350 - 400 {degrees}C) significantly lower than those typically used in conventional coal liquefaction. The process concept being explored consists of two reaction stages. In the first stage, the coal is solubilized by hydride ion donation. In the second, the products are catalytically upgraded to acceptable <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> The program explores not only the initial solubilization step, but integration of the subsequent processing steps, including an interstage solids-separation step, to produce distillate products. A unique feature of the process concept {{is that many of the}} individual reaction steps can be decoupled, because little recycle around the liquefaction system is expected. This allows for considerable latitude in the process design. Furthermore, this has allowed for each key element in the process to be explored independently in laboratory work conducted under Task 2 of the program...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis of coal or any {{carbonaceous}} material {{is a good}} method for producing valuable products such as gases, liquids and char. It has the advantage, versus other conversion technologies, of promoting the transfer of hydrogen from the parent material to the gas and the liquid products, concentrating the carbon in the residual char which {{can be an important}} improvement in the present scenario, in which carbon-free or at least low carbon fuels need to be promoted to reduce CO 2 emissions. In this sense, pyrolysis has been claimed as an alternative to incineration or land filling for valorization of wastes of hydrocarbon nature. Yields and composition of each product fraction obtained after pyrolysis depend not only on the reaction conditions but also on the experimental system used for the process. In general, the liquids contain a complex mixture of compounds of 5 - 20 carbons with a high proportion of aromatics that can be used directly as fuels or as petroleum <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> The gas fraction which can also be used as a fuel is composed mainly of hydrogen and light hydrocarbons.

This study has monitored the biodegradability of both an isolated aromatic UCM and the synthetic model compounds using the bacterium strain Pseudo onas fluorescens, a known aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon degrader. • Unresolved complex mixtures (UCMs) of hydrocarbons are an almost universal feature of environmental samples contaminated with weathered residues of petroleum [1]. • The UCM is considered to be relatively inert to microbial degradation [2] and, consequently, it is a dominant feature of the gas chromatograms of biodegraded crude oils (Fig. 1). • Alkyltetralins have previously been identified as important aromatic UCM components in several biodegraded and <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock</b> oils [3, 4]. • The most toxic component of the UCM is the monoaromatic fraction [5, 6]. • The synthesis of proposed ‘average ’ model structures (Fig. 2, I-VI) [7, 8] of monoaromatic UCM hydrocarbons has allowed a comparative toxicological evaluation to be made [5]. • Exposure of Mytilus edulis to compounds (I-III) exhibited similar toxicity effects (> 70...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Partially Premixed Combustion {{is known for}} reduced {{hazardous}} emissions and improved efficiency. Since a low-reactive fuel is required to extend the ignition delay at elevated loads, controllability and stability issues occur at the low-load end. In this investigation seven fuel blends are used, all having a Research Octane Number of around 70 and a distinct composition or boiling range. Four {{of them could be}} regarded as ‘viable refinery fuels’ since they are based on current <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> The latter three are based on primary reference fuels, being PRF 70 and blends with ethanol and toluene respectively. Previous experiments revealed significant ignition differences, which asked for further understanding with an extended set of measurements. Experiments are conducted on a heavy duty diesel engine modified for single cylinder operation. In this investigation, emphasis is put on idling (600 rpm) and low load conditions. In particular, the so-called low-temperature heat release (LTHR) is studied. The LTHR is known to be an indicator for ignition behavior in cold conditions as it is the precursor of the main combustion event due to the chain-branching reactions occurring during this phase. LTHR is found to decrease with elevated intake temperatures. This effect is strongly fuel specific and is closely linked to the n-paraffins present in the fuel. It {{should be noted that the}} LTHR effect diminishes if ignition delays shorten. Both ethanol and toluene enhance the LTHR phase. This observation is opposite to effects observed in homogeneous combustion, which implies a significant effect of mixture strength...|$|R

30|$|The huge {{consumption}} of conventional light crude and the continuous depletion of its reserves {{in addition to}} rising oil price have shifted attention to heavy oil reserves as an alternative substitute for our world which is largely dependent on petroleum-based fuels energy resource. To exploit heavy oil reserves economically with less environmental impact, the toe-to-heel air injection and its add-on CAtalytic upgrading PRocess In-situ (THAI–CAPRI™) process was developed for its recovery and upgrading in situ in the reservoir. This technology was propelled by several factors: producing oil of commercial value in situ that meets <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock</b> specifications, the rising global demands for energy, the declining of conventional light oil reservoirs, increasing price of light crude alongside fluctuating supply, and most importantly the abundant deposits of heavy oil and bitumen energy resources worldwide that is waiting exploitation. With estimated 8  trillions of heavy oil and bitumen reserves, it shows their capacity to boost global energy source for decades. The THAI–CAPRI™ process was developed in 1998, and its main objective was to convert heavy oil into light oil in situ without resort to further surface upgrading, in contrast to other thermal technologies like steam flooding, SAGD, CSS, conventional in situ combustion, etc. Throughout this paper the primary {{focus will be on}} THAI–CAPRI™ process, a brief overview of the thermal methods commonly applied by the petroleum industry for heavy oil and bitumen recovery will also be presented, so as to enable comparison between the techniques, in view that the findings would shape further research and applications.|$|E
40|$|Depletion {{of fossil}} fuel {{reserves}} along with growing environmental concerns has shifted focus towards {{renewable energy sources}} for liquid fuels production, such as biofuels. Most biofuels, like ethanol, are single-component fuels that cannot meet today 2 ̆ 7 s engine specifications unless they are blended with petroleum feedstocks. Current transportation infrastructure uses petroleum fuels that are mixtures of compounds. Therefore, {{it is important to}} be able to produce multi-component fuels in a cost effective way, from renewable resources. ^ Aqueous-phase hydrogenation reactions are crucial in converting biomass-derived molecules into liquid fuels and chemicals. It is possible to produce multi-component fuels through the hydrogenation of bio-oils in the aqueous phase. One of the hardest functionalities to be hydrogenated in bio-oils is the carboxylic acids. Our findings on acetic acid hydrogenation studies over monometallic catalysts will be discussed combined with insight learned from DFT calculations. Ruthenium has been shown to be the most active and selective catalyst towards ethanol formation. Acetyl species appears to be a key component as its formation is the rate-determining step for almost all catalysts. ^ Another way of making multi-component fuels is by the liquid-phase processing of the hemicellulose portion of biomass. It will be shown that hemicellulose-derived aqueous feedstocks can be converted into a petroleum feedstock that can readily be processed in existing petroleum refineries to make a variety of fuels. Furfural is produced in high yields from the dehydration of hemicellulose-derived sugar streams. The aldol condensation of furfural with acetone gives highly conjugated C 13 compounds along with some polymeric adducts. In the presence of supported metal catalyst these compounds undergo hydrogenation, and at the same time, form heavy cyclic molecules via Diels-Alder reactions. Through hydrodeoxygenation and isomerization over bifunctional catalysts these molecules produce refinery feedstocks, or more specifically, fluid catalytic cracker cycle oil substitutes, having carbon numbers up to C 31. This integrated catalytic process can be tuned to adjust the yield of the hydrocarbon products thereby selectively producing jet and diesel fuel range compounds or a heavier petroleum <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock.</b> This study demonstrates that biomass can produce mixtures of components that can fit seamlessly into petroleum refinery infrastructure. ...|$|E
40|$|Gasoline {{coming from}} {{refinery}} {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) unit is {{a major contributor to}} the total commercial grade gasoline pool. The contents of the FCC gasoline are primarily paraffins, naphthenes, olefins, aromatics, and undesirables such as sulfur and sulfur containing compounds in low quantities. The proportions of these components in the FCC gasoline invariable determine its quality as well as the performance of the associated downstream units. The increasing demand for cleaner and lighter fuels significantly influences the need not only for novel processing technologies but also for alternative refinery and petrochemical feedstocks. Current and future clean gasoline requirements include increased isoparaffins contents, reduced olefin contents, reduced aromatics, reduced benzene, and reduced sulfur contents. The present study is aimed at investigating the effect of processing an unconventional <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock,</b> composed of blend of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) on FCC full range gasoline yields and compositional spectrum including its paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, napthenes, and aromatics contents distribution within a range of operating variables of temperature (500 – 700 °C) and catalyst-feed oil ratio (CFR 5 – 10) using spent equilibrium FCC Y-zeolite based catalyst in a FCC pilot plant operated at the University of Alicante’s Research Institute of Chemical Process Engineering (RICPE). The coprocessing of the oil-polymer blend led to the production of gasoline with very similar yields and compositions as those obtained from the base oil, albeit, in some cases, the contribution of the feed polymer content as well as the processing variables on the gasoline compositional spectrum were appreciated. Carbon content analysis showed a higher fraction of the C 9 –C 12 compounds at all catalyst rates employed and for both feedstocks. The gasoline’s paraffinicity, olefinicity, and degrees of branching of the paraffins and olefins were also affected in various degrees by the scale of operating severity. In the majority of the cases, the gasoline aromatics tended toward the decrease as the reactor temperature was increased. While the paraffins and iso-paraffins gasoline contents were relatively stable at around 5 % wt, the olefin contents on the other hand generally increased with increase in the FCC reactor temperature.

A hydride ion reagent system was used to effect high coal conversions of Black Thunder Mine Wyoming subbituminous coal. An integrated first-stage and filtration step was successfully demonstrated and used to produce product filtrates with extremely low solids contents.
