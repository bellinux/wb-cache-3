5|$|This episode has {{the final}} {{speaking}} appearance of Lionel Hutz, {{five months before}} the death of Phil Hartman. The episode's development {{grew out of a}} desire by the writers to do a show focused on Marge, where her job did not work out. The episode received positive mention in the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, and is featured in the special 2003 DVD release The Simpsons: <b>Risky</b> <b>Business.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ballooning was a <b>risky</b> <b>business</b> for the pioneers. Blanchard lost {{consciousness}} {{on a few}} occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, {{she became the first}} woman to be killed in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she fell to her death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.|$|E
5|$|Drive {{has been}} called a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, {{extremely}} violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain. Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences {{can be seen in the}} neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by <b>Risky</b> <b>Business</b> (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.|$|E

5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film <b>Risky</b> <b>Business),</b> makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm {{demonstrated}} a rare {{ability to survive}} among early Scottish kings by reigning for twenty-nine years. He was a clever and ambitious man. Brehon tradition provided that the successor to Malcolm was to be selected by him from among the descendants of King Aedh, {{with the consent of}} Malcolm's ministers and of the church. Ostensibly in an attempt to end the devastating feuds in the north of Scotland, but obviously influenced by the Norman feudal model, Malcolm ignored tradition and determined to retain the succession within his own line. But since Malcolm had no son of his own, he undertook to negotiate a series of dynastic marriages of his three daughters to men who might otherwise be his rivals, while securing the loyalty of the principal chiefs, their relatives. First he married his daughter Bethoc to Crinan, Thane of The Isles, head of the house of Atholl and secular Abbot of Dunkeld; then his youngest daughter, Olith, to Sigurd, Earl of Orkney. His middle daughter, Donada, was married to Finlay, Earl of Moray, Thane of Ross and Cromarty and a descendant of Loarn of Dalriada. This was <b>risky</b> <b>business</b> under the rules of succession of the Gael, but he thereby secured his rear and, taking advantage of the renewal of Viking attacks on England, marched south to fight the English. He defeated the Angles at Carham in 1018 and installed his grandson, Duncan, son of the Abbot of Dunkeld and his choice as Tanist, in Carlisle as King of Cumbria that same year.|$|E

25|$|Two {{aircraft}}, with {{serial numbers}} N249 & N250 were built, the first flying on 25 August 1929 {{and the second}} on 31 August. The aircraft showed promise and high speed but had problems with fuel supply when banking, which led to engine cut-outs. For such a <b>risky</b> <b>business</b> as low-altitude air-racing, this was an unacceptable risk and the aircraft were withdrawn from competition in the 1929 Schneider Trophy, leaving the way clear for the Supermarine S.6 to win.|$|E

30|$|This {{confirms}} {{the finding of}} Furdas and Kohn (2010) that showed that women participate less in entrepreneurial activity than men. Women might be more risk averse than men {{and for that reason}} {{may not be able to}} venture <b>risky</b> <b>businesses.</b> It is important to state that going into own business needs a bold decision and women by their nature may not be prepared to venture the risk because they are risk-averse (Croson and Gneezy, 2009).|$|R
5000|$|The {{researcher}} {{observed that}} an interest cap exacerbates {{the problem of}} adverse selection as it restricts lenders’ ability to price discriminate and means that some enterprises that might have received more expensive credit for <b>riskier</b> <b>business</b> ventures will not receive funding. There has been some attempt to link this constraint in the availability of credit to output. In Bangladesh, firms with access to credit {{were found to be}} more efficient than firms with a credit constraint. The World Bank [...] found credit constraints may reduce profit margins buy up to 13.6% per year.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, glasses with large, plastic frames were in fashion for both men and women. Small metal framed {{eyeglasses}} made a return to fashion in 1984 and 1985, and in the late 1980s, glasses with tortoise-shell coloring became popular. These were smaller and rounder than the type that was popular earlier in the decade.

25|$|In 1967 Brel {{began his}} film career, {{appearing}} in André Cayatte's Les risques du métier (<b>Risky</b> <b>business),</b> co-starring Emmanuelle Riva, Jacques Harden, and Nadine Alari. Brel also produced the soundtrack with François Rauber. The film {{tells the story}} of a teenage girl who accuses her primary schoolteacher, Jean Doucet (Brel), of trying to rape her. The police and the mayor investigate, but Doucet denies the charges. Two other students come forward to reveal more of Doucet's misconduct—one confessing to be his mistress. Doucet faces trial and hard labour if convicted. The film was released on 21 December 1967. Film critics praised Brel's performance.|$|E
50|$|In the United States of America the American {{middle class}} is being forced to either make it bigger or lose it all due to policy passed within the {{business}} model of capitalism as the United States knows it. Less borrowing to relatively <b>risky</b> <b>businesses,</b> less availability of making large capital gains as well as rising inflation. Commodities are at record levels, keeping the large companies maintaining record profits, while the middle class are paying more for all this, as the primary consumers of goods, and falling {{into the bottom of}} the hourglass, at least on paper.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) have been receiving less focus from the software vendors than large enterprises (LEs). Research on {{the implementation of}} ERP in certain European countries shows that the job of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning package (ERP) is a <b>riskier</b> <b>business</b> for SMEs than for LEs. This paper presents a methodology for efficient implementation of ERP solutions by delegating the main project leadership roles to an experienced consultant. Finally, a case study is presented with proposed implementation steps. The steps taken in this project, if proven on some additional projects with SMEs could be become basis for a more formalized set of activities, or even a methodology...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{stakeholders}} of insurance companies and financial institutions against adverse outcomes of <b>risky</b> <b>businesses,</b> regulators and senior management use capital allocation techniques. For enterprise-wide risk management, it has become important to calculate the contribution of each risk within a portfolio. For that purpose, bivariate lower and upper orthant tail value-at-risk {{can be used for}} capital allocation. In this paper, we present multivariate value-at-risk and tail-value-at-risk for d ≥ 2, and we focus on three different methods to calculate optimal values for the contribution of each risk within the sums of random vectors to the overall portfolio, which could particularly apply to insurance and financial portfolios...|$|R
25|$|The {{thought that}} the {{mammalian}} body must have some way of identifying introduced foreign particles first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that {{the first of these}} identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a <b>risky</b> <b>business,</b> often being rejected for unknown reasons. The search for a reason spanned the next four decades and in some areas is still continuing today.|$|E
25|$|Danehill Dancer was {{retired to}} {{stand as a}} {{stallion}} at Coolmore Stud in 1997, with his stud fee initially set at Ir£4,000, and he traveled to stand at Coolmore's Australian stud for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. In 1997, he never covered any mares in Europe, as {{he was still in}} training, but did travel to Australia to cover mares there, although he did not produce any top-class foals that year. Danehill Dancer sired three Group 1 winners from his 1999 foals, including Choisir, who was a top-class sprinter in both Australia and Great Britain, winning the Lightning Stakes, King's Stand Stakes and Golden Jubilee Stakes. He now stands at stud for Coolmore in Ireland for a fee of €12,500 and shuttles to Australia for the southern hemisphere spring, where his stud fee is $29,700. His best progeny so far are Olympic Glory, Sacred Choice and Starspangledbanner. The other Group 1 winners from Danehill Dancer's first crop were Private Steer (Stradbroke Handicap, Doncaster Handicap and All Aged Stakes) and Where or When (Queen Elizabeth II Stakes). Danehill Dancer did not produce any horses that scored at the top level for a few seasons until Speciosa (foaled 2003) won the 1000 Guineas in 2006. She later finished fourth in the Oaks and second in the Pretty Polly Stakes. Danehill Dancer's 2004 crop included Alexander Tango (Garden City Handicap), Arapaho Miss (Crown Oaks), Light Fantastic (Australian Guineas), Miss Beatrix (Moyglare Stud Stakes) and <b>Risky</b> <b>Business</b> (Singapore Gold Cup). The following season he produced Atomic Force (The Galaxy and Railway Stakes) and Super Satin (Hong Kong Derby).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how banks' funding constraints {{impact the}} access {{and cost of}} capital of small firms. Banks raise external finance from {{a large number of}} small investors who face co-ordination problems and invest in small, <b>risky</b> <b>businesses.</b> When investors observe noisy signals about the true implementation cost of real sector projects, the model can be solved for a threshold equilibrium in the classical global games approach. We show that a "socially optimal" interest rate that maximizes the probability of success of the small firm is higher than the risk-free rate, because higher interest rates relax the bank's funding constraint. However, banks will generally set an interest rate higher than this socially optimal one. This gives rise to a built-in inefficiency of banking intermediation activity that can be corrected by various policy measures...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to introduce business angels as venture capital investors. The article contains theoretical basis of business angels, focuses on the history and definition of business angels, their motives of investing, typology and area of interest. As well attention is paid to features of the business angel investment process. Business angels are investors of informal venture capital. Business angels or private investors or informal investors are individuals – usually very successful businessmen – ready to provide capital for startup businesses. They fill equity gap between capital sources of founders and their family and friends on one side and between formal venture capital on the other side. Business angels are hands-on investors, they provide not only capital but as well they experiences and network. As hands-on investors they play an active role in managing the business. To provide equity capital for young and <b>risky</b> <b>businesses</b> business angels are motivated not only by economic motives (the change to gain profit), but as well by their endeavor to help enterprises with unique business idea. Business angels can invest individually or become a part of business angels networks. The term “business angels” is quite unknown in Slovakia. Business angels exist here and invest, but they are anonymous. To support development of business angels and informal venture capital market as well could help creation of Slovak business angel network...|$|R

40|$|The use of Internet {{technology}} for solicitation by sex workers has raised important legal and regulatory questions. We provide {{a description of}} the new institutions that facilitate prostitution online, and their potential market effects. We then supply some of the first evidence on several key parameters of interest to policymakers. First, we find that workers who solicit online largely represent growth in the overall prostitution market, as opposed to simple displacement of the off-line, street-focused market, although we find sizeable displacement effects among sex workers in their 30 s and 40 s. Using a newly-implemented survey, we also find that most sex workers who solicit online engage in lower-risk behaviors than traditional street-based workers; however, workers close to the margin for migration from outdoor work bring <b>riskier</b> <b>business</b> and sexual practices with them as they enter the off-street-sector.
