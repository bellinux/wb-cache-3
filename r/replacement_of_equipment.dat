25|$|Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement {{mandated}} that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> In September 1956 the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford {{indicated that the}} U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the U.S. National Security Council and President Eisenhower. However paragraph 13(d) prevented the introduction {{of nuclear weapons and}} missiles. The U.S. unilaterally abrogated paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. At a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on June 21, 1957, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the United Nations Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice. In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, followed within a year by atomic demolition munitions and nuclear armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union.|$|E

In the face of shorter product life cycles, higher product variety, increasingly unpredictable demand, and shorter delivery times, manufacturing facilities dedicated to a single product line cannot be cost effective any longer.

This created a widening gap between the supply and the use of industrial capacity (3). Federal Reserve economists believed that the administration had contributed to the recession by cutting back on Department of Defense purchases in 1957 (2).|$|E

A mid-life major overhaul including a complete replacement of critical parts such as fuel and control rod channels was thought necessary after that. Since RBMK reactors specified a major replacement programme at 35 years designers originally decided this needed to happen in the VVER type as well, although they are of more robust design than the RBMK type. Most of Russia's VVER plants are now reaching and passing the 35 year mark.

Quite often, each of these functional modules need to exchange periodic or real time data {{with each other for}} assessing present operation condition of the network, workflows and resources (like crew, assets, etc.). Unlike other power system segments, distribution system changes or grows every day, and this could be due to the addition of a new consumer, a new transmission line or <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> If the different functional modules are operating in a non-standard environment and uses custom APIs and database interfaces, the engineering effort for managing shall become too large.
