2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... <b>Right</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E

He added, [...] "It {{could not have}} been handled worse by those involved, {{including}} me.

I tried to warn you--for I did not want a row--when I said the case 'seemed to bring you luck.' But you would not be warned; and when the cigarette-case trick was played out, you fell back on the old dodge with the drop of water.

Well, perhaps he is not to be blamed. Perhaps I also might think uncharitable things if I were In his place. But that is why I now give an explanation to you, Robert, and not to him. You, at least, have trusted me, and you have a <b>right,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> become one of your family, to know all that I can tell you. Laura also has trusted me, but I know well that she is content still to trust me." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR PEOPLE, - I do not {{understand}} these reproaches. The letters come between seven and nine in the evening; and every one about the books was answered that same night, and the answer left Davos by seven o'clock next morning. Perhaps the snow delayed then; if so, 'tis a good hint to you not to be uneasy at apparent silences. There is no hurry about my father's notes; I shall not be writing anything till I get home again, I believe. Only I {{want to be able}} to keep reading AD HOC all winter, as it seems about all I shall be fit for. About John Brown, I have been breaking my heart to finish a Scotch poem to him. Some of it is not really bad, but the rest will not come, and I mean to get it <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> do anything else.|$|E

25|$|Ruth Hale, 1887–1934, was a {{freelance}} writer and member of the Algonquin Round Table who campaigned for women's <b>rights</b> <b>before</b> World War <b>I.</b> She was born and grew up in the town.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It {{happened}} that, as I {{was watching}} {{some of the}} little people bathing in a shallow, {{one of them was}} seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> left her. I had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The {{servants}} {{had already}} gone to their quarters. Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room {{at the top of}} the house until I needed her services. I sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see that all was <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> went upstairs. It was my custom to do this myself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be trusted. I went into the kitchen, the butler's pantry, the gun-room, the billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. As I approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. I flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad-shouldered elderly man, who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long French one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. I held my bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I saw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the fellow was on me in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself, I found that they had torn down the bell-rope, and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-table. I was so firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering a sound. It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. He had evidently heard some suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. He was dressed in nightshirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand. He rushed at the burglars, but another--it was an elderly man--stooped, picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a horrible blow as he passed. He fell with a groan and never moved again. I fainted once more, but again it could only have been for a very few minutes during which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in his hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been a father with his two sons. They talked together in whispers. Then they came over and made sure that I was securely bound. Finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free. When I did so, my screams brought the maid to my assistance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is really all that I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again." ...|$|E

And, from my standpoint, I do still like to write, though it's not so much the co-writing it once was. It could be, like the Poletown record was musically. We just got the original guys together, and we pretty much went in there just jamming on all the tracks. That's why everyone is listed as a writer. Then, I pretty much wrote the lyrics and made songs out of them." ...|$|E

You can almost picture the scene; it's set in a snowy kind of mountainous landscape. There are sound effects and all sorts of mayhem going on in it, and death metal vocals not quite all the way through it, but near enough.
