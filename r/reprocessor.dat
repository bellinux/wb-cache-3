40|$|We present {{models for}} {{reprocessing}} of an intense flux of X-rays and gamma rays {{expected in the}} vicinity of gamma ray burst sources. We consider the transfer and reprocessing of the energetic photons into observable features in the X-ray band, notably the K lines of iron. Our models are {{based on the assumption that}} the gas is sufficiently dense to allow the microphysical processes to be in a steady state, thus allowing efficient line emission with modest reprocessing mass and elemental abundances ranging from solar to moderately enriched. We show that the reprocessing is enhanced by down-Comptonization of photons whose energy would otherwise be too high to absorb on iron, and that pair production can have an effect on enhancing the line production.

40|$|Abstract Background Reprocessing of {{endoscopes}} generally requires labour-intensive manual cleaning {{followed by}} high-level disinfection in an automated endoscope <b>reprocessor</b> (AER). EVOTECH Endoscope Cleaner and <b>Reprocessor</b> (ECR) is approved for fully automated {{cleaning and disinfection}} whereas AERs require manual cleaning prior to the high-level disinfection procedure. The purpose of this economic evaluation {{was to determine the}} cost-efficiency of the ECR versus AER methods of endoscopy reprocessing in an actual practice setting. Methods A time and motion study was conducted at a Canadian hospital to collect data on the personnel resources and consumable supplies costs {{associated with the use of}} EVOTECH ECR versus manual cleaning followed by AER with Medivators DSD- 201. Reprocessing of all endoscopes was observed and timed for both <b>reprocessor</b> types over three days. Laboratory staff members were interviewed regarding the consumption and cost of all disposable supplies and equipment. Exact Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for assessing differences in total cycle reprocessing time. Results Endoscope reprocessing was significantly shorter with the ECR than with manual cleaning followed by AER. The differences in median time were 12. 46 minutes per colonoscope (p Conclusions The EVOTECH ECR was more efficient and less costly to use for the reprocessing of endoscopes than manual cleaning followed by AER disinfection. Although the cost of consumable supplies required to reprocess endoscopes with EVOTECH ECR was slightly higher, the value of the labour time saved with EVOTECH ECR more than offset the additional consumables cost. The increased efficiency with EVOTECH ECR could lead to even further cost-savings by shifting endoscopy laboratory personnel responsibilities but further study is required. </p...|$|E
40|$|The central {{engines of}} both type 1 and type 2 AGNs {{are thought to}} harbor a {{toroidal}} structure that absorbs and reprocesses high-energy photons from the central X-ray source.

If the <b>reprocessor</b> is Compton-thick, the calculation of emission-line and continuum spectra that are suitable for direct fitting to X-ray data is challenging because the reprocessed emission depends on the spectral shape of the incident continuum, {{which may not be}} directly observable. We present new Monte-Carlo calculations of Green’s functions for a toroidal <b>reprocessor</b> that provide significant improvements over currently available models.

40|$|We present new {{results from}} Monte Carlo {{calculations}} of the flux and equivalent width (EW) of the Ni Kalpha fluorescent emission {{line in the}} toroidal X-ray <b>reprocessor</b> model of Murphy & Yaqoob (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1549). In the Compton-thin regime, the EW of the Ni Kalpha line is a factor of ~ 22 {{less than that of}} the Fe Kalpha line but this factor can be as low as ~ 6 in the Compton-thick regime. We show that the optically-thin limit for this ratio depends only on the Fe to Ni abundance ratio, it being independent of the geometry and covering factor of the <b>reprocessor,</b> and also independent of the shape of the incident X-ray continuum. We give some useful analytic expressions for the absolute flux and the EW of the Ni Kalpha line in the optically-thin limit. When the <b>reprocessor</b> is Compton-thick and the incident continuum is a power-law with a photon index of 1. 9, the Ni Kalpha line EW has a maximum value of ~ 3 eV and ~ 250 eV for non-intercepting and intercepting lines-of-sight respectively. Larger EWs are obtained for flatter continua. We have also studied the Compton shoulder of the Ni Ka line and find that the ratio of scattered to unscattered flux in the line has a maximum value of 0. 26, less than the corresponding maximum for the Fe Kalpha line. However, we find that the shape of the Compton shoulder profile for a given column density and inclination angle of the torus is similar to the corresponding profile for the Fe Ka line. Our results will be useful for interpreting X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and X-ray binary systems in which the system parameters are favorable for the Ni Kalpha line to be detected.

The spectrum provides a direct measurement of a large, neutral column of gas with Nh 10 ** 24 cm**- 2 in the source direction. The source, as bright as 3 C 273 above 10 keV, has a steep (Gamma 1. 8) spectrum without any evidence of a high-energy cutoff up to at least 150 keV. At lower energies, the data are best modeled {{with the addition of}} an unabsorbed reflection component.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{instrument}} {{channels of}} gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopes may be heavily contaminated with bacteria even after high-level disinfection (HLD). The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines emphasize {{the benefits of}} manually brushing endoscope channels and using automated endoscope <b>reprocessors</b> (AERs) for disinfecting endoscopes. In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of decontamination using <b>reprocessors</b> after HLD by comparing the cultured samples obtained from biopsy channels (BCs) of GI endoscopes and the internal surfaces of AERs. Methods We conducted a 5 -year prospective study. Every month random consecutive sampling was carried out after a complete reprocessing cycle; 420 rinse and swabs samples were collected from BCs and internal surface of AERs, respectively. Of the 420 rinse samples collected from the BC of the GI endoscopes, 300 {{were obtained from the}} BCs of gastroscopes and 120 from BCs of colonoscopes. Samples were collected by flushing the BCs with sterile distilled water, and swabbing the residual water from the AERs after reprocessing. These samples were cultured to detect the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. Results The number of culture-positive samples obtained from BCs (13. 6 %, 57 / 420) was significantly higher than that obtained from AERs (1. 7 %, 7 / 420). In addition, the number of culture-positive samples obtained from the BCs of gastroscopes (10. 7 %, 32 / 300) and colonoscopes (20. 8 %, 25 / 120) were significantly higher than that obtained from AER reprocess to gastroscopes (2. 0 %, 6 / 300) and AER reprocess to colonoscopes (0. 8 %, 1 / 120). Conclusions Culturing rinse samples obtained from BCs provides a better indication of the effectiveness of the decontamination of GI endoscopes after HLD than culturing the swab samples obtained from the inner surfaces of AERs as the swab samples only indicate whether the AERs are free from microbial contamination or not. </p...|$|R
