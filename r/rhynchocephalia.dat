5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They considered Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E

Several living subgroups are recognized: Testudines (turtles and tortoises), approximately 400 species; <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> (tuatara from New Zealand), 1 species; Squamata (lizards, snakes, and worm lizards), over 9,600 species; Crocodilia (crocodiles, gavials, caimans, and alligators), 25 species; and Aves (birds), 10,000 species.|$|E

500|$|Tuatara are {{reptiles}} {{endemic to}} New Zealand.

The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rhynchocephalia</b> is {{an order}} of lizard-like {{reptiles}} that includes only two living species of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus and Sphenodon guntheri), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> at one time included {{a wide array of}} genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre Ankylosphenodon.|$|E
50|$|The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning scaled lizards) are {{reptiles}} with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and <b>Rhynchocephalia.</b> It is a monophyletic {{group and}} therefore contains all descendents {{of a common}} ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus Sphenodon, which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes.|$|E
50|$|Sphenodontidae is {{a family}} within the reptile group <b>Rhynchocephalia.</b> Most members of this family are only known from fossils {{but there is one}} living member, the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) from New Zealand.

50|$|Extant {{reptiles}} {{are in the}} clade Diapsida, {{named for}} a pair of temporal fenestrations {{on each side of the}} skull. Until recently, Diapsida was said to be composed of Lepidosauria and their sister taxa Archosauria. The subclass Lepidosauria is then split into Squamata and <b>Rhynchocephalia.</b> More recent morphological studies and molecular studies also place turtles firmly within Diapsida, even though they lack temporal fenestrations.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Michael Wachtler also {{discovered}} the well preserved {{skeleton of a}} small saurian that was then named Megachirella wachtleri. In a phylogenetic study published in 2013, the two Italian researchers Silvio Renesto and Massimo Bernardi confirmed that this species should be classified close to the common ancestor of the Squamata and <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> i.e. of the snakes and lizards, {{one of the most}} common groups of reptiles encountered today.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> which {{includes}} the tuatara and their extinct relatives, can presently only be found on some small islands off New Zealand. The tuatara has amphicoelous vertebrae, {{which means that the}} vertebrae are hollowed out at both ends. Tuataras also have the ability to autotomize their tails. A well-developed median or pineal eye is present {{on the top of the}} head (parietal region) and an addition row of upper teeth is located on the palatine bone.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, D.M.S.

He also reinterpreted the Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals respectively, making them paraphyletic, unlike Goodrich's definition. Thus his Sauropsida included Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes), <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> Crocodilia, [...] "thecodonts" [...] (paraphyletic basal Archosauria), non- dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and sauropyterygians.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> {{originated}} by the Middle Triassic {{period and}} were distributed worldwide. Except {{for the single}} species of tuatara that now lives in New Zealand, all species became extinct in the late Cretaceous, although material is known from the Miocene of New Zealand. This extinction {{is associated with the}} introduction of mammals, such as rats. The modern tuatara’s skull anatomy is significantly different from the best known Mesozoic taxa. Wild populations of tuatara can be found on 32 islands; in addition to three islands in which populations have formed due to migration.|$|E
50|$|Thalattosaurs {{were first}} {{classified}} by Merriam as diaptosaurs, or primitive diapsids. He compared them to <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> {{which includes the}} living tuatara. The classification of thalattosaurs has varied from study to study, especially since some paleontologists began including the askeptosaurids as true thalattosaurs. While some authors have placed the traditional thalattosaurs and the askeptosaurids within an expanded Order Thalattosauria, some cladistic definitions (see Phylogeny below) reserve the name Thalattosauria for a clade comprising the traditional thalattosaurs, and name the larger thalattosaur-askeptosaurid group Thalattosauriformes. In studies that use a more inclusive Thalattosauria, the name Thalattosauroidea {{has been used for}} the more exclusive thalattosaur group.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the roles}} of taxonomists is to {{identify}} wastebasket taxa and reclassify the content into more natural units. Sometimes, during taxonomic revisions, the wastebasket taxa can be salvaged after doing thorough research on its members, and then imposing tighter restrictions on what continues to be included. Such techniques [...] "saved" [...] Carnosauria and Megalosaurus. Other times, the taxonomic name contains too much unrelated [...] "baggage" [...] to be successfully salvaged. As such, it is usually dumped in favour of a new, more restrictive name (for example, <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> or Thecodontia), or abandoned altogether (for example, Simia).|$|E

50|$|Squamates are a {{monophyletic}} sister {{group to}} the tuatara. The squamates and tuatara together are a sister group to crocodiles and birds, the extant archosaurs. Fossils of the squamate sister group, the <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> appear in the Early Triassic, meaning that the lineage leading to squamates must have existed as well. Modern squamates probably originated in the mid Jurassic, when fossil relatives of geckos and skinks and snakes appear; other groups, including iguanians and varanoids, first appear in the Cretaceous period. Also appearing in the Cretaceous are the polyglyphanodonts, a lizard group of uncertain affinities, and the mosasaurs, a group of predatory, marine lizards that grew to enormous sizes. At {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, squamates suffered a major extinction at the K-T boundary, which wiped out polyglyphanodonts, mosasaurs, {{and a number of other}} groups.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} known fossil {{remains of}} a lizard belong to the iguanian species Tikiguania estesi, found in the Tiki Formation of India, which dates to the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, about 220 million years ago. However, doubt has been raised {{over the age of}} Tikiguania because it is almost indistinguishable from modern agamid lizards. The Tikiguania remains may instead be late Tertiary or Quaternary in age, having been washed into much older Triassic sediments. Lizards are most closely related to the <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> which appeared in the Late Triassic, so the earliest lizards probably appeared at that time. Mitochondrial phylogenetics suggest that the first lizards evolved in the late Permian. It had been thought on the basis of morphological data that iguanid lizards diverged from other squamates very early on, but molecular evidence contradicts this.|$|E
5000|$|The American {{paleontologist}} O.C. Marsh [...] named Sphenacodon (from Greek sphen [...] "wedge" [...] + ake [...] "point" [...] + odous (-odon) [...] "tooth") in 1878, {{based on}} part of a lower jaw (dentary) bone found in the redbeds of northern New Mexico by fossil collector David Baldwin. In his very short description of the jaw, Marsh cited the back teeth as characteristic ("crowns are much compressed, and have very sharp cutting edges without crenulations") and assessed the animal as [...] "about six feet in length, and carnivorous in habit," [...] although {{the rest of the}} skeleton was not known. He did not provide an illustration of the specimen. Marsh gave the genus the Latin species name ferox [...] "fierce" [...] and erected the new family Sphenacodontidae, placed under the primitive reptilian order “Rhynchocephala” <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> then including nearly all groups of early reptiles in addition to the living tuatara.|$|E
50|$|Snakes do {{not have}} an {{extensive}} fossil record; the oldest known fossil is from between early and late Cretaceous period. There were Tertiary fossil snakes that became extinct {{by the end of the}} Eocene period. The first colubrid also appeared in the Eocene period. Lizards first appeared in the middle Jurassic period, and this is when the scincomorph and the anguimorph lizards were first seen. The Gekkotans first appear in the late Jurassic period and the iguanians first appear in the late Cretaceous period. The lizards of the Cretaceous period represent extinct genera and species. The majority of amphisbaenians first appeared during the early Cenozoic period. Rhynchocephalian fossils first appear in the Middle Triassic period, between 238-240 million years ago, making them the earliest lepidosaurian fossils found to date. The tuatara can now only be found on small islands off the New Zealand coast. However, fossil records show that it once lived on mainland New Zealand and <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> as a whole was once distributed globally.|$|E
50|$|Stereosternum tumidum was {{discovered}} by Edward Drinker Cope in 1886, {{while he was in}} Brazil and looking over some specimens housed in the Museu Nacional (Rio de Janeiro). When looking at the specimen, he noticed that the characteristics seen in Stereosternum were also seen in Mesosaurus. At the time, E.D. Cope had no certainty about the time period Stereosternum belonged to, thinking that either it came from the Carboniferous or the Permian. He does note that the specimen looked like no other reptile known from the Carboniferous. He also discussed the ribs of the animal and noting how they were long, cylindrical, curved and very robust, reminding him of both Ichthyosaurus and Mesosaurus. Also, he had difficulties in trying to determine the position of Stereosternum, reporting that some characteristic point it into <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> or into Sauropterygia. The specimen that Cope had at the time contained only the posterior half of the animal and so he could not make a decision on whether to place it in Reptiles or in Batrachia. He also made some measurements of the different elements within the fossil, as well as noting the phalangeal formula, going from digits 2-6, as 4-4-4-3.|$|E
5000|$|Günther {{was born}} in Esslingen in Swabia (Württemberg). His father was a Stiftungs-Commissar in Esslingen {{and his mother was}} Eleonora Nagel. He {{initially}} schooled at the Stuttgart Gymnasium. His family wished him to train for the ministry of the Lutheran Church for which he moved to the University of Tübingen. A brother shifted from theology to medicine, and he, too, turned to science and medicine at Tübingen in 1852. His first work was [...] "Ueber den Puppenzustand eines Distoma". He graduated in medicine with an M.D. from Tübingen in 1858, the same year in which he published a handbook of zoology for students of medicine. His mother moved to England, and when he visited the country in 1855, he met John Edward Gray and Professor Richard Owen at the British Museum. This led to an offer to work at the British Museum in 1857, where his first task was to classify 2000 snake specimens. After the death of John Edward Gray in 1875, Günther was appointed Keeper of Zoology at the Natural History Museum, a position he held until 1895. The major work of his life was the eight-volume Catalogue of Fishes (1859-1870, Ray Society). He also worked on the reptiles and amphibians in the museum collection. In 1864, he founded the Record of Zoological Literature and served as editor for six years. He was one of the editors for the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for more than thirty years. His landmark paper on tuatara anatomy was the first to establish that the tuatara reptile was not a lizard and in fact the only living member of an entirely new group of reptiles which he named <b>Rhynchocephalia.</b> Fossil and genetic evidence have subsequently confirmed Günther's assertion and the tuatara is now recognised as the only living member of a once diverse lineage that shared a common ancestor with Squamata (lizards and snakes) over 240 million years ago.|$|E
40|$|The tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) is {{the only}} living {{representative}} of <b>Rhynchocephalia,</b> a group of small vertebrates that originated about 250 million years ago. The tuatara {{has been referred to}} as a living fossil; however, the group to which it belongs included a much greater diversity of forms in the Mesozoic. We explore the morphological diversity of <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> and stem lepidosaur relatives (Sphenodon plus 13 fossil relatives) by employing a combination of geometric morphometrics and comparative methods. Geometric morphometrics is used to explore cranium size and shape at interspecific scale, while comparative methods are employed to test association between skull shape and size and tooth number after taking phylogeny into account. Two phylogenetic topologies have been considered to generate a phylomorphospace and quantify the phylogenetic signal in skull shape data, the ancestral state reconstruction as well as morphological disparity using disparity through time plots (DTT). <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> exhibit a significant phylogenetic signal in skull shape that compares well with that computed for other extinct vertebrate groups. A consistent form of allometry has little impact on skull shape evolution while the number of teeth significantly correlates with skull shape also after taking phylogeny into account. The ancestral state reconstruction demonstrates a dramatic shape difference between the skull of Sphenodon and its much larger Cretaceous relative Priosphenodon. Additionally, DTT demonstrates that skull shape disparity is higher between rather than within clades while the opposite applies to skull size and number of teeth. These results were not altered by the use of competing phylogenic hypotheses. <b>Rhynchocephalia</b> evolved as a morphologically diverse group with a dramatic radiation in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic about 200 million years ago. Differences in size are not marked between species whereas changes in number of teeth are associated with co-ordinated shape changes in the skull to accommodate larger masticatory muscles. These results show that the tuatara is not the product of evolutionary stasis but that it represents the only survivor of a diverse Mesozoic radiation whose subsequent decline remains to be explained.
