25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the <b>radio</b> <b>transceiver.</b> The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
500|$|An {{advance party}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron from RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, moved to Onslow in August 1951 with heavy {{construction}} equipment, taking {{the train to}} Geraldton and then the road to Onslow. This was then transported to the Monte Bello Islands. A prefabricated hut was taken across by Karangai, along with equipment for establishing a meteorological station. Other materiel was moved from Onslow to the islands in [...] lots in an ALC-40 landing craft manned by the Australian Army and towed by Karangai. This included two 25-ton bulldozers, a grader, tip trucks, portable generators, [...] water tanks and a mobile <b>radio</b> <b>transceiver.</b> The hut was erected, and the meteorological station henceforth manned by an RAAF officer and four assistants. Roads and landings were constructed, and camp sites established.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from a {{standard}} <b>radio</b> <b>transceiver</b> {{and a computer}} with a sound card, very little equipment is required to use PSK31. [...] Normally, an older computer and a few cables will suffice, and many PSK31 software applications are free. Many operators now use a commercially available interface/modem device (or [...] "nomic") between their computers and radios. [...] These devices incorporate the necessary impedance matching and sound level adjustment to permit the sound card output to be injected into the microphone input, send the radio's audio output to the sound card input, and handle the radio's transmit-receive switching.|$|E
2500|$|The Model Bs {{received}} by Chennault and assembled in Burma {{at the end}} of 1941 were not well liked. There were no auxiliary fuel tanks that could be dropped before going into combat, and there were no bomb racks on the wings. [...] Chennault considered the liquid-cooled engine vulnerable in combat because a single bullet through the coolant tank would cause the engine to overheat in minutes. [...] The Tomahawks also had no radios, so the AVG improvised by installing a fragile <b>radio</b> <b>transceiver,</b> RCA-7-H, which had been built for a Piper Cub. [...] Because the plane lacked a supercharger, its effective ceiling was about 25,000 feet. The most critical problem was the lack of spare parts; the only source of spare parts was damaged aircraft. The planes were thought to be what no one else wanted, dangerous and difficult to fly. But the plane had advantages: its gas tanks were self-sealing and could take hits without catching fire. There were two heavy sheets of steel behind the pilot's head and back. The plane as a whole was ruggedly constructed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} phase-noise estimation and mitigation in full-duplex <b>radio</b> <b>transceivers.</b> It has been shown before that the phase-noise {{is one of the}} most critical factors limiting the self-interference suppression performance in full-duplex <b>radio</b> <b>transceivers.</b> In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for the phase-noise estimation and mitigation. The algorithm has high estimation quality and low computational complexity, and it does not require synchronization of the useful and self-interference signals, so it is applicable also in long-range communications. The performance of the algorithm is then evaluated and compared to the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithm with extensive computer simulations.
