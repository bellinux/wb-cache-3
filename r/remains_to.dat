5|$|A 1940 {{expedition}} by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more {{fossils of}} giant crocodilians, {{this time from}} Big Bend National Park in Texas. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name Phobosuchus riograndensis. Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> Deinosuchus, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.|$|E

5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{the vacant}} {{site of the}} former synagogue {{was used as a}} {{makeshift}} volleyball court.

The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E

Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome and the next day she was laid to rest in the crypt of the Russian church in Florence. After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} a courtyard, {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep.

5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter.

5|$|However, the {{rebellion}} of Justo José de Urquiza against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat {{at the battle}} of Caseros and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Martín's <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> Buenos Aires. Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Martín, despite the conflict. Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the state of Buenos Aires, dominated by Unitarians who despised San Martín. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.|$|E
