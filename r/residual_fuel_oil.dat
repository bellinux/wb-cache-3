5000|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>fuels</b> are the [...] "dregs" [...] of the {{distillation}} process {{and are a}} thicker, heavier oil, or oil with higher viscosity, which are so thick {{that they are not}} readily pumpable unless heated. <b>Residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> are cheaper than clean, refined diesel oil, although they are dirtier. Their main considerations are for use in ships and very large generation sets, due to the cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, frequently amounting to many tonnes per hour. The poorly refined biofuels straight vegetable oil (SVO) and waste vegetable oil (WVO) can fall into this category, but can be viable fuels on non-common rail or TDI PD diesels with the simple conversion of fuel heating to 80 to 100 degrees Celsius to reduce viscosity, and adequate filtration to OEM standards. Engines using these heavy oils have to start and shut down on standard diesel fuel, as these fuels will not flow through fuel lines at low temperatures. Moving beyond that, use of low-grade fuels can lead to serious maintenance problems because of their high sulphur and lower lubrication properties. Most diesel engines that power ships like supertankers are built so that the engine can safely use low-grade fuels due to their separate cylinder and crankcase lubrication.|$|R
50|$|Water {{continuous}} (oil-in-water) emulsified fuels are {{exemplified by}} the Orimulsion system and bitumen emulsions.

Water continuous emulsions of very heavy crudes, bitumen are easier to pump than the original fuel, which would require considerable heating and / or dilution with a distilled product (kerosene or light crude) in order to make them easy to handle. Water continuous emulsions of <b>residual</b> <b>fuel,</b> heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> etc. which have a calorific value and are used in industrial applications can also be converted to emulsified fuels, thus reducing the need to use cutter fluids and improving the combustion emissions associated with the inferior fuels.|$|R

50|$|The {{running of}} all {{internal}} combustion engines {{is dependent on}} the ignition quality of the fuel. For spark-ignition engines the fuel has an octane rating.

For <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> two other empirical indexes are used CII and Calculated Carbon Aromaticity Index (CCAI).

40|$|Abstract—Some {{aspects of}} the formation, control and {{dispersion}} of atmospheric pollution from fossil fuels are considered, especially the variation of concentration {{in time and space}} with weather and topography, the summation and interaction of many pollutants from various sources, and the large spatial scale involved. POLLUTANTS FORMED FROM FUEL FOSSIL fuels are responsible for most of the tonnage of air pollutants and much of the damage they cause. In weight, the main products are water and carbon dioxide; the latter has attracted interest because its "greenhouse " effect is important in the heat balance of the Earth. Man-made climatic changes of this type would be difficult to detect, however, because of natural fluctuations and the complicated feedback processes involved (SAWYER, 1972). Sulphur dioxide is an important pollutant. The sulphur content of fuels shows a wide range, from negligible amounts in gas up to several per cent in some coals and <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> The amounts of other pollutants depend greatly on the management of combustion, i. e. on the details and interactions of atomisation, flow pattern, mixing...|$|R

The fuel change reduced emissions of PM mass up to 67 %. The number of particles emitted remained unchanged and were dominated by nanoparticles. Furthermore, the fuel change resulted in an 80 % reduction of SO 2 emissions and decreased emissions of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emissions of both monoaromatic and lighter polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds increased with RMB 30, while the heavy, PM-bound PAH species that belong to the carcinogenic PAH family were reduced. Emissions of BC remained similar between the two fuels. This study indicates that the use of low-sulfur <b>residual</b> marine <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> is a way to comply with the new FSC regulation and will reduce the anthropogenic load of SO 2 emissions and secondary PM formed from SO 2, Emissions of primary particles, however, remain unchanged and do not decrease as much as would be expected if distilled fuel was used. This applies both to the number of particles emitted and some toxic components, such as heavy metals, PAHs or elemental carbon (EC). The micro-composition analyses showed that the soot particles emitted from RMB 30 combustion often do not have any trace of sulfur compared with particles from HFO combustion, which always have a sulfur content over 1 %m/m. The soot sulfur content can impact aging and cloud condensation properties.

It is often used as a backup fuel for peaking power plants in case the supply of natural gas is interrupted or as the main fuel for small electrical generators. In Europe, the use of diesel is generally restricted to cars (about 40%), SUVs (about 90%), and trucks and buses (virtually all). The market for home heating using fuel oil, called heating oil, has decreased due to the widespread penetration of natural gas as well as heat pumps. However, it is very common in some areas, such as the Northeastern United States.Residual fuel oil is less useful because it is so viscous {{that it has to be}} heated with a special heating system before use and it may contain relatively high amounts of pollutants, particularly sulfur, which forms sulfur dioxide upon combustion.

40|$|Since 1 st of January 2015 ships {{operating}} in sulphur emission control areas (SECAs) {{have to use}} marine fuels with a fuel sulphur content less than 0. 1 %m/m. This regulation forces the ship owners to make a fuel shift and use low-sulphur marine <b>fuel</b> <b>oils,</b> use alternative <b>fuels</b> or use scrubbers on-board their ships. One {{driving force behind the}} regulation of the fuel sulphur content was to reduce the emissions to air of harmful particles. This thesis focuses on the two first strategies and evaluate how fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics affect the particle emissions. This thesis presents results from particle measurements done in test-bed engine labs and on-board operating ships, with focus on number, mass and sizes of the emitted particles. The on-board measurements considered how a fuel shift from a heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> to a low-sulphur <b>residual</b> marine <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and how use of an alternative fuel, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG) affect the particle emissions. In the test-bed engine measurements the particle emissions from different types of fuels and the effects of fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics, primarily the content of aromatics, were investigated. The results highlight that reduced fuel sulphur contents will not be the only solution for reducing particle emissions, and other fuel characteristics need to be considered. The fuel sulphur content influences the emissions of particles with a diameter of 50 nm or less, whereas other fuel characteristics affect particles in all sizes. An increased content of aromatics did not result in increasing particle emissions, which indicate that the content of aromatics may not play a crucial role with respect to particle emissions from ships. Furthermore, the fuel shift strategy and changing from heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> to a low-sulphur <b>residual</b> marine <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> did not affect the number of particles emitted significantly: similar amounts of number of particles were emitted and there was an increase in the emissions of smaller particles. In contrast, the strategy of using an alternative fuel, here LNG, resulted in significant reductions of the particle emissions.
