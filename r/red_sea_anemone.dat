500|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are a {{group of}} marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria.

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> species are {{commensal}} with other organisms.

Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the <b>sea</b> <b>anemone.</b> Despite their venomous cells, <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs.

40|$|Background: Since {{the first}} report of a dog that {{developed}} severe systemic symptoms {{in response to a}} sec-ond injection of <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> toxin by Richet and Portier in 1902, no clear human cases of anaphylaxis related to exposure to <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> has been reported in the literature. Methods: A 24 -year-old man with an episode of local urticaria on his first contact with a <b>sea</b> <b>anemone</b> (Sticho-dactyla haddoni), developed dyspnea, severe urticaria and hypotension on exposure to water containing the dead bodies of the organism. To study whether this reaction was mediated by antigen-specific IgE, we per-formed a histamine release test with blood, Western blotting with serum and lymphocyte proliferating test with peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patient, for the homogenate of <b>sea</b> <b>anemones.</b> Results: The homogenate of <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> induced histamine release from the blood of the patient, but it also induced histamine release from the blood of control subjects. Moreover, it also caused hemolysis of blood of all donors. However, Western-blotting demonstrated the presence of an 86 kd protein-specific IgE in the se-rum of the patient. Conclusions: Protein antigen (s) in <b>sea</b> <b>anemones</b> may cause anaphylactic shock {{under the influence of the}} cytolytic effects andor lymphocyte-stimulating activity elicited by the toxin of <b>sea</b> <b>anemones...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>anemones</b> {{are common}} on reefs.
