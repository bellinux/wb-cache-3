50|$|Canis latrans harriscrooki (Slaughter, 1961) was a Late Pleistocene coyote {{that once}} {{inhabited}} {{what is now}} Texas. Slaughter described it as being wolf-like and was distinguished from other coyotes by a well-developed posterior cusp on its p2 (the second premolar on its mandible), a longer tooth row relative to the depth of its mandible, a <b>reduced</b> <b>distance</b> between premolars, and a more vertical descending ramus. The cusp dentition was also found in two specimens from Mexico and one from Honduras. Slaughter identified some affinity with C. l. hondurensis. Nowak proposed the hypothesis that a warm-adapted coyote that was more wolf-like than modern coyotes once inhabited Pleistocene Texas and might still be represented by C.l. hondurensis.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} such systems, however, is a {{complicated}} task. There are two main challenges in realizingmixed-signal ICs. The first challenging task, specific to RFICs, is to fabricate good on-chip passive elementssuch as high-Q inductors. The second challenging task, applicable to any mixed-signal IC and the subjectof this chapter, is to minimize noise coupling between {{various parts of the}} system to avoid any malfunctioningof the system. In other words, for successful system-on-chip integration of mixed-signal systems, thenoise coupling caused by nonideal isolation must be minimized so that sensitive analog circuits and noisy digital circuits can effectively coexist, and the system operates correctly. To elaborate, note that in mixed-signalcircuits, both sensitive analog circuits and high-swing high-frequency noise injector digital circuits may bepresent on the same chip, leading to undesired signal coupling between these two types of circuit via the conductive substrate. The <b>reduced</b> <b>distance</b> between these circuits, which is the result of constant technology scaling (see Moore's law and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors),exacerbates the coupling. The problem is severe, since signals of different nature and strength interfere,thus affecting the overall performance, which demands higher clock rates and greater analogprecisions.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} in sound source localization has helped increase the robustness of estimates to noise and reverberation. Circular arrays {{are of particular}} interest {{for a number of}} scenarios, particularly because they can be placed {{in the center of the}} sources. First, that improves the sound capture due to the <b>reduced</b> <b>distance.</b> Second, it helps on the direction estimation, not only because of the <b>reduced</b> <b>distance,</b> but also because it increases the angle differences. Nevertheless, most research on circular arrays focused on the case of omni-directional microphones. In this paper we present a new algorithm for sound source localization developed specifically for directional microphones.

40|$|The linear dextrin {{amylodextrin}} {{was prepared}} by enzymatic hydrolysis from waxy maize. Four metastable amylodextrins were prepared by complexation with different volatile organic compounds.

X-ray diffractometry revealed a helical conformation with six glucose units per turn for amylodextrin and metastable amylodextrins prepared with small molecules, and a helical conformation with seven glucose units per turn for metastable amylodextrins prepared with larger molecules. All metastable amylodextrins showed a helix with <b>reduced</b> <b>distance</b> between two turns as compared to amylodextrin. Metastable amylose, prepared from Amylose V, showed a helical conformation again with a <b>reduced</b> <b>distance</b> between two turns compared to Amylose V.
