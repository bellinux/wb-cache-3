Israel's Employment Law (1988) prohibits discrimination – in hiring, working conditions, promotion, professional training or studies, discharge or severance pay, and benefits and payments provided for employees in connection with their <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> <b>employment</b> – due to race, religion, nationality, and land of origin, among other reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Anything {{required}} by the character or substance of the position or job {{is not to be}} deemed discriminatory by the law. Prohibition of discrimination applies to hiring, working conditions, promotion, professional training or studies, discharge or severance pay and benefits and payments provided for employees in connection with their <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> <b>employment.</b> The law was enacted in 1988, and replaced an earlier 1981 law. [...] The law further provides that, under certain conditions, provisions in an enactment, collective agreement or employment contract made in connection with maternity are not to be considered discriminatory. It also provides that any rights given to working mothers are to be given equally to working fathers, under certain conditions. Protection from sexual harassment is addressed in section 7, which states that an employer shall not [...] "act against" [...] an employee who rejects, or opposes, any act of a sexual nature committed by the employer or by the supervisor of the employee.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{commentary}} is {{to present}} and briefly discuss {{an alternative to the}} traditional life-course retirement model. We explore the idea that paid retirement could be spread throughout workers’ adult lives to accommodate personal and family needs, wishes and circumstances, rather than being concentrated exclusively {{at the end of a}} person’s life. A legal framework could be introduced – without noticeable increases in public spending – that would contribute to overcoming the social exclusion many people experience on forced <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> <b>employment,</b> as well as the gender inequalities that stem from reconciling the work–life balance...|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} social {{integrity}} is {{emphasized in the}} role function mode. When human beings adapt to various role changes that occur throughout a lifetime, they are adapting in this mode. According to Hanson (1984), the family’s role can be assessed by observing the communication patterns in the family. Assessment should include how decisions are reached, the roles and communication patterns of the members, how role changes are tolerated, {{and the effectiveness of}} communication (Hanson, 1984). For example, when a couple adjusts their lifestyle appropriately following <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> full-time <b>employment,</b> they are adapting in this mode.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} makes {{a distinction}} between ‘voluntary’ and ‘involuntary’ early retirement, where ‘involuntary’ early <b>retirement</b> results <b>from</b> <b>employment</b> constraints rather than from a preference for leisure relative to work. This article analyses ‘voluntary’ and ‘involuntary’ early retirement based on international microdata covering 19 industrialized countries. The results show that ‘involuntary’ early retirement is particularly widespread in Continental Europe. Countries facing economic recessions and having strict employment protection legislation have higher shares of ‘involuntary’ retirements among early retirees. Generous early retirement provisions {{of the social security}} system do not only make ‘voluntary’ early retirement more attractive for individuals, but also induce firms to push more employees to retire early...|$|R

40|$|Adjustment to <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> gainful <b>employment</b> {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as one of the major adaptive tasks of later life. The degree to which this adjustment is successful often plays a major role in determining the extent to which an individual finds his later years satisfying and rewarding. In a complex technical society retirement does not consist of a relatively simple change in status from the role of worker to that of nonworker, but has important interpersonal and intrapersonal implications that affect the retired person's personal and social existence. This monograph describes the results of a study of compulsory retirement among urban males and females. The data reported are largely concerned with the prediction and nature of responses to the retirement event, and implications of these for the development of preretirement programs.

40|$|There is no abrupt {{change in}} physiology, {{pathology}} or pharmacology occurring at {{or around the}} age of 65 years. There is some evidence {{of a change in}} the effect of illness, and of the prevalence of disability with advancing age. However, these changes are individual and gradual, and more associated with passing 75 - 80 years rather than 65. The main change occurring in the seventh decade arises <b>from</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> paid <b>employment,</b> and is therefore financial. Hence, in contrast to personal financial support, Health and Social Services departments would be ill advised to use the age of 65 as a threshold. Age-related admission policies may perpetuate ageism, and needs-related policies may therefore be preferable. The challenge facing departments of geriatric medicine and psychiatry is to present their services attractively to patients, carers and purchasers, who need to recognize the rationale for the purchase of these forms of care, with reference not only to benefit to patients, but also to their informal carers...|$|R

40|$|This phenomenological {{research}} study explored {{the experiences of}} educational administrators in the transition from their administrative responsibilities into retirement. The study was guided by a grand tour question addressed by three sub-questions. Data collected during the individual interviews with 10 retired educational administrators provided the basic understanding of the issues and lived experiences as they transition into <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> fulltime <b>employment</b> as educational administrators to retirees from the State of Alabama educational system. An analysis of interview data revealed four themes regarding the perceptions and lived experiences of recently retired K- 12 educational administrators from the State of Alabama. These four major themes were (a) finances, (b) pressures, (c), self-importance, and (d) health issues. The experiences of recently retired participants showed economic issues {{have a profound effect}} upon retirees, especially when they are unfavorable, and the absence of workplace activity may well lead to decreased self-worth and insecurity. Either or both, and in isolation or combination with other factors can impact their mental and physical health. The participants expressed a desire for all educational administrators to prepare earlier for retirement, attend retirement planning seminars and utilize family to successfully transition into retirement. The {{research study}} was not without limitations and further research on the topic was recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} present-day Australia is {{the large number of}} baby boomers – those born between 1946 and 1965 – who are retiring or approaching <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> paid <b>employment.</b> Just as the baby boomers’ previous major life events, such as being employed and childbearing, have significantly impacted on Australia’s economy and society, so too will their transition to post-employment life. It is therefore surprising that such little is known about baby boomers and their transition from working life to retirement.   This report fills this research gap by examining the transition from a range of perspectives: the process of retiring and how this impacts on wellbeing and unpaid productivity in retirement, how people prepare for retirement and how this may impact on quality of life, and how retirees experiences compare with workers’ expectation of retirement. The report also analyses how retirement expectations are shaped by the economic, social and policy context in Australia, and how it compares with the US. Notable findings from the report include that good health, economic resources, and personal autonomy are very important in influencing how baby boomers transition, prepare and experience retirement. Further, baby boomers {{have been shown to be}} adaptable to challenging and changing economic and social conditions, such as the Global Financial Crisis and increasing longevity. This is the final NSPAC report from the Ageing Baby Boomer...|$|R

Final comments reflect on 3 relevant themes: the importance of the subjective experience, the dynamic nature of personal relationships in later life, and the control of older people over their relationships. Several topics are suggested for future research such as the continuing prevalence of age segregation in modern societies, tensions in personal relationships brought about by various transitions such as <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> paid <b>employment,</b> and the consideration of whether and how intervention programs can be implemented to foster positive social relationships as a useful tool for helping people face challenges arising in later life. In conclusion, it is noted that older people can draw on a longer span of relationship experiences, qualifying them to be proficient managers and designers of well suited personal living arrangements...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} and social function of life insurance companies in the United States is to provide financial security to individuals and families on a sound basis and at prices commensurate with the risks assumed. Life companies offer such security {{to the public in}} three distinct forms. First, life insurance offers protection against the financial risk of premature death of a breadwinner and the loss of income to the surviving family. Second, annuities and pension plans protect against the risk of outliving other forms of income, particularly after <b>retirement</b> <b>from</b> active <b>employment.</b> Third, health insurance offers protection against the financial strain of costly accidents or illness requiring extensive medical treatment. In serving these needs, life insurers also have long been a major source of long-term funds to the capital market through the investment of reserves in a variety of financial outlets. At the end of 1990, the total assets of U. S. life insurance companies aggregated $ 1, 408 billion, with 41 percent in corporate debt obligations, 19 percent in mortgage loans, 13 percent in Treasury and agency securities, 8 percent in common stock, 4 percent in policy loans, 3 percent in real estate, and 12 percent in miscellaneous assets. At latest count, there were 2, 343 life insurance companies in the United States, of which 118 were mutual companies and the remainder were stock companies. It is estimated that about 1, 200 of these companies are actually in operation; the others have been chartered but do not carry on an active current business.
