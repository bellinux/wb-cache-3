500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} half, Mönchengladbach's flurry of shots on goal didn't stop. Heynckes and Carsten Nielsen {{had made it}} 8–0 by the hour mark, at which time Otto Rehhagel had asked Sigfried Held to warm-up {{and get ready to}} go onto the pitch, but Held declined, saying: [...] "Coach, do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can make a {{difference}} to the outcome of the game?"

2500|$|Smith {{is widely}} {{known for his}} strong {{resemblance}} to actor and comedian Will Ferrell, who is almost six years his junior, which he has acknowledged by wearing shirts reading [...] "I Am Not Will Ferrell" [...] in live performances. Smith said that the two first met during the premiere of the film The Ladies Man. He said, [...] "I'm looking at Will and thinking, 'People <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> look like him?

2500|$|Despite winning on the undercard, a {{fight between}} Briggs and Haye didn't materialize. Brigg's {{continued}} to call out Haye, asking him to honor {{his end of the}} agreement.
