5|$|Many {{species of}} Apatosaurus have been {{designated}} from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, {{which resulted in}} many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus. They found that A.louisae was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a polytomy of A.ajax, A.parvus, and A.excelsus. Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus slightly differently, and also supported separating Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus.
