In this review, we discuss important aspects of liposomal research with a focus on the use of <b>radiolabeled</b> liposomes and their potential role in drug delivery and monitoring therapeutic effects.

Evaluation of the risks, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity is necessary to meet pharmaceutical and commercial requirements. It remains to be demonstrated whether the results found in animal studies translate to humans before <b>radiolabeled</b> liposomes can be implemented into clinical practice...|$|R

Because of the way 18F-FDG is metabolized by tissues, it results in intense <b>radiolabelling</b> in most cancers, such as brain and liver tumors.

5000|$|... 2-Bromo-LSD, {{also known}} as BOL-148, is a {{derivative}} of lysergic acid invented by Albert Hofmann, {{as part of the}} original research from which the closely related compound LSD was also derived. 2-bromo-LSD was found to be inactive as a psychedelic and so was comparatively little researched for many years, although its similar behavior in the body made it useful for <b>radiolabelling</b> studies. It was found to bind to many of the same receptor targets as LSD, but acting as a neutral antagonist rather than an agonist. However its generally similar behavior to LSD in some respects has shown to be very useful in one specific area, the treatment of cluster headaches. These debilitating attacks have been known for some time to be amenable to treatment with certain hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin, but because of the illegal status of these drugs and the kind of mental changes they induce, research into their medical use has been slow and therapeutic application limited to very specific circumstances under strict supervision. It had been thought that this specific therapeutic action against cluster headaches was limited to hallucinogenic drugs of this type, and would always present a major barrier to their clinical use. However a serendipitous discovery found that 2-bromo-LSD is also able to produce this therapeutic effect, despite lacking the other effects of LSD. This has led to a resurgence of interest and research into 2-bromo-LSD and its possible medical uses. Some isolated incidents of hallucinogenic responses have been reported, but as with other non-hallucinogenic LSD analogues such as lisuride, this appears to be a rare side effect occurring only in individuals with an as yet unexplained susceptibility to this reaction.|$|E

These compounds are reviewed from the genesis of apoptosis (cell death) imaging agents up to recent years.

40|$|Studies of the {{metabolism}} {{and distribution of}} lung surfactant are aided by use of <b>radiolabeled</b> surfactant or surfactant components. These studies have often made use of [3 H]- or [14 C]phosphatidylcholine. Analysis of the lung content of surfactant containing these beta-emitting labels usually requires tissue digestion, use of scintillation fluids, and significant correction for quenching of photon production. Because use of a gamma-emitting isotope would obviate these requirements, we have investigated the use of 3 -(trifluoromethyl) - 3 -(m-[125 I]iodophenyl) diazirine ([125 I]TID), a lipophilic photoactivatable compound, to <b>radiolabel</b> pulmonary surfactant. Our results indicate that, during photoactivation, products of [125 I]TID are produced that result in <b>radiolabeling</b> of both the lipid and protein components of extracted porcine surfactant. Separation of <b>radiolabeled</b> surfactant from hydrophobic nonlabelling photolysis products was accomplished by gel chromatography. Exposure of surfactant (34 mumol/ml) to [125 I]TID under labeling conditions resulted in incorporation of 45. 3 +/- 5. 1 % of the <b>radiolabel.</b> Incorporation of <b>radiolabel</b> in the various phospholipids of lung surfactant was approximately equivalent. Lipophilic surfactant apoproteins were also <b>radiolabeled.</b> Finally, both in vitro and in vivo testing of <b>radiolabeled</b> surfactant (0. 1 microCi/mg) revealed full retention of surface tension lowering ability...|$|R

Moreover, <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin, B subunit, and α chain preparations retained substantial ability to bind to intestinal mucosal homogenates. The minimal amount of antitoxin detectable with <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin was 0. 04 antitoxin units/ml. Substitution of <b>radiolabeled</b> B subunit, A subunit, and α chain for <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin decreased the sensitivity of the test. <b>Radiolabeled</b> γ chain did not bind to the antitoxin preparation. Competitive inhibition studies, with titrated anti-choleragen serum and <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin or components, indicated that the minimum concentration of toxin detectable was 7. 0 × 10 − 8 μmol/ml at a 90 % inhibition level. The A subunit and α chain preparations inhibited the binding of the <b>radiolabeled</b> B subunit to antitoxin sites. Conversely, B subunit inhibited the binding of <b>radiolabeled</b> A subunit and α chain to antitoxin. The γ chain did not show any reaction with antitoxin or cross-reaction with either whole toxin or its components.
