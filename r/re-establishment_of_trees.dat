50|$|Planting in Britain is {{commonly}} referred to as restocking, when it takes place on land that has recently been harvested. When occurring on previously unforested land it is known as new planting. Under the British system, in order to acquire the necessary permissions to clearcut, the landowner must agree a management plan with the Forestry Commission (the regulatory body for all things forestry) which must include proposals for the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> cover on the land. Planting contractors will be engaged by the landowner/management company, a contract drawn up and work will typically take place from November to April when most of the transplants are dormant.|$|R

50|$|The {{goals for}} {{treatment}} of the park included the preservation of historic site patterns, site features, structures, site remnants, and vegetation. Other works included {{the restoration of the}} definitive edges of the park spaces and <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> groves, paths, and, topography defining the open spaces. Preservation of the perimeter road as a significant landscape characteristic, modified to reflect bicycle and pedestrian use of the road, {{was also one of the}} recommendations. Landscape features such as, meadow areas in the park were to be restored with native grasses and wildflowers to reduce water consumption. The lake shore restoration was intended to focus on historic lake design and rehabilitation of City Ditch to convey historic flows. Other goals included the reuse of irrigation water through city ditch system and water-saving measures for swimming pool, showers, faucets, and so on. Most of the conservation practices address the conflicts between pedestrian, bicyclists and motorist, park plant diversity, and water quality issues.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Over {{the past}} 17 years, sound ecologically based {{research}} into impacts {{has provided the}} information necessary, while changes in legislative policy have provided the impetus, to employ strategies for mitigation of the impacts of roads and highways through rainforest ecosystems. Such strategies include: road designs that avoid rainforest habitat or rehabilitation of habitat previously disturbed by redundant linear infrastructure; the maintenance or <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> rainforest <b>tree</b> canopy above narrow roads and the identification and planting <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> species that create canopy over wider roads without dropping branches; the minimization of clearing width; engineering solutions for connectivity of habitat that include canopy bridges for arboreal animals and underpasses with furniture for cover or bridges that retain habitat underneath for terrestrial wildlife; the erection of powerlines or road bridges above the canopy. Collaboration between researchers, road authorities, government agencies and conservation groups has applied this research to upgrades of several roads and powerlines through Wet Tropics rainforest. Serial modifications of road designs and funding from Queensland Department of Main Roads (QDMR) for research into knowledge gaps ensured best practice environmental outcomes based on the latest research. The accumulated knowledge base is applicable to roads through rainforests throughout the world...|$|R
40|$|All or {{a part of}} a {{sequence}} of forest practices (i. e., salvage logging, site preparation, planting crop trees, and weeding) has been implemented after natural disturbances for the rapid <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> cover. Forest policies in Japan have recently changed from monocultural planting <b>of</b> coniferous crop <b>trees</b> to planting native broadleaved trees to restore forests and nurture local biodiversity following large windthrows. However, the effects of this new practice on preserving biodiversity, as well as the effects of legacy retention, have never been verified in Asia. Thus, the objective of our research was to compare the effects of legacy retention with plantation after salvaging on the initial stage of vegetation recovery in a blowdown area, specifically focusing on plant species diversity, the occurrence of alien species, and the composition of plant species. Following the analysis of our results, we finally describe appropriate practices to alter disturbed coniferous plantations to bring the species composition closer to that of the original natural mixed forests. A control (A, legacy retention) and three experimental treatment sites (B, salvage logged, site prepared, and Quercus crispula seedlings planted; C, same as B, but weeded once during the summer; and D, residual rows that emerged after establishing sites for planting) were prepared, and quadrats were set. Eleven indicators of the ground condition and the number of vascular plant species, including ferns, were quantified, and the number and abundance of residual and newly colonized plants of the main woody species were estimated. Our main findings were as follows: (1) in unsalvaged sites and residual rows, the diversity of plant species was poor, but a variety of plant species compositions were observed due to the heterogeneous conditions of the ground and ample residual plants; (2) in the planting site, many species appeared, but little variety of the species composition was observed due to the homogeneous condition of the ground and the destruction of residual plants; (3) a large number of alien species emerged in broad, unvegetated areas; (4) the impact of site preparation overwhelmed the impact of salvage logging on the initial recovery of plant species; and (5) to restore a natural mixed forest, a combination of legacy retention and plantation after salvaging would be the most appropriate...|$|R
