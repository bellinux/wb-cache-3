5|$|John Bachman {{discovered}} the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> in 1816, {{and it was}} formally described in 1837. Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s, mainly from Florida, but disagreement exists over their validity. The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species, the silver <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> (Oryzomys argentatus). Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west, {{which suggests that the}} western populations may be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. The species is part of the genus Oryzomys, which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America, some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat.</b> One, Oryzomys couesi, occurs with the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> in Tamaulipas and southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that <b>rice</b> <b>rats</b> {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rats</b> did not show hoarding behavior, but wild <b>rice</b> <b>rats</b> have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|R

5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat.</b> O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat.</b> In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat,</b> and accordingly included the former in the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat.</b> While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus, {{also known}} as the Nicaraguan oryzomys, Thomas's <b>rice</b> <b>rat,</b> or Nicaraguan <b>rice</b> <b>rat,</b> is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of the family Cricetidae. It is known from only three specimens, all {{collected}} in southeastern Nicaragua since 1904. Placed in Nectomys upon its discovery, it was later classified in its own subgenus of Oryzomys and finally recognized as closely related to other species now placed in Oryzomys, including the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> and Oryzomys couesi, which occurs in the same region.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat.</b> In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E

500|$|Marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rats</b> {{are active}} during the night, so are rarely seen, {{although}} they may {{be among the most}} common small mammals in part of their range. They build nests of sedge and grass, about [...] large, which are placed under debris, near shrubs, in short burrows, or high in aquatic vegetation. They may also use old nests of marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) or round-tailed muskrats (Neofiber alleni). Marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rats</b> sometimes make large runways or dig burrows.

5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges of the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat,</b> a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies of the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat.</b> Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat,</b> together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat's</b> diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles.

5|$|In 2010, Delton Hanson {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study of}} the relationships among populations of Oryzomys on the basis of data from three genes—the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2). The Cytb data placed all marsh rice rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O.couesi; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11.30%. The marsh rice rats fell into two main groups, differing on average by 6.05%, one containing animals from Mississippi, southwestern Tennessee, and further west, and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east. Within the eastern group, variation was only about 0.65%, though examples of the putative subspecies O. p. palustris, O. p. coloratus, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. planirostris were all included. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed a Costa Rican population within the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> than to the O.couesi group. The combined data supported the western and eastern clades within the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the western populations of the marsh <b>rice</b> <b>rat</b> be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. They recommended further research in the Mississippi–Alabama–Tennessee region, where the ranges of the two meet.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of its range, the species often occurs with the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), but no evidence shows they compete with each other.
