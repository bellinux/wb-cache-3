40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between the results of <b>routine</b> <b>inspections</b> and foodborne outbreaks in restaurants, we conducted a matched case-control study using available data from Seattle-King County, Washington. Case restaurants were facilities with a reported foodborne outbreak between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1987 (N = 28). Two control restaurants with no reported outbreaks during this period were matched to each case restaurant on county health district and date of <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> (N = 56). Data from the <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> that preceded the outbreak (for case restaurants) or the date-matched <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> (for control restaurants) were abstracted from computerized inspection records. Case restaurants had a significantly lower mean inspection score (83. 8 on a 0 to 100 point scale) than control restaurants (90. 9). Restaurants with poor inspection scores and violations of proper temperature controls of potentially hazardous foods were, respectively, five and ten {{times more likely to}} have outbreaks than restaurants with better results. Although this study demonstrates that Seattle-King County's <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> form can successfully identify restaurants at increased risk of foodborne outbreaks, it also illustrates that more emphasis on regulation and education is needed to prevent outbreaks in restaurants with poor inspection results...|$|R

40|$|Growth and {{liberalization}} {{of world trade}} have increased the risks of introduction of quarantine plant pests into importing countries. Import inspection of incoming commodities is a major tool for prevention of pest introductions related to world trade, but inspection capacities are limited. This article develops a theoretical and an empirical model for the optimal allocation of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> for phytosanitary <b>inspection</b> of imported commodities when the inspecting agency has a limited capacity. It is shown that the optimal allocation of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> equalizes marginal costs of pest introduction across risky commodity pathways. The numerical illustration finds the optimal allocation of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> of chrysanthemum cuttings imported in the Netherlands. The numerical results suggest that "ceteris paribus", greater <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> should be allocated to pathways whose inspection yields a greater reduction in the expected costs of pest introduction. The numerical results also suggest that import inspection has a high marginal benefit. In particular, we found that each additional euro of the inspection capacity decreases the expected costs of pest introduction from 18 to 49 euros, depending on the initial inspection capacity.
