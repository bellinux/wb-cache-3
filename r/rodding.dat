5|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} hot <b>rodding</b> cars (modifying them to increase performance) {{is reflected in}} part by the creation of special-interest magazines catering to this culture. Hot Rod is the oldest such magazine, with first editor Wally Parks, and founded by Robert E. Petersen in 1948, with original publication by his Petersen Publishing Company. Hot Rod has licensed affiliation with Universal Technical Institute.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, signals {{controlling}} sidings {{were controlled}} by keys which simultaneously locked or unlocked the point levers. Thus {{there was no}} point <b>rodding.</b>|$|E
25|$|These 'batons' {{were known}} as rods to the British and {{had been used to}} solve the Spanish Enigma. Knox's <b>rodding</b> method was later used to break the Italian Naval Enigma.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>rods</b> are {{sophisticated}} casting tools {{fitted with}} line guides and a reel for line stowage. They are most commonly made of fibreglass, carbon fibre or, classically, bamboo. Fishing <b>rods</b> vary in action {{as well as}} length, {{and can be found}} in sizes between 24 inches and 20 feet. The longer the <b>rod,</b> the greater the mechanical advantage in casting. There are many different types of <b>rods,</b> such as fly <b>rods,</b> tenkara <b>rods,</b> spin and bait casting <b>rods,</b> spinning <b>rods,</b> ice <b>rods,</b> surf <b>rods,</b> sea <b>rods</b> and trolling <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Rod</b> blanks can be {{purchased}} with guide locations preset for the individual <b>rod</b> or placed by hand. <b>Rod</b> sections tend to be directional, wanting to flex in a certain direction over others. <b>Rod</b> builders usually test each <b>rod</b> section to find the point of greatest flex (aka spining the <b>rod)</b> so that guides can be aligned along it. With the placement around the <b>rod</b> determined, the <b>rod</b> builder next determines where {{along the length of}} the <b>rod</b> to place the guides. This is usually done by taping the guides onto the <b>rod,</b> stringing the <b>rod,</b> flexing it and moving each guide to achieve the best fit to the <b>rod's</b> natural flex.|$|R
30|$|There are two {{different}} failure modes (threaded <b>rod</b> tensile fracture and threaded <b>rod</b> pullout fracture) for glued-in <b>rods</b> on connection strength of bamboo glulam. In threaded <b>rod</b> tensile fracture mode, <b>rod</b> necking and tensile fracture of the threaded <b>rod</b> also were found. However, in threaded <b>rod</b> pullout fracture mode, interface shear failure of the bamboo glulam around the anchoring zone of the threaded <b>rod</b> happened. The mechanical performances and the failure modes of the glued-in <b>rod</b> materials are mainly influenced by the inherent base materials.|$|R
25|$|The {{watercourse}} {{is essential}} for the land drainage of this low-lying area, which {{is the responsibility of the}} Isle of Axholme & North Nottinghamshire Water Level Management Board, the successor body to the Isle of Axholme Internal Drainage Board. The Board undertakes maintenance tasks such as annual mowing and <b>rodding</b> of the drain.|$|E
25|$|Phillips was 12 {{years old}} {{during the filming}} of American Graffiti, and 13 when the movie was released. She was cast as Carol Morrison, a young girl accidentally picked up by hot <b>rodding</b> {{teenager}} John Milner (Paul Le Mat). Because of California state law, producer Gary Kurtz became Phillips' legal guardian {{for the duration of}} the filming.|$|E
25|$|At this time, another {{colorful}} {{character in}} Edwards' history, Pancho Barnes, built her renowned Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch {{that would be}} the scene of many parties and celebrations to come. The dry lake was a hive of hot <b>rodding,</b> with racing on the playa. The runway on which the Space Shuttle landed follows the route that hosted racing in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|At SL-1, control <b>rods</b> {{would get}} stuck in the control <b>rod</b> channel sporadically. Numerous {{procedures}} were conducted to evaluate control <b>rods</b> to ensure they were operating properly. There were <b>rod</b> drop tests and scram tests of each <b>rod,</b> in addition to periodic <b>rod</b> exercising and <b>rod</b> withdrawals for normal operation. From February 1959 to November 18, 1960, there were 40 cases of a stuck control <b>rod</b> for scram and <b>rod</b> drop tests and about a 2.5% failure rate. From November 18, 1960 to December 23, 1960, there was {{a dramatic increase in}} stuck <b>rods,</b> with 23 in that time period and a 13.0% failure rate. Besides these test failures, there were an additional 21 <b>rod</b> sticking incidents from February 1959 to December 1960; 4 of these had occurred in the last month of operation during routine <b>rod</b> withdrawal. The central control <b>rod,</b> No. 9, had the best operational performance record even though it was operated more frequently {{than any of the other}} <b>rods.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fly <b>rods</b> are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} carbon {{graphite}}. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep the <b>rod</b> from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). The <b>rod</b> tapers {{from one end to}} the other and the degree of taper determines how much of the <b>rod</b> flexes when stressed. The larger amount of the <b>rod</b> that flexes the 'slower' the <b>rod.</b> Slower <b>rods</b> are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a <b>rod</b> creates imperfections that result in <b>rod</b> twist during casting. <b>Rod</b> twist is minimized by orienting the <b>rod</b> guides along the side of the <b>rod</b> with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing the <b>rod</b> and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized <b>rod</b> testing.|$|R

25|$|Knox's team at The Cottage used <b>rodding</b> to decrypt intercepted Italian naval signals {{describing}} the sailing of an Italian battle fleet, {{leading to the}} Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence credited the Allied victory at Matapan to this intelligence; Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, who had commanded the victorious fleet at Matapan, went to Bletchley to personally congratulate 'Dilly and his girls'.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} and oldest arrangement {{consists of}} two turnouts and a fixed diamond crossing. Because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse, say 1 in 8, the curve radius is necessarily small, leading to a speed of perhaps 25 km/h. This type of junction is common on street-running tramways, where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available road space. Because the points are close together, the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical point <b>rodding</b> of a single signal box.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Edelbrock's {{machinist}} {{skills were}} put to work welding in the Todd Shipyards in Long Beach hand fabricating aircraft parts. Because of a ban on auto racing by the Office of Defense Transportation, there was no racing during the war, but Edelbrock secretly designed and developed {{a new line of}} products. After the war, he produced aluminum racing cylinder heads, in addition to manifolds, which quickly gained him notability among hot <b>rodding</b> hobbyists. Parts to increase an engine's performance were not readily available, so racers built their own. Soon Edelbrock found himself building pieces first for his friends and then for customers.|$|E

50|$|In fact, the {{downward}} {{acceleration of the}} <b>rod,</b> which is simultaneous in the grate's frame of reference, is not simultaneous in the <b>rod's</b> frame of reference. In the <b>rod's</b> frame of reference, {{the bottom of the}} front of the <b>rod</b> is first accelerated downward (not shown in drawing), and as time goes by, {{more and more of the}} <b>rod</b> is subjected to {{the downward}} acceleration, until finally the back of the <b>rod</b> is accelerated downward. This results in a bending of the <b>rod</b> in the <b>rod's</b> frame of reference. It should be stressed that, since this bending occurs in the <b>rod's</b> rest frame, it is a true physical distortion of the <b>rod</b> which will cause stresses to occur in the <b>rod.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Today, fly <b>rods</b> {{are mainly}} made from carbon fiber/graphite with cork or, less frequently, hypalon being favored for the grip. Such <b>rods</b> {{generally}} offer greater stiffness than bamboo, {{are much more}} consistent and less expensive to manufacture, and require less maintenance. Fiberglass was popular for <b>rods</b> constructed {{in the years following}} World War II and was the [...] "material of choice" [...] for many years. However, by the late 1980s, carbon/graphite composite <b>rods</b> (including premium graphite/boron and graphite/titanium blends) had emerged as the materials used by most fly <b>rod</b> manufacturers. These premium <b>rods</b> offer a stiffness, sensitivity, and feel unmatched by any other synthetic material. Graphite composites are especially well-suited to the construction of multi-piece <b>rods</b> since the joints, known as ferrules, in better-quality graphite <b>rods</b> do not significantly affect overall flex or <b>rod</b> action. Today's modern carbon graphite composite fly <b>rods</b> are available {{in a wide range of}} sizes and types, from ultralight trout <b>rods</b> to bass fishing <b>rods</b> and two-handed [...] "spey" [...] <b>rods.</b>|$|R
25|$|For {{decades after}} the end of the Second World War, the {{involvement}} of the GC, as well as the code breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were declassified in 1978. Only later, after Dilly's <b>rodding</b> method was demonstrated by Mavis Batey to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected. In 1966, H. Montgomery Hyde published a story alleging that a spy (codename Cynthia) seduced Admiral Alberto Lais (the Italian naval attaché in Washington, D.C.) and that she obtained a codebook used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC involvement was not made public at that time. In 1980, the BBC series Spy! included similar allegations about a spy called 'Cynthia' who obtained a codebook. In 1974, Frederick Winterbotham in The Ultra Secret falsely credited the decryption of Luftwaffe Enigma traffic.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Jesus Fellowship {{had joined}} the Evangelical Alliance, one of whose {{membership}} requirements was that the church remain in close fellowship with other local evangelical churches. Earlier in 1986, the Evangelical Alliance had launched an inquiry into the beliefs and practices of the Jesus Fellowship Church {{and found that it}} no longer qualified for membership, citing much the same problems as did the Baptist Union later that year. But at least as relevant in both cases {{was the fact that the}} rise of the JA came at a time when an international welter of anti-cult activity was under way. Allegations that the JA had too authoritarian a style of leadership and that members were under pressure to commit to lifelong celibacy, together with the fact that corporal punishment of children (<b>rodding)</b> was practised, and that community members were required to hand over their material possessions, left them vulnerable to accusations of cultic practices. Their intense style and all-engulfing requirement of commitment led to some allegations of abuse from disillusioned former members, and some hostility from more conventional churchgoers. A number of churches within the Evangelical Alliance threatened to leave if the Jesus Fellowship Church was allowed to remain a member.|$|E
500|$|Hot <b>rodding</b> {{was about}} more than raw power. Kustom Kulture started in the 1950s, when artists such as Von Dutch {{transformed}} automobile pin striping from a seldom-used accent that followed {{the lines of the}} car into a freestyle art form. Von Dutch was as famous for his [...] "flying eyeball" [...] as he was for his intricate spider-web designs. As the decade began, hand-drawn pin striping was almost unheard of, but by 1958 it had become a popular method of customizing the looks of the hot rod. [...] As the decade progressed, hot <b>rodding</b> became a popular hobby for a growing number of teenagers as the sport literally came to Main Street.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after their}} {{development}} by Genaille, the <b>rods</b> were adapted {{to a set}} of <b>rods</b> that can perform division. The division <b>rods</b> are aligned similarly to the multiplication <b>rods,</b> with the index <b>rod</b> on the left, and the following <b>rods</b> spelling out the digits of the divisor. After these, a special [...] "remainder" [...] <b>rod</b> is placed on the right. The quotient is read from left to right, following the lines from one <b>rod</b> to the next. The path of digits ends with a number on the remainder <b>rod,</b> which is the remainder given by the division.|$|R

40|$|In {{an engine}} the {{connecting}} <b>rod</b> connects the piston to the crankshaft. Connecting <b>rods</b> may also convert rotating motion into reciprocating motion. Generally connecting <b>rod</b> are manufactured using C 70 steel. This Paper mainly focuses to reduce weight and manufacturing {{cost of the}} connecting <b>rod</b> by replacing existing steel material Connecting <b>rod</b> to Aluminium composite material connecting <b>rod.</b> The connecting <b>rod</b> is investigated with composite material that comprises aluminum as matrix and with various suitable reinforcements {{in order to reduce}} its weight and increasing its strength. The objective of this project is to make 3 d model of connecting <b>rod</b> using CATIA V 5 software and apply static analysis though Ansys 12. 1 software. After perform analysis on steel material connecting <b>rod</b> and Aluminum material connecting <b>rod</b> result of both connecting <b>rod</b> Analysis is compared. After that cost calculation is performed. That cost calculation shows that Composite material connecting <b>rod</b> has good strength to weight ratio as compared steel material connecting <b>rod</b> with reduction in unit cost of connecting <b>rod...</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{spaces between}} driving wheels housed steam-powered clasp brakes, that gripped the wheels {{by way of}} a [...] "scissor" [...] action. The two middle brake hangers held two brake blocks each, whilst the two outside hanger on the leading and rear driving wheels held one block each. These were {{connected}} together by outside <b>rodding</b> for ease of access, and the whole system was operated from the footplate.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Green Enterprises (CGE) Pacers: these cars, {{modified}} by automobile designer Carl Green, had [...] AMC V8 engines plus flares, air dams, and wings. The CGE Pacers appeared in Hot Rod, Popular Hot <b>Rodding,</b> and Car & Driver magazines. Green also built two Pacer pace cars for B.F. Goodrich {{to use in}} the International Motor Sports Association circuit, and provided body kits for Amos Johnson's Team Highball racecars.|$|E
2500|$|Following closure BR {{removed the}} single siding and the {{headshunt}} along the old up line formation. [...] The signals were recovered or scrapped, {{as was the}} lever frame in the signal box. [...] The point <b>rodding,</b> still NER / LNER standard round steel tube coated with tar was simply cut up into short lengths and left where it fell. [...] This presumably helped to support BR's claim {{that the cost of}} reinstating the signalling made re-opening the line too uneconomic.|$|E
5000|$|TREAT {{has three}} banks of control <b>rod</b> drive mechanisms, the control/shutdown <b>rods,</b> the compensation/shutdown <b>rods,</b> and the {{transient}} <b>rods.</b> There are 4 drive mechanisms in each group. The drive mechanisms are below the reactor, {{and raise the}} control <b>rods</b> out of the reactor to increase reactivity. [...] These banks of control <b>rods</b> are arranged in two rings. The inner ring contains four drive mechanisms, the compensation/shutdown <b>rods,</b> with one control <b>rod</b> for each drive mechanism. The outer ring has four control/shutdown drive mechanisms and four transient <b>rod</b> drive mechanisms. The control/shutdown and transient <b>rod</b> drive mechanisms have two control <b>rods</b> for each drive mechanism. All the control <b>rods</b> contain B4C poison sections. The compensation/shutdown and control/shutdown drive mechanisms are mechanical lead screw driven, and have use pneumatic pressure to assist the scram function. The four transient <b>rod</b> drives are hydraulically actuated, and are controlled by the ARCS to control transients. These transient <b>rods</b> move up to 170 in/sec over a total travel of 40 inches (i.e. full 40 inch stroke in about 0.24 seconds).|$|R

2500|$|The Enigma machine became {{available}} commercially in the 1920s. In Vienna in 1925, Knox bought the Enigma 'C' machine evaluated by Hugh Foss in 1927 {{on behalf of}} GC Foss found [...] "a high degree of security" [...] but wrote a secret paper describing how to attack the machine if cribs — short sections of plain text — could be guessed. When — a decade later — Knox picked up this work, he developed a more effective algebraic system (<b>rodding)</b> based on the principles described by Foss.|$|E
2500|$|GC {{began to}} discuss Enigma with France's Deuxième Bureau in 1938, obtaining from the Bureau details of Wehrmacht Engima {{supplied}} by Asché and signal intercepts, {{some of which}} must {{have been made in}} Eastern Europe. This led the French to disclose their links with Polish cryptographers. [...] Knox, Hugh Foss and Alastair Denniston represented GS at the first Polish-French-British meeting at Paris in January 1939. The Poles were under order to disclose nothing of importance at this time, leaving the British codebreakers disappointed. However Knox's description of his system of <b>rodding</b> impressed the Polish codebreakers, and they requested his presence at a second meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Winding gear is the {{mechanism}} which allows paddles {{to be lifted}} (opened) or lowered (closed). Typically, a square-section stub emerges from the housing of the winding gear. This is the axle of a sprocket ("pinion") which engages with a toothed bar ("rack") attached by <b>rodding</b> {{to the top of}} the paddle. A lock-keeper or member of the boat's shore crew engages the square socket of their windlass (see below) onto the end of the axle and turns the windlass perhaps a dozen times. This rotates the pinion and lifts the paddle. A pawl engages with the rack to prevent the paddle from dropping inadvertently while being raised, and to keep it raised when the windlass is removed, so that the operator can attend to other paddles. Nowadays it is considered discourteous and wasteful of water to leave a paddle open after a boat has left the lock, but in commercial days it was normal practice. To lower a paddle the pawl must be disengaged and the paddle wound down with the windlass. Dropping paddles by knocking the pawl off can cause damage to {{the mechanism}}; the paddle gear is typically made of cast iron and can shatter or crack when dropped from a height. In areas where water-wastage due to vandalism is a problem, (for example the Birmingham Canal Navigations), paddle mechanisms are commonly fitted with vandal-proof locks (nowadays rebranded [...] "water conservation devices") which require the boater to employ a key before the paddle can be lifted. The keys are officially known as [...] "water conservation keys", but boaters usually refer to them as T-keys, from their shape; handcuff keys because the original locks, fitted on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, resembled handcuffs; Leeds and Liverpool Keys after that canal; or simply Anti-Vandal Keys.|$|E

40|$|Cofilin-actin bundles (<b>rods),</b> {{which form}} in axons and {{dendrites}} of stressed neurons, lead to synaptic dysfunction and may mediate cognitive deficits in dementias. <b>Rods</b> form abundantly in the cytoplasm of non-neuronal cells {{in response to}} many treatments that induce <b>rods</b> in neurons. <b>Rods</b> in cell lysates are not stable in detergents or with added calcium. <b>Rods</b> induced by ATP-depletion and released from cells by mechanical lysis were first isolated from two cell lines expressing chimeric actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) /cofilin fluorescent proteins by differential and equilibrium sedimentation on OptiPrep gradients and then from neuronal and non-neuronal cells expressing only endogenous proteins. <b>Rods</b> contain ADF/cofilin and actin in a 1 : 1 ratio. Isolated <b>rods</b> are stable in dithiothreitol, EGTA, Ca 2 +, and ATP. Cofilin-GFP-containing <b>rods</b> are stable in 500 mm NaCl, whereas <b>rods</b> formed from endogenous proteins are significantly less stable in high salt. Proteomic analysis of <b>rods</b> formed from endogenous proteins identified other potential components whose presence in <b>rods</b> was examined by immunofluorescence staining of cells. Only actin and ADF/cofilin are in <b>rods</b> during all phases of their formation; furthermore, the rapid assembly of <b>rods</b> in vitro from these purified proteins at physiological concentration shows {{that they are the}} only proteins necessary for <b>rod</b> formation.
