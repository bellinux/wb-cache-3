5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated {{the establishment of a}} Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman.|$|E

5|$|Said {{disliked the}} Oslo Accords for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E

The Palestinians consider {{the vast majority of}} refugees as victims of Israeli ethnic cleansing during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and cite massacres such as Deir Yassin.

25|$|Almost all Israeli Jews {{oppose a}} literal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> for Palestinian {{refugees}} {{on the grounds}} that allowing such an influx of Palestinians would render Jews a minority in Israel, thus transforming Israel into an Arab-Muslim state. In addition to the right-wing and center, a majority of the Israeli left, including the far-left, opposes the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> on these grounds. The Israeli left is generally open to compromise on the issue, and supports resolving it by means such as financial compensation, family reunification initiatives, and the admittance of a highly limited number of refugees to Israel, but is opposed to a full <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The vast majority of Israelis believe that all or almost all of the refugees should be resettled in a Palestinian state, their countries of residence, or third-party countries. The Israeli political leadership has consistently opposed the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> but it has made offers of compensation, assistance in resettlement, and return for an extremely limited number of refugees based on family reunification or humanitarian considerations during peace talks.|$|E
