40|$|Section 1983 {{no longer}} {{serves as a}} {{remedial}} statute for the people {{most in need of}} its protection. Those who have suffered a violation of their civil rights at the hands of state authorities, but who cannot afford a lawyer because they have only modest damages or seek only equitable remedies, are foreclosed from relief because lawyers shun their cases. Today civil rights plaintiffs are treated the same as ordinary tort plaintiffs by the private bar: without high damages, civil rights plaintiffs are denied access to the courts because no one will represent them. Congress understood that civil rights laws are only as good as their enforcement. When Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s Fees Awards Act of 1976, it wanted to ensure that meritorious claims would be heard and that all illegal conduct would be deterred. The enforcement mechanism that Congress chose-fee-shifting-guaranteed access to the courts even when damages were modest or the form of relief was equitable. So-called 2 ̆ 2 private attorneys general 2 ̆ 2 would accept all meritorious claims, knowing that if they won they would be paid by the liable defendants at <b>reasonable</b> <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> pursuant to the fee-shifting provisions of the law. In 1986, however, in Evans v. Jeff D., the U. S. Supreme Court allowed defendants to condition settlement of civil rights cases on the waiver or reduction of plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees. Two decades later, it is evident that Evans destroyed the enforcement mechanism of the Civil Rights Act. Today civil rights plaintiffs who have only modest damages or who seek equitable relief are without a remedy. Although fee waivers (and their effects) were the subject of much debate after Evans was decided, in recent years the issue has dropped off the radar screen. It is time for Congress to amend the Fees Act in order to resurrect section 1983 as the robust remedial law Congress meant it to be...|$|E

However, some texts suggest otherwise. Microeconomic examples are given in which a rise in the <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> of interest results in increased biodiversity loss and others in which it does not. It is also posited that the rate of biodiversity loss (as well as the rate of natural resource extraction) tends to rise with the level of aggregate investment and aggregate economic activity. It is demonstrated, using macroeconomic models, that the <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> of interest can increase or decrease with a rise in aggregate investment and also with an increase in the level of aggregate economic activity.

In addition, we analyse the speed of adjustment of these lending rates with respect to such changes in the money <b>market</b> <b>rate.</b> Our main findings are: (1) pass-through from the money <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> to lending rates is not complete (2) the speed of adjustment varies quite considerably across alternative lending rates and (3) there has been significant structural change in the relationship between the money <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> and lending rates both in terms of pass-through and speed of adjustment during this period. ...|$|R

Therefore, we analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy in steering euro area money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> looking at, first, the predictability of money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> {{on the basis of}} monetary policy expectations, and second the impact of extraordinary central bank measures on money <b>market</b> <b>rates.</b> We find that during the crisis money <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> up to 12 months still respond to revisions in the expected path of future rates, even though to a lesser extent than before August 2007.

Our results also indicate that the ECB's non-standard monetary policy measures as of October 2008 were effective in addressing the disruptions in the euro area money market. In fact, our estimates suggest that non-standard monetary policy measures helped to lower Euribor rates by more than 80 basis points.

40|$|In {{deciding}} on whether {{and when to}} outsource component production, firms should consider the trade-off between total production costs {{and the ability to}} horizontally differentiate products. We study the outsourcing decision in a duopoly under decreasing but uncertain <b>market</b> <b>rates</b> for components, given that outsourcing increases the substitutability of the final products. We find that {{there is at least one}} firm that eventually outsources component production because it cannot differentiate its product enough by in-house production to justify the (eventually) higher costs. The follower outsources at a lower <b>market</b> <b>rate</b> or may even remain vertically integrated. The follower thus incurs the (eventually) much higher in-house component costs longer, while the low substitutability is enjoyed by both firms.
