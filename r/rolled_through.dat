5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, {{who had also}} come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> its opponents throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side.

Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, in which Randy Orton defended the {{championship}} against Shelton Benjamin. The match began with Benjamin performing a drop kick on Orton, which knocked him out {{to the outside of}} the ring. Benjamin proceeded to knock Orton over the security barricade into the crowd. Orton got the advantage, after Ric Flair {{made his way to the}} ring, distracting Benjamin in the process. The match came to an end when Benjamin went off the top rope and dove onto Orton, but Orton <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> and hooked Benjamin's tights to pin Benjamin for the three count and retaining the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, several {{thunderstorms}} {{already developed}} during the morning hours and continued to intensify during the afternoon. Just after 11:00 am EDT, one tornado in downtown Pensacola, Florida caused some extensive damage {{to the roof of}} a Baptist church as well as portions of Cordova Mall but there were no reported injuries at the Church and daycare center. During the early evenings severe weather affected the Louisville, Kentucky Metro area in which tree damage and power outage were reported throughout the area and a possible tornado at around 7:00 pm EDT near the Crescent Hill area which was later confirmed as a brief EF0. Still in the region, one tree fell over a passing car but the motorist escaped injuries although he was trapped for several minutes inside. The Louisville power authority, the LG reported as much as 2,500 homes without power mostly in St. Matthews and Crescent Hill areas. More storms <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys {{during the second half of}} the evening and overnight with more storms in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North Vietnamese tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North Vietnamese overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North Vietnamese tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North Vietnamese had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, Anderson kicked a 38-yard field goal to {{increase}} the Vikings lead to 20–10. In the fourth quarter, they drove 67 yards and scored with George's 5-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter, while the Cowboys lost any chance of a comeback due to two more costly turnovers. First they drove inside the Vikings 20-yard line, but linebacker Ed McDaniel forced a fumble from receiver Jason Tucker right before he could cross the goal line and the ball <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> the end zone for a touchback. Later on, Dallas drove {{all the way to}} the Minnesota 6-yard line, but safety Robert Griffith intercepted a pass intended for Tucker in the end zone.|$|E
25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E
25|$|Behind import duo Cotton and Prather, {{and with}} Gleeson's vision realised, the Wildcats won eight of their {{remaining}} twelve regular season games, including two must-win encounters {{in the final}} week to squeeze into the postseason. From there, the Wildcats <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> the Finals undefeated to claim the title, an incredible achievement in what was arguably the closest season in NBL history. Not only did Perth extend their playoff streak into a record 31st straight season, but their 3–0 Grand Final sweep of the Illawarra Hawks saw them claim their eight NBL title. The Wildcats went back-to-back {{for the first time}} since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to back-to-back championships—Cal Bruton was coach in 1990, while Murray Arnold was coach in 1991.|$|E

25|$|Billed {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} teams of all time, the 1990–91 squad became the first team in 12 seasons to go undefeated in the regular season (27–0). A perfect record of 18–0 captured the Big West crown and earned the Rebels the No. 1 seed in the West Region. UNLV also flexed its muscles in a 112–105 victory over then–No. 2 Arkansas in Fayetteville. The Rebels <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> regional play with wins over Montana, Georgetown, Utah and Seton Hall before a showdown with Duke in the Final Four at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. Grant Hill, Bobby Hurley, and Christian Laettner kept the Rebels in check all evening and ended UNLV’s dreams of back–to–back championships and the first perfect season since Indiana in 1976. The 79–77 loss ended UNLV’s season with a record of 34–1. The team was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to London, Määttä {{registered}} two assists in his next nine games. He rediscovered his game in early February and carried it {{through the end of}} the year, pushing London to its second straight first-place finish (50–13–2–3) this time with the second-best offense in the OHL and the number three defence. Once again London <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> its conference to the OHL title game, losing only two games in the process, but they faced stiffer competition for the J. Ross Robertson Cup from the Barrie Colts. Määttä registered a point in all but one game. London quickly found themselves down three game to one but rallied to force a seventh game at home. Määttä lead a defensive effort that held Barrie to fewer than four goals for just the second time in the series, as well as scoring the Knight's second goal and securing London's second League title in as many years with a 3–2 victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} virtual pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started {{at the end of}} lap seven when Bird entered the pit lane. Pahkala opted to bow out of a multi-car battle with Uusi-Jaakkola, Greco and Graham Carroll for third place {{at the end of the}} next lap to make his mandatory stop. Pahkala left with a clear track ahead of him, and since no other driver was close enough to impede his progress, he recorded a series of quick lap times. On the tenth lap, Graham Carroll got a run on Uusi-Jaakola leaving the final corner and steered onto the inside line heading towards the first turn. Greco made it three abreast on the outside with him and Uusi-Jaakola making contact and the latter touched Graham Carroll's left-rear wheel. Two of the cars barrel <b>rolled</b> <b>through</b> the trackside catch fencing and some palm trees. The cars glitched quickly and re-rendered themselves back onto the circuit. Uusi-Jaakola and Greco had each lost one of their wheels and fell down the running order. As the eRace progressed, race leader Huis made an error, allowing Rosenqvist to close to within less than two seconds of him.|$|E
