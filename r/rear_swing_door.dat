5000|$|Orla E. Watson (June 3, 1896 - January 17, 1983) was an American inventor, engineer, and draftsman. He is most {{remembered for}} his {{invention}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> feature on grocery shopping carts allowing the cart to telescope, or [...] "nest" [...] {{in order to save}} space.|$|R
50|$|Owing to its {{overwhelming}} success, {{many different}} manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the <b>rear</b> <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> feature but were denied {{due to the}} exclusive license issued to Goldman. The federal government {{filed a lawsuit against}} Telescope Carts, Inc. in 1950 alleging the exclusive license granted to Goldman was invalid, and a Consent Decree was entered into where Telescope Carts, Inc. agreed to offer the same license to any manufacturer. Orla Watson and Telescope Carts, Inc. licensed their telescoping shopping cart design to several manufacturers throughout the 1950s and 1960s until the patent expired.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{shopping}} cart innovator was Orla Watson, {{who invented the}} <b>swinging</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> to allow for [...] "nesting" [...] in 1946.|$|R
5000|$|In 1946, Orla Watson {{devised a}} system for a {{telescoping}} (i.e., [...] "nesting") shopping cart which did not require assembly or disassembly of its parts before and after use like Goldman's cart; Goldman's design up until this point required that the cart be unfolded much like a folding chair. [...] This cart could be fitted into another cart for compact storage via a <b>swinging</b> one-way <b>rear</b> <b>door.</b> The <b>swinging</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> {{formed the basis of}} the patent claim, and was a major innovation {{in the evolution of the}} modern shopping cart. Watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946, but Goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which Goldman named the [...] "Nest-Kart". After considerable litigation and allegations of patent infringement, Goldman relinquished his rights to the patent in 1949 to Watson and his company, Telescope Carts, Inc. realizing that the <b>swinging</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> feature was the key to Watson's patent. Watson was awarded patent #2,479,530 on August 16, 1949. [...] In exchange, Goldman was granted an exclusive licensing right in addition to the three other licenses previously granted; Telescope Carts, Inc. continued to receive royalties for each cart produced by Goldman's company that incorporated the [...] "nesting" [...] design. This included any shopping cart utilizing his hinged rear door, including the familiar single basket [...] "nesting" [...] designs similar to those used in the present.|$|R
50|$|The Roomster {{is based}} on the concept car of the same name, {{originally}} revealed in September 2003 at the Frankfurt Auto Show. The concept was slightly shorter - 4055 mm against 4205 mm - than the production model but has a longer wheelbase - 2710 mm against 2617 mm, and featured a single rear sliding door on the passenger side, which was replaced by two conventionally hinged <b>swinging</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b> Like the production car it was designed by Thomas Ingenlath and Peter Wouda.|$|R

50|$|The DJ-5A (Kaiser Co.) used a {{standard}} CJ front end, with a four-cylinder Chevrolet Nova 153 CID L engine and two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission. In 1971, this {{was changed to}} a unique five-slot grille without turn signals that was used only on postal Jeeps. The 1971 model actually has the grille extend past {{the front of the}} hood edge. This allowed more room for the AMC Straight-6 engine and radiator. While resembling the CJ series, these were built as a completely enclosed, rear-wheel drive vehicle, with sliding doors (which could be opened while driving), and a <b>swinging</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door.</b> Most models only had the driver's seat and a mail tray where the second seat would normally be located. One improvement over earlier Jeeps was mounting the rear springs outside of the frame rails, thus providing greater stability for the vehicle with its top-heavy enclosed cargo area, especially at highway speeds. Most models were also equipped with a limited slip differential and a heavy-duty steering gearbox.|$|R
