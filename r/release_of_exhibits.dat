40|$|AbstractIn many applications, {{an ability}} of liposomes to retain drug and then rapidly release it at some later {{time would be}} of benefit. In this work, we {{investigate}} the ability of cationic large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) to promote rapid <b>release</b> <b>of</b> doxorubicin from anionic LUV. It is shown that the addition of cationic liposomes containing cholesterol, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and the cationic lipid N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DODAC) to doxorubicin-containing LUV composed of cholesterol, DOPE, DSPC and the anionic lipid dioleoyphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) can result in <b>release</b> <b>of</b> more than 90 % of the drug in times of 30 s or less. Further, it is shown that these release characteristics are exquisitely dependent {{on the presence of}} DOPE and cholesterol. In the absence of DOPE, much slower release rates are observed, with maximum <b>release</b> levels <b>of</b> 50 % after a 2 -h incubation at 20 °C. Remarkably, threshold levels of more than 10 mol% cholesterol are required before any appreciable release is observed. [31 P]NMR spectroscopy and freeze-fracture electron microscopy studies reveal that systems giving rise to rapid <b>release</b> <b>of</b> doxorubicin <b>exhibit</b> limited formation <b>of</b> inverted hexagonal (HII) phase, suggesting that these lipids facilitate drug <b>release</b> by formation <b>of</b> local regions of non-bilayer structure. It is concluded that drug release triggered by mixing anionic and cationic liposomes could be of utility in drug delivery applications...|$|R

40|$|The pineal gland {{is known}} to be light {{sensitive}} and {{to be involved in the}} seasonal reproduction of male golden hamster Mesocricetus auratus. In general, the pineal gland has been demonstrated to be inhibitory to the reproductive system of the male golden hamster. Melatonin is a pineal hormone which can mimic the action of the pineal gland upon the reproductive system. However, the actual site(s) of melatonin action in the hamster has not been demonstrated. In this study a direct effect of melatonin on the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> FSH and LH from superfused hamster pituitary glands was investigated. ^ The superfused pituitary glands showed a stable in vitro basal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> FSH and LH for up to 10 hours. The superfused pituitaries demonstrated reproducible responses to repeated pulses of 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 8) M LHRH, and a dose-dependent response to stimulation with different concentrations of LHRH. ^ Melatonin inhibited the basal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> FSH and LH from superfused hamster pituitary glands. This effect of melatonin was specific and not a general indolamine or catecholamine effect. ^ The superfused pituitaries had a diurnal differential responsiveness to physiological concentrations of melatonin with respect to FSH and LH release which were related to the light cycle used to maintain the experimental animals. A LD 14 : 10 photoperiod cycle was used with light on from 5 a. m. till 7 p. m [...] With pituitary glands obtained at 8 : 30 a. m., the basal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> FSH <b>exhibited</b> an initial inhibition, a gradual rebound at approximately two hours after the beginning of melatonin superfusion, and a significant overshoot <b>of</b> FSH <b>release</b> after the cessation of infusion with melatonin (Morning Response). If the pituitary glands were obtained from hamsters which were sacrificed at 3 : 30 p. m., the <b>release</b> rate <b>of</b> FSH <b>exhibited</b> an inhibition during the entire period of melatonin infusion with a rebound effect appearing only after melatonin infusion was discontinued (Afternoon Response). There was no significant difference in the responsiveness of the pituitary gland to infusion with melatonin at either 8 : 30 a. m. or 3 : 30 p. m. with respect to LH release. Also, melatonin could not inhibit the gonadotropins response to continuous superfusion with 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 9) M LHRH in pituitaries obtained at either 8 : 30 a. m. or 3 : 30 p. m., nor inhibit the stimulatory effect of pulsatile 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 9) M LHRH....

40|$|Curcumin, {{a natural}} {{chemical}} compound found in Curcuma longa, {{has been applied}} in multiple medicinal areas from antibiotic to antitumor treatment. However, the chemical structure of curcumin results in poor stability, low solubility, and rapid degradation in vivo, hindering its clinical utilization. To address these issues, we have developed a novel niosome system composed of nonionic surfactants: Span 80, Tween 80, and Poloxamer 188. Curcumin was encapsulated in the niosomes with a high entrapment efficiency of 92. 3 [plus or minus] 0. 4 %. This system provided controlled <b>release</b> <b>of</b> curcumin, thereby improving its therapeutic capability. Dynamic dialysis was conducted to evaluate the in vitro drug <b>release</b> <b>of</b> curcumin-niosomes.

40|$|Abstract. Faithful {{information}} transfer at the hair cell afferent synapse requires synaptic transmission {{to be both}} reliable and temporally precise. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter must <b>exhibit</b> both rapid on and off kinetics to accurately follow acoustic stimuli with a periodicity of 1 ms or less. To ensure such remarkable temporal fidelity, the cochlear hair cell afferent synapse undoubtedly relies on unique cellular and molecular specializations. While the electron microscopy hallmark of the hair cell afferent synapse — the electron-dense synaptic ribbon or synaptic body — has been recognized for decades, dissection of the synapseÕs molecular make-up has only just begun. Recent cell physiology studies have added important insights into the synaptic mechanisms underlying fidelity and reliability of sound coding. The presence of the synaptic ribbon links afferent synapses of cochlear and vestibular hair cells to photoreceptors and bipolar neurons of the retina. This review focuses on major advances in understanding the hair cell afferent synapse molecular anatomy and function that have been achieved during the past years...|$|R
30|$|The role of {{synaptic}} plasticity and computation has been analyzed and reported on in numerous papers {{over the past}} 30 years. A review of feed-forward synaptic mechanisms and their implications {{can be found in}} [2]. In this paper Abbott and Regehr state “The potential computational power of synapses is large because their basic signal transmission properties can be affected by the history of presynaptic and postsynaptic firing in so many different ways.” They also outline the basic function of a synapse as a signal filter as follows: Synapses with an initial low probability <b>of</b> <b>release</b> act as high pass filters through facilitation, while synapses with an initially high probability <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>exhibit</b> depression and subsequently serve as low pass filters. Intermediate cases, in which the synapse can act as a band-pass filter, exist. Furthermore, short-term plasticity can influence the availability of postsynaptic receptors to bind neurotransmitter. For example, reducing neurotransmitter release probability can reduce postsynaptic receptor desensitization, effectively increasing the efficacy of synaptic transmission during high-frequency stimulation.|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a biomimetic approach, based on direct incubation with proteolytic enzymes, to measure bioavailable amino acids in sediments. The kinetics <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> monomers and oligopeptides, which {{are amenable to}} absorption by cells, is measured as either individual or total amino acids. Microbial proteases incubated with fresh sediments yield amino acids at a similar rate as gut juices from a deposit-feeding holothuroid. Amino acid release from fresh sediment was dominated by a slow hydrolysis step from a refractory substrate, which can be described with a first-order rate law. Typical rate constants for release were in the range 0. 15 - 0. 52 h-l, consistent with gut residence times of deposit feeders. The bioavailable pool of peptides had a composition resembling that of average biological tissue, but comparisons with tissue composition suggested dietary deficiency of some essential amino acids. The early stages <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>exhibited</b> significant contributions from osmolytes (e. g. glutamic acid and taurine), while a larger, more slowly released pool was anomalously low in methionine, suggesting a contribution from microbial coat proteins. Freezing the sediment led to greater yields of amino acids, which reduced the simulation of a deposit feeder’s gut but indicated a larger pool of potentially bioavailable substrate protected by some kind of matrix. This larger pool of peptide substrate was usually dominated by higher molecular weight polypeptides as measured b...|$|R

5000|$|Diebold Schilling the Younger (before 1460 - 3 November 1515(?)) was {{the author}} of the [...] "Luzerner Schilling", one of the Swiss {{illustrated}} chronicles, which he presented to the city council of Lucerne on 15 January 1513 (but which remained incomplete). He was the nephew of Diebold Schilling the Elder of Berne. The younger Diebold was a somewhat scandalous figure, not unlike his father Hans, brother to the elder Diebold, an adventurer who had sought his fortune at the court of Matthias Corvinus, and returned destitute in 1488. Diebold was a secretary in Lucerne from 1479, and received the priesthood in 1481. His behaviour was so unpriestly, however, that the city council locked him into the tower in 1487, where he remained imprisoned for two years before he was <b>released</b> on parole <b>of</b> <b>exhibiting</b> more appropriate behaviour in the future. After his release he was soon back to his old ways, and after he had killed a man after a tavern brawl, he was fined and obliged to read a mass for his victim every year. Diebold was fiercely anti-French, and he accused the Bernese in particular, as well as his fellow chronicler Petermann Etterlin because of their friendly attitude towards France. Diebold's own sympathies lay with the German emperor Maximilian I, who personally invited him to the Reichstag in Konstanz in 1507. As an author, Diebold's most important contribution to the historiography of his times is his account of the years 1507 - 1509, the events of which he tells in his own words as an eye-witness.|$|R
