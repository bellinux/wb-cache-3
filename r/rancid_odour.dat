In the present study, Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) was fed a conventional diet that was enriched with different kinds of antioxidants: synthetic antioxidants (butylated-hydroxy toluene and ethoxyquin; diet I), a tocopherols-richmixture (diet II) and a tocopherols–rosemary extract mixture (diet III). A comparative study of the sensory and physical changes observed in the corresponding frozen products was undertaken. RESULTS:After 18 months at− 18 ∘C, fish previously fed on diet I showed higher putrid and <b>rancid</b> <b>odours</b> and <b>rancid</b> taste scores, while lowermean typicalodour and taste valueswere attained. Dripping and expressiblemoisture values obtained fordiet II-fish were lower when compared with their counterparts belonging to the diet I; additionally, microstructure analysis revealed that Z-lines integration was better preserved in fish corresponding to diets II and III. CONCLUSION: Diet II has been recognised as being the most profitable to be employed to maintain the sensory and physical properties of the frozen product when long-term storage is considered. Further research is to be continued to optimise the natural antioxidants profile.

40|$|The {{identification}} of compounds producing a characteristic off-flavour in fresh beef meat obtained from different locations {{is essential to}} avoid consumer rejection. The volatile compounds of fresh beef samples were extracted by solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and their odour was evaluated by using olfactometry analysis (GC-O). The compound responsible for the characteristic off-flavour was identified by using GC–MS and quantified in different beef samples obtained from different locations. The sniffing analysis revealed eight odour active zones being four of them identified as 2, 3 -butanedione, allyl methyl sulfide, 1 -(methylthio) propane and 1 -(methylthio) - 1 -propene (Z). The most potent odorant was 1 -(methylthio) propane described as garlic, cabbage, oxidized iron, solvent and <b>rancid</b> <b>odour.</b> All panellists attributed the characteristic off-flavour detected in fresh beef to the odour of 1 -(methylthio) propane.

Methods In the present study, characteristic odorants from fat oxidation, known from previous studies, as well as free fatty acids were quantified as representative marker substances by means of stable isotope dilution assays of fresh milk samples and milk samples stored at + 4 °C for one and three days, respectively. Results Sensory evaluation showed that <b>rancid</b> and sweaty <b>odour</b> attributes were generated during storage, resulting in an unpleasant aroma profile for adults; however, odour changes were not as pronounced as those observed {{in our previous study}} for freeze storage. Fatty and buttery odour notes and a cooked milk-like smell were also generated. In total eight odorants from fat oxidation were determined and some potent odorants showed slight concentration increases. Moreover, five free fatty acids were determined and these all showed drastic concentration increases, even after storage for just one day. Conclusions These investigations support our previous findings that storage recommendations for breast milk might need to be slightly reconsidered in view of potential sensory changes; on the other hand, no negative physiological effects are to be expected from these changes...|$|R
40|$|Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) is a {{fatty fish}} species whose farming {{production}} has greatly increased in recent years. Lipid damage produced during Coho salmon chilled storage was studied {{for up to}} 24 d. Lipid hydrolysis (free fatty acids, FFA) and oxidation (conjugated dienes; peroxide value, PV; thiobarbituric acid index, TBA-i; fluorescent compounds formation, FR; browning development) were determined and compared to lipid composition (polyene index, PI; astaxanthin, AX) changes and sensory assessment (<b>rancid</b> <b>odour</b> development) results. Most lipid damage indices developed slowly during storage; thus, values obtained for FFA, PV, TBA-i and FR were in all cases under 1. 5 g/ 100 g, 4. 0 meq oxygen/kg lipid, 0. 40 mg malondialdehyde/kg muscle and 0. 40, respectively. Odour assessment showed a significant (0 < 0. 05) rancidity development at day 10, when compared to starting fish material; then, non-acceptable values were obtained at days 19 and 24. The PI analysis showed not many differences during the storage time, with the lowest mean value at day 19. AX analysis indicated a relatively high content in the white muscle, which was maintained {{till the end of}} the experiment. A low oxidation development is concluded for Coho salmon lipids when compared to other fatty fish species under the same chilling conditions.

40|$|PEF {{treatment}} {{is a new}} non-thermal food processing technique, which can improve food quality and extend shelf-life. This study investigated the effects of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on the sensory attributes, physicochemical properties and flavour of beef. Two types of beef muscles, biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) either as fresh or as frozen-thawed muscles were used. The muscles were treated at electric field strength of 0. 8 - 1. 1 kV/cm, pulse width of 20 μs, frequency of 50 Hz and energy of 130 kJ/kg. Temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) analysis were carried out to determine the temporal changes in sensory attributes of PEF treated beef samples. Oxidized and brothy were the dominant sensory attributes during mastication. The Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) {{results showed that the}} “oxidized” sensory attribute was positively affected by both storage and PEF processing. PEF processing enhanced the lipid oxidation of both fresh and frozen-thawed beef samples. Values above 0. 5 are considered critical since they indicate a level of lipid oxidation products, which produce a <b>rancid</b> <b>odour</b> and taste that can be detected by consumers. Values of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in our study with beef muscles before and after PEF treatment at 0 and 7 days storage was well below 0. 5. In general fatty acids decreased with PEF processing. The oxidation of lipid and fatty acids is an important contributor of cooked beef flavour. Ten common volatile compounds found in beef were investigated in this study. PEF processed samples stored for 7 days were associated with more flavour compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{perishability}} of mild cured herring products demands special precautions as to temperature during curing to acertain {{the right}} degree of taste and texture. With appropriate consideration of transport and «shelflife» before consumption {{it would be}} of certain advantage to have a quick and simple method in hand {{to be able to}} control the curing process and chose with accuracy the time when the right degree of curing is reached. An earlier work by the same author published in the Series of Technological Research concerning the Norwegian Fisheries, vol. 2 no. 10, undertook to establish figures {{to find out if the}} development of trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) which is considered as the difference between total volatile nitrogen and TMA-N, compared with an organoleptical estimation of the product could give figures exact enough to form a basis for judgement of the different stages of the curing. The investigations appeared to give a positive answer to the question as far as the analytical figures were found to coincide fairly well with the organoleptical test. As the analytical figures will naturally vary with the special forms of curing (mild salt curing with or without vinegar, salt and sugar curing etc.) it will be necessary later to establish the figures for these curing methods also. The individual variation in TMA values for herring will be of no importance when the brine is analysed, but will give a reliable average value. The Conway Diffusion method is a simple and satisfactory method as to speed and accuracy when applied to the analysis of a large number of samples simultaneously. The present publication is a continuation of the previous one and tries on hand of the same analytical method to establish figures which could enable one to judge the action and effect of different preservatives on mild cured herring products stored at elevated temperatures. The values for TMA-N, which is formed by the action of TMO splitting enzymes formed by certain bacterias active on saltwater fish and form a representative part of the bacterial flora also of salt cured herring, is thought to give an index of the bacterial activity. The difference between total volatile nitrogen and TMA-N which is 95 % ammonia is presumed to give an index of the overall enzymatic activity. Compared with an organoleptical judgement the graphical curves showing the development of NH 3 -N and TMA-N during storage at + 37 ° C of herring in brine with different added preservatives seem to give a reliable picture of the difference in effectiveness of the preservatives. The herring with 8 % salt, 6 % sugar and 0, 8 % acetic acid content was placed in a jar and covered with 10 % salt brine. The pH of the brine being as an average 5, 0. The preservative was then added and the jar was allowed to stand for two days at + 10 ° C to allow for even distribution and penetration of preservative into the fish before being stored at + 37 ° C. Samples were taken at regular intervals. The following preservatives were tried: (The figures are percentage of total content of the jar). A. Benzoic acid sodium 0, 2 %. B. Benzoic acid sodium 0, 2 % + ocylgallat 0, 015 %. C. Nipacombin 0, 1 %. D. Hexamethylenetetramine 0, 1 %. F. Herring previously spiced with 1, 4 % of a commercial mixture of spices with added sodiumnitrite (0, 25 % of weight of the herring.) The action of the preservatives on account of the analysis of NH 3 -N and TMA-N was estimated as follows: A. Showing good proteolytic inhibiting action but poor bacteriostatic action. B. A pronouncedly stronger effect than A on the enzymatic as well as on the bacterial activity. C. The bacteriostatic effect is equal to B but as an enzym inhibitor it is noticeably inferior to A and B. D. The evaluation of the action of hexamethylenetramine is influenced by the splitting off of ammonia in an acid medium. As demonstrated by a blind test a solution of 0, 1 % hexamethylenetetramine in 0, 7 % acetic acid splits off 26 mg of NH 3 -N/ 100 ml. Allowing for an adequate reduction of the registered values for NH 3 -N in D the effect as an enzyme inhibitor appears very good. The bacteriostatic effect is not less than B and C and appears similarly good in comparison. The effect of the preservative is thought to be due at least in part to the liberated equivalent of formaldehyde. F. An apparent prolonging effect of the spice-mixture on storage life of the herring. The effect of the preservatives on the rancidity of the herring fat was analysed through the Kreis red values. C and F showed the lowest values and no <b>rancid</b> <b>odour.</b> B showed a much lower value than A and no <b>rancid</b> <b>odour.</b> A and D were pronouncedly rancid and the Kreis values were from two to three times that of the others.

40|$|Norway is an {{important}} fish catching and producing country and has traditionally used fish and fish by-products in feed for monogastric animals, the pig is no exception. Fish and fish by products are excellent sources of essential amino acids, healthy fatty acids, vitamins {{and serves as a}} mineral supplier. Extended use has, however, caused negative effects on pork quality in terms of fat firmness, off-flavours and off-odours. During the last years feed recommendations, for most pigs in Norway, have been: no use of fish or fish by-products in feed for slaughter pigs, maximum iodine value product (IVP) 57 /feed unit and minimum 200 mg/kg vitamin E. These limitations have challenged the formulation of pig feeds. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of different dietary fat level, fatty acid composition and of sex (entire male and female) on sensory, technological and nutritional pork quality parameters. Three feeding experiments were conducted using entire males and females of the crossbreed [(Norwegian Landrace x Yorkshire) x (Duroc) ]. Pigs were individually and restricted fed. Fat sources used were soybean oil, palm kernel oil and fish oil. Experimental diets varied in IVP: 31 to 118, fish oil inclusion in percent: 0, 0. 25, 0. 48, 0. 52, 0. 72 and 3. 0 and fat level in percent of dry matter 2. 9 up to 9. 6. The ribs, pork chops and mince for meat balls were shortterm frozen stored at - 20 ˚C for 3 months, and belly and neck were short-term frozen stored for 2 and 4 months, respectively, at - 80 ˚C. All products were tested by sensory profiling after short-term frozen storage. Long-term stored ribs, loins and meat balls were wrapped in plastic bags and frozen stored at - 20 ˚C for additional 6 months and meat balls for additional 7 months. The ribs were long-term stored in darkness while the chops and meat balls were exposed to light simulating normal retail display. Long-term stored bellies were stored for 12 months at - 80 ˚C with additional 6 months at - 20 ˚C. Fatty acid composition was measured in shoulder fat (outer and inner layer), in backfat (outer and inner layer) at P 2 location and in neutral lipids and phospholipids of M. longissimus dorsi (LD). Backfat firmness and colour, and meat colour were also evaluated. The results from the present study showed that the fatty acid composition of backfat, inner and outer layer and neutral lipids of LD changed towards the dietary fatty acid composition. Feeding low fat diets seemed to enhance the de novo fatty acid synthesis, producing SFA and MUFA, especially C 18 : 1. Pigs fed low fat diets had low percentages of the very long chain (VLC) n- 3 fatty acids, mostly C 22 : 5 n- 3 in backfat and in neutral fat of LD. These pigs had also a high C 20 : 4 n- 6 percentage indicating production from C 18 : 2 n- 6. Dietary soybean oil, giving a high IVP, led to an increase in the percentage of C 18 : 2 n- 6 linearly to the dietary contribution. These pigs were also low in VLC n- 3 and still the C 22 : 5 n- 3 was dominating. When introducing fish oil, high in VLC n- 3 fatty acids, a substantial increase in the percentages of C 20 : 5 n- 3, C 22 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 in backfat and neutral lipids of LD was found indicating a higher nutritional quality. Increasing the fat level, by use of other added fat in combination with fish oil, seemed to improve the wanted incorporation of VLC n- 3 fatty acids into both backfat and neutral fat of LD. Our results further suggest that fish oil and high PUFA diets can be used for slaughter pigs without detrimental effects on sensory attributes like odour and flavour on short-term frozen stored products. After long-term frozen storage rib, meat balls and belly were not negatively influenced by high dietary PUFA, or dietary fish oil up to 0. 7 %. Only pork chops from the highest dietary IVP group showed increased odour and flavour rancidity and intensity. Longterm stored belly from pigs fed the second highest fish oil inclusion (0. 5 %) gave no offflavour or off odour. Only tendencies to higher fish oil flavour in the long-term stored belly was found in the highest fish oil group. After reheating, bellies from the highest fish oil group had a slightly increased fish oil flavour and odour together with a significant <b>rancid</b> flavor and <b>odour.</b> Dietary IVP slightly influenced the backfat firmness. Higher firmness scores were obtained when the dietary IVP declined. Fat colour was less influenced by the dietary fatty acid composition. Phospholipids had, as expected, high percentages of PUFA but were also influenced by the dietary treatments. Both low fat and soybean oil diets gave higher C 20 : 4 n- 6 percentages and lower percentage of VLCn- 3 fatty acids than fish oil fed pigs. The supply of C 18 : 3 n- 3 seemed to enhance the desaturation and elongation into C 20 : 5 n- 5 and C 22 : 5 n- 3 but a decrease in the percentage of C 22 : 6 n- 3 when feeding these diets strongly supports the view that the synthesis of this fatty acid is very limited in pigs. Providing dietary VLC n- 3 fatty acids by using fish oil, these fatty acids were incorporated into phospholipids, now with the C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 as the prominent Sex had an impact on fatty acid composition. Males had higher PUFA and lower MUFA percentages in outer and inner layers of backfat and shoulder fat and in neutral fat of LD. The percentage of C 18 : 1 was in particular lower in males, indicating a lower delta- 9 -desaturase activity as compared to females. In conclusion, it is possible to change the fatty acid composition of pork towards healthier products for human consumption without detrimental effects on important sensory traits. Care must, however, be taken when long term storage or reheating is intended...|$|R

La evaluaci&# 243;n durante el almacenamiento se realiza mediante m&# 233;todos qu&# 237;micos y sensoriales. El olor y sabor rancio del producto elaborado con AG, se manifest&# 243; a 180 y 49 d&# 237;as, a temperatura ambiente y 40 &# 194;&# 186;C respectivamente, aumentando, en paralelo, el &# 237;ndice de per&# 243;xidos (IP), los compuestos polares (CP) y los triglic&# 233;ridos oxidados (TGox), y disminuyendo la concentraci&# 243;n de alfa tocoferol (AT) y el tiempo de inducci&# 243;n (TI), confirmando la inestabilidad del producto. Las patatas crisps elaboradas en AGPH se mostraron estables a temperatura ambiente y 40 &# 194;&# 186;C. Los ensayos se detuvieron a los 210 d&# 237;as, sin detectarse olor y sabor a rancio. Los par&# 225;metros qu&# 237;micos confirmaron la estabilidad oxidativa del AGPH y la influencia de la composici&# 243;n en &# 225;cidos grasos en la vida &# 250;til del producto. Mediante an&# 225;lisis estad&# 237;stico se demostr&# 243; la existencia de coeficientes de correlaci&# 243;n significativos entre IP, CP, TGox y AT. Finalmente, se estim&# 243; la vida &# 250;til de las patatas crisps elaboradas con AG, encontr&# 225;ndose que 1 d&# 237;a de almacenamiento a 40 &# 194;&# 186;C equivalen a 4. 9 d&# 237;as a temperatura ambiente...|$|E
