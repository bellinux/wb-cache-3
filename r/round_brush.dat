Juana Maria hung seal meat from a series of 4 - 8 ft long poles placed around the structures, or from ropes stretched between the poles. Like other California natives, the Nicoleño were apparently skilled basket weavers, and Juana Maria is described as making four different shapes. When found she was wearing a dress made of green cormorant skins, decorated with feathers. She had a number of possessions made of sinew and bone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Most present-day {{interactive}} paint applications {{lack the}} means of adequately capturing a user’s gestures and translating them into realistic and predictable strokes, despite the importance of such a mechanism. We present a novel brush design that adopts constrained energy optimization to deform the brush tuft according to the user’s input movement. It incorporates bidirectional paint transfer and an anisotropic friction model. The main advantage of our method {{is its ability to}} handle a wide range of brush tuft shapes that are animated using a freeform deformation lattice, which is associated with the tuft’s geometry. This way, almost no conditions or limitations are placed upon the appearance of the brush. Examples range from <b>round</b> <b>brushes</b> modeled as polygon meshes, to flat brushes with individual bristles. Less common deformable tools that are used to apply or remove paint on the canvas, like sponges, can be created as well. The model is integrated in our interactive painting system for creating images with watery paint.

50|$|After {{the deep}} {{conditioner}} is fully rinsed out, a leave in conditioner is applied and hair {{is set on}} large magnetic rollers and placed under a hood dryer for up to 2 hours, depending on the length and density of the hair. Rollers are used to begin the straightening process and also create body and movement in the straightened style. Once the rollers are removed, concentrated silicone-based serums are applied to the hair. Oil-based products are typically avoided at this stage as they add weight and greasiness and can burn on the hair. Next, hair is blowdried straight in small sections at high heat, using a <b>round</b> <b>brush</b> to create tension and volume. A concentrator nozzle {{is attached to the}} end of the blowdryer to allow heat to be directed on the section being straightened. After blowdrying, a small amount of serum is applied and hair is wrapped in a dubi or doobie, a method which wraps and pins the hair around the head, using it as a giant roller, to create additional straightening and movement. Finally, hair is taken down from the dubi and styled as desired.|$|E
40|$|Polymer nanofibers {{are used}} in {{numerous}} applications ranging from the design of new composite materials to the fabrication of nanostructured biomimetic scaffolds for artificial bones and organs for regenerative medicine. Here, we describe a simple controllable set-up for drawing single filament nanofibers from polymer solutions or melts using a rotating rod or a set of rods (<b>round</b> <b>brush).</b> The set-up can be assembled {{in a few minutes}} and applied to fabricate customized nanofiber scaffolds and meshes for various applications. The resulting fiber diameter is controlled precisely in the range 40 nm to 5 μ m by adjusting the rotational speed and polymer concentration. Owing to the simple design and capability to manipulate single nanofibers, the spinning set-up can be used to wind a single filament into unidirectional, orthogonal or randomly oriented 2 D and 3 D meshes with controlled density, thickness and combinations of different fibers and materials in the scaffolds. The method is scalable and can be implemented easily for laboratory and industrial manufacturing...|$|E

5000|$|From a short {{distance}} Lenz’s paintings appear to be strikingly realistic, even to be photographs perhaps, upon closer inspection however, they are seen to {{be made up of}} thousands of brushstrokes. [...] Lenz starts a new painting by initially working out ideas in small pencil “thumbnail” drawings. The artist then photographs all the various elements of the image individually. These are used as the main reference material for the final painting. For a major work, he also completes an extensive array of color sketches. After the composition is fully developed, the image is drawn out carefully with pencil on a stretched canvas or board. Lenz’s painting technique is quite traditional; straight oil paint is applied using small <b>round</b> sable <b>brushes</b> over a primed and warmly tinted linen canvas.|$|R
5000|$|Rob Schamberger is an American painter, {{best known}} for his {{portraiture}} of professional wrestlers. He is currently the host of Canvas 2 Canvas on the WWE Network. He currently resides in Kansas City. Rob's technique involves the tracing/copying of promotional images or video stills to paper or canvas after which he uses various materials such as acrylic (Liquitex basics or Amsterdam standard series are favourites), watercolour (appear to be unbranded pan sets), ink and paint markers, to create his work. Often many materials are used in the same painting in a mixed media fashion. Schamberger uses what appear to be synthetic <b>round</b> <b>brushes</b> in a variety of sizes as well as a painting knife to create his works. Regarding tracing Schamberger himself has stated - [...] "Man, I could give a damn."Schamberger has a great eye for unusual colour combinations and uses a technique not unlike the posturization tool in Photoshop to break down the original reference photos to create something that is often quite unique when compared to the source material although his work in ink can vary in quality with some likenesses not quite hitting the mark. This might be as a result of having his reference on a monitor some way behind him and to one side rather than closer to hand. This can be seen briefly in some of the Canvas 2 Canvas videos and might be as a result of trying to avoid comparisons from viewers about the direct referencing of images in a painting by numbers fashion or an attempt to hide photomanipulation that is done in advance of the painting as although these steps are a common part of many illustrators work processes some artists can remain sensitive about how much is referenced to avoid criticism. Whatever the case Schamberger has a distinctive style and though his grinding he has created a near six figure business, something to be admired.|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 59 This {{tutorial}} {{will present}} {{an overview of}} the operation and design of steam turbines used for driving reactor and boiler feed pumps, called a boiler feed pump turbine (BFPT). Overall, these turbines are designed {{in much the same way}} as other mechanical drive turbines; however, there are characteristics to these units that make them unique to this application. A feed pump turbine must be integrated and completely compatible with the pump and the main turbine generator (TG) unit because these pieces of equipment are so interrelated. One of the most unique features of these turbines is their ability to operate from two separate and very different steam supplies. To accommodate these steam sources, two separate inlets must be used, each with its own special characteristics. The high pressure (HP) inlet has a separate steam chest designed to accept the boiler pressure. This inlet will feed a nozzle block that has an arc of admission of 25 percent or less. The low pressure (LP) inlet generally utilizes approximately 50 percent of the arc and has a much larger flow passing area. This type of turbine varies in output across the operating range of the plant. There are two basic operating cycles. The two pump operating cycle usually runs between 40 percent and 110 percent main unit load (MUL), this operation is achieved by using all LP steam. The one pump operating cycle, startup to approximately 65 percent MUL, uses both steam sources. The percent of each is determined by the load required, as well as the LP steam conditions. As the load increases on the TG main unit, the LP pressure supply to the BFPT increases, the HP steam is used to start up the BFPT unit and supplemented by the LP steam source to achieve the required load. There are numerous other factors beside modes of operation to consider when designing a boiler feed pump turbine. These include the speed and power requirements of the pump, steam characteristics from the main unit and boiler, and exhaust pressure. From a mechanical perspective there are a number of design features available on the style turbine to consider for maintaining reliability. The most obvious design feature is the single flow versus double flow design. The rotating component of the turbine, the rotor, is the key for maintaining reliability. It consists of an integrally forged shaft, blades with various styles of fastening, and shrouds or blade covers. The blades have either an axial or radial entry design root to secure them to the disk portion of the shaft. Shrouding also has multiple variations. It can be riveted, integral, integral with wire, or an integral interlocking design. Stationary elements consist of the diaphragms and labyrinth seals. The diaphragms direct the flow between the rotating blade rows. All boiler feed pump turbines have two journal bearings and a thrust bearing. In most cases tilting pad journal bearings are used because of their inherent stability and damping characteristics. Thrust bearings are mostly the standard double acting type. Controlling the steam flow to the turbine is done with the valve operating gear assembly. This assembly consists of simple linkage arrangement that controls the lift of the diffuser valves feeding the low pressure chest and the high pressure valve. The entire assembly is raised and lowered by an oil controlled servo motor. There are various other peripherals such as turning gears, probes, and <b>rounding</b> <b>brushes</b> that may or may not be used, which will also be discussed...|$|R
60|$|Holroyd {{was proud}} of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd {{currents}} of thought that and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium. He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample of its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of his labour--it was heavy labour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd's--Azuma-zi would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then the brushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would swear, but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The band ran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of the piston. So it lived all day in this big airy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knew--mere captive devils of the British Solomon--had been, but a machine enthroned. Those two smaller dynamos Azuma-zi by force of contrast despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord of the Dynamos. They were fretful and irregular, but the big dynamo was steady. How great it was! How serene and easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the Buddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living! The great black coils spun, spun, spun, the rings ran <b>round</b> under the <b>brushes,</b> and the deep note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected Azuma-zi queerly.|$|R
60|$|Taking his portrait, {{from top}} to toe, the picture of him began with a tall hat, broadly encircled by a {{mourning}} band of crumpled crape. Below the hat was a lean, long, sallow face, deeply pitted with the smallpox, and characterized, very remarkably, by eyes of two different colors--one bilious green, one bilious brown, both sharply intelligent. His hair was iron-gray, carefully <b>brushed</b> <b>round</b> at the temples. His cheeks and chin were in the bluest bloom of smooth shaving; his nose was short Roman; his lips long, thin, and supple, curled up at the corners with a mildly-humorous smile. His white cravat was high, stiff, and dingy; the collar, higher, stiffer, and dingier, projected its rigid points on either side beyond his chin. Lower down, the lithe little figure of the man was arrayed throughout in sober-shabby black. His frock-coat was buttoned tight round the waist, and left to bulge open majestically at the chest. His hands were covered with black cotton gloves neatly darned at the fingers; his umbrella, worn down at the ferule to {{the last quarter of}} an inch, was carefully preserved, nevertheless, in an oilskin case. The front view of him was the view in which he looked oldest; meeting him face to face, he might have been estimated at fifty or more. Walking behind him, his back and shoulders were almost young enough to have passed for five-and-thirty. His manners were distinguished by a grave serenity. When he opened his lips, he spoke in a rich bass voice, with an easy flow of language, and a strict attention to the elocutionary claims of words in more than one syllable. Persuasion distilled from his mildly-curling lips; and, shabby as he was, perennial flowers of courtesy bloomed all over him from head to foot.|$|R

A model for contraction is presented in which, in the intact cell, terminal web filaments and core filaments interact to produce shortening of the microvilli. Several recent studies have suggested that the microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells possess contractile properties (13, 18, 31, 32, 43, 45). This idea has been based largely on the finding that the longitudinal filaments which compose the cores of the microvilli are able to bind heavy meromyosin (HMM) {{in a manner similar to}} the way skeletal muscle actin binds this same protein (13, 31, 32, 45). In addition, the protein {{isolated from}} microvilli filaments is, by several biochemical criteria, indistinguishable from muscle actin (45). Two reports have described rapid, coordinated movements of microvilli in intact cells (35, 43). More recently, Mooseker (18) has reported the movement of the core filaments into the terminal web when demembranated brush borders, isolated from intestinal epithelium, are incubated with Ca ~+ and adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP). We report here a different form of contraction in isolated brush borders, with membranes partially intact, which is also dependent on divalent cations and ATP. We describe two different populations of actin filaments both of which may participate in the contraction within intact cells...|$|R

He wouldn't ambush a trail for any one else. He's not killing cowboys these days. He wants you for some reason. So Gene thought, and now I believe him. Well, we'll know for sure in five minutes.

Come, this heah's the safest and smartest way to fool Don Carlos." [...] Madeline felt herself more forced than persuaded into acquiescence. She mounted the black and took up the bridle. In another moment she was guiding her horse off the trail in the tracks of Majesty. Florence led off at right angles, threading a slow passage through the mesquite. She favored sandy patches and open aisles between the trees, and was careful not to break a branch. Often she stopped to listen. This detour of perhaps half a mile brought Madeline to where she could see open ground, the ranch-house only a few miles off, and the cattle dotting the valley. She had not lost her courage, but it was certain that these familiar sights somewhat lightened the pressure upon her breast. Excitement gripped her. The shrill whistle of a horse made both the black and Majesty jump. Florence quickened the gait down the slope. Soon Madeline saw the edge of the brush, the gray-bleached grass and level ground.|$|R

With the desperate resolution to leave no chance untried of producing an impression on Miss Gwilt, he had cast aside his dreary black garments; he had even mustered the courage to wear his blue satin cravat. His coat was a riding-coat of light gray. He had ordered it, with a vindictive subtlety of purpose, {{to be made on}} the pattern of a coat that he had seen Allan wear. His waistcoat was white; his trousers were of the gayest summer pattern, in the largest check.

His enemies, if a creature so wretched could have had enemies, would have forgiven him, on seeing him in his new dress. His friends--had any of his friends been left--would have been less distressed if they had looked at him in his coffin than if they had looked at him as he was now. Incessantly restless, he paced the room from end to end. Now he looked at his watch; now he looked out of the window; now he looked at the well-furnished breakfast-table--always with the same wistful, uneasy inquiry in his eyes. The waiter coming in, with the urn of boiling water, was addressed for the fiftieth time in the one form of words which the miserable creature seemed to be capable of uttering that morning: [...] "My son is coming to breakfast. My son is very particular. I want everything of the best--hot things and cold things--and tea and coffee--and all the rest of it, waiter; all the rest of it." [...] For the fiftieth time, he now reiterated those anxious words. For the fiftieth time, the impenetrable waiter had just returned his one pacifying answer, [...] "All right, sir; you may leave it to me"--when the sound of leisurely footsteps was heard on the stairs; the door opened; and the long-expected son sauntered indolently into the room, with a neat little black leather bag in his hand.|$|R
