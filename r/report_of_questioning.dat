The {{intention was to}} improve students’ questioning skills, to develop their conception of the importance <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> in their learning, and to impact positively on their information literacy. The context was a first year-seminar course in the History Department at the University of Sheffield (UK). Students were asked to ‘bookmark’ sites (including scholarly articles and primary sources) that they had found on the web during their weekly readings and to pose questions arising from their reading to a discussion forum. Data on students’ conceptions <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> were gathered via pre- and post-module questionnaires and standard module evaluations. This information was coupled with evidence gathered from a reflective diary that the tutor completed on a weekly basis.

40|$|Imagine living one {{day without}} asking a single {{question}}. Why not try it. How long before a question surfaces in your mind. How {{long before you}} are compelled, by force of necessity or habit, to ask it. Questioning {{is an integral part}} of our everyday lives. We use it to learn, to communicate, to express ourselves and to understand our world. Questioning binds us to common goals, allows us to establish common ground and is a vital tool in our daily search for information. What we ask, how we ask and where, when, and who we ask determines a large proportion of what we come to know about our world and the people that we share it with. That’s why <b>questioning</b> matters. Regardless <b>of</b> who we are, questioning occupies a familiar, ubiquitous, and indispensable place in our lives. This thesis examines the nature and value <b>of</b> <b>questioning.</b> It opens in Chapter One with an overview of the history <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> in the Western philosophical tradition, uncovering divergent roles for questioning in distinct historical contexts, and changing attitudes towards the practice in line with underlying epistemological commitments. In Chapter Two a contemporary context for the epistemology <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> is offered, providing an indication of the nature and scope of contemporary philosophical inquiry into questioning, and outlining a contemporary epistemological context for the investigation. Chapter Three begins the analytical investigation, presenting a characterisation <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> as a social epistemic practice, and a characterisation of questions as acts, drawing on the results of a large online survey. Chapter Four investigates the value <b>of</b> <b>questioning,</b> highlighting its role in the acquisition of epistemic goods, such as knowledge and understanding, and in the dissemination of these goods within epistemic communities. Chapter Five examines the nature and practice <b>of</b> good <b>questioning,</b> presenting a component-based account <b>of</b> good <b>questioning,</b> drawing on the results of an original empirical study conducted with schoolchildren. Chapter Six explores the nature <b>of</b> virtuous <b>questioning,</b> offering a characterisation of the intellectual virtue of inquisitiveness and highlighting the distinctive role of inquisitiveness in the intellectually virtuous life. Finally, Chapter Seven investigates the role that questioning plays in education and presents an argument in support of educating for virtuous questioning. The epistemological examination <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> captures its essential character and significance. <b>Questioning</b> matters because <b>of</b> the purpose that it serves; that of finding things out. We ask questions in order to gather information on the basis of which we form beliefs and decide how to act. Through the information that we gather and the beliefs that we form, we arrive at knowledge and understanding. Questioning matters because it forms the basis of what we know and understand, as individuals and communities. This thesis examines <b>questioning</b> in light <b>of</b> its central epistemological significance. As such, it provides the groundwork for an epistemology <b>of</b> <b>questioning...</b>|$|R

40|$|Since the postpositivist {{critique}} of the policy sciences, policy theory has come into question. More particularly, the problem orientation upon which Lasswell defined the policy sciences has come into question because policy making does not conform to his problem solving logic. That logic is inadequate. I argue that we must reconsider the problem orientation at a philosophical level to reconstruct it upon a more appropriate foundation. This thesis does not depict how we should conduct policy making but deals with foundational concepts and issues. I draw on Michel Meyer's new philosophy <b>of</b> <b>questioning,</b> problematology, to consider policy theory in terms <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> and to reconstruct the problem orientation on problematological grounds. The thesis is in two parts. Part I reviews and critiques past policy theory in terms <b>of</b> <b>questioning,</b> commencing from the problem solving basis of Dewey's philosophy and Lasswells policy sciences. I criticise this basis and outline how it made politics and argumentation residual aspects of reason. I discuss how the postpositivist critique problematised the policy sciences and how this permits us to pose policy theory itself as a question. Part II answers this question by reconstructing policy theory upon the problematological foundation of knowledge. Meyers logic <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> incorporates problematicity in answering, allowing us {{to account for the}} politics of policy. I outline the dynamic nature of the logic <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> and how it incorporates key concepts of interpretative epistemology; hermeneutics, dialectic, and rhetoric. I conclude by describing policy making as a synthesis of two questions: the policy question and the question of legitimacy...|$|R
