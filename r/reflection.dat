5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, <b>reflection</b> symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each <b>reflection,</b> and an intensity for each <b>reflection</b> (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given <b>reflection</b> was recorded on that image)).|$|E

The <b>reflection</b> high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the <b>reflection</b> of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials.

5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale <b>reflection.</b> This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each <b>reflection</b> is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours <b>reflection</b> of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E
