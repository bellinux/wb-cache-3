40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) degree at Loughborough University. Over the last two decades, sustainability has matured to become a societal imperative and {{is at the forefront}} of UK government policy and industry strategy. For example, the Strategy for Sustainable Construction (BERR, 2008) and Low Carbon Construction (BIS, 2012) reports have focused on encouraging more sustainable construction through reductions in energy, water and resource use. In response to such demands, the UK precast concrete industry developed a sector sustainability strategy and subsequently chose to continue activities in this area through an Engineering Doctorate (EngD) research project. The project focused on the scope for applying the principles of product stewardship (PS) as a means to mitigate environmental impacts associated with precast products, throughout the entire life-cycle of their use. Numerous PS schemes have been adopted in other industrial sectors, such as chemicals, electronics and product manufacture. One of the distinguishing features of PS is that multiple stakeholders need {{to take responsibility for their}} ‘share’ of environmental impacts, and that life-cycle thinking should pervade the value chain. Hence, through PS, the precast industry might be able to address not only the impacts within cradle-to-gate phases, but also develop a framework to positively act on broader, cradle-to-grave impacts. The aim of this research was to develop a framework for embedding the principles of PS more deeply into the precast industry, creating a novel pathway towards more sustainable construction. The research commenced with a literature review to understand the key sustainability issues affecting the industry, followed by an analysis and synthesis of industry key performance indicator (KPI) data from 2006 – 2012. Industry participation in the research was facilitated through a questionnaire survey and interviews with senior staff within UK precast businesses. Evidence of PS practices was found to exist within the industry through <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> <b>schemes,</b> implementation of Environmental Management Systems and through the mitigation of various specific impacts. However, the coordinated communication of such initiatives was found to be lacking and with the advent of new European standards around Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) for construction, it was decided that the precast industry would benefit from a sector-specific EPD framework to capture and communicate its PS credentials. An EPD framework and tool was therefore developed and validated through a focus group, to establish whether an EPD can be used successfully to deliver environmental information and refine an approach such that it would accord with the principles of PS. Further research and development arising from this research could focus on implementation and evaluation of the industry-specific EPD scheme, a mechanism to communicate and share life-cycle information amongst upstream and downstream stakeholders and a means through which stakeholder responsibility can be attributed and managed effectively. The key findings of this research have been presented in four peer–reviewed papers (one of which is in draft) which are presented in the Appendices...|$|R
40|$|<b>Responsible</b> <b>Sourcing</b> {{is gaining}} growing {{importance}} for companies willing to demonstrate responsibility {{and commitment to}} sustainable practices. Sourcing {{is a key element}} of supply chain management and by adopting <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> practices, companies can greatly contribute to the sustainability of their entire supply chains. Being close to both customers and suppliers, retailers hold a particularly influential position in the supply chain and their sourcing choices can play a key role for sustainability improvements. This paper investigates the different strategies that can be adopted to guarantee <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> in the retail sector, through the specific case study of two UK retailers, Sainsbury´s and Tesco, and their offer of sustainable seafood. Specifically, the relation between the offer of MSC certified products and the retailers´ commitment to source responsibly is here analysed. The main source of data collection is a content analysis of retailers´ CSR online reports and web pages. Additional information is obtained through reports and web pages’ analysis of four UK organizations dealing with sustainable seafood issues. The findings of the study suggest that the offer of MSC certified products is positively correlated with the adoption of <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> practices; different strategies are available to retailers to guarantee <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> and that retailers´ sourcing policies can be influenced by other stakeholders´ guidelines for <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing.</b> ...|$|R

The performances of the original and the new scheme are compared with minimal calibration against data from sparse vegetation taken from the HAPEX-Sahel experiment. Both schemes perform well; in particular the dual source SVAT successfully simulates the different temperatures of the sparse vegetation and soil. It is demonstrated that the two sources need to be coupled, rather than acting independently, for an accurate result. Some components of the single and dual <b>source</b> <b>schemes</b> are driven offline by measured surface temperature.

Now {{is the time}} to embrace the challenges and seize the opportunities offered by this crucial juncture in the country’s history to proactively position the garment industry as a catalyst for sustainable development. In order to produce and source garments responsibly, the whole industry in Myanmar, including suppliers, buyers, and other industry stakeholders, needs to expand its focus both inside and outside factory walls.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{sourcing}} decision of a buyer choosing between two supplier types: responsible suppliers are costly but adhere to strict {{social and environmental}} responsibility standards, while risky suppliers are less expensive but may experience responsibility violations. A segment of the consumer population, called socially conscious, {{is willing to pay}} a higher price for a product <b>sourced</b> from a <b>responsible</b> supplier, and will not buy from the firm {{in the event of a}} responsibility violation from a risky supplier. We identify four possible sourcing strategies that a buyer might employ: low cost sourcing (sourcing from the risky supplier), dual <b>sourcing,</b> <b>responsible</b> niche <b>sourcing</b> (<b>sourcing</b> from a <b>responsible</b> supplier and selling only to socially conscious consumers), and <b>responsible</b> mass market <b>sourcing</b> (sourcing responsibly and selling to all consumers). We determine when each strategy is optimal, and show that efforts to improve supply chain responsibility that focus on consumers (by increasing their willingness-to-pay for responsibility or increasing the number of consumers that are socially conscious) may lead to unintended consequences such as an increase in risky sourcing. Efforts that focus on enforcement and penalizing the buyer, however, never backfire and always lead to more <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> and less risky sourcing...|$|R

Permission is granted by ICE Publishing to print one copy for personal use. Any other use of these PDF files is subject to reprint fees. <b>Responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> (RS) of materials is defined as the ethical management of sustainability issues within the construction supply chain, and engagement is typically evidenced by certification to BES 6001, the framework standard for the <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> of construction products. Points are scored in BES 6001 under a number of clauses, yet little is known about RS practices. The aim was to extract knowledge about RS practices from all 138 nr. BES 6001 certificates issued to UK companies between 2008 and 2013. Data by performance rating, company size and product sector were analysed using Spearman’s rho (ρ) and Cronbach’s alpha (α). Performance against the life cycle assessment and resource use clauses was found not to significantly influence overall performance, so neither of these clauses can be assumed to represent good summary measures of sustainability performance. This suggests a refocusing of the scope of both these clauses might be appropriate in future developments of the standard...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Maney Publishing via the DOI in this record. We use {{a wider range of}} specialist raw materials in our manufactured goods than ever before. Many of these are mined in just small quantities, of tens to thousands of tons per year, and that means that a small number of mines is sufficient to satisfy world demand. Annual rare earth production, for example, is two orders of magnitude lower than that of copper. Critical metals are defined as economically important but produced from just a few mines or countries such that they are particularly vulnerable to supply disruption[1],[2]. These critical metals are essential for new ‘green’ and ‘digital’ technologies such as renewable energy, state-of-the-art medical technologies, computers and smartphones. Considerable effort has been made {{in the last few years}} to increase recycling, diversify supply or find alternatives to these critical metals. Less attention has been paid to <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing.</b> Yet, it seems common sense that raw materials needed for environmentally-friendly technologies should come from environmentally-friendly - and ‘people friendly’ - sources. How easy is this to achieve for the critical metals? Is it a case of ‘beggars can’t be choosers’ or is <b>responsible</b> <b>sourcing</b> an important factor in determining critical metal supply chains?
