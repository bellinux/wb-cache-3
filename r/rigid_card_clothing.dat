50|$|Common to all carders is <b>card</b> <b>clothing.</b> <b>Card</b> <b>clothing</b> is {{made from}} a sturdy {{flexible}} backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded. The shape, length, diameter, and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used. A later version of the <b>card</b> <b>clothing</b> product developed during {{the latter half of}} the 19th century and found only on commercial carding machines, whereby a single piece of serrated wire was wrapped around a roller, became known as metallic <b>card</b> <b>clothing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Carding is a {{mechanical}} process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibres {{to produce a}} continuous web or sliver suitable for subsequent processing. This is achieved by passing the fibers between differentially moving surfaces covered with <b>card</b> <b>clothing.</b> It breaks up locks and unorganised clumps of fibre and then aligns the individual fibers to be parallel with each other. In preparing wool fibre for spinning, carding is the step that comes after teasing.|$|R
5000|$|Membership of {{the union}} {{declined}} from the 1950s due {{to the introduction of}} metallic carding in the cotton industry. The union was thereafter restricted to the woolen industry in Yorkshire; by 1982, the majority of its members worked for the English <b>Card</b> <b>Clothing</b> Company, and by 1984, membership was down to just 130. [...] Membership decline continued, to only 88 in 1994. [...] That year, about half the remaining membership, including the general secretary, were laid off, leading to one final major strike.|$|R
50|$|At first, the <b>card</b> <b>clothing</b> for wool mills {{was made}} in the form of sheets, and when {{attached}} to the cylinder and to all the rollers including the last doffer there were gaps of about an inch between the sheets. This made it impossible to make endless slubbings. Even when it became possible to wrap the doffer with fillet clothing with no gaps, sheets with gaps continued to be used because a continuous woolen sliver was too difficult to manage through the subsequent steps.|$|R
50|$|The Shelburne Escape Line was {{the only}} World War II Underground escape line that {{successfully}} evaded infiltration by the Gestapo. Allied airmen, who were rescued after being shot down, were eventually taken to Paris by Resistance members where they received new names, identity <b>cards,</b> <b>clothing,</b> training, and special passes for the forbidden coastal zones in Brittany. The pilots were hidden in safe house attics, barns, and abandoned buildings of local farmers until a moonless night when they would be evacuated to England by the British Royal Navy's high-speed Motor Gun Boat 503.|$|R

50|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} is a {{computer}} printer which uses heat to transfer dye onto materials such as a plastic, card, paper, or fabric. The sublimation name was first applied because the dye was considered {{to make the transition}} between the solid and gas states without going through a liquid stage. This understanding of the process was later shown to be incorrect. There is some liquifying of the dye. Since then, the process is sometimes known as dye-diffusion, though this has not eliminated the original name. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints, ID <b>cards,</b> <b>clothing,</b> and more.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} machine carder is {{the drum}} carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked {{but some are}} powered by electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with <b>card</b> <b>clothing.</b> The licker-in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the licker-in. This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum's card cloth. Fibre is added until the storage drum's card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.|$|R

5000|$|In January 1944, Hollingsworth {{received}} his first patent for [...] "an invention that allowed textile machinery to better process synthetic fibers." [...] Shortly thereafter {{he was both}} drafted into the U.S. Navy and married his bookkeeper, Ella Mae Bennett, who managed the business in his absence. In the 1950s, Hollingsworth perfected metallic <b>card</b> <b>clothing,</b> revolutionizing the textile carding process. He also purchased and rebuilt used cards for sale. Though Hollingsworth products and his reputation for excellent service soon made him a wealthy, internationally significant manufacturer of textile machinery, {{he could be a}} slapdash businessman. In 1964, a newly hired accountant was horrified to discover that although Hollingsworth's company had annual sales of about $9 million, the business was not incorporated and Hollingsworth had kept no accounting books. Hollingsworth was also overly enamored of innovative textile machinery and made many uneconomical purchases.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of a <b>rigid</b> <b>card</b> falling in air using direct numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and a fluid force model based on ordinary differential equations derived from recent experiments and simulations. The system depends on three non-dimensional parameters, i. e., the thickness to width ratio, the nondimensional moment of inertia, and the Reynolds number. By increasing the thickness to width ratio in the direct numerical simulations and thereby the non-dimensional moment of inertia we observe a transition from periodic fluttering to periodic tumbling with a wide transition region in which the cards flutter periodically but tumble once between consecutive turning points. In the transition region the period of oscillation diverges and the cards fall vertically for distances of up to 50 times the card width. We analyze the transition between fluttering and tumbling in the ODE model and find a heteroclinic bifurcation {{which leads to a}} logarithmic divergence of the period of oscillation at the bifurcation point. We further discuss the bifurcation scenario of the ODE model in relation to our direct numerical simulations and the phase diagrams measured by Willmarth...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains a}} series of images which should be printed and cut {{out to make a}} simple cardboard version of a medieval astrolabe. The resulting astrolabe is a simplified and modernised version of that described in Geoffrey Chaucer’s c. 1391 Treatise on the Astrolabe, and has been constructed following the prescription described in Eisner (1975, 1976 a, 1976 b). The diagrams in this document have been produced using PyXPlot. § Instructions Pages 2, 3 and 5 should be printed out onto paper, or more preferably onto thin card. Page 4 should be printed onto a sheet of transparent acetate. The two sides of the Mother (pages 2 and 3) should be glued rigidly back-to-back, perhaps sandwiching a piece of <b>rigid</b> <b>card.</b> The Rete, printed onto transparent acetate, should be placed over the Plate, {{on the front of the}} Mother. The Label and the Rule should be placed on either side of the astrolabe: the Rule, marked out with a declination scale, should be placed over the Plate and the Rete, whilst the Label should be placed on the back of the Mother. The whole construction may then be fastened together by placing a split-pin paper fastener through the centre. For more information, please visit...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to define the terms "business protocol", "state protocol", "diplomatic protocol" and "etiquette", to {{describe}} some {{of the rules of}} social behavior and explain the importance of compliance with these rules. Equally important part is form of protocol and etiquette of diplomacy, for example how follow-up contacts between the countries each other, who is regarded as the initiator, what kind of ceremonial duties exist, how looks the organization of visits or how to choose appropriate gifts. This thesis is divided into three main chapters. The first part defines the basic concepts. The second part of the work focuses on the business protocol itself. It includes such topics as social priority, introduction, business <b>cards,</b> <b>clothing,</b> letters, netiquette, organizing a business meeting, a visit of a foreign guest, an international conference and last but not least social accident. The third chapter examines diplomatic protocol and pays particular attention to the supreme visiting government officials. To obtain the necessary information has been used by professional literature and sources of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. On the basis of the methods of direct observation were characterized the best and worst results, that is what is good and what is not good. It was discovered that the rules of the protocol in business circles in the Czech Republic are often violated...|$|R

40|$|Privacy is a {{major concern}} in RFID systems, {{especially}} with widespread deployment of wireless-enabled interconnected personal devices e. g.

An RFID authentication protocol should not only allow a legitimate reader to authenticate a tag but it should also protect the privacy of the tag against unauthorized tracing: an adversary should {{not be able to get}} any useful information about the tag for tracking or discovering the tag’s identity. In this paper, we analyze the privacy of some recently proposed RFID authentication protocols (2006 and 2007) and show attacks on them that compromise their privacy. Our attacks consider the simplest adversaries that do not corrupt nor open the tags. We describe our attacks against a general untraceability model; from experience we view this endeavour as a good practice to keep in mind when designing and analyzing security protocols...|$|R
