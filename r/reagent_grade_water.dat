40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Cryptosporidium parvum {{is known}} to occur widely in both source and drinking water and has caused waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. To improve monitoring, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency developed method 1622 for isolation and detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Method 1622 is performance based and involves filtration, concentration, immunomagnetic separation, fluorescent-antibody staining and 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) counterstaining, and microscopic evaluation. The capsule filter system currently recommended for method 1622 was compared to a hollow-fiber ultrafilter system for primary concentration of C. parvum oocysts in seeded reagent water and untreated surface waters. Samples were otherwise processed according to method 1622. Rates of C. parvum oocyst recovery from seeded 10 -liter volumes of reagent water in precision and recovery experiments with filter pairs were 42 % (standard deviation [SD], 24 %) and 46 % (SD, 18 %) for hollow-fiber ultrafilters and capsule filters, respectively. Mean oocyst recovery rates in experiments testing both filters on seeded surface water samples were 42 % (SD, 27 %) and 15 % (SD, 12 %) for hollow-fiber ultrafilters and capsule filters, respectively. Although C. parvum oocysts were recovered from surface waters by using the approved filter of method 1622, the recovery rates were significantly lower and more variable than those from <b>reagent</b> <b>grade</b> <b>water.</b> In contrast, the disposable hollow-fiber ultrafilter system was compatible with subsequent method 1622 processing steps, and it recovered C. parvum oocysts from seeded surface waters with significantly greater efficiency and reliability than the filter suggested {{for use in the}} version of method 1622 tested...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} interest in the commercial application of D-glucose-isomerase for the large-scale conversion of D-glucose into fructose-containing syrups []. As such, {{there is a need}} for a rapid and reliable method for the routine analysis of glucose-isomerising activity in fermentation broths. The analytical methods currently in use include the incubation of the enzyme preparation with a solution of D-glucose followed by colorimetric analysis of the fructose produced [2, 3]. Of the many proposed colorimetric methods such as the reaction of anthrone with sulphuric acid [4 - 6], resorcinol with hydrochloric acid [7], thiobarbituric with hydrochloric acid [8], and the cysteine-carbazole-sulphuric acid procedure, the latter commonly known as the "Dische Reaction" [9, 10] stands out as being particularly advantageous for the selective and sensitive analysis of fructose in the presence of other carbohydrates. Cadmus and Strandburg reported an automated procedure using only cysteine and sulphuric acid reagents for the quantitative assay of D-fructose in the presence of a large excess of aldoses and other ketoses. Lloyd et al 12] described a semi-automated procedure using the Dische reaction for the determination of D-fruct 0 se in biological materials. This note describes a simplified and rapid automated procedure which, retains the accuracy of the cysteinecarbazole-sulphuric acid procedure while using milder reaction conditions than those formerly prescribed 12 - 14]. There are also fewer analytical modules included than previously described. The method is capable of analysing fructose in the range of 0. 01 - 0. 1 g/ 1 solution.

Their baseline tank waste process consists of: (1) Separating the supernate from the sludge, (2) Washing the sludge {{with water and}} adding this wash water to the supernate, (3) Stabilizing the supernate/wash water or the washed sludge with additives if either are projected to fail Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) Toxic Characteristics Leaching Protocol (TCLP) criteria, and (4) Stabilizing both the washed sludge and supernate/wash water by vacuum evaporation.
