5000|$|Another [...] "famous in NZ" [...] {{landmark}} is the Ngaere Dairy Factory, {{founded in}} 1914. It {{had its own}} brand of cheese called [...] "Triumph". Since its closure in the mid-1970s, the factory has been put to many uses - a clothing factory, indoor cricket arena, <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> hall, and currently a saw mill.|$|E
50|$|Docklands became notable {{during the}} 1990s for its {{underground}} <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> scene. The {{growth of the}} warehouse rave scene carried on from the earlier gay and lesbian warehouse party scene which had started in the early 1980s, and continued in the Docklands through parties such as The ALSO Foundation's Red Raw, Winterdaze, New Year's Eve, and Resurrection dance parties.|$|E
50|$|Franconi had a {{successful}} career during the late 1990s and early 2000s as Superstar DJ Keoki; he released a number of CDs over that decade and was hired to play for thousands of people at massive <b>rave</b> <b>dances.</b> In 2006 and 2007, he toured - dressed extravagantly, wearing makeup, and sporting a number of tattoos - in the United States and Europe on the Club Party Monster Tour, {{a tribute to the}} film Party Monster (2003) as well as a nod to the Club Kid scene that shot him into stardom.|$|R
50|$|The Video Airship is {{an ongoing}} project which weaves {{together}} several themes in Shannon's work. In the late 60's Shannon proposed spherical televisions linked to orbiting camera satellites. Buckminster Fuller had earlier proposed a 200-ft sphere covered with lights to display Earth to the United Nations. Shannon designed a LED-covered spherical blimp with cameras that could land at school campuses and other public locations to deliver education and at night host <b>rave</b> <b>dances.</b> Aerovironment, Inc., the engineering firm founded by aeronautics legend Paul MacCready, found the design feasible; it can be aerodynamically controlled and can present clear computer video in daylight.|$|R

50|$|From the 1880s, {{the former}} swamp west of Melbourne became heavily {{used as a}} dock, with an {{extensive}} network of wharfs, heavy rail infrastructure and light industry. However, following the containerisation of shipping traffic it fell into disuse and by the 1990s was virtually abandoned, becoming notable for an underground <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> scene, a dance culture which survives through popular organised events held at Docklands Stadium.|$|E
50|$|Peace Love Unity Respect, {{commonly}} shortened to PLUR, {{is a set}} {{of principles}} that is associated with the rave culture. Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on Usenet, it has been commonly used since the early 1990s when it became commonplace in club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties. It has since expanded to the larger <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> music culture as well.|$|E
5000|$|Although Hardstyle and Hard Trance {{has been}} a {{dominant}} genre to dance on within the Melbourne Shuffle for many years, referring to the dance with [...] "hardstyle" [...] is incorrect. [...] "Hardstyle" [...] is an umbrella term for many different rave dances globally, {{as well as a}} genre of electronic music. Hardstyle is a <b>rave</b> <b>dance,</b> while most other styles were typically performed in clubs and dance parties.|$|E

5000|$|Hakken (sometimes Hakkûh) {{is a form}} of <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> {{originating}} from the Dutch Hardcore and Gabber scene. The dance is very similar to earlier European folk dance and is thought to be a sub form of zapateo with less airborne moves (unlike jumpstyle, for example, which features the [...] "drunken sailor" [...] style of jazz dance and high kicks). Music one is able to do the dance to is also called hakmuziek. The name is derived from the Dutch verb hakken which generally means chopping, or hacking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{death of}} Sydney {{teenager}} Anna Wood from ecstasy in 1995 prompted strong media coverage and moral outrage over concerns relating to teenage {{drug use in}} Australia and attacks on <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> parties, where Wood consumed the drug and later became ill. Wood's parents later vehemently campaigned the [...] "Just Say No" [...] policy {{across the country to}} prevent the tragedy from re-occurring. However, despite state and federal governments investing millions of dollars in anti-drug campaigns, ecstasy use has increased amongst Australians, including young people.|$|E
5000|$|... "Party Rock Anthem" [...] was {{the first}} single {{released}} from the album, released on January 25, 2011. It topped the charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. The hit music video for Party Rock Anthem internationally popularized the <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> [...] "Melbourne Shuffle" [...] which was revamped by David Mues, also known as [...] "Robot Dave". To date, the music video has over 1.3 billion views on YouTube. It also topped the YouTube 100, along with their later single, [...] "Sexy and I Know It".|$|E
50|$|Sound Magic has {{now sold}} over 300,000 copies. The band {{performed}} at festivals, <b>raves,</b> and <b>dance</b> clubs and regularly included two African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drum and djembe and NFaly Kouyate on vocals, kora and balafon.|$|R

50|$|Go-go dancers {{that are}} hired to dance at night clubs, special parties, festivals, circuit parties or <b>rave</b> <b>dances</b> in bright, {{colorful}} costumes are called performance art dancers. Their costumes often include accessories such as glow sticks, light chasers, toy ray guns that light up, go-go shorts embedded with battery-operated fiber optic tubes in various colors, strings of battery-operated colored lights in plastic tubes, fire sticks, a musical instrument, or an animal (usually a snake). In {{the early to}} mid‑1980s, the performance art dancer John Sex, who performed with a python, {{played a role in}} making go-go dancing popular once again at gay and bisexual night clubs along with his life partner Sebastian Kwok.|$|R
5000|$|Tilt {{was started}} in Coventry, England by Mick Park and Mick Wilson. They became {{resident}} DJs at Eclipse, {{one of the early}} 1990s <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> clubs. During their time at Eclipse, they met Sasha, who inspired them to produce their own material. In 1993, they met up with John Graham and formed Tilt. Engineered by Nic Britton at Bassroom/Midiroom Studios in Stoke-on-Trent, their first big hit single came in 1996 with [...] "I Dream", released on Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Records. Tilt released several other singles such as [...] "My Spirit", [...] "Places", and [...] "Butterfly", as well as [...] "Rendezvous", which they recorded with Paul van Dyk.|$|E
50|$|While some pro audio stores only sell audio equipment, {{others also}} sell {{products}} in other categories {{that are used}} in rock concerts and DJ events, such as portable stages, stage lights, par cans and light stands. Some stores sell coloured lights, lasers and strobe lights which flash, change colours and/or move according to the beat of the music; these lights are used in nightclubs and <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> events. Some stores also sell fog machines, which are used in dances, concerts and theatre productions, often to enhance the appearance of the lighting and laser effects. Some pro audio stores sell a range of DJ equipment, such as direct drive turntables, record cartridges and styli, DJ CD players and DJ mixers.|$|E
5000|$|Wood had {{recently}} left Forest High School {{to pursue a}} career in beauty therapy at a salon near her home in Sydney's North Shore. On 21 October 1995, Wood and a group of school friends attended an [...] "Apache" [...] <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> party at the Phoenician Club on Broadway in Ultimo, in inner-city Sydney. She had told her parents {{that she was going to}} a friends house to have a sleepover. Wood and her friends bought and consumed ecstasy tablets from a female friend outside the club prior to entering. At approximately 5 am on 22 October, Wood began feeling unwell inside the club and was seen rushing to the toilets, where she was found vomiting.|$|E
50|$|His musical {{style has}} been {{described}} as part electro, part power pop, more basic pop, with elements of new wave, <b>rave,</b> and <b>dance</b> found in many of his collaborations in the more than 15 years he has been in the music industry.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{the game}} was to drive around looking for fliers and energi sic tablets. Once the player had {{accumulated}} enough energi tablets, they could then proceed to their <b>rave</b> and <b>dance,</b> until they collected all three sections of the WOW Tryptich.|$|R

50|$|Another {{example of}} a street dance is house dance, which is {{prominently}} danced to house music. House dance evolved out of Chicago clubs but grew and developed in the clubs of New York.Due to the modern mainstream popularity of clubs, street and fad dances tend to evolve more often in nightclubs rather than outdoor spaces. However, they may be practiced in outdoor spaces. Many rave dances are also street dances. The majority of rave dances are street dance styles since rave culture is prominently an underground movement. Rave culture, like hip-hop culture, is vastly diverse {{and there are many}} different music genres each of which have individually prominent vernacular dance styles. Amongst the electronic dance community, street dances in the form of rave dances are mainly revolved around a consistent rhythm and flow. Street dance styles like popping, tutting, and roboting, due to their futuristic-psychedelic theme and/or movements, have been widely adopted amongst the electronic dance community and influenced dances such as Liquiding. From out of the electronic dance community, street dances like Electro Dancing and Jumpstyle (an {{example of a}} <b>rave</b> <b>dance)</b> have emerged. Unlike many hip-hop dances, house and rave dances are usually heralded more 'fun' than 'competitive', although most street dances start like so before being adopted for competition or any other purpose since nobody legally owns them. Generally dances like the Melbourne Shuffle are not applied as a dance for battling, rather for dancing in the crowd at a rave party. This distinguishes <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> from partner and competitive street dance forms. However, many people do perform rave dances as an expressively competitive dance.|$|E
5000|$|In England, {{one of the}} few {{licensed}} venues The Eclipse attracted {{people from}} up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> events featuring music with [...] "repetitive beats". There were a number of abortive [...] "Kill the Bill" [...] demonstrations. The Spiral Tribe at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves, and forced through the bill, which became law, in November 1994. The music continued to grow and change, as typified by Leftfield with [...] "Release the Pressure", which introduced dub and reggae into the house sound, although Leftfield had prior releases, such as [...] "Not Forgotten" [...] released in 1990 on Sheffield's Outer Rhythm records.|$|E
5000|$|The Phoenician Club {{became a}} popular rock venue in the 1980s, hosting many concerts by {{both local and}} {{overseas}} groups. Simulations of Manchester techno dance parties were held at the club in 1991. In January 1992, Nirvana played their first Australian show there. It {{became the focus of}} a major public controversy in 1995 following the death of Sydney teenager Anna Wood, who died from a cerebral oedema after taking the drug ecstasy while attending a <b>rave</b> <b>dance</b> party at the venue. The club survived calls for it to be closed down in the ensuing public fall-out over Wood's death. Fines and restrictions imposed on it by the courts significantly reduced its role as a major music venue, however. [...] The club eventually closed down in 1998, and it has since been redeveloped into residential and commercial premises.|$|E
50|$|Clubwear in the US and UK usually {{consists}} {{of things like}} tutus, white gloves, boiler suits, rompers, bikini sets, high visibility vests and trousers and fluffy or furry leg warmers. This type of clubwear is usually found at <b>raves,</b> big <b>dance</b> events and nightclubs dedicated to rave/dance music.|$|R
