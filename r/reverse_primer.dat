50|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) has become a powerful and effective method for detection of potato plant viruses within potato plant material and even dormant potatoes. Only a minute piece of plant material is required for analysis using RT-PCR. Considering the protocol described within this thesis, 0.1 g of plant material is enough for 14 500 separate reactions. During a RT-PCR specific target RNA sequences are amplified exponentially into DNA copies. For this to occur, however, the RNA of the virus must first be transcribed to DNA {{by means of a}} reverse transcriptase polymerase. This polymerase synthesizes a DNA strand using the RNA as template. This results in a DNA/RNA complex. For synthesis of a DNA strand from the RNA template only the <b>reverse</b> <b>primer</b> is required since the RNA is a single strand arranged from 5’ to 3’.

5000|$|Compared to PCR, the {{guidelines}} for primer and probe design for RPA are less established, and may take {{a certain degree of}} trial and error, although recent results indicate that standard PCR primers can work as well. The general principle of a discrete amplicon bounded by a forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>primer</b> with an (optional) internal fluorogenic probe is similar to PCR. PCR primers may be used directly in RPA, but their short length means that recombination rates are low and RPA will not be especially sensitive or fast. Typically 30-38 base primers are needed for efficient recombinase filament formation and RPA performance. This is in contrast to some other techniques such as LAMP which use a larger number of primers subject to additional design constraints. Although the original 2006 report of RPA describes a functional set of reaction components, the current (proprietary) formulation of the TwistAmp kit is [...] "substantially different" [...] and is available only from the TwistDx supplier. This is in comparison to reaction mixtures for PCR which are available from many suppliers, or LAMP or NASBA for which the composition of the reaction mixture is freely published, allowing researchers to create their own customized [...] "kits" [...] from inexpensive ingredients.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one {{of the most}} used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little <b>reverse</b> <b>primer,</b> which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as Lambda exonuclease. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.|$|E

50|$|The {{result of}} a T-RFLP {{profiling}} is a graph called electropherogram which is an intensity plot representation of an electrophoresis experiment (gel or capillary). In an electropherogram the X-axis marks the sizes of the fragments while the Y-axis marks the fluorescence intensity of each fragment. Thus, what appears on an electrophoresis gel as a band appears as a peak on the electropherogram whose integral is its total fluorescence. In a T-RFLP profile each peak assumingly corresponds to one genetic variant in the original sample while its height or area corresponds to its relative abundance in the specific community. Both assumptions listed above, however, are not always met. Often, several different bacteria in a population might give a single peak on the electropherogram due {{to the presence of}} a restriction site for the particular restriction enzyme used in the experiment at the same position. To overcome this problem and to increase the resolving power of this technique a single sample can be digested in parallel by several enzymes (often three) resulting in three T-RFLP profiles per sample each resolving some variants while missing others. Another modification which is sometimes used is to fluorescently label the <b>reverse</b> <b>primer</b> as well using a different dye, again resulting in two parallel profiles per sample each resolving a different number of variants.|$|E
5000|$|Multiplex ligation-dependent probe {{amplification}} [...] (MLPA)http://www.mlpa.com is {{a variation}} of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction that permits amplification of multiple targets with only a single primer pair. Each probe consists of two oligonucleotides which recognize adjacent target sites on the DNA. One probe oligonucleotide contains the sequence recognized by the forward primer, the other contains the sequence recognized by the <b>reverse</b> <b>primer.</b> Only when both probe oligonucleotides are hybridized to their respective targets, can they be ligated into a complete probe. The advantage of splitting the probe into two parts is that only the ligated oligonucleotides, but not the unbound probe oligonucleotides, are amplified. If the probes were not split in this way, the primer sequences at either end would cause the probes to be amplified regardless of their hybridization to the template DNA, and the amplification product would not be dependent on the number of target sites present in the sample DNA. Each complete probe has a unique length, so that its resulting amplicons can be separated and identified by (capillary) electrophoresis. This avoids the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR. Because the forward primer used for probe amplification is fluorescently labeled, each amplicon generates a fluorescent peak which can be detected by a capillary sequencer. Comparing the peak pattern obtained on a given sample with that obtained on various reference samples, the relative quantity of each amplicon can be determined. This ratio is a measure for the ratio in which the target sequence is present in the sample DNA.|$|E
