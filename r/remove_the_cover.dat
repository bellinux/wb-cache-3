5000|$|Flatau {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw (it exists to this day), and he created the first experimental neurobiological laboratory in Poland, and was member and contributed to development of the Warsaw Scientific Society (he was its member since January 19, 1908). As Poland was under occupation in that time this society {{played an important}} role in reestablishing Polish science in the years to come. The neurological laboratory at the Nencki Institute had rather humble origin. In the early twentieth century, after settling in Warsaw, Flatau established in his private apartment, microscopy laboratory in the building where the fashion house of Herse was located on Marszałkowska 150 street. The anecdote about this laboratory is as follows: Carriage would take us to building on Marszalkowska Street the same building where were mannequin ladies stood in shopping windows of House of Fashion of Boguslaw Herse (...) In this house lived, on the first floor, my uncle Edward Flatau who - just like my father - was a neurologist and psychiatrist (...) There was St. Bernard dog who had its idiosyncrasies. In the long, narrow room of the apartment stood, preserved in alcohol and covered, brains of animals and humans that uncle studied. At night St. Bernard used his paws to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> and ate a brain, always just one. He was taking off the cover gently and quietly placed it on the table.

Let his brother, aged four, who has no fear of fish, come up to the bowl and put his hands in the bowl and catch the fish. No amount of watching a fearless child play with these harmless animals will remove the fear from the toddler. Try shaming him, making a scapegoat of him. Your attempts are equally futile. Let us try, however, this simple method. Place the child at meal time at one end of a table ten or twelve feet long, and move the fish bowl to the extreme other end of the table and cover it. Just as soon as the meal is placed before him <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> from the bowl. If disturbance occurs, extend your table and place the bowl still farther off, so far away that no disturbance occurs. Eating takes place normally, nor is digestion interfered with. Repeat the procedure on the next day, but move the bowl a little nearer. In four or five days the bowl can be brought right up to the food tray without causing the slightest disturbance. Then take a small glass dish, fill it with water and move the dish back, and at subsequent meal times bring it nearer and nearer to him. Again in three or four days the small glass dish can be put on the tray alongside of his milk. The old fear has been driven out by training, unconditioning has taken place, and this unconditioning is permanent.|$|E

Although she was {{permitted}} to get up, she preferred to stay in bed as long as possible. This is how I found her. After asking my companions to move away from the bed a little, I tried to attract the young woman's attention as I caressed her hair and speaking to her in English while using the types of phrases I would have used while speaking with the Grand Duchesses, but I did not refer to her by any name other than 'Darling'. She did not reply and I saw that she did not understand a word of what I had said, for when she raised the cover after a certain period of time, and I saw her face, there was nothing in her eyes which showed she had recognized me. The eyes and forehead showed some resemblance to the Grand Duchess Tatiana Nicolaievna, resemblance that disappeared, nevertheless, as soon as her face was not covered. I had to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> by force, and I saw that neither the nose, the mouth, nor the chin were formed like that of the Grand Duchess. The hair was lighter in color, some of her teeth were missing-and the remaining ones were not like those of the Grand Duchess...Her hands were also completely different, the fingers were longer and the nails narrower. I wanted to measure her height, but she refused, and I found it impossible to get an exact measurement without force. We judged roughly that in any case, she was smaller than me, while the Grand Duchess Tatiana was more than ten centimeters taller than me. I have been able to verify this, thanks to the patient's official measurement at the time of her arrival at the hospital and that corresponded exactly with the one which was taken in my presence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A mix is a {{communication}} proxy that hides {{the relationship between}} incoming and outgoing messages. Routing traffic through a path of mixes is {{a powerful tool for}} providing privacy. When mixes are used for interactive communication, such as VoIP and web browsing, attackers can undermine user privacy by observing timing information along the path. Mixes can prevent these attacks by inserting dummy packets (cover traffic) to obfuscate timing information in each stream. A recently proposed defense called adaptive padding makes cover traffic more effective by ensuring that statistically unusual gaps between packets are partially filled in with dummy packets. In this work, we propose Selective Cross Correlation (SCC), an attack that an eavesdropper could employ to de-anonymize users despite the use of adaptive padding. The main insight of our approach is that, with the defense, the timings {{at one end of the}} stream are effectively a subset of the timings at the other end of the stream. By considering the network conditions, an appropriate correlation window can be found and used to effectively <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> traffic, thereby enabling us to correlate both ends of the stream. We have conducted real network experiments and have found that SCC greatly improves attacker effectiveness over prior techniques against the defense. With SCC, the attacker is nearly as successful as when no defense is applied. This attack demonstrates the need for more robust defenses against statistical timing attacks. I...|$|E
40|$|Classical ZN {{catalysts}} {{still have}} the monopoly of industrial iPP production. With their complex formulation, including an ‘activated’ MgCl 2 support, a Ti precursor, an Al-alkyl activator, {{and in most cases}} a properly chosen pair of electron donor modifiers, these systems are rightfully considered, in many respects, ‘black box’ ones, and so far no true cases of active surface design have been reported. On the other hand, it is indeed possible to tailor application based on trial-and-error, primarily by means of a smart selection of the electron donors, recently also under the guidance of ‘black-box’ QSAR models. In the latter respect, a collaboration between SABIC and this laboratory, making intensive use of High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) screening methods, gave important results, including the identification of electron donors with improved performance. In parallel with the ‘black-box’ QSAR, a fundamental study of the catalysts is also in progress; moving from the HTE database, added with statistical analyses of 13 C NMR polymer microstructure, quenched-flow kinetic experiments, and periodic and cluster DFT calculations, quantitative hypotheses on the interactions between the various catalyst system components and the local structure of the active surfaces are being formulated, and it happens more and more that partial views of what hides in the ‘black-box’ are obtained. In this presentation, we will describe what we saw, along with the actions that, in our opinion, are necessary to fully <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> and highlight the box...|$|E
