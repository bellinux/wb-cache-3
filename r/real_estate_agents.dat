25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, Americans of Polish descent felt {{a new low}} in their social status.

In Detroit in particular, Polish Americans were among the last white ethnic groups to remain in the city as its demographics changed into a Black enclave. Poles resented Black newcomers to their urban communities, and resented white liberals who called them racist for their attempts to remain in Polish-majority communities. Poles in Chicago fought against blockbusting by <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> who ruined the market value of their homes while changing their communities into low-income, high crime centers.|$|E
