A Reg Grundy production, it was often billed as [...] "The game show without a host" [...] although it had a presenter, Robin Houston. He read the questions off-screen throughout the show and was never seen by the viewers. The maximum number of shows that were produced in one day was twelve, although the normal <b>recording</b> <b>day</b> saw ten shows being produced. The reason for such a high number was to amortise the production costs. In the spinoff called 100% Gold it was presented by Melinda Walker.|$|E

5000|$|TBC (styled as tbc), are a Christian girl band {{who were}} {{launched}} by Innervation Trust in 2004, as a [...] "flagship" [...] girl band alongside their brother band Thebandwithnoname. Innervation Trust is a Christian charity that exists {{to recruit and}} resource schools teams, dubbed [...] "Collectives", each dedicated to a major city in the UK. Innervation Trust {{is the product of}} Mark Pennells and Zarc Porter, a songwriter/producer partnership also credited with writing most of the music for, and co-founding, the World Wide Message Tribe. After 7 years of promoting the Collective bands throughout every region of the UK, they were replaced by the primary school project, Pop Connection. This has since been replaced by iSingPOP. iSingPOP works in primary schools and will spend a week teaching all the children a number of songs (usually 7) as a choir and the next week will perform these songs in their local church or activity hall/centre with an audience. They also have a <b>recording</b> <b>day</b> to make their very own album.|$|E
5000|$|Coke Studios season 9 {{became one}} of the most {{anticipated}} series, after the immensely positive reception from previous season. The change of format drew wide attention leading to the speculations that having six music directors on the show would bring chaos, record producer Faisal Rafi said that [...] "multiple-producer idea, if implemented, will be the last nail in the coffin," [...] he went on to say that,"Producers are selfish people. They wouldn’t want others to share their limelight." [...] In contradict to Rafi's statement, housband member and Coke Studio long-term drummer Gumby said, [...] "The initial success of Coke Studio lay in the fact that we had an ensemble of producers joining forces. People like Asad Ahmed, Omran Shafique and I used to work in coordination," [...] and said [...] "Hyatt did hold the reins but the show had our input as well." [...] Speaking on the format change he explained, [...] "it is ridiculous that a single producer churns out 25 to 30 songs alone." [...] Citing the example of the Shiraz Uppal-produced [...] "Tajdare-Haram" [...] in season eight, he said [...] "tracks like these prove that the formula works." [...] Receiving mixed reception from media on the change of format, Faisal Kapadia said, [...] "Bringing in new people was the need of the hour. It’s going to shake things up and keep audiences riveted. It is our job to assess what works and to make changes accordingly. And honestly, with or without us, Coke Studio identifies Pakistan’s pop industry. We don’t just own it; the whole nation does." [...] The death of Qawali singer Amjad Sabri brought wide media attention to series before it premier or any press release, when it was revealed that he was a debut featured artist on show before being killed in a target killing on 22 Jun 2016, just 25 days after he recorded his debut performance. His appearance on show {{became one of}} the most awaited performances on the Coke Studio. In an interview Faisal said, [...] "On <b>recording</b> <b>day,</b> after a small briefing session, we skipped the rehearsal and went straight into recording. Sabri started singing in his grand sonorous voice and blew everyone away. We all cried that night. These two masters took us to a very different journey, a journey we can never forget. Just 25 days later, Sabri is not with us. We still can’t believe it." [...] Sabri became the first featured-artist whose performance was aired posthumously.|$|E

40|$|The {{hippocampus}} is {{a region}} of the brain which {{plays a major role}} in encoding spatial and episodic memory. The hippocampus is divided in to two main subregions, dorsal and ventral. These subregions are connected, but their functional organization remains widely unknown. Place cells are cells of the hippocampus which fire in a specific spatial area and help create a mental map of our surroundings. Place cells have been seen to remain constant during slight fluctuations in surroundings, but completely remap in response to large fluctuations in the environment. There is little known about the relatively few place cells in the ventral hippocampus. This project used single unit electrodes to record from one place cell at a time over several weeks. The electrode recorded each time the place cell fired, and this data was compared to behavioral data. The electrode was moved each <b>recording</b> <b>day</b> to record from place cells in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus allowing us to shed light on the connectivity of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. My work focused on analyzing the exact placement of the single unit electrode on each <b>recording</b> <b>day.</b> This work was done by using the electrode track to calculate the location of the electrode on prior days. In order to find the electrode track the animal was sacrificed and its brain was extracted, sliced, stained, and imaged. The staining and imaging allowed us to visualize the location of the electrode on previous recording days...|$|E

The admission lasted about 6  weeks until remission. Due to renal complications of lithium, the medication regime was changed to quetiapine and lamotrigine during the admission.|$|E
40|$|KLFromRecordingDays allows {{measurement}} of Kullback–Leibler (KL) distances between 2 D probability distributions of vocal acoustic features. Greater KL distance measures reflect increased phonological divergence across the vocalizations compared. The software {{has been used}} to compare *. wav file recordings made by Sound Analysis Recorder 2011 of songbird vocalizations pre- and post-drug and surgical manipulations. Recordings from individual animals in *. wav format are first organized into subdirectories by <b>recording</b> <b>day</b> and then segmented into individual syllables uttered and acoustic features of these syllables using Sound Analysis Pro 2011 (SAP). KLFromRecordingDays uses syllable acoustic feature data output by SAP to a MySQL table to generate and compare “template” (typically pre-treatment) and “target” (typically post-treatment) probability distributions. These distributions are a series of virtual 2 D plots of the duration of each syllable (as x-axis) to each of 13 other acoustic features measured by SAP for that syllable (as y-axes). Differences between “template” and “target” probability distributions for each acoustic feature are determined by calculating KL distance, a measure of divergence of the target 2 D distribution pattern from that of the template. KL distances and the mean KL distance across all acoustic features are calculated for each <b>recording</b> <b>day</b> and output to an Excel spreadsheet. Resulting data for individual subjects may then be pooled across treatment groups and graphically summarized and used for statistical comparisons. Because SAP-generated MySQL files are accessed directly, data limits associated with spreadsheet output are avoided, and the totality of vocal output over weeks may be objectively analyzed all at once. The software has been useful for measuring drug effects on songbird vocalizations and assessing recovery from damage to regions of vocal motor cortex. It may be useful in studies employing other species, and as part of speech therapies tracking progress in producing distinct speech sounds in isolation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday, {{there are}} {{millions}} of surveillance cameras monitoring and <b>recording</b> <b>day</b> to day activities of people in the sake of safety and security of general public. However, like double-edged sword, there are both pros and cons when using such technology to protect people. Some of the advantages like detecting abnormal behaviors, identifying theft attempts of evidence for crime scene, etc., are overrun by the abilities of abusing the same technology in several ways due to the miniaturization and lack of limits or controls on their use. Especially miniaturization with latest technological development has enabled setting and hiding those cameras beyond the imaginations. Therefore in this paper we proposed a method to protect people from monitoring and recording their behaviors without consent and control illegal usage while enabling a method to distinguish legal cameras from fake...|$|E
40|$|The {{pairing of}} {{dynamical}} systems theory and complexity science brings novel concepts and methods {{to the study}} of infant motor development. Accordingly, this longitudinal case study presents a new approach to characterizing the dynamics of infant limb and vocalization behaviors. A single infant’s vocalizations and limb movements were recorded from 51 -days to 305 -days of age. On each <b>recording</b> <b>day,</b> accelerometers were placed on all four of the infant’s limbs and an audio recorder was worn on the child’s chest. Using nonlinear time series analysis methods, such as recurrence quantification analysis and Allan factor, we quantified changes in the stability and multiscale properties of the infant’s behaviors across age as well as how these dynamics relate across modalities and effectors. We observed that particular changes in these dynamics preceded or coincided with the onset of various developmental milestones. For example, the largest changes in vocalization dynamics preceded the onset of canonical babbling. The results show that nonlinear analyses can help to understand the functional co-development of different aspects of infant behavior...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} changes in steroid hormones across the menstrual cycle on the spinal nociceptive reflex. Method: We studied in 14 healthy women during the follicular and luteal phase the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII reflex), an objective neurophysiological method that allows exploring possible abnormal functioning of the pain-control system. The basal body temperature (BBT) {{was used to evaluate}} the different phases of the ovarian cycle. The menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ) was also applied for monitoring somatic and psychological symptoms during the cycle. Results: During the luteal phase, the threshold of the RIII reflex (Tr) and the psychophysical threshold for pain (Tp) were both significantly reduced compared with the follicular phase. Moreover, the reflex threshold in the luteal phase was negatively correlated to the total MDQ score of the <b>recording</b> <b>day.</b> Conclusions: A higher sensitivity to pain stimuli was observed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which probably results from a reduction in the inhibitory descending control on spinal nociceptive flexion reflex. Complex neuromodulatory interactions of ovarian steroids with other systems of neurotransmission (especially serotonergic) may account for these observations. Key words: gender, pain, steroid hormones, menstrual cycle, nociceptive flexion reflex, threshold.
