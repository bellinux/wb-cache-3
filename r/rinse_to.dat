5000|$|In 1913-1914, {{just before}} World War I, {{there was a}} vogue for dyed brightly {{coloured}} hair in exotic shades such as blue, violet or emerald. This started in Paris and then spread to other cities such as London. [...] In 1924, the first celebrity hairdresser, Monsieur Antoine, dyed his dog's hair blue. An influential client, Lady Elsie De Wolfe Mendl, took up the same style and this started a new fad. [...] Later in the 20th century, mature ladies had a blue <b>rinse</b> <b>to</b> conceal grey hair. The Queen Mother was the trend-setter and the peak of popularity for this fashion was the period following the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|The bolsita {{is always}} washed and dried between each use, as a dry bolsita {{produces}} the best results. It is advisable {{for anyone who}} likes to make coffee often {{to have more than}} one filter. When the coffee is made, the bolsita is rinsed afterwards with water to remove the coffee grains. Soap or detergent is never used for cleaning because they would leave an aftertaste in the coffee. In time, oils from the coffee grounds, e.g. caffeol, dye the cotton bolsita; however, the taste of the brewed coffee remains unaffected. These oils can be dissolved and removed by scrubbing the bolsita with salt about once a month, followed by a thorough <b>rinse</b> <b>to</b> remove all of the salt. A properly cared-for bolsita lasts many months.|$|E

5000|$|Short, tight curls with a poodle cut {{known as}} [...] "short bangs" [...] were very popular, favored by women such {{as first lady}} Mamie Eisenhower. Henna was a popular hair dye in the 1950s in the US; in the popular TV comedy series I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball (according to her husband’s statement) “used henna <b>rinse</b> <b>to</b> dye her brown hair red.” The poodle cut was also made popular by Audrey Hepburn. In the 1953 film Roman Holiday, Audrey Hepburn's {{character}} had short hair known as a “gamine-style” pixie cut, which accentuated her long neck, and which was copied by many women. In the film Sabrina, her character appears initially in long plain hair while attending culinary school, but returns to her Paris home with a chic, short, face-framing [...] "Paris hairstyle", which again was copied by many women. When the rage among women was for the “blond bombshell” hair style, Hepburn stuck to her dark brown hair color and refused to dye her hair for any film.Jacqueline Kennedy wore a short hair style for her wedding in 1953, while later she sported a “bouffant”; together with the larger beehive and shorter bubble cut, this {{became one of the}} most popular women's hairstyles of the 1950s. Grace Kelly favored a mid-length bob style, also influential. There were exceptions, however, and some women, such as Bettie Page, favored long, straight dark locks and a fringe; such women were known as [...] "Beat girls". In the mid-1950s, a high ponytail became popular with teenage girls, often tied with a scarf. The ponytail was seen on the first Barbie dolls, in 1959; a few years later Barbies with beehives appeared. The “artichoke cut”, which was invented by Jacques Dessange, was specially designed for Brigitte Bardot. Compact coiffures were popular in the 1950s as less importance was given to hairstyling, although a new look was stylized by Christian Dior’s fashion revolution after the war.|$|E

In South Africa, Xhosa people use a {{poultice}} made from the whole plant parts of the plant to treat boils, inflammed purulent wounds and swellings (Afolayan et al. 2008). A hot poultice of leaf is used to treat wounds and swellings in La Reunion, and tea of the leaf is taken as a nervine tonic and used as a taenicide and for profuse menstruation (Sharma and Ali 1999). A dried powder or an infusion of the leaves and roots is used to clean wounds and sores in Lesotho (Afolayan et al. 2008). Tea of the leaf is used for treating dry, irritative cough and bronchitis (Ishtiaq et al. 2012). A decoction of the leaves and roots is also used as a hair <b>rinse</b> <b>to</b> remove dandruff and to soften the hair, and tea of the leaf is also used to clean out the mother’s system after childbirth (Mukul 2012). Seeds are demulcent, used to treat cough and ulcers in the bladder (Sharma and Ali 1999).

The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of a novel nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) desensitizing oral <b>rinse</b> <b>to</b> occlude dentine tubules compared to selected commercially available desensitizing oral rinses. Methods. 25 caries-free extracted molars were sectioned into 1 [*]mm thick dentine discs. The dentine discs (n= 25) were etched with 6 % citric acid for 2 minutes and rinsed with distilled water, prior to a 30 -second application of test and control oral rinses. Evaluation was by (1) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the dentine surface and (2) fluid flow measurements through a dentine disc. Results. Most of the oral rinses failed to adequately cover the dentine surface apart from the nHa oral rinse. However the hydroxyapatite, 1. 4 % potassium oxalate, and arginine/PVM/MA copolymer oral rinses, appeared to be relatively more effective than the nHA test and negative control rinses (potassium nitrate) in relation to a reduction in fluid flow measurements. Conclusions. Although the novel nHA oral rinse demonstrated the ability to occlude the dentine tubules and reduce the fluid flow measurements, some of the other oral rinses appeared to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in fluid flow through the dentine disc, in particular the arginine/PVM/MA copolymer oral rinse...|$|E
