40|$|This paper {{presents}} a GIS-based research approach to investigating {{the status and}} dynamics of spawning areas of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir (within Volgograd Region), {{one of the largest}} inland fishery water bodies in the South of Russia. The spawning areas were considered in terms of the concept of ecotone origin, of the highly dynamic aquatic-terrestrial transitional environment in which temporary flooding is the main factor determining the diversity of spawning habitats, <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions,</b> as well as ecosystem productivity. The processing and interpretation of Landsat images for the spring and low-water seasons for years between 2005 and 2016, in combination with other data (large-scale topographic maps, fishery research, and scientific papers) allowed revealing the location of main spawning areas within the reservoir’s Upper section and to calculate their areas. For three case study sites located on the left bank of the reservoir, the main natural and anthropogenic factors determining the spawning conditions were identified. Retrospective analysis and synthesis of data on young fish composition and abundance between 1980 and today confirmed the importance of these sites for fish recruitment as well as the opportunities for their improvement by means of restoration measures. The output maps present the spatial distribution of the spawning areas and the environmental factors directly or indirectly affecting fish <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions.</b> The most impacted areas have been determined, including the areas affected by abrasion, siltation and eutrophication processes, as well as pollution of the aquatic zone and water protection zone of the reservoir.

This study asks if increased geomorphic complexity increases <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions</b> of sown seeds or affects post-dispersal natural seedling densities. Location: Vindel River catchment, northern Sweden. Methods: We selected seven study streams with paired reaches that differed in {{the degree to which}} geomorphic complexity was restored. Basic reaches used simple restoration methods while enhanced reaches additionally added large boulders and woody debris. We sowed seeds of six species at ten locations in each reach in 2014 and counted the number of seedlings after 8 wk and the number of naturally occurring seedlings in a plot adjacent to the sowing locations in 2013 and 2014. Using factor analysis based on 34 complexity measurements, overall geomorphic complexity was quantified for eight of the 14 reaches. Results: Total numbers of sown (2014) and natural seedlings (2013 and 2014) summed per reach did not differ between restoration types when tested pair-wise. Enhanced restoration did not always significantly increase geomorphic complexity, which differed considerably between the streams. More complex reaches were steeper, had larger size sediment and more nutrient-poor soils. Total recruitment of sown species significantly decreased with increasing complexity. Numbers of natural seedlings differed considerably from 2013 to 2014, but were not related to complexity. In 2014, a potential parent plant of the same species occurred within the same plot for 71. 8 % of the natural seedlings that could be identified. Conclusions: The recruitment of sown seeds was affected by overall geomorphic complexity rather than by the enhanced restoration. The absence of a correlation between geomorphic complexity and natural seedlings could indicate that natural seedling dynamics are not solely determined by <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions,</b> but also by dispersal...|$|E

Surprisingly, the fact that perennials may replace an investment in large seeds by the allocation to vegetative propagation {{has not yet been}} investigated as an additional pathway enabling species coexistence. We focused on the mechanisms of coexistence in Carex elata and C. elongata, two co-occurring clonal sedges dominant in European swamp alder forests. We asked the following questions: i) Is the number of germinated seeds a better predictor of species coexistence than the total number of seeds? ii) What <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions</b> and competition rules determine vegetative sprouting to be an alternative to large, competitively superior seeds? We measured several species functional traits related to the colonisation and fitness of perennials. To examine the competitive hierarchy between species and microsite species preferences, we analysed the effects of environmental factors and plant densities on fitness-related traits using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Then, using a series of spatially explicit simulations partly parameterised based on the field measurement, we evaluated the importance of seed and ramet propagation and <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions</b> for long-term species coexistence. SEM indicated a competitive hierarchy and a large overlap in microsite preferences between species. As a response to our initial questions we found that: i) Only differences in the numbers of germinated seeds, allowed the two species to coexist. If we consider only differences in the total number of seeds, the superior competitor (Carex elata) outcompeted the inferior competitor (C. elongata) in all scenarios. This is because the former produced about three-times as many seeds as the latter. ii) We show that vegetative sprouting represents an additional pathway for the seed size-number trade-off when the competitive superiority of species is attributed to vegetative propagation. This is another way that a species deals with the omnipresent seeds of other species. Taken together, our study demonstrates that differences in seed performance, coupled with differences in vegetative propagation related to competitive ability, are an additional mechanism allowing the coexistence of {{perennial plants}}...|$|E

40|$|Bone marrow-derived {{progenitor}} {{cells have}} recently {{been shown to be}} involved in the development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has profound stimulatory effects on intimal hyperplasia, but it is unknown whether these effects involve progenitor cell recruitment. In this study we found that although TGF-β had no direct effect on progenitor cell <b>recruitment,</b> <b>conditioned</b> media derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) stimulated with TGF-β induced migration of both total bone marrow (BM) cells and BM-mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and also induced MSC differentiation into smooth muscle like cells. Furthermore, overexpression of the signaling molecule Smad 3 in VSMC via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (AdSmad 3) enhanced the TGF-β's chemotactic effect. Microarray analysis of VSMC stimulated by TGF-β/AdSmad 3 revealed monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) as a likely factor responsible for progenitor cell recruitment. We then demonstrated that TGF-β through Smad 3 phosphorylation induced a robust expression of MCP- 1 in VSMC. Recombinant MCP- 1 mimicked the stimulatory effect of conditioned media on BM and MSC migration. In the rat carotid injury model, Smad 3 overexpression significantly increased MCP- 1 expression after vascular injury, consistent with our in vitro results. Interestingly, TGF-β/Smad 3 -induced MCP- 1 was completely blocked by both Ro- 32 - 0432 and rotterlin, suggesting protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) may play a role in TGF-β/Smad 3 -induced MCP- 1 expression. In summary, our data demonstrate that TGF-β, through Smad 3 and PKCδ, stimulates VSMC production of MCP- 1, which is a chemoattractant for bone marrow-derived cells, specifically MSC. Manipulation of this signaling system may provide a novel approach to inhibition of intimal hyperplasia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} fatty acids and retinoic acid (carotene) on brown adipose tissue {{differentiation}} are mediated by {{activation of the}} transcription factors PPARγ and PPARα in combination with RXR. There is good support for the idea that activated PPARγ promotes adipogenesis also in brown adipose tissue. However, the issue is more complex concerning the full differentiation to the brown adipocyte phenotype, particularly {{the expression of the}} brown-fat-specific marker UCP 1. The effect of norepinephrine on PPARγ gene expression, at least in-vitro, is negative, PPARγ-ablated brown adipose tissue can express UCP 1, and PGC- 1 α coactivates other transcription factors (including PPARα); thus, the significance of PPARγ for the physiological control of UCP 1 gene expression is not settled. However, importantly, the effects of PPAR agonists demonstrate the existence of a pathway for brown adipose tissue recruitment that is not dependent on chronic adrenergic stimulation and may be active in <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions</b> such as prenatal and prehibernation recruitment. The ability of chronic PPARγ agonist treatment to promote the occurrence of brown-fat features in white adipose tissue-like depots implies a role in anti-obesity treatment, but this will only be effective if the extra thermogenic capacity is activated by adrenergic stimulation...|$|E

40|$|Prolonged {{storage of}} seeds {{on the plant}} is called serotiny. It is well {{represented}} in fireprone, nutrient-poor and seasonally dry, woody vegetation in Australia, South Africa and North America. Serotiny maximizes the number of seeds available {{for the next generation}} by storing successive seed crops and protecting them from granivores, agents of decay and fire heat. It is an advantage when annual seed production is insufficient for self-replacement in any single year and greatly increases the range of fire frequencies tolerated. While serotiny is a form of environmentally enforced dormancy, it has little in common with soil storage of seeds in terms of its ecology and trade-offs. Our models have shown that optimal levels of serotiny depend on fire frequency in relation to lifespan of the species, probability of interfire recruitment and the extent of fluctuations in fire intervals. Serotiny is adaptive when the cue for seed release, usually fire, also creates superior conditions for seedling establishment. For serotiny to be an advantage over soil storage, it is essential that any fire is followed by reliable <b>recruitment</b> <b>conditions.</b> Intermediate levels of serotiny are favored as fire intervals approach the lifespan of the species, or if there is a substantial resource cost at short intervals. As the probability of interfire recruitment increases, maximum population growth shifts from strong serotiny under short fire intervals to no serotiny at long fire intervals. As variation about the mean fire interval increases, the optimal level of serotiny declines slightly...|$|E
40|$|An {{application}} of the Spatial Ecosystem And POpulation DYnamics Model (SEAPODYM) is developed for the North Atlantic albacore (Thunnus alalunga) population. We investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of this species, distinguishing the influences of environment and international fishing. Incorporating historical data (1960 - 2008), a maximum likelihood approach allows the estimation of biological parameters (thermal and oxygen tolerance) and stock spatial distribution varying over time. Juvenile albacore are predicted in warm surface waters, whereas adults inhabit cooler and deeper waters. Positive correlations between juveniles and tropical large-scale climate indices highlight the importance of environmental drivers when estimating stock recruitment biology and spatiotemporal distribution. A methodology is proposed to use SEAPODYM outputs to estimate stock abundance and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). MSY is computed {{taking into account the}} spatial dynamics of the species and the environmental variability and is based on a mechanistic modelling of larval recruitment. MSY estimates converge towards an asymptotic value (15 997 t) of the same magnitude than standard stock assessment estimates conducted for the international tuna commission. In agreement with all assessment studies, the stock status is estimated from overfished in the 1990 s to recovered in the 2000 s.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A recent {{decrease}} in the George River caribou herd ecruitment was caused both by an increasing calf winter mortality since 1977 {{and an increase in}} their summer mortality since 1984. A reduction in pregnancy rate could also be partly responsible for a decline in gross recruitment. Evaluation of net recruitment shows that the rate of increase of the herd has been negative since 1984. The probable causes of the decline involve the negative effects and interrelation of various factors: decline of the physical condition of females, habitat deterioration on the current calving grounds (former summer range), increase in energy expendituI'es related to more extensive movements, delayed birth dates, increase in density within their range and especially on calving rounds, increase in wolf populations and exceptionally high snow accumulation during the 1980 - 81 winter.
