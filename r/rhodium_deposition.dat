40|$|The {{structure}} of rhodium films electrodeposited on (111) surfaces of gold was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, x-ray scattering measurements and {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM). A {{better understanding of the}} <b>rhodium</b> <b>deposition</b> process and film structure was gained. After mechanical polishing the Au(111) crystal was electropolished and annealed in an hydrogen flame. These crystal preparation procedures yielded a gold single crystal with electrochemical characteristics comparable to previously published cyclic voltammagrams. The rhodium film was then deposited electrochemically from a 0. 5 mM rhodium chloride and 0. 5 M perchloric acid solution at 100 mV versus SCE at 70 C until the desired amount of charge had passed. The deposition of rhodium is a 3 electron process following this electrode reaction, [RhCl{sub 6 }]{sup 3 {minus}} (aq) + 3 e{sup {minus}} {r_arrow} Rh (s) + 6 Cl{sup {minus}} (aq). X-ray measurements were performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory beamlines X 10 a and X 25 using focused, monochromatic radiation ({lambda} = 1. 494 and 1. 282 angstroms, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|A gold {{polycrystalline}} electrode modified with rhodium {{species was}} characterized by electrochemical and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) techniques in moderately alkaline medium. The Au/Rh electrodes were prepared utilizing a spontaneous deposition process (SDP) of rhodium adlayer on the gold surface. In particular, <b>rhodium</b> <b>deposition</b> was obtained in non-deaerated 50 mM HClO 4 solution containing 10 mM RhCl 3 at open circuit for a given time. The modified gold electrode with adsorbed rhodium species (Au/ Rh) exhibit higher electrochemical activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The effects on the electrochemical activity of the Au/Rh electrode such as: rhodium coverage, pH, electrolyte composition and applied potentials were critically evaluated and discussed. An optimized pulsed chronoamperometric detection technique for the analytical determination of several mono- and di-protic organic acids such as acetic, tartaric, oxalic, malic, etc., was successfully proposed. An average film composition of AU 93 (+/- 1) Rh- 7 +/- 1 was evaluated by XPS technique. The film composition remains unchanged after various electrode treatments such as cycling of potentials and/or polarization conditions for long times in alkaline medium. Thus, the adsorbed rhodium oxide particles show a good chemical and mechanical stability despite the conditions of electrochemical treatment of the electrode surface...|$|E
40|$|A thinlayer {{of carbon}} nanofibers (CNFs) was {{synthesized}} on a thin polycrystalline rhodium (Rh) metal layer by decomposing ethylene {{in the presence}} of hydrogen. Interaction of Rh crystals with carbon results in fragmentation and formation of Rh-nanoparticles, facilitating CNF growth. CNFs are immobilized on the surface by an apparently amorphous intermediate layer containing both Rh and C. Maximum CNF growth was achieved at intermediate hydrogen concentrations. A CNF growth mechanism by (sub-) surface diffusion of carbon on Rh is suggested. Carbon nanofibers/tubes (CNF/Ts) are finding applications in e. g. electronic devices, electrochemical capacitors, catalyst support layers in microreactors, additives to polymers and super hydrophobic coatings. Controlled growth of these structures is important to realize application in nanoscale devices. Synthesis of CNF/Ts by catalytic chemical vapor deposition method offers high rate of carbongrowth and easy control of the reaction conditions [1]. Fe, Co, Ni are widely studied metals for CNF/T growth, however, the presence of residual ferro-magnetic catalyst particles in the CNF/Ts may be an obstacle for research on the magnetic properties of CNF/Ts, as well as for applications in electronic devices, electrochemical capacitors and catalysts. In addition to ferro-magnetic metals, also Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, Ru, Re, Rh, Ir and Os enable CNF/T growth. So far, exclusively Pd was studied for growing CNF/Ts on thin metal films. In the present work, we report on synthesis CNFs on thin Rh layers, exploring the effect of the conditions on CNF growth. A 100 nm polycrystalline rhodiumlayer was deposited at room temperature on a single crystalline silicon wafer (Ø 100 mm) using DC-sputtering technique. Prior to <b>rhodium</b> <b>deposition,</b> a 15 nm thick titanium adhesion layer was sputter deposited on the silicon wafer. CNF formation was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz reactor. The fresh wafers were heated in nitrogen (100 ml/min) from room temperature to 600 °C (6 °C/min), followed by reduction in H 2 (5 vol. %) for 15 min. After flushing with N 2 for 5 min, ethylene was introduced, growing CNFs during 30 min. The concentration of ethylene (10 vol. %) in the feed was kept constant in all experiments, whereas the hydrogen concentration was varied between 0 and 20 vol. % (balance N 2, total flowrate 100 ml/min). Pretreatment of fresh wafers with H 2 results in significant sintering of Rh grains from ∼ 10 nm to ∼ 85 nm, {{as can be seen in}} Fig. 1. XRD analysis of the wafers confirmed this as the intensity of the Rh(1 1 1) peak-width decreased significantly (Table 1). The only phase in the layer was metallic Rh according to XRD. Carbon deposition on the Rh surface resulted in the formation of CNFs with metal particles in the tips (Fig. 2), containing exclusively Rh and carbon, according TEM–EDX. This confirms that Rh particles are responsible for the formation of CNFs and no other metals contribute to the growt...|$|E
