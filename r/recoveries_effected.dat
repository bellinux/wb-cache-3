40|$|Wearable {{sensors and}} {{healthcare}} devices use small lightweight batteries to power their typical operations of monitoring and tracking. It becomes absolutely vital to effectively utilise {{all the available}} battery charge for device longevity between charges. The electrochemical <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> enables the extraction of more power from the battery when implementing idle times in between use cycles, and {{has been used to}} develop various power management techniques. However, there is no evidence concerning the actual increase in available power that can be attained using the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect.</b> Also, this property cannot be generalised on all the battery chemistries since it is an innate phenomenon, relying on the anode/cathode material. Indeed recent developments suggest that <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> does not exist at all. This paper presents experimental results to verify the presence and level of the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> in commonly used battery chemistries in wearable sensors and healthcare devices. The results have revealed that the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> significantly does exist in certain batteries, and importantly we show that it is also comprised of two different time constants. This novel finding has important implications for the development of power management techniques that utilise the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> with application in a large range of battery devices...|$|R
40|$|With the {{perennial}} demand for longer runtime of battery-powered Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs), several techniques {{have been proposed}} to increase the battery runtime. One such class of techniques exploiting the battery <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> phenomenon claims that performing an intermittent discharge instead of a continuous discharge will increase the usable battery capacity. Several works {{in the areas of}} embedded systems and wireless sensor networks have assumed the existence of this <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> and proposed different power management techniques in the form of power supply architectures (multiple battery setup) and communication protocols (burst mode transmission) in order to exploit it. However, until now, a systematic experimental evaluation of the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> has not been performed with real battery cells, using high accuracy battery testers to confirm the existence of this recovery phenomenon. In this paper, a systematic evaluation procedure is developed to verify the existence of this battery <b>recovery</b> <b>effect.</b> Using our evaluation procedure we investigated Alkaline, Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery chemistries, which are commonly used as power supplies for WSN applications. Our experimental results do not show any evidence of the aforementioned <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> in these battery chemistries. In particular, our results show a significant deviation from the stochastic battery models, which were used by many power management techniques. Therefore, the existing power management approaches that rely on this <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> do not hold in practice. Instead of a battery <b>recovery</b> <b>effect,</b> our experimental results show the existence of the rate capacity effect, which is the reduction of usable battery capacity with higher discharge power, to be the dominant electrochemical phenomenon that should be considered for maximizing the runtime of WSN applications. We outline power management techniques that minimize the rate capacity effect in order to obtain a higher energy output from the battery...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} how compensation type and failure type explain the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> of compensation, using a meta-analysis (Study 1) and an experiment (Study 2). Drawing on resource exchange theory, we propose new classifications for both compensation and failure type and find three major results. First, {{consistent with our}} matching hypothesis, the strongest <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> is generally observed when compensation represents a resource similar to the failure {{it is supposed to}} offset, that is, immediate monetary compensation for a monetary failure, exchange for a flawed product, reperformance for a failed service, and psychological compensation for lack of attention. Surprisingly, lack of attention may also be rectified by the other compensation types. Second, consistent with our intertemporal choice hypothesis, immediate monetary compensation is generally more effective than delayed monetary compensation. Yet, this effect also varies with failure type. Third, resource-based classifications explain the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> of compensation better than current classifications of compensation and failure type. As a theoretical contribution, the resource-based classifications help to explain the fluctuating effect sizes of compensation reported in prior research. From a managerial point of view, practitioners can choose the appropriate compensation type for a failure, one that repays in kind what customers have lost. As a result, companies achieve stronger <b>recovery</b> <b>effects</b> without additional costs...|$|R

The relationships between a system’s frequency and the frequency regulation capacity of the generating units and the interruptible loads are different. In this paper, an index for the frequency <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> is proposed based on the static frequency adjustment coefficient of the interruptible load and the adjustment coefficients of the generating units, and an optimization model of an interruptible load participating in primary frequency regulation is built with the objective of minimizing the cost of the primary frequency regulation reserve that uses the system’s frequency <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> as a constraint.

However, the frequency response provided by emulated inertia cannot completely avoid UFLS. Decreasing the amount of emulated inertia reduces not only the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> but also frequency support provided by wind farms.

A specific advantage of supercapacitors over traditional batteries is their performance over large numbers of discharge cycles. Likewise, in the case of wearable devices, it is essential to efficiently manage the available power. Supercapacitors exhibit a small <b>recovery</b> <b>effect,</b> in part due to ion diffusion.

One of the actual disadvantages for this technology is the highly pronounced rate capacity effect, which reduces the available capacity to be discharged when high currents are used. This drawback might be addressed by the use of the capacity <b>recovery</b> <b>effect,</b> which by introducing relaxation periods between consecutive pulse discharges of the battery, increases the available discharge capacity of the cell.

40|$|Neurogenesis in {{the adult}} dentate gyrus (DC) is {{decreased}} in rodent models for mood disorders. Mood stabilizers including lithium (Li) and valproate (VPA) increase it. These increasing effects of Li and VPA on neurogenesis in adult DG {{are considered to be}} one of the therapeutic actions of Li and VPA, but their molecular mechanism remains unclear. We have already reported that Li recovers the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone (DEX), an agonist of glucocorticoid receptor, on the proliferation of adult rat DG-derived neural precursor cells (ADP) via GSK- 3 beta and beta-catenin pathway. Following it, here we investigated the mechanism underlying the <b>recovery</b> <b>effects</b> of VPA on DEX-induced decrease of ADP proliferation. VPA is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). However, Trichostatin A, a HDAC inhibitor, had no effect on ADP proliferation. In contrast, SB 415286, a specific GSK- 3 beta inhibitor, recovered DEX-induced decrease of ADP proliferation. In addition, quercetin (Que), a beta-catenin pathway inhibitor, abolished such a <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> of VPA. Moreover, nuclear p-catenin and the expression of cyclin D 1 were altered by DEX. VPA and Que like the proliferation. Moreover, VPA increased the phosphorylation of Ser(9), which is known as the inhibitory phosphorylation site of GSK- 3 beta. These suggest that HDAC is not involved in the <b>recovery</b> <b>effect</b> of VPA on ADP proliferation and that VPA recovers the inhibitory effects of DEX via increasing the phosphorylation of Ser 9 on GsK- 3 beta and following up-regulation of beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, GSK- 3 beta and beta-catenin pathway might play a role in the increasing effects of VPA on neurogenesis on adult DC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
