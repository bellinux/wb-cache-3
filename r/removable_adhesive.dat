5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} redacting confidential material from a paper document before its public release involves overwriting portions of text {{with a wide}} black pen, followed by photocopying the result—the obscured text may be recoverable from the original. Alternatively opaque [...] "cover up tape" [...] or [...] "redaction tape", opaque, <b>removable</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape in various widths, may be applied before photocopying.|$|E
50|$|The tools {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and <b>removable</b> <b>adhesive</b> tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we applied {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM), microanalysis and Raman spectroscopy to study the fungi inhabiting a richly illuminated parchment document and the damage induced by their activity. To that aim we collected samples of fungal mycelium from the deteriorated areas onto a <b>removable</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape. SEM analysis of the adhesive tape samples showed the co-occurrence of several species of fungi. One strain closely reminding Acremonium species was observed only in the tape micrographs but no agar cultures were obtained. Its fungal structures showed the production of abundant oxalates with an outstanding leaching of the calcium-based materials of parchment (typically manufactured with gypsum and lime). Needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate produced by the fungus forming a sort of “cage” around conidial slimy heads were documented. As a result, the areas affected by moulds were weakened, stained and characterized by a powdery patina rich in calcium. Confocal µ-Raman confirmed the presence of oxalates while EDS showed the presence of calcium in crystals. We conclude that the defacement of the parchment was due to both collagenolytic activity, and to the biotransformation of calcium based minerals by fungi...|$|E

50|$|Peelable - Adhesion {{is fairly}} strong {{and will not}} fall off in normal circumstances, but the label can be removed {{relatively}} easily without tearing the base stock or leaving adhesive behind on the old surface. The adhesive is usually strong enough to be applied again elsewhere. This type is frequently known as 'removable'. There are {{many different types of}} <b>removable</b> <b>adhesives,</b> some are almost permanent, some are almost 'ultra peelable'.|$|R
25|$|Masking tape is a {{pressure-sensitive}} tape made with an easy-to-tear thin paper, and fly {{back and a}} <b>removable</b> pressure-sensitive <b>adhesive.</b> In 1925, Richard G. Drew, {{an employee of the}} Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), invented the first masking tape, a two-inch-wide tan paper strip backed with a light, pressure-sensitive adhesive. Drew filed U.S. patent #1,760,820 on May 28, 1928 and was issued to him on May 27, 1930.|$|R

50|$|The {{point of}} exiting {{is what is}} known as the stoma. For {{greatest}} success and to minimize negative effects, it is preferable to perform this procedure as low down in the tract as possible, as this allows the maximal amount of natural digestion to occur before eliminating fecal matter from the body. The stoma is usually covered with a <b>removable</b> pouching system (<b>adhesive</b> or mechanical) that collects and contains the output for later disposal. Modern pouching systems enable most individuals to resume normal activities and lifestyles after surgery, often with no outward physical evidence of the stoma or its pouching system.|$|R
40|$|Reconstituting {{tissues from}} their {{cellular}} building blocks facilitates the modeling of morphogenesis, homeostasis and disease in vitro. Here we describe DNA-programmed assembly of cells (DPAC), {{a method to}} reconstitute the multicellular organization of organoid-like tissues having programmed size, shape, composition and spatial heterogeneity. DPAC uses dissociated cells that are chemically functionalized with degradable oligonucleotide 'Velcro', allowing rapid, specific and reversible cell adhesion to other surfaces coated with complementary DNA sequences. DNA-patterned substrates function as <b>removable</b> and <b>adhesive</b> templates, and layer-by-layer DNA-programmed assembly builds arrays of tissues into the third dimension above the template. DNase releases completed arrays of organoid-like microtissues from the template concomitant with full embedding {{in a variety of}} extracellular matrix (ECM) gels. DPAC positions subpopulations of cells with single-cell spatial resolution and generates cultures several centimeters long. We used DPAC to explore the impact of ECM composition, heterotypic cell-cell interactions and patterns of signaling heterogeneity on collective cell behaviors.

40|$|The tritium {{profiles}} in a TFTR graphite tile exposed to D-D plasmas {{and in a}} JET graphite tile employed during the first tritium campaigns in 1991 were examined in detail by full combustion, thermogravimetry, and thermal desorption. The combustion measurements showed {{that most of the}} tritium, i. e. > 98. 9 %, is trapped in a co-deposited and an implanted layer of less than 50 #mu#m thickness. The remainder of the tritium, i. e. < 1. 1 %, was found to be distributed homogeneously throughout the whole tile. The tritium distribution {{on the surface of the}} tiles is not homogeneous; measurements indicate that the concentration varies by a factor of up to 10. A significant fraction of the tritium was found in the gaps between the tiles. The concentrations of tritium on the upper edge of the lateral side of a tile were as high as 30 % of those at the plasma-exposed side. However, the total tritium on the lateral sides of the tiles is only 5 % of the tritium on the tile surface. A fraction of the co-deposited layer was found to be easily <b>removable</b> with <b>adhesive</b> tape from the tile surface. Graphite disks from the plasma-exposed side of JET tiles heated up to 1100 deg. C under a helium carrier gas containing 0. 1 % hydrogen showed the highest tritium release rate at about 850 deg. C. The agreement between tritium measurements by full combustion and thermal release was reasonably good. More than 95 % of the tritium in the co-deposited layer of graphite tiles can be released by prolonged heating at about 400 deg. C under a stream of moist synthetic air. The implications of the observations and measurements carried out in this work on the development of detritiation methods for contaminated tiles are discussed.
