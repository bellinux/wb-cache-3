5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living <b>room</b> <b>floor</b> had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing <b>room</b> <b>floor</b> in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} {{three games in}} four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, Orlando Magic 4–0). They {{defeated}} the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 season. Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker <b>room</b> <b>floor</b> with the game ball.|$|E

Under interrogation, Tessa confesses to killing Greg but denies Ruby was at Lake Okobogee that night. Mulder and Scully return to the Morris' house, and, finding it deserted, discover the binary-covered pieces of paper laid out across the living <b>room</b> <b>floor,</b> forming an image of Ruby's face. The agents return to Lake Okobogee, where they find Darlene and Kevin in the nearby woods. A motorcycle gang appears, and as Mulder hurries to rescue Kevin from their wake, Scully discovers Ruby nearby.|$|E
5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference <b>room</b> <b>floor</b> with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E

25|$|The frantic pace of The Tracey Ullman Show {{was one of}} the {{key factors}} in her {{decision}} to give up television. That show was shot in front of a live studio audience and featured her playing on average three characters a week. She frequently wore layers of costuming to disguise herself. The prosthetic makeup was at times excessive.

25|$|Gehry {{was born}} Frank Owen Goldberg on February 28, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Sadie Thelma (née Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg. His father {{was born in}} Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, {{and his mother was}} a Polish Jewish immigrant. A {{creative}} child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan, with whom he would build little cities out of scraps of wood. With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living <b>room</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{fireplace}} hearth in {{the living}} room integrates boulders found on the site and upon which the house was built— ledge rock which protrudes up to a foot through the living <b>room</b> <b>floor</b> was left in place to demonstrably link the outside with the inside. Wright had initially intended that the ledge be cut flush with the floor, but this {{had been one of the}} Kaufmann family's favorite sunning spots, so Mr. Kaufmann suggested that it be left as it was. The stone floors are waxed, while the hearth is left plain, giving the impression of dry rocks protruding from a stream.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, {{the body}} of a 28th victim was found buried in a pit close to a {{barbecue}} grill in the backyard of the property: the victim was found wrapped within several plastic bags and wore a silver ring on the fourth finger of his left hand, indicating the possibility he had been married. One week later, on March 16, the skeletal remains of another victim were found buried beneath the joists of the dining <b>room</b> <b>floor,</b> bringing the total number of bodies exhumed at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue to 29. In April 1979, Gacy's vacant house was demolished.|$|E

25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} <b>room</b> <b>floor,</b> shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that {{appeared to have been}} inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E
25|$|They {{continued}} down river, hitting more rapids and cutting wood from {{trees along the}} bank for fuel. Captain Miller sent two men ahead in a boat to scout out for rocks and rapids, and the Shoshone proceeded behind them. They ran a particularly hazardous stretch at the Mountain Sheep section in Seven Devils Canyon. The boat was sucked into a whirlpool, and a huge wall of water came aboard, breaking into and nearly flooding the engine room, washing big chunks of cordwood all about the engine <b>room</b> <b>floor.</b> As {{the men in the}} engine room dodged these hazards, the Shoshone ran through a passage so narrow that {{there were only a few}} inches clearance between the rock walls on both sides of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|The hotel portion was {{condensed}} to 170 guest <b>rooms</b> on <b>floors</b> 12-18, {{with public}} <b>rooms</b> on <b>floor</b> 19. The hotel was entered {{through a small}} foyer {{on the ground floor}} facing Chancellor Court, with the lobby and public rooms on the remodeled 19th floor. The two domed ballrooms on that floor (the South and North Cameo rooms), were turned into the Ethel Barrymore Tea Room and a restaurant called Founders, with statues of Philadelphia fathers William Penn, Benjamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, and Charles Wilson Peale. The middle wing of the E-shaped building was removed from the guest <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> 12 to 18, and the back side was sealed up, creating an atrium. The historic 19th-floor Rose Ballroom atop this middle wing was retained, however, standing on seven-story stilts which ran through the atrium.|$|R

500|$|Time in the {{compound}} was spent killing defenders, [...] "moving carefully through {{the compound}}, room to <b>room,</b> <b>floor</b> to floor" [...] securing the women and children, clearing [...] "weapons stashes and barricades" [...] including a false door, and searching the compound for information. U.S. personnel recovered three Kalashnikov rifles and two pistols, ten computer hard drives, documents, DVDs, almost a hundred thumb drives, a dozen cell phones, and [...] "electronic equipment" [...] for later analysis.

In a sneak-peek clip from the episode, a patient is seen attacking Meredith, but it wasn't disclosed why the patient went after the Grey Sloan surgeon. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Footage of Ellen Pompeo's Dr. Meredith Grey being beat up by a patient and left for dead on a hospital <b>room</b> <b>floor</b> has been promoted with the admirable aggression of, well, a network promoting an event episode. There's a cheapness to stunt TV, sure. But there's also a crass beauty to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerr's {{first film}} role {{was in the}} British {{production}} Contraband in 1940, but her scenes were left on the cutting <b>room</b> <b>floor.</b> With her next two British films—Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of Love on the Dole, [...] "is not {{within a mile of}} Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E
