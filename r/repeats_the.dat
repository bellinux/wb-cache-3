5|$|In Shahîd's reconstruction, {{this event}} {{took place at}} Antioch on 13 April 244, while the emperor {{was on his way}} back to Rome from the Persian front. The 12th-century Byzantine {{historian}} Zonaras <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> story.|$|E
5|$|The soloist {{sings the}} {{recapitulation}} {{of the beginning}} similar to the first time, again on the pedal point, but <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> second line one more time, while the chorus sings about the hovering, as before.|$|E

5|$|The text is {{presented}} in six stanzas of nine lines each. It is in bar form, three lines form the Stollen, three the Abgesang, with the meter 6.6.5.6.6.5.7.8.6. The last line of the last stanza <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> first line of the first stanza. The song is written in the first person, addressing Jesus.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> border of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme and}} its broken seventh chord (G-B-D-F) which {{characterize}} this movement is stated {{first as a}} major seventh in the two first passages of the first section A with a discreet accompaniment. To finish this section, the theme arpeggiates a dominant seventh. In the second A section, the theme first <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> major seventh before developing into a minor seventh with a minor third in the second passage (G-B-D-F).|$|E

5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{conventional}} classroom learning, {{in which}} a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, chavrusa learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely {{new insights into the}} meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get speedier. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125m. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.|$|E
5000|$|Compound vowel: <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> last vowel letter {{except when}} it {{contains}} an “a”, then just <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> “a”. (E.g., [...] "zoaa".) In the case of ø, use øo rather than øø.|$|R
50|$|The village by {{the ocean}} is {{probably}} the motif which has been <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> most in Faroese art. In Countless paintings Amariel Norðoy has <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> motif and shown it contains unlimited possibilities.|$|R

5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of {{blue and}} fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept {{infrasonic}} pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected {{hundreds of miles from}} their source.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with several shots of a dining table; it {{includes}} uneaten sweets, foods, and small pink bird ornaments. The first verse features close-ups {{of the girls}} singing and dancing to the song, {{in front of a}} beige backdrop. The chorus section has three scenes of each member; Kashiyuka is seen laying down with an electronics cable in her hand; Nocchi is seen at the dining table; and A-Chan is seen under a table with a cable telephone. During the instrumental break, close-up shots (yet very blurry) features a fish bowl that have small fishing swimming around. The second verse <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> first verses video shoots.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) is {{a species}} of leaf beetle. It {{measures}} 7.7–10.5mm in length and has a characteristic bright metallic green colouration. The common name derives from the tansy plant on which they often feed as both larvae and adults. In addition to the nominotypical subspecies, which <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> specific name, C. graminis graminis, there are five further distinct subspecies of tansy beetle, which, collectively, have a Palearctic distribution, although {{in the majority of}} countries where it is found the species is declining. In the United Kingdom it is designated as 'Nationally Rare' and this localised population, centred on York, North Yorkshire, {{has been the subject of}} much recent research.|$|E
25|$|Cowen has {{subsequently}} {{threatened to}} sue Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin if he <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> accusation outside the Dáil. Ó Caoláin responded by <b>repeating</b> <b>the</b> accusation in public and inviting Cowen {{to take him to}} court.|$|R
50|$|Vanbrugh <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> {{motif of}} three long round-headed windows at Castle Howard, {{and on the}} corner pavilions at Blenheim Palace. He <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> rusticated central block with plainer {{projecting}} wings at Seaton Delaval Hall.|$|R

5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third chorus, and its instrumentation {{comes from a}} guitar, brass and string instruments. It starts with an instrumental introduction, with a chord progression of A–Faug–Dmaj7–G7 that is also used during {{the first part of}} the verses and the chorus. Brown and Bunton sing the first lines of the first verse; the progression then changes to Bm7–E–Dmaj7–C♯7 during the last part of the verse, which is sung by Chisholm. After the chorus, the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Halliwell, Beckham, and Chisholm singing the second verse. The progression changes to Bm7–C♯m7–Gmaj9–F♯7(♯9) as Chisholm sings the bridge, while the rest of the group adds the high harmony. The group sing the chorus twice, and <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> ad-lib as the song fades out. The album version, which is forty seconds longer than the radio edit, features an instrumental section at the end of the track.|$|E

5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith <b>repeats</b> <b>the</b> opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E
