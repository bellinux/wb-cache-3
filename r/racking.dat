He and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster <b>racking</b> up 21 of them. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty {{in the final minute}} of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, pulled off an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick to secure three important points for Celtic. In total, he kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>RACK</b> 1 is a {{versatile}} scaffold protein in mammals, regulating diverse developmental processes. Unlike in non-plant organisms where <b>RACK</b> 1 is encoded {{by a single}} gene, Arabidopsis genome contains three <b>RACK</b> 1 homologous genes, designated as <b>RACK</b> 1 A, <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C, respectively. Previous studies indicated that the loss-of-function alleles of <b>RACK</b> 1 A displayed multiple defects in plant development. However, the functions of <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C remain elusive. Further, the relationships between three <b>RACK</b> 1 homologous genes are unknown. Results We isolated mutant alleles with loss-of-function mutations in <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C, and examined {{the impact of these}} mutations on plant development. We found that unlike in <b>RACK</b> 1 A, loss-of-function mutations in <b>RACK</b> 1 B or <b>RACK</b> 1 C do not confer apparent defects in plant development, including rosette leaf production and root development. Analyses of <b>rack</b> 1 a, <b>rack</b> 1 b and <b>rack</b> 1 c double and triple mutants, however, revealed that <b>rack</b> 1 b and <b>rack</b> 1 c can enhance the <b>rack</b> 1 a mutant's developmental defects, and an extreme developmental defect and lethality were observed in <b>rack</b> 1 a <b>rack</b> 1 b <b>rack</b> 1 c triple mutant. Complementation studies indicated that <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C are in principle functionally equivalent to <b>RACK</b> 1 A. Gene expression studies indicated that three <b>RACK</b> 1 genes display similar expression patterns but are expressed at different levels. Further, <b>RACK</b> 1 genes positively regulate each other's expression. Conclusion These results suggested that <b>RACK</b> 1 genes are critical regulators of plant development and that <b>RACK</b> 1 genes function in an unequally redundant manner. Both the difference in <b>RACK</b> 1 gene expression level and the cross-regulation are likely the molecular determinants of their unequal genetic redundancy. </p...|$|R

Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI).

All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted Saddle Horse and <b>Racking</b> Horse associations as well.

5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for a new coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, <b>racking</b> up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E

Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion <b>racking</b> up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and <b>racking</b> focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E
