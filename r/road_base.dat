5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the <b>road</b> <b>base</b> made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway sealed by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.|$|E
25|$|However, the IRA {{campaign}} in the area did not begin in earnest until 1971. On 7 August of that year, Harry Thornton, a 29-year-old sewage worker from South Armagh {{was shot and killed}} by the British Army while staying in a car outside Springfield <b>road</b> <b>base</b> in Belfast, he and his coworker Arthur Murphy having been mistaken for gunmen. Murphy was lightly wounded and arrested by the RUC. The incident caused outrage among South Armagh residents, provided the IRA with many new recruits and created a hostile climate where local people were prepared to tolerate the killing of security force members.|$|E
500|$|A road along {{what is now}} Great Eastern Highway {{has existed}} since the convict era of Western Australia. The {{original}} road {{is thought to have}} been constructed in 1867, using convict labour, with a <b>road</b> <b>base</b> made of jarrah tree trunks cut into disc shapes. The use of wooden discs as a <b>road</b> <b>base</b> had been proposed by Western Australian Governor John Hampton, leading them to be known as [...] "Hampton's Cheeses". The discs were approximately [...] thick and as large as [...] in diameter, and the gaps between pieces would have been filled with soil or lime. The same type of road is known to have existed along Stirling Highway, Guildford Road, Albany Highway and Wanneroo Road in the 1860s, and would have prevented horses and carts from getting bogged in wet weather. Evidence of this original road was found in Belmont in 1948 when widening works uncovered jarrah discs. During upgrade works in 2012, more discs were discovered beneath the existing asphalt, over a [...] stretch.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the road {{sections}} sealed in the 1950s and 1960s were {{in need of}} repair or maintenance to prolong the pavement life. Old bitumen surfaces would deteriorate and crack. Resealing such cracks was a high priority, as expensive reconstruction would be required if water was allowed to enter the <b>road</b> <b>base.</b> Over a ten-year period, $49 million was spent on repairing Albany Highway. The techniques used in this process were then formalised into the 4R Program, which aimed to alleviate a growing maintenance problem – based on a thirty-five-year pavement lifespan, the amount of reconstruction required {{would be more than}} double the actual rate of reconstruction. [...] "4R" [...] abbreviated the options that could be used keep roads serviceable: ...|$|E
2500|$|Processes during {{earthwork}} include excavation, {{removal of}} material to spoil, filling, compacting, construction and trimming. If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed, moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90-95% relative compaction). [...] Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the roadbed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal <b>road</b> <b>base.</b> When a depression must be filled {{to come up to}} the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed. The fill is made by the [...] "compacted layer method" [...] where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications, under saturated conditions. The process is repeated until the desired grade is reached. (pp. 68–69 [...] ).|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{operational}} planning processes for <b>road</b> <b>based</b> long haul transportation and analyze the potentials for improvements. The point of departure is an Operations Management planning model used to build a frame of reference that is used to analyze transport planning processes. Design/methodology/approach - A literature study was conducted to review models and theories from the Operations Management area. The outcome of that study was used to provide a theoretical foundation for analyzing transport planning processes. Following the literature study, empirical data was collected through two different case studies, one with focus on vehicle fill rate and the other with focus on transport planning processes. Findings - The findings include evidence of poor fill rate in <b>road</b> <b>based</b> long haul transportation related to poor planning processes. Hence, a framework for transport planning based on Operations Management planning models is provided. By using that framework, the analysis reveals shortcomings in transport planning related to lack of information access but also time to allocate the right resources to various assignments. Research limitations/implications – This paper is focused on <b>road</b> <b>based</b> transportation. It shows poor fill rate in long haul transport operations and consequently a need for improved transport operations planning. The provided transport planning framework constitutes a theoretical contribution and is beneficial for analyzing transport operations planning. Practical implications – The fact that the fill rate in long haul <b>road</b> <b>based</b> transportation has potential to improve gives an opportunity for enhanced planning operations. The developed framework is useful in identifying opportunities for improvements in planning as well as what prerequisites needs to be fulfilled to enable better transport planning. Originality/value – In addition to showing evidence of poor fill rate in <b>road</b> <b>based</b> transportation, this work provides a transport operations planning framework based on traditional Operations Management planning models and transport planning models...|$|R
