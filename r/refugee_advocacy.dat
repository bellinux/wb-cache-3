40|$|In the 1950 s, civic {{society in}} South Africa became mobilized against racist laws that {{penetrated}} nearly {{every aspect of}} civic life.

40|$|In the 1950 s, civic {{actors in}} South Africa mobilised against racist laws that {{penetrated}} nearly {{every aspect of}} civic life. The social justice struggle that eventually displaced white minority rule culminated in democratic elections in 1994. Following this historic transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, other issues came to the fore, including how the South African government was to receive persons claiming refugee status {{on the basis of}} persecution and war. Civic actors again mobilised around these ‘new’ human rights and social justice issues; they became engaged either in working with government to develop a refugee policy, or in confronting the government to fulfil its national and international obligations towards refugees. This book discusses the dynamics of civic-state interactions aimed at the state’s obligations to promote, protect and fulfil human rights. Through the lens of <b>refugee</b> rights <b>advocacy</b> in South Africa {{in the first decade of}} its post- 1994 period of democracy, this book examines and explains the circumstances under which civic-state interactions can lead to structural change, and what these interactions can teach us about the potential of civic society to realise rights in general. In any social justice struggle, the key to civic actors being able to hold states and their governments accountable for their human rights obligations lies in civic actors making strategic choices. Making strategic choices has various implications for civic actors. First, civic actors must appreciate the social, political and legal context in which they operate; this historical appreciation reveals certain structural boundaries to realising rights that are nearly always imposed by the state. Second, civic actors must critically assess these structural boundaries that condition their behaviour, but also have the potential for structural change or ‘elaboration’, through civic actors interacting with the state in formal and also informal interventions. Third, civic actors must appreciate the social distance that always exists between themselves and the government, measured by divergences in meanings, interests and political positions. Through a critical engagement in this ‘external’ relationship, it is possible for civic actors to capitalize on these divergences in advocating a state’s accountability for realising human rights. Whether the social distance ought to be narrowed or broadened at a particular moment depends on (1) the context in which this takes place, (2) the structural boundaries that exist, and (3) the desired outcome. Three examples of <b>refugee</b> rights <b>advocacy,</b> and the corresponding social distance that existed between civic actors and the government in South Africa are examined. The first concerns the process of bringing a formal refugee policy into place. The second example focuses on the implementation of a separate policy to resolve the situation of former Mozambican refugees in the country. The third example focuses on the manner in which the rights of refugees have been litigated through the South African courts. Drawing on these three examples, the book concludes that a critical engagement with the government by civic actors, reflected in the strategic choices that they make, allows civic actors to take advantage of a narrow, but significant space for achieving structural change...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the types of programs, partnerships and policies UNHCR should support to improve microcredit and microsavings for urban refugees in the informal economy. I set out to accomplish this purpose in partnership with the Women’s Refugee Commission, an evidence-based advocacy organization that advocates vigorously for laws, policies and programs to improve the lives and protect the rights of refugee and internally displaced women, children and young people, including those seeking asylum—bringing about lasting, measurable change. Though independent, WRC often collaborates with UNHCR and other stakeholders to determine better practices and approaches for protecting refugees, especially women and youth. There are approximately 10. 5 million refugees worldwide, more than half of who live in urban areas and only a third in camps. Refugees in protracted situations make up 68 % of the refugee population, meaning they are not sure when or if they will return home. The average length of their displacement is 17 years, hardly a length of time appropriate for short-term, humanitarian interventions. The trend of urbanization does not apply exclusively to refugees. More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, 1. 5 billion living in poor urban and slum areas. Urban refugees typically live in the same communities as urban poor. Both groups operate primarily in the informal economy, face bribery and harassment from police, and have inadequate social safety nets such as healthcare, education and housing. Women are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and gender-based violence under these circumstances. Refugees face additional challenges as they often do not have proper documentation, clear legal status or rights to work, or move as do their host neighbors. These challenges result in additional protection concerns and obstacles to generating an income and becoming self-reliant. Microcredit and microsavings are approaches that development actors are exploring to help protect and reduce poverty among urban poor, but urban refugees are often left out of these microfinance schemes. Refugees have expressed the need for microcredit to grow their informal businesses, and microsavings schemes to help establish financial security. Utilizing financial services could help many refugees achieve self-reliance. I identified four categories where UNHCR can support microfinance: partnerships, programming, policy and evaluation and advocacy. I developed nine different options within these categories and analyzed them against three criteria: ensure political feasibility, consider UNHCR’s financial limitations, balance refugee protection concerns with economic stability. I ultimately recommend all nine options for UNHCR to consider for implementation. Partnerships 1. 	Strengthen and increase partnerships with international and national development actors and host government ministries to carry out microfinance programs. 2. 	Strengthen and increase partnerships between field officers, country staff, city officials and development groups to carry out microfinance programs. Programming 3. 	Pilot microcredit and microsavings programs in select urban locations over longer project time horizons. Emphasize microsavings first and more broadly, and only apply credit to refugees who meet the appropriate criteria. Use both sustainable MFI models and subsidized and non-financial service models depending on the needs of the population in the pilot location. 4. 	Build the capacity of field officers, implementing partners and future MFI partners to successfully extend microfinance services to urban refugees. 5. 	Pilot guaranteeing loans for refugees who show potential to start and grow a scalable business and who could then hire other refugees and urban poor. Policy and Evaluation 6. 	Allow UNHCR staff to commit funds to microfinance projects for up to five years before having to request an extension for project funds. 7. 	Rigorously monitor and evaluate not just the financial, but also the social impact of microfinance programs for urban <b>refugees.</b> <b>Advocacy</b> 8. 	Lobby donors for increased self-reliance and livelihood funds intended to support and partner with existing MFIs, government agencies and development NGOs in order to offer more savings and credit options to <b>refugees.</b> 9. 	Continue <b>advocacy</b> efforts with host national and local governments and MFIs. Use messages of self-reliance and contributions to local economic development. The goal of advocacy should be to ensure an enabling environment for work and financial services for refugees. UNHCR has issued guidance and explored microfinance previously in a limited number of ways. However, my recommendations apply specifically to urban refugees predominantly in non-conflict settings. UNHCR and development actors have tended to focus primarily on microcredit. However, credit should be applied cautiously to refugees who meet specific criteria. Microsavings is a more appropriate approach for a wider range of refugees, especially the poor and vulnerable who risk going into debt. The poorest and most vulnerable often need a graduation model of financial services. Another approach for the poorest requires the provision of social services like healthcare, education, business training, or one-time asset transfers alongside credit and savings. Credit or savings alone is not the solution for refugees to protect themselves or grow their household income. Advocacy, policy changes and partnerships are necessary as UNCHR and WRC move forward in supporting microfinance programs for urban refugees in the informal economy...|$|R

He knew of other church-sponsored community service programs, such as the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, formed in the late 1950s; and the Mennonite Voluntary Service, {{which was founded in}} 1944. [...] So he helped found the Lutheran Volunteer Corps (LVC), which became a ministry of Luther Place and operated in space provided by the church and the ministries of the N Street Village. Modeled as a very small version of the Peace Corp, volunteers work in social justice agencies—homeless shelters, medical clinics, <b>refugee</b> services, justice <b>advocacy</b> groups—for a one-year period, while living in intentional community with other volunteers in group houses. [...] In explaining his vision for LVC, Steinbruck recalled the work of Albert Schweizer, who turned his back on a brilliant career to volunteer as a physician in the heart of Africa, learning first-hand the importance of [...] "reverence for life." [...] "My early memories are of the military, of dehumanization[...] [...] [...] I really wish that I could have started out with the LVC rather than boot camp."

40|$|This is an ethnographic {{study of}} Montreal's {{community}} of refugee advocates {{who work on}} behalf of refugees making requests to the Canadian government for asylum. The goal of this thesis is to portray who refugee advocates are, what they do, how they do it, and why. The study reveals that the work of advocacy requires building and maintaining networks through information exchange and that the successes of these networks are dependent upon the individuals in them. This thesis makes contributions to three areas of literature and research: (1) Refugee studies: Most research in this field has been undertaken within development discourse and conducted in the so-called "Third World". This thesis locates refugee rights as a "First World" issue and makes visible the work of <b>refugee</b> <b>advocacy</b> in one North American urban setting; (2) Advocacy anthropology: This thesis is based on grounded, collaborative, ethnographic fieldwork and responds to the expressed wish of advocates for a qualitative study [...] previous evaluations tended to be quantitative.

Rather, they have forced the state to develop new strategies in order to reassert its sovereignty and regain its legitimacy.

Results indicated that they experienced moderate to high levels of stress in their <b>refugee</b> <b>advocacy.</b> While they used emotional support significantly more than other coping strategies, they found emotional support and instrumental support the most effective. Regardless of the high costs involved in such advocacy (e. g., financial, emotional, and interpersonal), participants noted a number of positive outcomes such as new friendships and personal growth. The findings are discussed in terms of long-term implications in relation to immigration policy and community support...|$|E
