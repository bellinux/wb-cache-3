5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers are capped by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The lower gate sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, sheaves and sickles. The inner gates bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I <b>render</b> <b>to</b> the Lord?"), while the outer gates bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E

25|$|But by {{your hard}} and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for {{yourself}} {{on the day of}} wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will <b>render</b> <b>to</b> every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.

For God shows no partiality.|$|E
500|$|The lead {{visual effects}} company was Weta Digital in Wellington, New Zealand, {{at one point}} {{employing}} 900 people {{to work on the}} film. Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even {{on the other side of}} the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for Avatar, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing. To render Avatar, Weta used a [...] server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system. The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta. Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage, and each minute of the final footage for Avatar occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage. Often, it would take each frame of the movie several hours to <b>render.</b> <b>To</b> help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions. Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.|$|E

2500|$|Instead, Anselm {{suggested}} that we owe God a debt of honor: [...] "This is the debt which man and angel owe to God, and no one who pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins. This is justice, or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or upright in heart, that is, in will; {{and this is the}} sole and complete debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us." [...] Having failed to <b>render</b> <b>to</b> God this debt, {{it is not enough to}} restore the justice originally owed, but the offense to God's honor must be satisfied, too. [...] "Moreover, so long as he does not restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; and it will not suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away." [...] This debt creates an imbalance in the moral universe; God cannot simply ignore it according to Anselm. The only way to satisfy the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of justice owed to God and satisfy the injury to divine honor. In light of this view, the [...] "ransom" [...] that Jesus mentions in the Gospels would be a sacrifice and a debt paid only to God the Father.|$|E
2500|$|John Calvin {{explains}} that since injustice is an abomination to God, {{the intent of}} the commandment against stealing is that one must <b>render</b> <b>to</b> every man his due. This commandment forbids us to long after other men's goods. [...] Calvin holds that each individual’s possessions have not fallen to him by chance, but by the distribution of the sovereign Lord of all. [...] Therefore, no one can pervert his means to bad purposes without committing a fraud on a divine dispensation. [...] Calvin asserts that God sees the long train of deception by which the man of craft begins to lay nets for his more simple neighbor. For Calvin, violations of this commandment are not confined to money, or merchandise, or lands, but extend to every kind of right. [...] We defraud our neighbors to their hurt if we decline any of the duties which we are bound to perform towards them. God’s wrath is incurred if an agent or an indolent steward wastes the substance of his employer, or does not give due heed to the management of his property; if he unjustly squanders or luxuriously wastes the means entrusted to him; if a servant holds his master in derision, divulges his secrets, or in any way is treacherous to his life or his goods. [...] Likewise, a master incurs God’s wrath if he cruelly torments his household, because he is guilty of theft before God; along will all who fail to deliver what he owes to others, keeps back, or makes away with what does not belong to him.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert Murray Simpson {{originally}} {{worked with}} his father in the firm Thomas Simpson & Son. Thomas Simpson's former board schools of the post-1870 period (most were designed between 1880 and 1903) can be found throughout the city. Architecturally, his schools are [...] "the best [...] works" [...] in Sussex. His style evolved from the Queen Anne Revival typical of early board schools towards [...] "an Edwardian Free style" [...] in which the standard red brickwork is supplemented by pebbledashing, terracotta and stonework. [...] His rooflines became more elaborate over time as well. The Finsbury Road School (1881; now flats) combines red and brown brickwork. [...] Connaught Road School in Hove (1884) and Elm Grove School in Brighton (1893) are in the Queen Anne Revival style; the former, now an adult education centre, combines yellow and red brick and terracotta-coloured <b>render</b> <b>to</b> create an [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "distinctive" [...] façade. [...] Clayton & Black extended the building in 1903. York Place School has been dated to [...] 1895 and has two frontages; it is now integrated into City College Brighton & Hove's buildings, which are scheduled for redevelopment. In Preston parish, Simpson built the Preston Road School (1880, with [...] "flamboyant pedimented gables" [...] and a large roof), the Downs School (a simpler building of 1890) and the dome-topped Stanford Road School (1893), which also has a tower. Simpson's last board school, St Luke's at Queen's Park, was also the most elaborate. [...] Dated 1900–03, it has a separate swimming pool and caretaker's house, {{all in the same}} [...] "characterful Edwardian Free style". [...] The extravagant -shaped design features two wings with entrances set below timber-turreted towers, four gables to the rear, and an ornately decorated arched window in the third wing (the base of the [...] ).

The Gemara interpreted the words [...] "The Lord, the Lord" [...] in [...] to teach that God is the Eternal (exhibiting mercy) before humans sin and the same after they sin and repent.
