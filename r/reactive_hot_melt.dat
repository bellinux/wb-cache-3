40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{additive}} of <b>reactive</b> <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive (RHMA), thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) {{was modified}} with neat sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) or Na-MMT intercalated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), {{and their effects}} on the adhesion, rheological, and mechanical properties of RHMA were examined. The neat Na-MMT or Na-MMT intercalated with PEG (Na-MMT/PEG) effectively reduced the set time of RHMA, although the contents of neat Na-MMT or Na-MMT/PEG were less than 0. 2 %. The increase of complex viscosity and pseudo-solid like behavior observed at low shear rate indicated that there were intimate interactions between RHMA molecules and neat Na-MMT or Na-MMT/PEG.

40|$|The bonding of rigid PVC to a {{plasticised}} PVC film using a <b>reactive</b> <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> polyurethane adhesive {{has been}} investigated {{in order to improve}} the stability and durability of the bonding between the PVC and the adhesive. (The primers used to modify the surface of rigid PVC are mainly solvent-based products, either methylene chloride based or methyl ethyl ketone based). With Adhesion Promoters, such concerns are environmental (High VOC emissions and clean-up costs), introductions of dirt, high maintenance costs, and safety. Chlorinated solvents, most commonly used in Adhesion Promoters, are highly flammable and toxic which in turn is dangerous to plant and personnel alike. These solvent-based products were band by European Union environment agency in 2011. Alternative surface modification technique should replace the solvent prima to modify the surface of the commercial PVC. Consequently the flame treatment technique was employed to modify the surface of the commercial PVC before bonding to a plasticised PVC film by using a <b>reactive</b> <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> polyurethane adhesive. Before surface modification of the PVCs, the PVC samples were investigated by employing surface analysis’s techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements (CAM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and DMA. In order to avoid the damage of the PVC samples while they expose to X-ray irradiation. Initially, XPS and EDX were employed in a X-ray degradation study of PVC to determine the maximum time a PVC sample can be exposed to an X-ray source where X-ray has minimum effect on the surface of PVC. The samples used in the degradation study were pure PVC (drop cast in THF on to aluminium foil to produce a PVC film as reference) and three industrial PVC blends. EDX analysis of a pure PVC specimen exposed to an X-ray source showed 5...|$|E

Solvent evaporation technique was employed to prepare films of different combinations of polymers, plasticizer, and a modal drug sulindac to narrow down on a few polymer-plasticizer-sulindac combinations. The sulindac-polymer-plasticizer combination that was stable with good film forming properties was processed by <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing, a technique close to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion, to predict its behavior in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion process. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing is not a substitute to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion but is an aid in predicting the formation of molecularly dispersed form of a given set of drug-polymer-plasticizer combination in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion process.

40|$|Hot-melt {{adhesives}} {{have been}} commercially {{available for a}} long time and they are used in a wide range of applications. In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low off-taste, low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with the same properties of polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive. Three formulations of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive. Further research needs to be conducted on EVA-HMA 3 for other properties to confirm its viability in replacing the commercial polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive in packaging industry...|$|R
40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed high tack. Financial support by REPSOL (Móstoles, Madrid, Spain) is acknowledged...|$|R

Although {{the influence of}} the addition of microcrystalline and Fischer-Tropsch waxes on the properties of ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> has been studied, the addition of polypropylene wax has not been considered yet. In this study, different polypropylene waxes (polypropylene wax – PP, – maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene wax – PPMA – copolymer of polypropylene and 10. 9 [*]wt. % polyethylene wax – PP-E) were added to EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> and they were characterized by Brookfield viscosity, softening point measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, plate–plate rheology, tack, and single-lap shear adhesion. The viscosities of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing polypropylene waxes were relatively high, the highest viscosity corresponded to the formulation containing PP-E wax which also showed pseudoplasticity. The change in viscoelastic properties (i. e., from dominantly viscous to dominantly elastic) was produced at lower temperature in EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> containing PP-E wax, this adhesive exhibited the highest tack. On the other hand, the addition of acrylic PPMA wax increased the adhesion of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> but lower tack was obtained. Finally, the PP-E wax was more compatible with EVA copolymer than the other polypropylene waxes...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePrecision {{assembly}} of hybrid micro systems requires {{not only a}} high precision handling and adjusting of the parts but also a highly accurate and fast bonding technique. In this field adhesive technology {{is one of the}} major joining techniques. At the Collaboration Research Center 516, a batch process based on a joining technique using <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesives was developed. This technique allows the coating of micro components with <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> in a batch. The coating process is followed by the joining process. Due to this, the time between coating and joining can be designed variably. Because of the short set times of <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesives short joining times are possible. For this assembly process adapted heat management and adapted gripper systems are very important. Primarily, the conception and construction of suitable grippers, which realize the complex requirements of the heat management, meet a high challenge.
