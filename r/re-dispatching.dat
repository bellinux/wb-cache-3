40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{faced in}} the operation of power systems increases as larger amounts of intermittent sources, such as wind and solar power, are being installed. Traditionally, an optimal generation <b>re-dispatch</b> is obtained by solving security-constrained optimal power flows (SCOPF). The resulting system operation is then optimal for given values of the uncertain parameters. New methods have been developed to consider the uncertainty directly in the generation <b>re-dispatch</b> optimization problem. Chance-constrained optimal power flows (CCOPF) are such methods. In this paper, SCOPF and CCOPF are compared and the benefits of using CCOPF for power systems operation under uncertainty are discussed. The discussion is illustrated by a case study in the IEEE 39 bus system, in which the generation <b>re-dispatch</b> obtained by CCOPF is shown to always be cheaper than that obtained by SCOPF.

40|$|Concerning {{the design}} of (regional) {{electricity}} markets, the weighting of uniform pricing with <b>re-dispatch</b> {{on the one hand}} and zonal or even nodal pricing on the other hand largely depends on the trade-off between price signals, short and long-term incentives, liquidity and competition.

With regard to the European context, the thesis presents a methodology to identify suitable bidding zones under consideration of the fundamental market structure.

By integrating genetic algorithm based solution, problem formulation became easier. The solution obtained from this methodology is quite encouraging and useful in the economic point of view and it has been observed that for calculating short run marginal cost, generator <b>re-dispatching</b> solution is better than classical method solution.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{transmission}} congestion problem arising from multiple transactions in deregulated electricity markets. Two congestion management approaches (<b>re-dispatch</b> {{and the application of}} Flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS)) have been studied in three market models (pool, bilateral and the combined (hybrid)). An optimal power flow (OPF) framework has been used to simulate the considered market models and the congestion problems. The IEEE 14 -bus and the CIGRE 32 -bus test systems have been used to demonstrate the robustness of the approaches. The objectives of congestion management are different in different market. In the pool market, the objective function is the minimisation of the amount of <b>re-dispatched</b> power. In the bilateral market, minimising the transaction deviations is considered as the objective. In the hybrid model, the objective function is two pronged, minimising the pool <b>re-dispatch</b> and minimisation of deviations of the bilateral contracts. Furthermore, the objective of minimising the cost of congestion is applied in all the market models. The use of series FACTS devices to alleviate congestion is also demonstrated. In the pool market, congestion requires <b>re-dispatch</b> of generation hence deviating from the market settlement. It has been shown that <b>re-dispatch</b> increases the system cost since the out of merit generators are involved more than scheduled. The minimisation of redispatch in the pool therefore ensures that the deviation from the economical settlement of the market is minimised. In the bilateral market, the interest is to maintain the desired transactions between contracting parties. To solve the arising congestion in this market model, the rescheduled transactions are forced to be as close to the scheduled transactions as possible. The changes to contracts are non-discriminatory, hence only contracts that affect the congestion are modified. In order to meet the load requirements, power has to be supplied from the regulation market. In the hybrid market model, a weighting factor is used between the pool and bilateral <b>re-dispatch.</b> The pool could be <b>re-dispatched</b> more than the transactions and vice versa, depending on the weighting factor. It has been found that when FACTS are included in the network, the amount of redispatched power in the pool is greatly reduced resulting in an optimal operating point closer to that dictated by the market settlement. In the bilateral market, the results show that the transactions may not need to be modified when we have FACTS. The cost of congestion to the ISO also reduces when FACTS are employed. In order to justify the use of FACTS with regards to congestion management, a simple cost benefit analysis has been proposed where the benefit from FACTS is considered as avoided congestion costs that the system would have to bear otherwise. The resulting <b>re-dispatched</b> generation schedules are only optimal as far as congestion is concerned under normal operating conditions i. e., N- 0 contingency. The schedule is therefore tested for security under the N- 1 criterion. The contingency cases have been simulated and ranked using an overload index and total power violations arising from the outages. A dc load flow and line outage distribution factors have been used for testing system behaviours under various contingency conditions. A comparison of the dc and ac load flow methods has been made and the results indicate a small average absolute error...|$|R

Therefore, if proper market power mitigation approaches are not utilized in both day-ahead and <b>re-dispatch</b> markets, then zonal pricing may be more susceptible to market power, especially in zonal model which is based on available transfer capacity (ATC), strategic player's profit and social welfare can be very volatile. In general, the more network constraints are incorporated in day-ahead market (100 % in nodal and almost zero in ATC), the more social welfare is attainable. Hence, nodal model is acquitted from the more market power denunciation...|$|R

Balancing market exists in markets in {{which most of the}} trading is done via decentralized bilateral contracts. In these markets only final adjustments necessary to ensure secure system operation is carried out at a centralized balancing market. Each market player can participate in the balancing market by submitting offers and bids to increase and decrease its initially submitted active generation output. The proposed technique is based on mixed integer linear programming, so that a power system network is represented by a simplified DC power flow. Market participants' offers and bids are also represented by linear models. Results show that applications of FACTS devices can significantly reduce costs of congestion <b>re-dispatch...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{volumes of}} {{intermittent}} {{renewable energy sources}} (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) are increasing in grids across Europe. Undoubtedly, the distribution networks cope with congestion issues much more often due to distributed generation and increased network use. Such issues are often handled by unit <b>re-dispatching</b> in short term and grid expansion in long term. <b>Re-dispatching</b> is, however, not always an appropriate solution for local distribution networks since the limited generation units are mostly RES of uncontrollable volatility. Recovering the incurred investment costs {{on the other hand}} would trigger an increase of the network tariffs. A possible solution is to defer such an investment by utilizing the demand side resources. The FlexMart model, developed and suggested in this paper, provides the ability for the Distribution System Operator (DSO) to purchase demand flexibility offered by residential consumers. Two feeders with different topologies are tested and the ability of the suggested mechanism to provide benefits for the involved stakeholders, both the DSO and the consumers, is demonstrated.

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the optimal {{placement}} of power quality meters and flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices in power systems. The chapter presents two recent applications of optimization techniques to power system planning. The first example addresses optimal monitoring programs of power system for voltage sags assessment. Voltage sags are short duration reductions of the rms voltage caused by the occurrence of remote short circuit faults. A meter placement method for voltage sags monitoring of a large transmission systems is presented. An integer programming based modeling is proposed for choosing the locations of {{a limited number of}} power quality meters. A branch and bound type algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. A large transmission network is used to validate the proposed method and stochastic assessment of voltage sags is applied to the network to obtain simulated monitoring results. Voltage sag system indices are calculated from monitoring programs designed according to the optimization method. Comparisons with the system indices obtained from a full monitoring program show the applicability of the method. The second example considers the optimal placement of flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices to reduce the transmission congestion problem in the deregulated power systems. The example {{deals with the}} congestion problem in the deregulated electricity market using an optimal power flow framework (OPF). The congestion management method considered is based on a constrained <b>re-dispatch</b> of generation schedule which are formed by the market. From the <b>re-dispatch,</b> the congestion management cost can be evaluated. The installation and operation of the flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices in the transmission network is considered in order to alleviate congestion and minimize the amount of active power which has to be <b>re-dispatched.</b> A cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the economical justification of using FACTS for congestion management is also proposed.

Toward this goal, day-ahead stochastic market clearing with high-penetration wind en-ergy is pursued in this paper based on the DC optimal power flow (OPF).
