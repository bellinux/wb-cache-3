50|$|Hans Yost Creek is a {{tributary}} of Deep Creek in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately 3.4 mi long and flows through Foster Township and Barry Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of 3.52 sq mi. The creek is designated as an impaired waterbody, with the causes being metals and pH and the probable source being abandoned mine drainage. It has no named tributaries, but two abandoned mine discharges flow into it. The creek's watershed was extensively mined in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but the only remaining active mining permits are for <b>remining.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the leaders}} of the {{displaced}} Banaban community in Fiji have called for Banaba to be granted independence. One reason given for the maintenance of a community on Banaba, at a monthly cost of F$12,000, is that if the island were to become uninhabited, the Kiribati government might take over the administration of the island, and integrate it with the rest of the country. Kiribati is believed to be anxious to retain Banaba, in the hope of <b>remining</b> it in the future. Additionally, along with Kiritimati, it is not a low-lying coral atoll and less susceptible to rising sea levels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Morphological {{characteristics}} from 97 genera {{representing the}} major groups of tribe Heliantheae sensu lato and several outgroups {{were analyzed using}} Analysis of Pattern (ANOPA) and baraminic distance correlation. The ANOPA results revealed a complex structure that does not correspond to any previous classifi cation and does not exhibit any obvious discontinuity.

Taken together, {{results from this study}} and our previous one (Wood and Cavanaugh 2001) strongly support monobaraminic status for tribes Heliantheae s. l. and Eupatorieae collectively. This monobaramin contains 5730 species, more than 25 % of the sunfl ower family. www. bryancore. org/bsg / 1 Although of central importance to creation systematics, discontinuity is often defi ned merely by the failure to demonstrate baraminic relationship (continuity). <b>ReMine</b> suggested absence of continuity as his only criterion for detecting discontinuity (<b>ReMine</b> 1990).

40|$|Under an {{approved}} <b>remining</b> program, mine operators can remine abandoned coal mines without assuming legal responsibility {{for treatment of}} the previously degraded water, {{as long as the}} discharging waters are not further degraded and other regulatory requirements are satisfied. A U. S. Bureau of Mines review of 105 <b>remining</b> permits in Pennsylvania indicates that <b>remining</b> results in substantial reclamation of abandoned mine lands, utilization of significant quantities of coal, and reduction of contaminant loads (acidity and iron) from degraded mine drainage discharges. Normality tests performed on the water quality and flow data indicate generally nonnormal distributions and extreme right-skewness, tending toward lower values. The water quality of underground coal mines was observed to be more highly degraded in terms of acidity, iron, and sulfate than that of surface coal mines. The optimum baseline sampling scenario is 12 months in duration at a frequency of one sample per month. Analysis of water quality and flow rates before and after <b>remining</b> indicates {{that a majority of the}} mines exhibited either no change or a significant decrease in pollution rate because of <b>remining.</b> The discharge flow rate was the dominant controlling factor when the post-remining contaminant load was significantly better or worse than the baseline (pre-remining) load.

40|$|Abstract: Mining {{generalized}} association rules among {{items in}} the presence of taxonomy and with nonuniform minimum support has been recognized as an important model in data mining. In our previous work, we have investigated this problem and proposed two algorithms, MMS_Cumulate and MMS_Stratify. In real applications, however, the work of discovering interesting association rules is an iterative process. The analysts need to repeatedly adjust the constraint of minimum support and/or minimum confidence to discover real informative rules. How to reduce the response time for each <b>remining</b> process thus becomes a crucial issue. In this paper, we examined the problem of maintaining the discovered multi-supported generalized association rules when the multiple minimum support constraint is updated. Empirical evaluation showed that the proposed RM_MMS algorithm is very efficient and has good linear scale-up characteristic.

40|$|Abstract. Mining {{frequent}} itemsets over data streams is an emergent research {{topic in}} recent years. Previous approaches generally use a fixed support threshold {{to discover the}} patterns in the stream. However, the threshold will be changed {{to cope with the}} needs of the users and the characteristics of the incoming data in reality. Changing the threshold implies a re-mining of the whole transactions in a non-streaming environment. Nevertheless, the &quot;look-once &quot; feature of the streaming data cannot provide the discarded transactions so that a <b>remining</b> on the stream is impossible. Therefore, we propose a method for variable support mining of frequent itemsets over the data stream. A synopsis vector is constructed for maintaining statistics of past transactions and is invoked only when necessary. The conducted experimental results show that our approach is efficient and scalable for variable support mining in data streams. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{detection}} {{and prevention of}} Risks Against Patient Safety (RAPS) are ever-increasing issues in health care.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} years gene {{interaction}} networks are increasingly being used for the assessment and interpretation of biological measurements. Knowledge of the interaction partners of an unknown protein allows scientists to understand the complex relationships between genetic products, helps to reveal unknown biological functions and pathways, and get a more detailed picture of an organism's complexity. Being able to measure all protein interactions under all relevant conditions is virtually impossible. Hence, computational methods integrating different datasets for predicting gene interactions are needed. Mendel's Accountant is an advanced numerical simulation program for modeling genetic change over time and was developed collaboratively by Sanford, Baumgardner, Brewer, Gibson and <b>ReMine.</b> Mendel’s Accountant (hereafter referred to as “Mendel”) is a user-friendly biologically realistic simulation program for investigating the processes of mutation and selection in sexually reproducing diploid populations.
