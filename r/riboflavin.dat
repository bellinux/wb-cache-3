5|$|As {{an example}} of Curcubita, raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with {{negligible}} fat content (table). In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and <b>riboflavin</b> (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E
5|$|In a 100g amount, {{maple syrup}} {{provides}} 260 calories and {{is composed of}} 32% water by weight, 67% carbohydrates (90% of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and <b>riboflavin</b> are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured <b>riboflavin</b> in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, <b>riboflavin,</b> folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of <b>riboflavin</b> crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline <b>riboflavin,</b> and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E
25|$|FAD plays a {{major role}} as an enzyme {{cofactor}} along with flavin mononucleotide, another molecule originating from <b>riboflavin.</b> Bacteria, fungi and plants can produce <b>riboflavin,</b> but other eukaryotes, such as humans, have lost the ability to make it. Therefore, humans must obtain <b>riboflavin,</b> also known as vitamin B2, from dietary sources. <b>Riboflavin</b> is generally absorbed in the small intestine and then transported to cells via carrier proteins. <b>Riboflavin</b> kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) adds a phosphate group to <b>riboflavin</b> to produce flavin mononucleotide, and then FAD synthetase attaches an adenine nucleotide; both steps require ATP. Bacteria generally have one bi-functional enzyme, but archaea and eukaryotes usually employ two distinct enzymes. Current research indicates that distinct isoforms exist in the cytosol and mitochondria. It seems that FAD is synthesized in both locations and potentially transported where needed.|$|E
25|$|Experimental balance studies {{indicate}} that urinary <b>riboflavin</b> excretion rates increase slowly with increasing intakes, until intake level approach 1.0nbsp&mg/d, when tissue saturation occurs. At higher intakes, the rate of excretion increases dramatically. Once intakes of 2.5nbsp&mg/d are reached, excretion becomes approximately equal to the rate of absorption (Horwitt et al., 1950) (18). At such high intake {{a significant proportion of}} the <b>riboflavin</b> intake is not absorbed. If urinary <b>riboflavin</b> excretion is <19nbsp&µg/g creatinine (without recent <b>riboflavin</b> intake) or < 40nbsp&µg per day are indicative of deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione reductase is a {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and FAD-dependent enzyme, and {{the major}} flavoprotein in erythrocyte. The measurement of the activity coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR) is the preferred method for assessing <b>riboflavin</b> status. It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term <b>riboflavin</b> status. In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients (AC) is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium. ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD. An AC of 1.2 to 1.4, <b>riboflavin</b> status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity. An AC > 1.4 suggests <b>riboflavin</b> deficiency. On the other hand, if FAD is added and AC is < 1.2, then <b>riboflavin</b> status is considered acceptable. Tillotson and Bashor reported that a decrease in the intakes of <b>riboflavin</b> was associated with increase in EGR AC. In the UK study of Norwich elderly, initial EGR AC values {{for both males and females}} were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later, suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long-term biochemical <b>riboflavin</b> status of individuals. These findings are consistent with earlier studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Riboflavin</b> is {{continuously}} excreted in {{the urine}} of healthy individuals, making deficiency relatively common when dietary intake is insufficient. <b>Riboflavin</b> deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Riboflavin,</b> {{also known}} as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} prevent and treat <b>riboflavin</b> deficiency and prevent migraines. It may be given by mouth or injection.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} for <b>riboflavin</b> toxicity produced by excessive intakes, in part because it has lower water solubility than other B vitamins, because absorption becomes less efficient as doses increase, and because what excess is absorbed is excreted via the kidneys into urine. Even when 400mg of <b>riboflavin</b> per day was given orally to subjects in one study for three months to investigate the efficacy of <b>riboflavin</b> in the prevention of migraine headache, no short-term side effects were reported. Although toxic doses can be administered by injection, any excess at nutritionally relevant doses is excreted in the urine, imparting a bright yellow color when in large quantities.|$|E
25|$|Pathogen Reduction {{treatment}} that involves, for example, {{the addition of}} <b>riboflavin</b> with subsequent exposure to UV light {{has been shown to}} be effective in inactivating pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites and white blood cells) in blood products. By inactivating white blood cells in donated blood products, <b>riboflavin</b> and UV light treatment can also replace gamma-irradiation as a method to prevent graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD).|$|E
25|$|<b>Riboflavin</b> {{deficiency}} prolongs {{recovery from}} malaria, despite preventing growth of plasmodium (the malaria parasite).|$|E
25|$|FMN riboswitch (also RFN-element) binds {{flavin mononucleotide}} (FMN) to {{regulate}} <b>riboflavin</b> biosynthesis and transport.|$|E
25|$|<b>Riboflavin</b> was {{discovered}} in 1920, isolated in 1933, and first made in 1935. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Riboflavin</b> is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In the United States a month of supplements costs less than 25 USD. Some countries require its addition to grains.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} a diet which includes an adequate amount of <b>riboflavin</b> containing foods. Multi-vitamin and mineral dietary supplements often contain 100% of the Daily Value (1.3 mg) for <b>riboflavin,</b> {{and can be}} used by persons concerned about an inadequate diet. Over-the-counter dietary supplements are available in the United States with doses as high as 100mg, but {{there is no evidence that}} these high doses have any additional benefit for healthy people.|$|E
25|$|Subclinical {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been observed in women taking oral contraceptives, in the elderly, in people with eating disorders, chronic alcoholism and in diseases such as HIV, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and chronic heart disease. The Celiac Disease Foundation points out that a gluten-free diet may be low in <b>riboflavin</b> (and other nutrients) as enriched wheat flour and wheat foods (bread, pasta, cereals, etc.) is a major dietary contribution to total <b>riboflavin</b> intake.|$|E
25|$|Phototherapy {{to treat}} {{jaundice}} in infants can cause increased degradation of <b>riboflavin,</b> leading to deficiency if not monitored closely.|$|E
25|$|Food and {{beverages}} that provide <b>riboflavin</b> without fortification are milk, cheese, eggs, leaf vegetables, liver, kidneys, legumes, mushrooms, and almonds.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} <b>riboflavin</b> ophthalmic {{solution and}} KXL system for crosslinking based on three 12-month clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|For example, flour {{has been}} {{fortified}} with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, <b>riboflavin,</b> niacin and vitamin B12.|$|E
25|$|A 2017 review {{found that}} <b>riboflavin</b> {{may be useful}} to prevent migraines in adults, but found that {{clinical}} trials in adolescents and children had produced mixed outcomes.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017 {{a system}} is marketed by Terumo in Europe {{that is used to}} remove {{pathogens}} from blood; donated blood is treated with <b>riboflavin</b> and then with ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|Overt {{clinical}} signs are rarely seen among {{inhabitants of the}} developed countries. The assessment of <b>Riboflavin</b> status is essential for confirming cases with unspecific symptoms where deficiency is suspected.|$|E
25|$|Enriched nonfat milk {{macaroni}} products – {{similar to}} nonfat milk macaroni products with added requirements that products {{in this category}} contain thiamin, <b>riboflavin,</b> niacin or niacinamide, folic acid and iron, all within specified ranges.|$|E
25|$|It {{is nearly}} always well tolerated. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. <b>Riboflavin</b> {{is in the}} vitamin B group. It is {{required}} by the body for cellular respiration. Food sources include eggs, green vegetables, milk, and meat.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium persulfate (APS) (N2H8S2O8; mW: 228.2) is {{a source}} of free {{radicals}} and is often used as an initiator for gel formation. An alternative source of free radicals is <b>riboflavin,</b> which generated free radicals in a photochemical reaction.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ectasia is a {{progressive}} thinning of the cornea; {{the most common}} form of this condition is keratoconus. Collagen cross-linking by applying <b>riboflavin</b> topically then shining UV light is a method to slow progression of corneal ectasia by strengthening corneal tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free <b>riboflavin</b> is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free <b>riboflavin,</b> with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free <b>riboflavin</b> in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E
25|$|As a {{chemical}} compound, <b>riboflavin</b> is a yellow-orange solid substance with poor {{solubility in water}} compared to other B vitamins. Visually, it imparts color to vitamin supplements (and bright yellow color to the urine of persons {{taking a lot of}} it).|$|E
25|$|In 100 gram amounts, milk {{chocolate}} {{is an excellent}} source (> 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of <b>riboflavin,</b> vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc (table). Chocolate is a good source (10–19% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron (table).|$|E
25|$|Kimchi {{is one of}} {{the famous}} foods of Korea. Kimchi is pickled {{vegetables}} which contain vitamins A and C, thiamine, <b>riboflavin,</b> iron, calcium, carotene, etc. There are many types of kimchi including cabbage kimchi, spring onion kimchi, cucumber kimchi, radish kimchi, and sesame kimchi.|$|E
25|$|Vegemite {{is one of}} {{the richest}} sources of Bvitamins, {{specifically}} thiamine, <b>riboflavin,</b> niacin and folate (B1, B2, B3 & B9, respectively). Unlike Marmite and some other yeast extracts, the base version contains no vitamin B12 although both B6 and vitamin B12 are added to the low-salt formulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{deficiency}} of <b>riboflavin</b> can be primary - poor vitamin sources in one's daily diet - or secondary, {{which may be}} a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine, the body not being able to use the vitamin, or an increase in the excretion of the vitamin from the body.|$|E
