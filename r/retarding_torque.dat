5000|$|Consider, for example, two masses, mi ("inner") and mo ("outer") {{connected}} by a spring under tension, both masses in orbit around a central body, Mc. In such a system, the angular velocity of circular orbits near the center {{is greater than the}} angular velocity of orbits farther from the center, but the angular momentum of the inner orbits is smaller than that of the outer orbits. If mi is allowed to orbit a little bit closer to the center than mo, it will have a slightly higher angular velocity. The connecting spring will pull back on mi, and drag mo forward. This means that mi experiences a <b>retarding</b> <b>torque,</b> loses angular momentum, and must fall inward to an orbit of smaller radius, corresponding to a smaller angular momentum. mo, on the other hand, experiences a positive torque, acquires more angular momentum, and moves outward to a higher orbit. The spring stretches yet more, the torques become yet larger, and the motion is unstable! Because magnetic forces act like a spring under tension connecting fluid elements, the behavior of a magnetized fluid is almost exactly analogous to this simple mechanical system. This is the essence of the MRI [...]|$|E

This electrical brake has been designed for the sugar cane industry in Queensland, Australia, which uses brake vans coupled to the end of cane trains to produce a given braking torque. The brake would be suitable for similar applications of electrical brakes in electrically driven machines such as electrical vehicles. This project was established to investigate electrical braking as an alternative to existing mechanical systems. Three fuzzy logic controllers {{have been designed}} to control the output <b>retarding</b> <b>torque</b> produced by an induction machine. One of these controllers adjusts the value of a shunt capacitance to maintain the excitation required for the generating operation. The other two adjust the duty cycle of a PWM converter, which drives the load of the induction machine. The duty cycle is adjusted in such a way to keep the <b>retarding</b> <b>torque,</b> produced by the machine, fixed at a given value...|$|E

40|$|The {{autorotation}} of a {{flat plate}} about its spanwise axis was experimentally studied. Most of the work was done with a wing mounted in a 5 x 7 ft low-speed wind tunnel. The measurements consisted of the unsteady lift, drag, angular acceleration and the wing rotation rate. The flow pattern {{was very different from}} that over a static wing. The maximum and average lift, drag and angular acceleration were measured for Reynolds numbers from 25, 000 to 250, 000. The effect of applying driving and <b>retarding</b> <b>torques</b> to the wing was studied. A variety of wing configurations were tested, together with freely falling wings. For Reynolds numbers above 4000 the average lift and drag coefficients were comparable to those observed in the fixed axis tests, and it appeared that the flow pattern was similar...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{and control}} of a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle is presented in this paper. A four wheel drive parallel hybrid electric vehicle is built by assembling an auxiliary electrical machine and battery group. Some preliminary instrumentation such as accelerator pedal, brake, clutch pedal position sensors and gear ratio estimation are realized to split torque demand into the two power sources. The first power source is {{the internal combustion engine}} and the second one is the permanent magnet electric motor. A rule-based control strategy is developed by setting transition rules between the two power sources. The control strategy is implemented on a proof-of-concept vehicle and road tested. In order to satisfy smooth transient switching between the two power sources, and in order not to disturb the driver by abrupt or <b>retarded</b> transitions, <b>torque</b> splitting is achieved by taking the power source dynamics and vehicle dynamics in the longitudinal direction into account. The internal combustion engine is not operated at its high emission and low fuel efficient regions. Regenerative braking is implemented to charge the electric motor battery pack during braking. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a MATLAB/Simulink dynamic model of an induction generator, which makes simulation studies {{possible for the}} design of fuzzy logic controllers for the purpose of controlling the <b>retarding</b> <b>torque</b> output of the generator in an electrical brake application, using the fuzzy logic toolbox of MATLAB. Electrical braking has been proposed in the literature {{as an alternative to the}} mechanical braking systems with an advantage of providing lower maintenance costs. An induction generator, acting as a brake, converts the kinetic energy of a vehicle to electrical energy, which can be dissipated in a resistor bank or used in a regenerative mode. The Simulink model developed will be used to design and test controllers for an effective control of the output torque of the electrical brake system...|$|E
40|$|A {{brake disc}} rotor forms pan of a {{foundation}} brake and rotates with the wheel hub assembly. The main {{function of a}} foundation brake is to generate a <b>retarding</b> <b>torque</b> by converting mechanical energy to thermal energy {{by virtue of the}} frictional work done in relative sliding at the rotor-pad interface. In practice, most brake discs arc made from cast iron and in use arc sometimes subjected to high thermal stresses which can lead to permanent plastic deformation and occasionally rotor cracking. The aim of the present work is to investigate the thermal response of such a cast iron brake disc using the finite element (FE) method. One particular existing brake disc design for a medium passenger car was chosen for the investigation. This is a "back-vented" disc designed to minimise disc coning but the present work also includes an investigation of a conventional "frontvented" disc similar in dimension to the back-vented disc but with different detailed geometry. Experimental work was undertaken to derive the rotor material properties in tension and compression as a function of temperature. This data was used to generate suitable FE material model routines which accurately allow for the different temperature-dependent yield properties of cast iron in tension and compression. The modelling work highlights the role of the rotor geometry in controlling the thermal response of the structure but. more importantly, the necessity for an accurate material model is illustrated, particularly with regard to its ability to predict the accumulation of plastic strain which may lead to rotor cracking. Using the most accurate user developed material subroutine, the thermal response of the back-and front-vented disc designs are compared: the back-vented disc suffers lower thermal distortion but at the expense of higher plastic strain accumulation, particularly near the point of attachment of the vanes...|$|E
40|$|Rotation damping and {{alignment}} {{are discussed}} as prerequisites for polarization power. An expression {{is derived from}} first principles, for the damping time of the rotation of a particle in a magnetic field, under the Faraday braking torque, provided its electrical properties are known. This {{makes it possible to}} describe mathematically, in great detail, the motion of the particle and determine its ultimate state of motion, if a steady state is possible at all. This work defines, first, the necessary condition for the Faraday braking to be effective: a) the net electronic charge distribution should not be uniform throughout; b) the number of vibration modes should exceed a few tens. Resonance of rotation frequency with any of these modes is not a requirement. For alignment to be possible, the ratio of gyroscopic and conservative magnetic to non-conservative (<b>retarding)</b> magnetic <b>torques</b> must be low. Either dia-, para- or ferro-magnetism can do, and a small susceptibility is enough and even preferable. This opens up a wide spectrum of possible candidates. A few examples are given.

40|$|As {{two black}} holes bound {{to each other}} in a close binary {{approach}} merger their inspi-ral time eventually becomes shorter than the characteristic inflow time of surrounding orbiting matter. Using an innovative technique in which we represent the changing spacetime in the region occupied by the orbiting matter with a 2. 5 PN approximation and the binary orbital evolution with 3. 5 PN, we have simulated the MHD evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-mass non-spinning binary. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} inspiral, the structure of the circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from Newtonian results. The binary opens a low-density gap whose ra-dius is roughly two binary separations, and matter piles up at the outer edge of this gap as inflow is <b>retarded</b> by <b>torques</b> exerted by the binary; nonetheless, the accretion rate is diminished relative to its value at larger radius by only about a factor of 2.

40|$|The authors tested whether heavy {{strength}} training, including hip-flexion exercise, {{would reduce}} {{the extent of the}} phase in the crank revolution where negative or <b>retarding</b> crank <b>torque</b> occurs. Negative torque normally occurs in the upstroke phase when the leg is lifted by flexing the hip. Eighteen well-trained cyclists either performed 12 wk of heavy strength training in addition to their usual endurance training (E+S; n = 10) or merely continued their usual endurance training during the intervention period (E; n = 8). The strength training consisted of 4 lower body exercises (3 x 4 - 10 repetition maximum) performed twice a week. E+S enhanced cycling performance by 7 %, which was more than in E (P -. 02). Performance was determined as average power output in a 5 -min all-out trial performed subsequent to 185 min of submaximal cycling. The performance enhancement, which has been reported previously, was here shown to be accompanied by improved pedaling efficacy during the all-out cycling. Thus, £+ 5 shortened the phase where negative crank torque occurs by - 16 °, corresponding to - 14 %, which was more than in E (P =. 002). In conclusion, adding heavy strength training to usual endurance training in well-trained cyclists improves pedaling efficacy during 5 -min all-out cycling performed after 185 min of cycling...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a simple variable speed drive (VSD) based on a brushless direct current (BLDC) machine and discrete logic circuits. A practical VSD was built, capable of operating a BLDC machine in two quadrants, motoring and regenerative braking. The intended applications are electric scooters and electric bicycles, where the recovered energy from braking extends {{the range of the}} vehicle. A conceptual four quadrant VSD, suitable for three and four wheelers requiring reverse operation, was designed and tested in simulation. Simplicity was emphasized in this design to help achieve a robust, easy to analyse system. The versatility of multi-function gate integrated circuits (ICs) made them ideal for implementing the commutation logic and keeping the system simple. The BLDC machine has sensors with a resolution of 60 ed to determine rotor position. An electronic commutator or phase switcher module interprets the position signals and produces a switching pattern. This effectively transforms the BLDC machine into a direct current (DC) brushed machine. A synchronous step down converter controls the BLDC machine current with a tolerance band scheme. This module treats the BLDC machine {{as if it was a}} DC machine. The leakage inductance of the electric machine is used as the inductive filter element. The unipolar switching scheme used ensures that current flows out of the battery only for motoring operation and into the battery only during regeneration. The current and torque are directly related in a DC brushed machine. The action of an electronic commutator or phase switcher creates that same relationship between torque and current in a BLDC machine. Torque control is achieved in the BLDC machine using a single channel current controller. The phase switcher current is monitored and used to control the duty ratio of the synchronous converter switches. Successful operation of the practical VSD was achieved in two quadrants: forwards motoring and forwards regenerating. The maximum tested power outputs were 236 W in motoring mode and 158 W in regenerating mode. The output torque could be smoothly controlled from a positive to a negative value. iv v Simulation of the conceptual four quadrant design was successful in all the motoring, generating and active braking zones. The required manipulation of logic signals to achieve this type of operation was done automatically while the machine was running. The resulting output torque is smoothly controlled in all of the operating zones. Commutation at certain speeds and torques are handled better by some topologies than others. Some current sensing strategies adversely affect instantaneous phase currents under certain conditions. The final design chose the method where phase currents experience no overshoot, minimizing component stress. The battery, or energy storage system, used in verifying the operation of the VSD in the practical electric bicycle was found to be the most limiting component. In regenerating mode, the low charge acceptance rate of the battery reduced the maximum <b>retarding</b> <b>torque</b> and energy recovery rate...|$|E

During inspiral, the inner edge of the disk at first moves inward in coordination with the shrinking binary, but as the orbital evolution accelerates, the rate at which the inner edge moves toward smaller radii falls behind the rate of binary compression. In this stage, the rate of angular momentum transfer from the binary to the disk slows substantially, but the net accretion rate decreases by only 10 - 20 %. When the binary separation is tens of gravitational radii, the rest-mass efficiency of disk radiation is a few percent, suggesting that supermassive binary black holes in galactic nuclei could be very luminous at this stage of their evolution. If the luminosity were optically thin, it would be modulated at a frequency that is a beat between the orbital frequency of the disk's surface density maximum and the binary orbital frequency. However, a disk with sufficient surface density to be luminous should also be optically thick; as a result, the periodic modulation may be suppressed.
