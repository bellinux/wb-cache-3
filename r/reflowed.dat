50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{techniques}} for <b>reflowing</b> solder. One is to use infrared lamps; this is called infrared <b>reflow.</b> Another is to use a hot gas convection. Another technology which is becoming popular again is special fluorocarbon liquids with high boiling points which use a method called vapor phase <b>reflow.</b> Due to environmental concerns, this method was falling out of favor until lead-free legislation was introduced which requires tighter controls on soldering. Currently, at the end of 2008, convection soldering is the most popular <b>reflow</b> technology using either standard air or nitrogen gas. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

50|$|A {{majority}} of the defects in circuit-board assembly are caused due to issues in the solder-paste printing process or due to defects in the solder paste. There are {{many different types of}} defects possible, i.e. too much solder, or the solder melts and connects too many wires (bridging), resulting in a short circuit. Insufficient amounts of paste result in incomplete circuits. head-on-pillow defects, or incomplete coalescence of ball grid array (BGA) sphere and solder paste deposit, is a failure mode that has seen increased frequency since the transition to lead-free soldering.

50|$|Flip chip, {{also known}} as {{controlled}} collapse chip connection or its abbreviation, C4, is a method for interconnecting semiconductor devices, such as IC chips and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), to external circuitry with solder bumps that have been deposited onto the chip pads.

The solder bumps are deposited on the chip pads on the top side of the wafer during the final wafer processing step. In order to mount the chip to external circuitry (e.g., a circuit board or another chip or wafer), it is flipped over so that its top side faces down, and aligned so that its pads align with matching pads on the external circuit, and then the solder is <b>reflowed</b> to complete the interconnect.

Surface tension causes the bead to have a curved surface and rise above the solder mask, where it solidifies into a Bead Probe. The bead will be roughly obround in shape and may be 15-25 mils long. A properly constructed bead is the same width as the trace and just enough to clear the surrounding solder mask. The bead is then accessible for testing using a probe with a flat end, which can help compensate for the tolerance build up in the test fixture and PCB.|$|E
50|$|Reflowing as a rework technique, {{similar to}} the {{manufacturing}} process of reflow soldering, involves dismantling the equipment to remove the faulty circuit board, pre-heating the whole board in an oven, heating the non-functioning component further to melt the solder, then cooling, following a carefully determined thermal profile, and reassembling, a process which is hoped will repair the bad connection without the need to remove and replace the component.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} the combined assessment of <b>reflow</b> and {{collateral blood flow}} by myocardial contrast echocardiography after myocardial infarction.  DESIGN—Myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed in patients with acute myocardial infarction shortly after successful coronary reperfusion (TIMI 3  patency) by direct angioplasty. Collateral flow was assessed before coronary angioplasty, and contrast <b>reflow</b> was evaluated 15  minutes after reperfusion. The presence of contractile reserve was assessed by low dose dobutamine echocardiography (5  to 15  µg/kg/min) at (mean (SD)) 3  (2) days after myocardial infarction. Recovery of segmental function (myocardial viability) was evaluated by resting echocardiography at a two month follow up. The study was prospective.  PATIENTS— 35 consecutive patients referred for acute transmural myocardial infarction.  RESULTS—Contrast <b>reflow</b> was observed in 20  patients (57 %) and collateral flow in 14  (40 %). Contrast <b>reflow</b> and collateral contrast flow were both correlated with reversible dysfunction on initial dobutamine echocardiography and at follow up (p <  0. 05). The presence of <b>reflow</b> or collateral flow on myocardial contrast echocardiography was a highly sensitive (100 %) but weakly specific (60 %) indicator of segmental dysfunction recovery.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper focuses on the effect of <b>reflow</b> process on the contact resistance and reliability of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) interconnection. The contact resistance of ACF interconnection increases after <b>reflow</b> process due to the decrease in contact area of the conducting particles between the mating I/O pads. However, the relationship between the contact resistance and bonding parameters of the ACF interconnection with <b>reflow</b> treatment follows the similar trend to that of the as-bonded (i. e. without <b>reflow)</b> ACF interconnection. The contact resistance increases as the peak temperature of <b>reflow</b> profile increases. Nearly 40 % of the joints were found to be open after <b>reflow</b> with 260 °C peak temperature. During the <b>reflow</b> process, the entrapped (between the chip and substrate) adhesive matrix tries to expand much more than the tiny conductive particles because of the higher coefficient of thermal expansion, the induced thermal stress will try to lift the bump from the pad and decrease the contact area of the conductive path and eventually, leading to a complete loss of electrical contact. In addition, the environmental effect on contact resistance such as high temperature/humidity aging test was also investigated. Compared with the ACF interconnections with Ni/Au bump, higher thermal stress in the Z-direction is accumulated in the ACF interconnections with Au bump during the <b>reflow</b> process owing to the higher bump height, thus greater loss of contact area between the particles and I/O pads leads to an increase of contact resistance and poorer reliability after <b>reflow...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the world}} moves towards {{eliminating}} lead from consumer products, the microelectronics industry has {{put effort into}} developing lead-free solder paste. The major drawback of lead-free solder is the problems caused by its high reflow temperature.

Issues addressed in this study include using VFM to reduce the solder reflow temperature, comparing the heating rate of different size solder particles, and comparing the reliability of VFM <b>reflowed</b> solder versus conventionally <b>reflowed</b> solder. Results comparing the effect of particle size on the heating rate of solder showed that the differences were negligible. This {{is due in part to}} the particle sizes overlapping. Many lead-free solder pastes reflow around 250 ℃. Results indicate that when using the VFM, lead-free solder paste will reflow at 220 ℃. The reliability of solder that was <b>reflowed</b> using the VFM at the reduced temperature was found to be comparable to solder <b>reflowed</b> in a conventional manner. Based on these findings, VFM processing can eliminate the major obstacles to making lead-free solder paste a more attractive option for use in the microelectronics industry. M. S.

As a result, comparing the particular device reported with nickel on glass process which operates at 180 kHz for low frequency application, the preliminary experimental result of the newly reported device shows a resonant frequency at around 7. 7 MHz by using an impedance analyzer.
