40|$|Purpose - In recent years, {{housing prices}} and rents have {{recorded}} impressive growth in Iran. Several observers believe that <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> {{have had a}} significant effect on this phenomenon. However, some do not agree with this viewpoint and argue that the role of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> is not that much and housing prices and rents are affected by macroeconomic factors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate whether <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> can influence housing prices and rents across provinces of Iran. Design/methodology/approach - Applying panel data technique, this paper uses observations from 28 provinces of Iran covering 2000 and 2003 to examine the role of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> on housing prices and rents. Findings - The empirical results indicate that the increased number of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> and their activities positively significantly stimulate housing prices and rents. Research limitations/implications - To the author's knowledge, most studies in this area cover the US and European <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> markets. Since findings for developed countries might not be directly transferable to emerging market economies such as Iran, more work is necessary to obtain a clearer picture of the role of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> on housing prices and rents in emerging economies. Originality/value - Although there has been a series of cross-sectional studies published in this area, few empirical works have examined the effects of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> on housing prices and rents by applying panel data set. The paper begins to fill this gap by analyzing a data sample of 28 provinces of Iran covering 2000 and 2003...|$|R

40|$|A 1982 {{survey of}} Anglo, Black, and Hispanic <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> in the Denver {{metropolitan}} area suggested that {{race and ethnicity}} influence the attitudes and business practices of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents.</b> Minority <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> tended to gain listings from minority sellers and in areas of minority concentrations. They also have closer business relationships with other agents of the same minority group. One possible indicator of their integration into the dominant community, however, is the finding that minority agents {{were more likely to}} select personal residences in non- minority neighborhoods...|$|R
5|$|Mark Vogel, a Maryland <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agent,</b> {{purchased}} both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs Racetrack in 1987 for $6 {{million in}} cash plus $5.5 million in debt. Rosecroft was awarded another Breeders Crown race in 1988, making it their fifth straight—but final—year of hosting them. Vogel had three main goals when he became owner: to construct a $10 million grandstand, simulcast Rosecroft races at other racetracks throughout Maryland to attract a larger market, and have more racing days. In 1989, Vogel purchased Freestate Raceway. Freestate was sold to a development firm the next year, and Rosecroft was awarded more racing days.|$|E

5|$|Rindt was {{pronounced}} dead {{on the way to}} hospital and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agent</b> found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> industry is segmented along racial or ethnic lines.

Sellers select <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agents</b> at least partially on the basis of a common ethnicity, ethnicity affects the size and location of territories in which an agent obtains listings, and an agent 2 ̆ 7 s network of business contacts is limited by and is shaped by the ethnicity of the agent.
