5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime.

This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E

Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually <b>resided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E

5|$|Upon Mowry's death, {{his wife}} {{retained}} the house until {{selling it to}} Stephen Paine on September 5, 1671. Paine conveyed it to Samuel Whipple who <b>resided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house {{until his death in}} 1711. Upon his death the house was recorded as having a two-story lean-to. Whipple transferred the property to his wife and upon her death, which passed to their daughters Abigail and Hope Whipple. Hope Whipple would marry Robert Currie and upon her death, Robert Currie would marry her sister Abigail Whipple, and upon her death fell to Robert Currie's ownership. In 1737, Currie sold the house to William Smith, Job Whipple and John Whipple. It remained in the Whipple family until 1761 when it was sold to Captain Joseph Owen. The house would take its final name, the Abbott House, from Thomas Abbott who married Joseph Owen's daughter and <b>resided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house until his death in 1826. The Mowry Tavern was allegedly one of only five buildings not burned by the Indians during King Philip's War. It is believed that it was spared because Roger Williams, a friend of the Indians, held Christian worship services in the building. The house was located on Abbott Street adjacent to the North Burial Ground. The entire structure was demolished in 1900 to construct a triple decker tenement house. At the time of its demolition, it was the oldest house in Providence.|$|E
