25|$|In the {{introduction}} to book seven, Vitruvius goes {{to great lengths to}} present why he is qualified to write De Architectura. This is the only location in the work where Vitruvius specifically addresses his personal breadth of knowledge. Similar to a modern <b>reference</b> <b>section,</b> the author's position as one who is knowledgeable and educated is established. The topics range across many fields of expertise reflecting that in Roman times as today construction is a diverse field. Vitruvius is clearly a well-read man.|$|E

25|$|Chaos Dwarfs: The White Dwarf Presents army {{book was}} {{released}} during 4th Edition {{as a collection}} of White Dwarf articles, but is still considered an official rule book. An official Chaos Dwarf army list was included in Ravening Hordes at the start of 6th edition. The army list was included in the <b>reference</b> <b>section</b> of 7th edition, but has been removed from the 8th edition rulebook. This model line was discontinued at the end of 5th edition and is no longer supported by the main rules. Forge World is releasing new Chaos Dwarf models under their new Warhammer Forge line. Rules for Chaos Dwarfs are expected in their first Warhammer supplement.|$|E
25|$|During {{refurbishment}} the library's lending service continued temporarily at , 35 Pound Lane. The {{stock at}} Pound Lane included books for adults, children and teenagers; computer facilities; DVDs, CDs, talking {{books and a}} reduced <b>reference</b> <b>section.</b> Baby Bounce and Rhyme and Story Time sessions for children continued, along with other community services. Part of the local studies library was accessible at the Cathedral Archives until 2012. On one day in May 2009 at the Dane John Gardens, Kent Libraries & Archives staged a Lark in the Park educational entertainment event to publicise the library's move from the Beaney to the Pound Lane location. The building reopened in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Whenever {{a player}} {{correctly}} answers {{a question or}} solves a puzzle in a minigame, they gain [...] "mastery points" [...] on the word they successfully answered. The minigames can be increased in difficulty; on higher difficulty levels, players will acquire more mastery points when successfully completing a minigame. For instance, in Multiple Choice, the player has 50 seconds to select an answer for a question on the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty, and will receive two mastery points for each correct answer. On the [...] "Medium" [...] difficulty, the player has 40 seconds to select an answer and receives three mastery points for each correct answer. The process continues until the player scores fifteen mastery points for every word, allowing the player to proceed to the next lesson. Following the completion of all fifty lessons, the player can continue to learn new words through [...] "open lessons" [...] that contain ten new vocabulary words apiece; the dictionaries of both games each hold nearly 10,000 words. The player can freely access the <b>reference</b> <b>section,</b> which contains a dictionary and phrasebook, at any time. Both the dictionary and phrasebook hold all of the words and phrases in each game, as well as meanings and audio files for both; the player can look through different categories of words and phrases, use a search function, and bookmark chosen phrases.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In {{a review of}} the PSP version of My Spanish Coach, IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to [...] "quite a bit of grinding" [...] due to the game's repetitive structure. Nevertheless, IGN accepted that the repetition was an effective way to learn the vocabulary, and noted that [...] "icking up on things like gender and age, emphasis and the breakdowns of the actual language itself and proper/casual ways of conversing are made fairly clear and reinforced regularly". IGN's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense, calling it one of the [...] "most disappointing" [...] aspects of the game, but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames. Eurogamer noted that the minigames were [...] "only really good for practicing reading" [...] {{due to a lack of}} games for practicing proper speaking, but GameZone disagreed, noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons, and praised this aspect as the [...] "most interesting and intriguing feature of [...] ". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My Spanish Coach, Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames [...] "exhibit the same type of unimaginative boringness" [...] and that [...] "it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini-games"; however, it noted that the minigames were [...] "extremely effective" [...] and [...] "constructed extremely well" [...] in terms of teaching the language. Nintendo World Report's review of the DS version of My French Coach called the game's <b>reference</b> <b>section</b> [...] "a very handy travel dictionary", noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was [...] "an absurd value".|$|E
2500|$|In 1911 Mudge {{was hired}} at Columbia University. The President of Columbia, Nicholas Murray Butler, {{became one of}} her {{earliest}} supporters. [...] Butler found her “incredibly resourceful in meeting his varied reference and bibliographic needs.” [...] She began to push for all libraries to have a <b>reference</b> <b>section</b> that would include at least “the possession of certain basic works, a dictionary, an encyclopedia, an atlas, a biographical dictionary” but hopefully would also include “a book of quotations, handbook of statistics, a state or government manual”.|$|E

An ICT training suite at the library has been named the [...] "Bill Gates Room". Blackburn has smaller libraries serving the Mill Hill, Livesey and Roman Road parts of the town, as well as a mobile library service.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{successive}} Books of Common Prayer of the reformed Church of England, from 1549 to 1662, its recitation was provided for on 19 occasions each year, a practice which continued until the nineteenth century, when vigorous controversy regarding its statement about 'eternal damnation' saw its use gradually decline. It {{remains one of}} the three Creeds approved in the Thirty-Nine Articles, and is printed in several current Anglican prayer books (e.g. A Prayer Book for Australia (1995)). As with Roman Catholic practice, its use is now generally only on Trinity Sunday or its octave. The Episcopal Church based in the United States has never provided for its use in worship, but added it to its Book of Common Prayer {{for the first time in}} 1979, where it is included in small print in a <b>reference</b> <b>section</b> entitled [...] "Historical Documents of the Church." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first floor}} of the main branch of the Cedar Rapids Public Library was filled with floodwater. With a {{collection}} of books said to be about 290,000, the entire adult section was lost, as was the <b>reference</b> <b>section.</b> The children's collection, however, was located on the unflooded second floor. Plans to expand the building and to increase the library levy were shelved. On July 3, 2008, the library's director stated that the main branch may not reopen for at least three years, with the possibility open of moving to a new location altogether. In the meantime, the library leased additional space at Westdale Mall, where it already operated a branch. [...] FEMA would not pay for rebuilding the main branch on the current, flood-prone site, so a property swap was effected with a commercial property owner away from the river; the new owner paid for renovation, and FEMA paid for a new library across the square from the city art museum. In 2013, the downtown branch of the library was completed by OPN Architects, a regional design firm located in Cedar Rapids. The project has received many awards in library design and construction by the American Library Association and American Institute of Architects.|$|E
