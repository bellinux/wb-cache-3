50|$|The {{arrangement}} of the continents has changed over time due to plate tectonics, resulting in the bathymetry of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape {{and size of the}} basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. Numerical models simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions. On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical estuarine circulation. Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from <b>river</b> <b>input</b> and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.|$|E

Results of principal components analysis (PCA) of the fossil diatom assemblages from 13. 8 cal ka to the present track changes related to fluctuations of <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> and variations of lake levels. Diatom abundance data indicate that the hydrologic balance between 13. 8 and 7. 6 cal ka is strongly tied to <b>river</b> <b>inputs,</b> whereas after 7. 6 cal ka the hydrologic balance is more influenced by changes in lake evaporation.

Increased nutrient availability from <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> in this area (compared to an extreme scenario with no river nutrients) leads to an increase in 14 % (0. 7 Pg C a&minus; 1 ) in open ocean primary production (PP), and 21 % (0. 2 Pg C a&minus; 1 ) in coastal ocean PP.

On the other hand, African <b>river</b> <b>inputs,</b> although smaller than South American inputs, have larger impact on the coastal and open tropical Atlantic Ocean export production.

40|$|We {{tested for}} {{unintended}} mercury contamination {{problems associated with}} estuarine floodplain restoration projects of the Louisiana coastal zone, USA. Barataria Bay and Breton Sound are two neighboring deltaic estuaries that were isolated by levees from the Mississippi River about 100 years ago. These estuaries recently have been reconnected to the nutrient-rich Mississippi River, starting major <b>river</b> diversion (<b>input)</b> flows in 1991 for Breton Sound and in 2004 for Barataria Bay. We collected > 2100 fish over five years from 20 stations in these estuaries to test two hypotheses about Hg bioaccumulation: (H 1) Background Hg bioaccumulation in fish would be highest in low-salinity upper reaches of estuaries, and (H 2) recent <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> to these upper estuarine areas would increase Hg bioaccumulation in fish food webs. For H 1, we surveyed fish Hg concentrations at several stations along a salinity gradient in Barataria Bay in 2003 - 2004, a time when this estuary lacked strong <b>river</b> <b>inputs.</b> Results showed that average Hg concentrations in fish communities were lowest (150 ng/g dry mass) in higher salinity areas and 2. 4 נhigher (350 ng/g) in low-salinity oligohaline and freshwater {{upper reaches of the}} estuary. For H 2, we tested for enhanced Hg bioaccumulation following diversion onset in both estuaries. Fish communities from Breton Sound that had long-term (> 10 years) diversion inputs had 1. 7 נhigher average Hg contents of 610 ng/g Hg vs. 350 ng/g background values. Shorter-term diversion inputs over 2 - 3 years in upper Barataria Bay did not result in strong Hg enrichments or stable C isotope increases seen in Breton Sound, even though N and S stable-isotope values indicated strong <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> in both estuaries. It may be that epiphyte communities on abundant submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) are important hotspots for Hg cycling in these estuaries, and observed lesser development of these epiphyte communities in upper Barataria Bay during the first years of diversion inputs may account for the lessened Hg bioaccumulation in fish. A management consideration from this study is that river restoration projects may unintentionally fertilize SAV and epiphyte-based food webs, leading to higher Hg bioaccumulation in river-impacted floodplains and their food webs.

40|$|Under certain {{conditions}} the strontium isotope ratio {{in the water}} of a semi‐enclosed basin {{is known to be}} sensitive to the relative size of ocean water inflow and <b>river</b> <b>input.</b> Combining Sr‐isotope ratios measured in Mediterranean Late Miocene successions with data on past salinity, one can derive quantitative information on the Mediterranean hydrological budget at times before and during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC). Previous studies obtained this hydrological budget by inverting the salinity and strontium data with steady state solutions to the conservation equations of salt, strontium and water. Here, we develop a box model with a time‐dependent set of equations to investigate the coeval evolution of salinity and Sr ratios under different water budgets, gateway restrictions and riverine Sr characteristics. Model results are compared with the salinity and strontium ratio data from the Mediterranean. With a present‐day water budget, strontium ratios in the Mediterranean never reach the observed Messinian values regardless of gateway restriction and water budget. However, a model with tripled <b>river</b> <b>input,</b> as inferred for the Late Miocene, is able to reproduce the Sr ratios observed. The onset of the MSC can be explained with a simple restriction of the gateway(s) between the Mediterranean and Atlantic.

We use a standard model scenario and three sensitivity tests to investigate {{the role of}} total river nutrient and carbon inputs, {{as well as the}} western (South American) and eastern (African) <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> on the tropical Atlantic Ocean biogeochemistry, between 20 S– 20 N and 70 W– 20 E. Increased nutrient availability from <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> in this area (compared to a sensitivity scenario without <b>river</b> nutrient <b>inputs,</b> NO_RIVER) leads to an increase in primary production (PP) and export production (EP), mainly in the coastal ocean area (modeled ocean area with bathymetry< 200 m). Model results suggest an enhanced N-fixation by diazotrophs on the tropical Atlantic mainly in open ocean areas. The increased rate of Nfixation in the TODAY scenario is proportional to the increase in PP and EP relative to the NO_RIVER scenario, and may support up to 14 % of the coastal ocean export production. Inputs from South American rivers have an impact in coastal PP and EP two times higher than those from African rivers. On the other hand, results suggest that the contribution of African and South American rivers to the total increase in open ocean PP and EP is similar. Considering the amount of delivered nutrients (2 – 3 times less nutrients and carbon <b>inputs</b> by African <b>rivers)</b> one concludes that African riverine inputs may have a larger impact on the whole tropical Atlantic Ocean biogeochemistry. This is probably due to a combination of nutrient trapping in upwelling areas off the large rivers’ outflows and shallow mixed layers in the eastern tropical Atlantic, concomitantly to the differences in delivered nutrient ratios leading to alleviation in limitation conditions, mainly for diatoms. When <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> are added to the model, we estimate a modest decrease in open ocean sea-air CO 2 fluxes (− 5. 2 TgC a− 1) and an increase in coastal ocean CO 2 fluxes, mainly provoked by the remineralization of riverine organic matter delivered by the South American rivers...|$|R

40|$|The {{wide range}} of {{ecological}} goods and services provided by tropical coastal lagoons and wetlands are under considerable pressure due to the synergistic effects of local anthropogenic impact and global climate change. In transitional waters, salinity is a key driver of ecological processes mostly depending on the balance between marine and <b>river</b> <b>inputs,</b> a balance that can be significantly modified by climate change and by anthropogenic alteration of the watershed. Mesoamerica being considered as a climate change hot-spot and as an ecoregion strongly vulnerable to global change, our study aimed at analyzing the relationship between salinity, river runoff, and rainfall variability in a tropical coastal lagoon and to assess the respective influence of climate change and watershed management. The study focusing on the large and shallow coastal lagoon of Laguna de Terminos in south eastern Mexico established: (1) the variability in salinity distribution along the yearly cycle and the occurrence of a high salinity anomaly period during the wet season of 2009; (2) the relationship between lagoon waters salinity and <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> further underlying the anomalous situation encountered in 2009; (3) a long term increase in river discharge during the past 60 years, indicating potential salinity decrease in the lagoon during that same period; (4) an absence of any change in rainfall linking the increase in runoff to watershed management rather than long term trend in climate change. Additionally, the specific context of the 2009 - 2010 Central-Equatorial Pacific El Nio is underlined and the potential relationship between river discharge and ENSO is discussed.

Unlike previous studies, here both short- and long-lived nuclide {{data were obtained}} for <b>river</b> <b>inputs,</b> <b>river</b> water, and estuarine waters. The mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin was chosen as a typical northern shield area because this river may represent typical waters flowing into the Arctic and northern seas. Groundwaters from bedrock and glacial tills have comparable Th isotope concentrations and do not exhibit significant Th isotopic shifts relative to host rocks. The extensive peat deposits of the basin receive groundwater discharges and concentrate Th and U (but not Ba and Ra), which cause high ^(230) Th/^(232) Th ratios in mire waters. However, mire outflows {{do not have a}} significant impact on Th and Ra isotopic compositions of the river. Overall weathering characteristics for the basin are obtained from the river data. The ^(230) Th/^(232) Th, ^(228) Ra/^(226) Ra, and ^(226) Ra/Ba river ratios are comparable to those of source rocks, consistent with similar release rates of these nuclides from U-, Th-, and Ba-bearing minerals. River ratios of (^(230) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) and (^(226) Ra/^(238) U) _(AR) are < 1, so that Th and possibly Ra are accumulating in the weathering regions, and the weathering profile is still evolving. Low (^(228) Ra/^(232) Th) _(AR) and (^(226) Ra/^(230) Th) ^(AR) ratios indicate that Th is preferentially retained over Ra. River (^(234) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) ratios are greater than (^(230) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) ratios and suggest that in systems where <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> are well characterized, these ratios can be used to calculate Th transit times through the watershed. Filtration data indicate that although a dominant fraction of the Th is transported in the river on particles, the rest is almost entirely carried by colloids.

40|$|Riverine {{inputs and}} direct {{discharges}} to Norwegian seas in 2009 have been estimated {{in accordance with}} the requirements of the OSPAR Commission. Due to the general lower water discharges in 2009 than in 2008, there was a reduction in all nutrient fractions in riverine loads in 2009. Long-term (1990 - 2009) trends show that nutrient loads have decreased in some Norwegian rivers, although nitrogen concentrations have increased in others. Direct discharges of nutrients from fish farming continue to increase. The riverine loads of all metals except mercury were lower in 2009 than in 2008. The copper discharges from fish farming continue to increase. Analyses of long term trends (1990 - 2009) in metal inputs showed that zinc and copper loads have been reduced in several <b>rivers.</b> <b>Inputs</b> of PCBs and the pesticide lindane in 2009 were insignificant.

40|$|Regional seas (n = 19), {{archipelago}} coasts (n = 3) {{and extended}} coastal platforms (n = 2) are here considered as mega filters of land-ocean linkage through river fluxes. They are differentiated {{on the basis}} of morphological characteristics and they correspond to 7. 2 % of the global ocean area and to 2. 4 % of its volume. Their catchment characteristics (48 indicators for catchment relief, lithology, climate; <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> of total suspended solids TSS, total N and dissolved SiO 2; population) are determined {{on the basis of}} a recombination of 69 individual coastal segments and catchments (COSCATs, [Meybeck, M., Durr, H. H. and Vorosmarty, C. J., 2006. Global coastal segmentation and its river catchment contributors: a new look at land-ocean linkage. Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 20, GB 1 S 90, doi: 10. 1029 / 2005 GB 002540. ], Global Biogeoch. Cycles, 20, 1, GB IS 90). Regional Seas (RS) alone intercept 44 Mkm 2 of land-drainage, i. e. 39 % of the exorheic area, corresponding to 52 % of the population connected to oceans, to 35 % of the river runoff, 38 % of the global coastline (at 0. 5 degrees resolution) and to 46 %, 33 % and 46 % of the river fluxes to oceans of TSS, silica and total N, respectively. In this intercepted area, essentially developed in the N. Hemisphere, the wet tropical catchments are under-represented compared to other climate types, while its relief and lithology are similar to those of the direct drainage to the open ocean. The RS catchment area/RS area ratio ranges from 0. 35 (close to the global ocean figure) to 10. 3, the average RS depths from 42 to 2 500 in and theoretical river water renewal times from 50 to 52000 years. Together with the catchment population pressure per km 2 of RS (from 1 to 670 p km - 2) they are the first-order indicators that best differentiate the RS. The resulting <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> per unit RS catchment area and per unit RS area and RS volume range over 2 to 4 orders of magnitude. The population pressure is also very variable. Each RS should therefore be characterized, protected and managed individually. If specific filter coefficients of river material were applied to the 3 types of mega filters, these filters could intercept about 5300, 15 and 100 10 e 12 g y - 1 of TSS, total N and dissolved SiO 2, respectively, thus lowering the present <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> to the open ocean by 33 %, 36 % and 26 %, respectively. Regional Seas and their catchments are very different from the rest of the oceans. Their average specific river loads per unit sea area or volume are higher by one order of magnitude than those of the open ocean and much higher for some individual seas. They are very sensitive to human pressures, and should now be treated separately and individually both in Earth System Science and Ocean protection...|$|R
40|$|Geological {{sequestration}} {{of atmospheric}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{can be achieved}} by the erosion of organic carbon (OC) from the terrestrial biosphere and its burial in long-lived marine sediments. Rivers on mountain islands of Oceania in the western Pacific have very high rates of OC export to the ocean, yet its preservation offshore remains poorly constrained. Here we use the OC content (C org, %), radiocarbon (Δ 14 C org) and stable isotope (δ 13 C org) composition of sediments offshore Taiwan to assess the fate of terrestrial OC, using surface, sub-surface and Holocene sediments. We account for rock-derived OC to assess the preservation of OC eroded from the terrestrial biosphere and the associated CO 2 sink during flood discharges (hyperpycnal river plumes) and when <b>river</b> <b>inputs</b> are dispersed more widely (hypopycnal). The C org, Δ 14 C org and δ 13 C org of marine sediment traps and cores indicate that during flood discharges, terrestrial OC can be transferred efficiently down submarine canyons to the deep ocean and accumulates offshore with little evidence for terrestrial OC loss. In marine sediments fed by dispersive <b>river</b> <b>inputs,</b> the C org, Δ 14 C org and δ 13 C org are consistent with mixing of terrestrial OC with marine OC and suggest that efficient preservation of terrestrial OC (> 70 %) is also associated with hypopycnal delivery. Sub-surface and Holocene sediments indicate that this preservation is long-lived on millennial timescales. Re-burial of rock-derived OC is pervasive. Our findings from Taiwan suggest that erosion and offshore burial of OC from the terrestrial biosphere may sequester > 8 TgC yr − 1 across Oceania, a significant geological CO 2 sink which requires better constraint. We postulate that mountain islands of Oceania provide a strong link between tectonic uplift and the carbon cycle, one moderated by the climatic variability which controls terrestrial OC delivery to the ocean...|$|R
