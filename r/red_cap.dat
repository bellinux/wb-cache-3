5|$|<b>Red</b> <b>Cap</b> Garage, {{sometimes}} abridged as <b>Red</b> <b>Cap,</b> was a gay bar and nightclub that {{operated in}} Portland, Oregon from 1987 to 2012. The bar {{was connected to}} two others called Boxxes and the Brig. It hosted drag queen shows, live music, special events, and viewing parties. In 2012, the bar was sold and closed after operating for 25 years, and the building which housed <b>Red</b> <b>Cap</b> was gutted {{to make way for}} the retail alley known as Union Way.|$|E

5|$|The species Pluteus horakianus {{shares with}} P.nevadensis a fragile fruit body, a <b>red</b> <b>cap,</b> and similar cystidial morphology. It differs in its orange-red gill edges, red stem, and cap cuticle cells that contain pigment. Other species with a roughly similar appearance, {{including}} P.aurantiopustulatus, P.aurantipes, P.flammipes, P.laetifrons, and P.laetus, {{can be distinguished}} by differences in microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|The predominate {{color of}} the prisoner's costumes was red, the {{traditional}} {{color of the}} uniforms worn by the crews on the galleys in the 16th and 17th centuries. The costumes of the prisoners consisted of a white shirt, yellow trousers, red vest and smock and a cap which had different colors depending on the sentence duration. In early years those sentenced to life imprisonment wore green caps, all the others <b>red</b> <b>caps.</b> During the French Revolution, because the revolutionaries wore the <b>red</b> Phrygian <b>cap,</b> the symbol of freedom, the French Convention forbade prisoners to wear <b>red</b> <b>caps,</b> and they went bare-headed. Under Napoleon, the <b>red</b> <b>caps</b> The <b>red</b> <b>caps</b> were reinstated for all prisoners. The trousers were buttoned the whole length of the leg, {{so they could be}} removed without taking off the iron ring and chain on their ankle. The prisoners were shaven and were given a peculiar haircut, with one sideburns on one side shaven and on the other allowed to grow, so they could be identified more easily if they escaped.|$|R

5|$|Variety queletiformis can be {{distinguished}} from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh. Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson <b>red</b> <b>cap,</b> while var. lupiniformis has a pale yellow or dirty ochre cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a <b>red</b> <b>cap</b> with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to <b>red</b> <b>cap</b> which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E

5|$|The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive <b>red</b> <b>cap</b> and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish flush in its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its <b>red</b> <b>cap.</b> The edible R.rugulosa—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with naphthol. The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiation}} {{into these}} Nnukwu-Ozo titles was and still is, very expensive. Historically, the initiation ceremony into {{the secrets of}} the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi scarification, by which these men were identified in public. The Ichi scarification as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons. The last bearer of Ichi marks, Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century. Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the <b>red</b> <b>cap</b> (with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo), the horse tail fly whisk, the round cow hide fan and the elephant tusk.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known blazon {{from this}} period states that the arms of Finland represents A crowned lion of gold holding a sword in the right forepaw and trampling with both hindpaws on a Russian sabre (ryssesabel), surrounded by nine silver roses in a red field, over the shield a golden crown with a <b>red</b> <b>cap.</b> As both King Gustavus I and his son, John III, were involved in lengthy wars with Russia, {{it should come as}} no surprise that this was a central element in the arms of both the Grand Duchy of Finland, and in that of the coat of arms of the Finnish province of Karelia (Figure 6), which symbolizes the struggle between East and West.|$|E
25|$|Rajesh, who is {{normally}} called Raj or just by his surname Koothrappali, is from New Delhi, India. He despises Indian food, and {{his lack of}} knowledge about Indian culture and Hinduism are often rebuked by Sheldon. He was born into a wealthy family and has five siblings, one of whom is Priya, a former on-off girlfriend of Leonard. Raj {{is normally}} seen wearing a layered combination of a shirt and sweater vest, khakis or cargo pants with skate shoes and a fleece or nylon track top-style windbreaker. Raj wore a <b>red</b> <b>cap</b> in the pilot episode, but has not worn any headgear on a regular basis {{for the rest of the}} series' run.|$|E
25|$|Numerous Danish folktales {{contain a}} range of mythical figures such as trolls, elves, goblins and wights as well as figures from Nordic mythology like giants and lygtemænd (hobby lanterns). The nisse is a {{particularly}} well known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian times when it was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed <b>red</b> <b>cap,</b> he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The nisse would be helpful if treated well, for instance by offering him a bowl of porridge with a clump of butter at night, but, failing good treatment, he could become quite troublesome and mean.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} instar on, the spiderlings have a brownish-gray cephaIothorax and limbs, {{and a red}} abdomen with {{markings}} limited to the posterior portion. These consist {{of a pair of}} black stripes, each bearing two conspicuous white dots, separated by a light region. The light region may be gray, white, or even golden; immediately anterior to the black stripes it is enlarged into a conspicuous light dot. While the abdomen of very young spiderlings appears bronze, the red color of the abdomen is striking in later instars. In one of the later instars, the 5th or perhaps the 6th, a <b>red</b> <b>cap</b> appears in the eye region, but this marking disappears in the following molt. The light basal band and side bands of the adult are also present in immature spiders, and, in the two instars proceeding maturity, the chelicerae are also iridescent.|$|E
500|$|<b>Red</b> <b>Cap</b> Garage, {{established}} in 1987, occupied a building which once housed a taxicab company. The bar faced Stark Street and {{was connected to}} two others called Boxxes and the Brig, and the restaurant Fish Grotto. In 2008, Out Traveler Jason Rowan described the three establishments as: [...] "interconnected bars offer one-stop shopping: twink go-go boys in Boxxes, dirty smokers in <b>Red</b> <b>Cap,</b> and late-night clubbing at the Brig. Good-natured, sauced-up fun reigns in this trampy labyrinth, especially during Tuesday night drink specials." ...|$|E

A large number (31 - 41 % of total Ig-bearing cells) which gave <b>red</b> <b>caps</b> with anti-mu subsequently stained green peripherally with anti-Fab under the non-capping conditions. The remaining stained cells were divided between those showing only <b>red</b> <b>caps</b> (17 - 29 % of Ig-bearing cells) and those showing only green rings (37 - 45 % of Ig-bearing cells). These data are interpreted by assuming {{that most of}} the staining with the second reagent (fluorescein-coupled anti-mouse Ig) is due to the presence of surface associated IgD...|$|R
500|$|In {{an article}} {{confirming}} the bar's closure, Marjorie Skinner of The Portland Mercury wrote: [...] "While <b>Red</b> <b>Cap</b> was mainly a queer bar, I know I'm {{not the only}} ally who will miss it—the people there were always welcoming, the food was totally decent, and the drinks were (sometimes dangerously) cheap (where oh where will I escape to now when Clyde Common is too packed/expensive/stop 'n' chatty??)."
