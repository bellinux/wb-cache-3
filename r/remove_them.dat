5|$|Hamilton {{formulated}} the Jay Treaty {{to normalize}} {{trade relations with}} Great Britain, <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> from western forts, and resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution; John Jay negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794. Jeffersonians supported France and strongly attacked the treaty. Washington listened to both sides, then announced his strong support, which mobilized public opinion and was pivotal in securing ratification in the Senate on June 24, 1795 by the requisite two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|He {{had managed}} to retain some of his {{previous}} advisers, despite attempts by the Ordainers to <b>remove</b> <b>them,</b> and divided the extensive de Clare inheritance among two of his new favourites, the former household knights Hugh Audley and Roger Damory, instantly making them extremely rich. Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.|$|E

5|$|In 1884 the French {{microbiologist}} Charles Chamberland {{invented a}} filter, {{known today as}} the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study {{what became known as}} the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.|$|E
5|$|In December 1523, {{the council}} set a {{deadline}} of Pentecost in 1524 {{for a solution}} to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to <b>remove</b> <b>them,</b> as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E

5|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} these provisions is that unlawful non-citizens {{should be kept}} in detention for as long as necessary to <b>remove</b> <b>them,</b> and that if removing them never became practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed unlawful non-citizens to be detained while removal was a practical possibility, and that if removal was not a practical possibility, then they should be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi party's {{goal was}} to remove Jews from German {{cultural}} and economic life, and eventually to <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> from the country altogether. In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions. Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin {{in the early years}} of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to <b>remove</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise {{settlement of}} back taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked {{the attorney general to}} investigate, the case was not decided during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> outright. This action was made more damning because one of the attorneys was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E
5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that the bypass would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over the bypass and the highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} the bypass opened, without connections to the under-construction bypass, in April and May 2009, respectively. The roundabout at the northern end of the bypass opened when the bypass opened to traffic on August 6, 2009. To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat, MDSHA installed tunnels under the bypass for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near the bypass rather than <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> with mechanical mowers. Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when the bypass opened.|$|E

5|$|In Mendeleev's 1871 {{periodic}} table, copper, silver, {{and gold}} are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the iron triad and platinum group metals), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised {{to note that}} it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due {{to the existence of}} copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time. However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opener}} at Virginia, Sanchez threw for a career-best 338 yards, {{completing}} 26 of his 35 passes for three touchdowns and one interception. The Davey O'Brien Foundation named him the O'Brien Quarterback of the Week and his performance garnered early Heisman discussion. The Trojans suffered a stunning 27–21 loss against Oregon State on September 25. By season's end, the Trojans' lone loss {{was enough to}} <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> from contending for the BCS National Title and instead they were {{to play in the}} Rose Bowl against Penn State. The Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions 38–24. Sanchez won the 2009 Rose Bowl Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense; his 413 passing yards ranked second {{in the history of the}} Rose Bowl and fourth in Trojan history. With Sanchez starting all thirteen games, the Trojans ended the season 12–1 and ranked number two in the Coaches' Poll and number three in the AP Poll. Sanchez finished the season with 3,207 yards passing, 34 touchdowns, second most in Trojan history, behind Leinart, and 10 interceptions.|$|E
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to <b>remove</b> <b>them.</b> The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of the}} first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to <b>remove</b> <b>them</b> and filming continued.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to <b>remove</b> <b>them.</b> When this happened, US troops fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E
