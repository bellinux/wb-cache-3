40|$|Abstract. This work {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} study on backward-facing steps situated in a rarefied hypersonic flow. The work is motivated by the interest in investigating the step height on the flowfield structure. The primary aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the sensitivity of the velocity, density, pressure and temperature due to step-height variations of such backward-facing steps. Effects on the flowfield structure due to variations on the step height have been investigated by employing the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The analysis showed that the flow past a backward-facing step in hypersonic flow is characterized by a strong expansion around de corner of the step, which influences the downstream separation region. It was found that the recirculation region behind of the steps is a function of the <b>rear-face</b> height. The analysis also showed that changing the height of the step did not affect the flow upstream of it. However, disturbances downstream the step depend on changes in the <b>rear-face</b> height of the steps...|$|R

5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel <b>rear-facing</b> camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments.

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of {{the loading}} on a structure {{resulting from the}} impingement of a blast wave following a high explosive detonation is crucial if analysts are {{to be able to}} determine the viability of protective structures. This is of particular importance in the case of near-field explosive detonations, where the magnitude of the loading is extremely high, and highly spatially non-uniform over the face of the target. This loading can result in localised failure of structural targets due to brisance or <b>rear-face</b> spalling (predominantly load magnitude related phenomena) or shear failure due to spatially non-uniform impulse take-up of the target (predominantly impulse related phenomenon). However, no clear and simple guidance exists on how to define the magnitude and spatial variation of very near-field blast loading. Whilst it is possible to use numerical modelling approaches to simulate the detonation, air-shock propagation and shock-structure interaction, little definitive, well controlled experimental data exists to validate such models. This paper presents an experimental methodology that has been developed in part to enable such experimental data to be gathered. The experimental rig comprises an array of Hopkinson Pressure Bars, fitted through holes in a target, with the loaded faces of the bars flush with the target face. Thus, the bars are exposed to the normally or obliquely reflected shocks from the impingement of the blast wave with the target. Pressure-time recordings are presented along with associated Arbitary Langrangian Eulerian modelling using the LS-DYNA explicit numerical code. A new finite element based method is introduced which allows for correction of the effects of dispersion of the propagating waves in the pressure bars, enabling accurate characterisation of the peak pressures and impulses from these loadings...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses studies {{relating to}} the physical properties of thermoplastics. Separate investigations involving the melting temperature of a slow-to-crystallize polymer, thermal behavior of a miscible polymer blend, and thermal conductivity of oriented polyethylenes are presented. ^ Polycarbonate is known to thermally crystallize slowly and to a limited extent, {{with a range of}} reported melting points. In this study, the melting temperature of polycarbonate was modified from 195 (DEGREES) C to 300 (DEGREES) C by employing a sequence of vapor-induced crystallization and annealing treatments. The crystals formed by the treatment with organic vapor act as a precursor state for further crystallization into larger, more perfect lamellae. An equilibrium melting point of 335 (DEGREES) C has been obtained for PC from an extrapolation of reciprocal lamellar thickness. FTIR and SEC measurements confirm the Kolbe rearrangement reaction occurs only to a limited extent for the annealing procedure employed. ^ The miscibility of bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC) / poly-(epsilon) -caprolactone (PCL) was investigated using DSC. A single glass transition was found across the compositional diagram, in accordance with an earlier study, yet no depression was observed in the melting points of either PC or PCL. For the PCL-rich blends, Hoffman-Weeks extrapolations are linear, and identical to the PCL homopolymer, thus the Flory ((chi)) interaction parameter must be zero or slightly positive for this blend. The PC Hoffman-Weeks extrapolation could not be made, since the blends are reactive at high crystallization temperatures. This reaction was demonstrated by FTIR, NMR, and turbimetric titration to be thermo-oxidative chain branching rather than transesterification between these two polyesters. ^ Thermal conductivity measurements are not a routine experimental technique in the field of polymer science. In this dissertation, experimental methods for cylindrical and film sample geometries are explored. The flash technique for thermal diffusivity has been critically examined with regard to <b>rear-face</b> rise and front-to-rear temperature difference modes of analysis on a systematic series of drawn low-density polyethylenes. Correction procedures have been put forth for losses due to radiation and surrounding air. The increase in thermal conductivity was shown to be proportional to draw ratio. Work on a steady-state fin and a pulsed method for thin film measurements is also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is widely}} used in design of {{protective}} structures due to its good energy-absorbing characteristics under high pressures and, when properly reinforced, ductile behaviour. Nevertheless, the response of concrete structures subjected to severe dynamic loading differs from their static behaviour, on a structural level but also on a material level. The addition of steel fibres in the concrete may improve the energy-absorbing characteristics of plain concrete, which {{is especially true for}} the tensile behaviour. The fracture energy for steel-fibre reinforced concrete may be many times higher already for low dosages of fibres compared to plain concrete. In design of protective structures it is important to identify the possible threats and their risk of occurrence to be able to characterise the design loads. Often this involves the effects of cased charges, i. e. combined blast and fragment loading. While the structural behaviour for blast load and single fragment impacts is relatively well understood, the response under combined loading, including the blast and multiple impacts of fragments, is not yet clear. The theoretical bases for concrete material behaviour, weapon load characteristics, and their effect on the structural response are treated in this licentiate thesis. In addition, three numerical studies are presented, whose aim is to increase the understanding of impact and impulsive loading and the subsequent response of a concrete element. The first numerical study was a comparative investigation of the relative effect on the impact resistance when adding steel fibres to concrete. It was concluded that the depth of penetration of the striking projectile was only slightly influenced by the addition of fibres, while the sizes of the front- and <b>rear-face</b> craters were decreased. The second numerical study involved combined blast and fragment loading of a reinforced concrete wall strip, and it was seen that the total damage of the wall strip subjected to the combined loads was highly related to the damage caused by the fragment impact alone. Furthermore, the mid-point deflection in combined loading was larger than the sum of mid-point deflections in blast and fragment loading, indicating synergetic effects of the two loads. In the third numerical study the effect of reinforcement on the projectile impact resistance was studied. It was concluded that the presence of reinforcement may improve the impact resistance of the concrete if a suitable reinforcement detailing is used...|$|R
