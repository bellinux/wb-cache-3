40|$|Advances in our {{understanding}} of the neural plasticity that occurs after hemiparetic stroke have contributed to the formulation of theories of poststroke motor recovery. These theories, in turn, have underpinned contemporary motor <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> for treating motor deficits after stroke, such as upper limb hemiparesis. However, a relative drawback has been that, in general, these strategies are most compatible with the recovery profiles of relatively high-functioning stroke survivors and therefore do not easily translate into benefit to those individuals sustaining low-functioning upper limb hemiparesis, who otherwise have poorer residual function. For these individuals, alternative motor <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> are currently needed. In this paper, we will review upper limb immobilisation studies that have been conducted with healthy adult humans and animals. Then, we will discuss how the findings from these studies could inspire the creation of a neural plasticity model that is likely to be of particular relevance to the context of motor rehabilitation after stroke. For instance, as will be elaborated, such model could {{contribute to the development of}} alternative motor <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> for treating poststroke upper limb hemiparesis. The implications of the findings from those immobilisation studies for contemporary motor <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> will also be discussed and perspectives for future research in this arena will be provided as well...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} paper is to summarize current pavement management activities in Kentucky. Early pavement management activities generally were decentralized (involving a number of transportation functions such as planning, design, construction, maintenance, and research) and involved long-term monitoring for skid resistance and ride quality (roughness). Current pavement management activities may be categorized by evaluation, project selection, and development of recommendations for pavement <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies.</b> Pavement evaluation activities at the statewide system level typically involve assessments of ride quality (ridesbility index) and estimated pavement serviceability, skid resistance, visual condition ratings, and the accumulation of traffic volumes and pavement fatigue. Funding allocations to highway districts involves the application of limiting criteria to system level data obtained during the evaluation phase. Factors considered include rideability index (estimated from roughness measurements), skid resistance, visual condition ratings, accumulation of traffic volumes and fatigue, and engineering judgment. Recommendations for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> also may be based on structural evaluations using deflection measurements. Typical <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> are discussed. Procedures and criteria for the allocation and distribution of funding to the highway districts are presented...|$|R

5000|$|Re-offending {{by former}} prisoners is {{estimated}} to cost society £15bn per year. Justice Secretary Elizabeth Truss said, [...] "Governors and staff cannot lead and manage change {{in an environment where}} they fear violence. Likewise, offenders cannot be expected to turn their life around while they are dependent on drugs or in fear of being assaulted." [...] Drugs, notably legal highs smuggled into prisons destabilize the prisons, add to violence and are a serious problem. 39 prison deaths from 2013 to 2015 were related to legal highs. The number of prison staff is set to increase but will remain below 2010 levels. There are doubts if new staff can be recruited since there are better starting salaries in less stressful and less dangerous environments. There are concerns that not enough is being done to rehabilitate offenders and that there is no consistent policy on rehabilitation. There is a call for a national <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy,</b> also a call for a rehabilitation requirement for prison and probation service together with a requirement to track progress of individuals and institutions and a return to frontline staffing levels of 2010.

5000|$|In 2010, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of an Italian architect Andrea Bruno, Georgia commenced reconstruction works aimed at returning Bagrati Cathedral to its original state as a religious space. In July 2010 UNESCO added Bagratli cathedral to its list of endangered world heritage sites {{in part because of the}} continuing reconstruction, which it feared would affect the structural integrity and authenticity of the site. Even before the reconstruction works, in 2008 ICOMOS was concerned about the deteriorating state of Bagrati, but it commended that any conservation efforts by the Government should not include a type of reconstruction which would affect the site's historical value. In 2011 UNESCO urged the Georgian government authorities to develop a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy</b> that would reverse some of the changes made to the site in recent years, but it acknowledged that these alterations may be [...] "almost irreversible". In 2013, architect Andrea Bruno was awarded a Georgian state gold medal for his role in the Bagrati Cathedral reconstruction and was subsequently recognized for this project with the University of Ferrara Domus International Prize for Restoration and Conservation. UNESCO removed Bagrati Cathedral from its World Heritage sites in 2017, considering its major reconstruction detrimental to its integrity and authenticity.|$|E

40|$|An optimal Empirical-Markovian {{approach}} is presented {{for the assessment}} of potential rehabilitation strategies as applied to flexible pavement at the project level. A simplified empirical model is proposed to predict the heterogeneous transition probabilities associated with rehabilitated pavement based on the corresponding values associated with original pavement, future traffic loading, and modified structural capacity. Therefore, the performance of rehabilitated pavement can directly be controlled by the modified structural capacity. The modified structural capacity associated with a particular <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy</b> is defined using the modified layer coefficients with the corresponding modified structural numbers are used in the empirical model to predict the relevant heterogeneous transition probabilities. These probabilities are then used to estimate the annual distress ratings associated with each potential <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy</b> for a specified analysis period. The optimal assessment of potential rehabilitation strategies is carried out using the cost-effectiveness ratio defined as the ratio of the life-cycle average distress rating to the life-cycle cost. The life-cycle cost can include cost items such as initial construction cost, routine maintenance cost, and major rehabilitation cost. The optimal <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy</b> is the one associated with the highest cost-effectiveness ratio. The presented case study has indicated the effectiveness of the proposed optimal approach in developing and yielding dependable optimal rehabilitation strategies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process for}} retrofitting a building for seismic criteria. It explains {{the need for a}} new, performance-based design code to provide a range of acceptable building behavior. It then outlines the procedure for retrofitting a building. This procedure begins with acquiring information about the existing building and its surroundings. The building owner or client then needs to work with the design professional to establish an acceptable performance level, or rehabilitation objective. A rehabilitation method must then be selected that determines how the building should be analyzed. The analysis of the building, including suggested <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies,</b> must then be performed. Once the analysis indicates that the building will perform to its prescribed performance level, the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategies</b> must then be implemented.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Following an {{analysis}} of humanitarian-assistance principles and of {{the roots of the}} Mindanao conflict, this paper contrasts the relief and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy</b> of the government with civil-society efforts in building the “Space for Peace ” in Nalapaan, Pikit, North Cotabato. It identifies how the conflict’s dynamics and actors shape the character of relief and rehabilitation assistance, and how the dynamics of relief and rehabilitation assistance feed the conflict or help address its roots. It also presents the potentials and limitations of relief and rehabilitation initiatives of government and civil society (in Nalapaan) in providing meaningful humanitarian assistance that addresses the conflict’s roots and preventing the conflict from getting worse. The paper concludes by building a framework for carrying out a more meaningful relief and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>strategy</b> {{in the context of the}} ongoing conflict in Mindanao, which puts an emphasis on strategizing beyond disaster management, incorporating the value of local capacities and fostering meaningful partnerships among stakeholders, and addressing the roots of the conflict and promoting a “culture of peace. ...|$|E
