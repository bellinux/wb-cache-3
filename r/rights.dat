Other delegatesincluding future Bill of <b>Rights</b> drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual <b>rights</b> risked the implication that other, unnamed <b>rights</b> were unprotected.

5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's <b>rights</b> movement when she, together with Susan B.

5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based <b>rights</b> approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest <b>rights.</b> After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based <b>rights</b> approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of <b>rights,</b> and that <b>rights</b> approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal <b>rights,</b> a theory of justice according to which animals have <b>rights</b> based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding prima facie <b>rights,</b> and some prima facie <b>rights</b> becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, <b>rights.</b> In this picture, the violation of concrete <b>rights,</b> but not necessarily prima facie <b>rights,</b> represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground prima facie <b>rights</b> against the infliction of suffering and death. These prima facie <b>rights</b> convert to concrete <b>rights</b> in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process <b>rights</b> as implicit constitutional <b>rights,</b> {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of <b>rights.</b>|$|E
