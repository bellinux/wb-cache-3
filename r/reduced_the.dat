5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking.

40|$|In this paper, a seven level {{modified}} cascaded multilevel inverter {{is proposed}} for industrial drive applications.

40|$|Field-weakening in {{interior}} PM machines {{is performed}} by using negative rf-axis current {{to oppose the}} magnet flux and hence <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> total fundamental rf-axis flux at high speeds. Due to the rotor saliency, the rf-axis current produces large amplitude harmonic airgap flux density components which can cause large harmonic stator iron losses. <b>Reducing</b> <b>the</b> magnet flux density <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> required rf-axis stator mmf to oppose it and hence <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> field-weakening iron losses. However <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> magnet flux density also <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> magnet torque and hence increases the stator current requirement, particularly at lower speeds.
