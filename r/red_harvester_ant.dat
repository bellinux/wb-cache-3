5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant,</b> than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the <b>Red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{their numbers}} have been declining, and this has often been {{attributed}} to competition for food with the invasive red imported fire ant and the Argentine ant.

25|$|The main {{food source}} for <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> usually {{consists}} of seeds, which they hoard in great numbers. The food is first {{ground to a}} bread-like consistency using the ants' large mandibles, and is then stored in a granary, assuring the colony access to food year-round. Seed collection {{on behalf of the}} <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> benefits their ecosystem through the process of myrmecochory, in which ants aid in the dispersal of seeds while foraging for food. Both plants and ants benefit from this relationship: the plants increase their dispersal range and density, while the ants benefit from acquiring nutrients and ensuring a more secure food supply in future harvests. This is typically understood as a mutualistic interaction. Dead insects are also collected during foraging.|$|R

25|$|Mating is {{perennial}} and species-specific between subspecies of the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant.</b> Males distinguish reproductive {{females of}} their species from females {{of other species}} using pheromones.

These pheromones are perfectly detected by males of the species upon physical contact, resulting in the stimulation of sexual behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability for}} a colony to quickly {{regulate}} its foraging behavior is quite important since their food source is variable and scattered. This regulatory ability is variable in itself, influenced by food availability, current need to eat, and colony health. Colonies {{are more likely}} to adapt to varying forager return rates when the rate of foraging is high, which may be because variances are simply harder to detect during low rates. Overall, the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> demonstrates a remarkable ability in social cognition, cost-benefit analysis, and behavioral economics.|$|E
25|$|Pogonomyrmex {{barbatus}} is {{a species}} of harvester ant from the genus Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include red ant and <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant.</b> These large (5â€“ to 7-mm) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the Southwestern United States. Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 m deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} <b>ants,</b> such as <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> {{as well as}} certain bee species, like Tetragonisca angustula and Trigona spinipes exhibit lek-like mating patterns. Males form {{reproductive}} aggregations, congregating and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females.|$|R
50|$|Interference {{competition}} occurs directly {{between individuals}} via aggression etc. when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in {{a portion of}} the habitat.

25|$|Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and {{the value}} of {{adaptability}} and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects. Beyond the rationale, there is well-documented empirical evidence of communication related to tasks; examples include the waggle dance of honey bee foragers, trail marking by ant foragers such as the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> and the propagation via pheromones of an alarm state in Africanized honey bees.|$|R
25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on the foraging behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant.</b> Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. On a given day, nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds. If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony may be forced to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years.|$|E
500|$|The <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> Pogonomyrmex californicus {{has been}} widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for {{hundreds}} of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination. [...] During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe. [...] Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> nests are {{characterized}} {{by a lack of}} plant growth and small pebbles surrounding the entrance to the tunnel, which usually descends at a pronounced angle. [...] of seeds may be found scattered around the nest. In grassland areas, such as ranches, the lack of plant life makes <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> colonies very easy to spot, and where they are very plentiful, they may make serious inroads into the grazing available to livestock.|$|E
50|$|Desert horned lizards prey {{primarily}} on invertebrates, such as <b>ants</b> (including <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,)</b> crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, worms, flies,lady bugs, meal worms and some plant material. They {{can often be}} found in the vicinity of ant hills, where they sit and wait for ants to pass by. When they find an area of soft sand, they usually shake themselves vigorously, throwing sand over their backs and leaving only their head exposed. This allows them to hide from predators and await their unsuspecting prey.|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{areas of}} {{patterned}} vegetation, with distinctive and repetitive patterns, can arise because of natural phenomena that differentially influence plant growth or mortality and by biotic interactions {{of animals and}} plants. Such patterns can be easily observed in satellite images, {{if they have a}} high enough resolution for the specific observation. Here we will show that a large area of a patterned vegetation with a " polka-dot " arrangement can be observed in the Toroweap Valley of Arizona, near the Grand Canyon. In this case, the vegetation has been patterned by the presence of the nests of <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants.</b> The observation is remarkable for the large surface occupied by such colonies...|$|R
40|$|Social insects use odors as cues for {{a variety}} of {{behavioral}} responses, including nestmate recognition. Past research on nestmate recognition indicates cuticular hydrocarbons are important nestmate discriminators for social insects, but other factors are likely to contribute to colony-specific odors. Here we experimentally tested whether external microbes contribute to nestmate recognition in <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> (Pogonomyrmex barbatus). We changed the external microbiome of ants through topical application of either antibiotics or microbial cultures. We then observed behavior of nestmates when treated ants were returned to the nest. Ants whose external microbiome was augmented with microbial cultures {{were much more likely to}} be rejected than controls, but ants treated with antibiotics were not. This result is consistent with the possibility that external microbes are used for nestmate recognition...|$|R

50|$|Communication is {{varied at}} all scales of life, from {{interactions}} between microscopic organisms {{to those of}} large groups of people. Nevertheless, the signals used in communication abide by a fundamental property: they must be a quality of the receiver that can transfer information to a receiver {{that is capable of}} interpreting the signal and modifying its behavior accordingly. Signals are distinct from cues in that evolution has selected for signalling between both parties, whereas cues are merely informative to the observer and may not have originally been used for the intended purpose. The natural world is replete with examples of signals, from the luminescent flashes of light from fireflies, to chemical signaling in <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> to prominent mating displays of birds such as the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, which gather in leks, the pheromones released by the corn earworm moth, the dancing patterns of the blue-footed booby, or the alarm sound Synoeca cyanea make by rubbing their mandibles against their nest.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} applying decentralised task allocation and task switching mechanisms in heterogeneous groups of robots {{in order to increase}} their ability to respond to task demand effectively. Our work is strongly inspired by the behaviour of eusocial insects (typically ants) and their behaviour of switching tasks {{in order to meet the}} changing demand. The objective of this paper is threefold: 1) identification of task allocation and task switching mechanisms in robots inspired by <b>ants</b> like <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> Pogonomyrmex barbatas, 2) developing a simple model of these mechanisms for use with a heterogeneous group of simulated robots and 3) implementing a decentralised and adaptive mechanism of updating thresholds for heterogeneous groups of simulated robots. The paper extends the use of threshold based mechanisms in homogeneous robots into the realms of heterogeneous groups of robots. Experimental results show that the incorporation of task switching mechanisms in specialised groups of robots improves the foraging efficiency and swarm energy significantly...|$|R
5000|$|For example, in {{foraging}} behaviour, <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) {{communicate to}} other ants where food is, how much food there is, {{and whether or}} not they should switch tasks to forage based on cuticular hydrocarbon scents and the rate of ant-interaction. By using the combined odors of forager cuticular hydrocarbons and of seeds and interaction rate using brief antennal contact, the colony captures precise information about the current availability of food and thus whether or not they should switch to foraging behaviour [...] "all without being directed by a central controller or even another ant". The rate at which foragers return with seeds sets the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest on foraging trips; faster rates of return indicate more food availability and fewer interactions indicate a greater need for foragers. A combination of these two factors, which are solely based on local information from the environment, leads to decisions about switching to the foraging task and ultimately, to achieving the global goal of feeding the colony.|$|R

50|$|In the Chihuahuan Desert, Novomessor cockerelli competes for {{resources}} with another seed-eating ant species, the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> (Pogonomyrmex barbatus). It {{has been found}} that workers of N. cockerelli will emerge from the nest {{early in the morning and}} plug the entrance holes of nearby P. barbatus colonies with grit and small stones thus delaying the emergence of the other workers. Nests close to the A. cockerelli home nest are plugged more often than ones far away, and older, larger nests have their entrances plugged more often than younger, smaller ones.|$|E

40|$|Social insect colonies use {{interactions}} among workers to regulate collective behavior. Har-vester ant foragers interact in a chamber {{just inside the}} nest entrance, here called the 'entrance chamber'. Previous studies of the activation of foragers in <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> show that an outgoing forager inside the nest experiences an increase in brief antennal con-tacts before it leaves the nest to forage. Here we compare the interaction rate experienced by foragers that left the nest and ants that did not. We found that ants in the entrance cham-ber that leave the nest to forage experienced more interactions than ants that descend to the deeper nest without foraging. Additionally, {{we found that the}} availability of foragers in the entrance chamber is associated with the rate of forager return. An increase in the rate of forager return leads to an increase in the rate at which ants descend to the deeper nest, which then stimulates more ants to ascend into the entrance chamber. Thus a higher rate of forager return leads to more available foragers in the entrance chamber. The highest den-sity of interactions occurs near the nest entrance and the entrances of the tunnels from the entrance chamber to the deeper nest. Local interactions with returning foragers regulate both the activation of waiting foragers and the number of foragers available to be activated...|$|R
5000|$|Group {{foraging}} is when animals find, {{capture and}} consume prey {{in the presence}} of other individuals. In other words, it is foraging when success depends not only on your own foraging behaviors but the behaviors of others as well. An important note here is that group foraging can emerge in two types of situations. The first situation is frequently thought of and occurs when foraging in a group is beneficial and brings greater rewards known as an aggregation economy. [...] The second situation occurs when a group of animals forage together {{but it may not be}} in an animal's best interest to do so known as a dispersion economy. Think of a cardinal at a bird feeder for the dispersion economy. We might see a group of birds foraging at that bird feeder but it is not in the best interest of the cardinal for any of the other birds to be there too. The amount of food the cardinal can get from that bird feeder depends on how much it can take from the bird feeder but also depends on how much the other birds take as well. [...] In <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> the foraging process is divided between three different types of workers: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. These workers can utilize many different methods of communicating while foraging in a group, such as guiding flights, scent paths, and [...] "jostling runs", as seen in the eusocial bee Melipona scutellaris.|$|R
50|$|Social living {{provides}} {{a multitude of}} advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is eusociality, characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of {{the overwhelming majority of}} colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), Isoptera (termites), Thysanoptera (thrips), and Hemiptera (aphids).Social insects have been extraordinarily successful ecologically and evolutionarily. This success has at its most pronounced produced colonies 1) having a persistence many times the lifespan of most individuals of the colony, and 2) numbering thousands or even millions of individuals.Social insects can exhibit division of labor with respect to non-reproductive tasks, in addition to the aforementioned reproductive one. In some cases this takes the form of markedly different, alternative morphological development (polymorphism), {{as in the case of}} soldier castes in ants, termites, thrips, and aphids, while in other cases it is age-based (temporal polyethism), as with honey bee foragers, who are the oldest members of the colony (with the exception of the queen). Evolutionary biologists are still debating the fitness-advantage gained by social insects due to their advanced division of labor and task allocation, but hypotheses include: increased resilience against a fluctuating environment, reduced energy costs of continuously switching tasks, increased longevity of the colony as a whole, or reduced rate of pathogen transmission.Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and the value of adaptability and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects. Beyond the rationale, there is well-documented empirical evidence of communication related to tasks; examples include the waggle dance of honey bee foragers, trail marking by ant foragers such as the <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> and the propagation via pheromones of an alarm state in Africanized honey bees.|$|R

50|$|In short, {{the use of}} a {{combination}} of simple cues makes it possible for <b>red</b> <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> colonies to make an accurate and rapid adjustment of foraging activity that corresponds to the current availability of food while using positive feedback for regulation of the process: the faster outgoing foragers meet ants returning with seeds, the more ants go out to forage. Ants then continue to use these local cues in finding food, as they use their olfactory senses to pick up pheromone trails laid by other ants and follow the trail in a descending gradient to the food source. Instead of being directed by other ants or being told as to where the food is, ants rely on their closely coupled action and perception systems to collectively complete the global task.|$|E
