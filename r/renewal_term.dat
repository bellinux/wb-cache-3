50|$|However, sharp {{increases}} in property rents {{in the early}} 1970s gave rise to strong opposition from leaseholders to the payment of the full market rental value of the land, {{as required by the}} lease conditions, for the <b>renewal</b> <b>term.</b> In view of this situation, Government introduced a number of alternative methods of renewal. Finally, on 14 December 1973, the Crown Leases Ordinance, now re-titled the Government Leases Ordinance (cap. 40 of the Laws of Hong Kong), came into operation. The Ordinance provided that for the <b>renewal</b> <b>term,</b> a leaseholder should pay an annual rent equivalent to 3% of the rateable value of the land at the date of renewal of the lease. The Cap. 40 rent so assessed would remain unchanged throughout the <b>renewal</b> <b>term</b> unless and until the land was redeveloped, in which case it would be re-assessed at 3% of the rateable value of the interim valuation of the new building erected on the land.|$|E

5000|$|The Copyright Act of 1976 is a United States {{copyright}} law and remains the primary basis of {{copyright law}} in the United States, as amended by several later enacted copyright provisions.

50|$|Predictable, reliable, stable funding. The Mod. Rehab. {{program was}} {{repealed}} {{due to a}} scandal {{having to do with}} how HUD awarded the assistance contracts. The effects of the scandal linger in the form of relatively unfavorable <b>renewal</b> <b>terms,</b> which are embedded in MAHRAA. Specifically, renewal rents must be at the lesser of current rents, as adjusted; Fair Market Rent; or market rent. This means that properties with below-market rents can renew only at similar rent levels, as adjusted by what is typically a modest amount. Since HUD does not offer multiyear contracts, the rents are re-set each year at contract renewal.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, telecom leases are for {{an initial}} five-year term {{followed}} by additional five-year <b>renewal</b> <b>terms.</b> Leases typically {{also have a}} 30- to 90-day cancellation period when the cellular provider {{has the right to}} terminate the lease within 30 to 90 days of giving notice to the landowner. This specific portion of a telecom lease is due to recent mergers in the industry, which render some towers useless. [...] Due to cellular providers merging with other cellular companies, one company can double its number of towers. This often causes redundancy, as previously mentioned, which often leads to the termination of leases and removal of redundant towers.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{determining}} whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because copyright terms have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting {{over the course of}} the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible <b>renewal</b> <b>term,</b> to a term extending to fifty, then seventy, years after the death of the author. The claim that [...] "pre-1923 works are in the public domain" [...] is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.|$|E
50|$|In 1831, {{the term}} of {{copyright}} increased from a maximum of 28 years {{to a maximum of}} 42; in 1909 the <b>renewal</b> <b>term</b> was extended from 14 years to 28. Beginning in 1962, {{the term of}} existing copyright was extended eleven times in the last 40 years. After 1976, any works created were subject to only one term of copyright, the maximum term, which was the life of the author plus fifty years, or seventy five years for corporations. According to Lessig, the public domain becomes orphaned by these changes to copyright law. In the past thirty years the average term has tripled and has gone from about 33 years to 95.|$|E

If the syntactic variations of multi-word terms have been described and tools designed to process them, only a few works studied the syntagmatic variants of compound terms. This paper is dedicated to the identification of such variants, and more precisely to the detection of synonymic pairs that consist of “compound term - multi-word term”. We describe a pipeline for their detection, from compound recognition and splitting to alignment of the variants with original terms, through multi-word term extraction. The experiments are carried out for two compound-producing languages, German and Russian, and two specialised domains: wind energy and breast cancer. We identify variation patterns for these two languages and demonstrate that the transformation of a morphological compound into a syntagmatic compound mainly occurs when the term denomination needs to be enlarged...|$|R

40|$|From its {{earliest}} manifestations, copyright law {{has struggled to}} deal with the equitable and efficient division of value and control between creators and the enterprises that distribute their works. And for almost as long as copyright has existed, there has been concern about creators getting the short end of the stick in their dealings with distributors. Since 1909, Congress has sought to protect authors and their families by allowing them to grant their copyrights for exploitation and then, decades later, to recapture those same rights. After judicial interpretation of the 1909 Act frustrated this intent by upholding advance assignments of <b>renewal</b> <b>terms,</b> Congress spoke unambiguously in 1976 : “Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.... ” Yet recent decisions in the Ninth and Second Circuits have eviscerated that clear Congressional command by permitting a grantee to renegotiate the terms of the grant so as to frustrate recapture by the author’s family. After critically analyzing these decisions, this article provides a comprehensive framework for restoring the integrity and clarity of the termination of transfer provisions...|$|R

(a) The GEIS included a determination of whether {{the analysis of the}} environmental issue could be applied to all plants and whether additional mitigation measures would be warranted. Issues were then assigned a Category 1 or a Category 2 designation. As set forth in the GEIS, Category 1 issues are those that meet all of the following criteria: (1) The environmental impacts associated with the issue have been determined to apply either to all plants or, for some issues, to plants having a specific type of cooling system or other specified plant or site characteristics. (2) A single significance level (i. e., SMALL, MODERATE, or LARGE) has been assigned to the impacts (except for collective offsite radiological impacts from the fuel cycle and from highlevel waste and spent fuel disposal). (3) Mitigation of adverse impacts associated with the issue has been considered in the analysis, and it has been determined that additional plant-specific mitigation measures {{are not likely to be}} sufficiently beneficial to warrant implementation. For issues that meet the three Category 1 criteria, no additional plant-specific analysis is required unless new and significant information is identified.
