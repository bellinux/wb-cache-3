The diagnosis of EE {{is dependent on the}} pathological detection of eosinophilic infiltration in esophageal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated a patient who applied to our clinic with complaints of long-term difficulty in swallowing, sensation of food sticking while eating and weight loss; the patient was diag-nosed with EE, following biochemical, radiological, endoscopic and pathological assessments and was treated with steroids. The results show that EE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with dysphagia and food impingement in the retrosternal area, and the diagnosis should be confirmed through multiple esophageal biopsies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to explore}} the {{hydrodynamic}} mechanisms involved in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure. Design: an experimental model of calf venous pump was constructed with collapsible tubes and valves. Material: the model consisted of a conduit and a pump with an intervening competent valve. Another valve that could allow <b>reflux</b> into the <b>pump</b> was mounted above the pump. Methods: conduit pressure and recovery times were monitored under conditions of different degrees of ejection fraction and <b>reflux</b> into the <b>pump.</b> Model variables included using poorly compliant tubes for the pump, the conduit and for both the pump and conduit. Results: the latex tube exhibited a non-linear volume–pressure relationship and a bi-modal regimen of compliance. This bestowed pressure-buffering properties. Ambulatory venous hypertension resulted when reflux beyond buffering capacity occurred. Substituting less compliant PTFE for latex at the pump had a relatively minor effect on post-ejection pressure and recovery times. Using PTFE at the conduit had a profound but divergent effect on both of these parameters. Conduit capacitance reduction had a similar effect. Conclusion: conduit elastance {{plays a significant role}} in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure in this experimental model.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{is not a}} {{risk factor}} for {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux and oesophagitis, and there are arguments suggesting that H. pylori may actually protect against gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease patients are less often infected with H. pylori than controls. If infected, they may have less severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and H. pylori infected duodenal ulcer patients without gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are potentially at risk of developing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease after eradication of the organism. In addition, H. pylori also affects the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. H. pylori eradication may decrease the acid-lowering capacity of proton pump inhibitors and H 2 receptor antagonists, and it could induce or aggravate gastro-oesophageal <b>reflux.</b> Proton <b>pump</b> inhibitor treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease may be associated with an accelerated development of atrophic gastritis in H. pylori positive patients, suggesting that H. pylori should be diagnosed and eradicated in these patients.

40|$|Background/Aims: Although {{considerable}} information exists regarding gastroesophageal reflux {{disease with}} erosions, much less {{is known of}} non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), the dominant form of reflux disease in the developed world. Methods: An expert international group using the modified Delphi technique examined the quality of evidence and established levels of agreement relating to different aspects of NERD. Discussion focused on clinical presentation, assessment of clinical outcome, pathobiological mechanisms, and clinical strategies for diagnosis and management. Results: Consensus was reached on 85 specific statements. NERD {{was defined as a}} condition with reflux symptoms in the absence of mucosal lesions or breaks detected by conventional endoscopy, and without prior effective acid-suppressive therapy. Evidence supporting this diagnosis included: responsiveness to acid suppression therapy, abnormal reflux monitoring or the identification of specific novel endoscopic and histological findings. Functional heartburn was considered a separate entity not related to acid <b>reflux.</b> Proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors are the definitive therapy for NERD, with efficacy best evaluated by validated quality-of-life instruments.

40|$|Christina Reimer, Peter BytzerDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, K&oslash;ge University Hospital, DenmarkAbstract: There {{is a lack}} of {{consistent}} guidelines and consensus for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). A therapeutic trial with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been suggested to identify patients with LPR. This review focuses on the current difficulties in diagnosing the disease and examines the evidence for the effectiveness of PPI therapy in suspected reflux-related laryngeal symptoms. Additionally, mode of action, safety, and tolerability of PPIs are described. A total of 7 placebo-controlled trials were identified and included in the review. All studies evaluated the effect of a PPI on symptoms and objective laryngoscopic findings in suspected LPR. Data from these trials show that PPI therapy is no more effective than placebo in producing symptom relief in patients suspected of LPR. Symptoms, laryngoscopic findings, or abnormal findings on pH monitoring will not predict response to PPI therapy. High placebo response levels suggest a much more complex and multifactorial pathophysiology of LPR than simple acid reflux. Further studies are needed to characterize subgroups of patients with reflux-associated laryngeal symptoms that might benefit from treatment with PPI. Future studies should use validated patient reported outcome measures with endpoints that represent a predefined clinically meaningful change in symptom scores.

40|$|Sabrina Cardile, Claudio RomanoDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Messina, ItalyAbstract: Gastroesophageal reflux is {{a common}} {{condition}} in the pediatric population, with an increasing incidence {{in the last few}} years. It can be defined as an effortless retrograde movement of gastric contents into the esophagus related to complex multifactorial pathogenesis, involving anatomical, hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors. In some cases, it may be associated with esophageal or extraesophageal symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation), and is defined as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The therapeutic approach to gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children is often conservative, including changes in lifestyle (eg, posture and thickening of meals). If these children remain symptomatic after lifestyle changes (nutrition, feeding, and positional modification), or present with clinical red flags (poor weight gain, recurrent respiratory symptoms, or hematemesis) and complications of GERD (esophagitis, bleeding, stricture, Barrett&# 39;s esophagus, or adenocarcinoma) {{it may be necessary to}} set up a proper diagnostic protocol. Proton pump inhibitors have been recommended as the most effective acid suppression therapy for adults and pediatric patients.

50|$|Varicose veins are veins {{that have}} become {{enlarged}} and twisted. The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg, although varicose veins can occur elsewhere. Veins have pairs of leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or venous <b>reflux).</b> Leg muscles <b>pump</b> the veins to return blood to the heart (the skeletal-muscle pump), against the effects of gravity. When veins become varicose, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem, varicose veins can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening (lipodermatosclerosis) and ulceration. Although life-threatening complications are uncommon, varicose veins may be confused with deep vein thrombosis, which may be life-threatening.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{evaluation}} {{of medical and}} sur-gical outcomes relies on methods of accurately quan-tifying treatment results. Currently, there is no vali-dated instrument whose purpose is to document the physical findings and severity of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Objective: To evaluate the validity and reliability of the reflux finding score (RFS). Methods: Forty patients with LPR confirmed by double-probe pH monitoring were evaluated pretreatment and 2, 4, and 6 months after treatment. The RFS was docu-mented for each patient at each visit. For test–retest intraobserver reliability assessment, a blinded laryn-gologist determined the RFS on two separate occa-sions. To evaluate interobserver reliability, the RFS was determined by two different blinded laryngolo-gists. Results: The {{mean age of the}} cohort was 50 years (6 12 standard deviation [SD]). Seventy-three percent were women. The RFS at entry was 11. 5 (6 5. 2 SD). This score improved to 9. 3 (6 4. 7 SD) at 2 months, 7. 3 (6 5. 5 SD) at 4 months, and 6. 1 (6 5. 2 SD) at 6 months of treatment (P <. 001 with trend). The mean RFS for laryngologist no. 1 was 10. 8 (6 4. 1 SD) at the initial screening and 10. 8 (6 4. 0 SD) at the repeat evaluation (r 5 0. 95, P <. 001). The mean RFS for laryngologist no. 2 was 11. 1 (6 3. 8 SD) at the initial screening and 10. 9 (6 3. 7 SD) at the repeat evaluation (r 5 0. 95, P <. 001).

Clinical presentations of these acid-related disorders may be atypical in the geriatric population. Older individuals {{are at increased risk}} for poor outcomes in complicated PUD and for development of GERD complications. Multiple risk factors (eg, Helicobacter pylori [HP], use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspirin) {{contribute to the development of}} PUD. Recent data has shown that HP-negative, NSAID-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers are on the rise and carry a higher risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding and mortality. Effective management of PUD in the geriatric population relies on identification and modification of treatable risk factors. Elderly patients with GERD often require long-term acid suppressive therapy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) including esomeprazole are effective in the treatment of reflux esophagitis, maintenance of GERD symptomatic control, and management of PUD as well as its complications. Potential safety concerns of long-term PPI use have been reported in the literature. Clinicians should balance the risks and benefits before committing elderly patients to long-term PPI therapy.

40|$|Background: Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is the {{backflow}} {{of stomach}} contents into the throat. The current {{standard of care}} is to treat patients with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily for up to 6 months or longer. Two meta-analyses were completed in 2006 and found no evidence PPI therapy is better than placebo for chronic laryngitis. Since that time new tools have been created to measure outcomes in this field of research, the Reflux Finding Score (RFS) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI). Using these standardized measures are researchers able to demonstrate PPI therapy is efficacious {{in the treatment of}} LPR? Method: An exhaustive literature search using the Medline, EBMRM, and CINAHL search engines was conducted from 2006 -present with the following search terms: laryngopharyngeal <b>reflux,</b> proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors, extraesophageal, laryngitis, globus, throat clearing, and chronic cough. Randomized controlled trials comparing PPI to placebo for the treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux in adults were included. Trials were excluded if completed before 2006 or if they were previously evaluated in a meta-analysis. Studies were evaluated for quality using the GRADE criteria. Results: Three studies met inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this systematic review. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 82 participants demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the total RSI scores after 12 weeks of treatment, this effect disappeared once treatment was stopped. Another double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 41 participants found no difference from baseline in any of their outcome measures. Finally a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found statistically significant reduced RSI at week 12. This was the only study able to demonstrate improvement in the RFS after 12 weeks of treatment. Conclusion: The use of proton pump inhibitors for LPR continues to be a topic surrounded with controversy. Current research supports a trial of twice daily PPI for at least 3 months if the patient is also experiencing symptoms of GERD. Patients with throat symptoms alone are unlikely to find relief from PPI therapy and should be evaluated for other possible etiologies. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the latest placebo controlled RCT using the RFS 1 and RSI 2 to evaluate the efficacy of PPI therapy for LPR...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain whether treating the laryngopharyngeal <b>reflux</b> with proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors influences the quality of the chronic rhinosinusitis treatment. The research was carried out as a double blind test comprising of 60 participants, 28 women and 32 men with the LPR symptoms and diagnosed chronic paranasal sinus inflammation. To confirm both diagnoses, all the participants underwent testing, which included the reflux symptom index (RSI), reflux finding score (RFS), eosinophil cationic protein analysis of the nasal lavage fluid, and the 24 -hour pH-evaluation using an esophageal sensor indicating the number and the size of the reflux episodes incidence. The participants were then divided into two groups. For the next 60 days, the first group was given proton pump inhibitors (Omeprazole) in 20 mg doses, while those in the control-group were given placebo doses. The initial testing was repeated after completion of the therapy. 85 The results support the hypothesis claiming the improvement of patient condition after proton pump inhibitor treatment (Omeprazole) in 20 mg doses a day during two months’ period in chronic rhinosinusitis.

40|$|AbstractElectromagnetic Pumps {{have been}} used for pumping liquid sodium in {{auxiliary}} circuits such as fill and drain and purification circuits of sodium cooled fast breeder reactors. Despite their low efficiency these pumps are used in fast reactors because of their high reliability and low maintenance due to absence of moving parts. Besides, EM Pumps can be used for pumping impure sodium. IGCAR has developed electromagnetic pumps of various capacities and successfully used them in experimental facilities. This paper deals with the design, development and performance testing of a large electromagnetic pump called Annular Linear Induction Pump (ALIP). This 170 m 3 /h capacity ALIP is for use in PFBR Secondary Sodium Fill and Drain Circuit (SSFDC) and was introduced in the sodium circuit of SGTF for testing its performance. In this type of pump, a linearly traveling magnetic field is generated by means of circular windings placed spatially apart in slots and excited by 3 -phase supply. This traveling field induces circulating currents in liquid sodium which generates secondary magnetic field. Interaction of primary magnetic field and secondary magnetic field produces pumping force on liquid sodium. The pump duct is made of SS 316 L. Pump winding is made up of copper with class H insulation. The pump is designed for 360 V and for a maximum sodium temperature of 450 °C. The <b>pump</b> is a <b>reflux</b> type of <b>pump</b> with both inlet and outlet on the same side.

This study aimed to assess the variation in different APG parameters in patients with chronic venous disease and to evaluate the reliability of APG in test-retest situations. Method: Seventeen patients (18 limbs) with chronic venous disease were recruited into this study. Subjects were asked to undergo tests on two occasions, 1 to 6 weeks apart. Three tests were performed at each visit, and three patients had 10 tests performed at one visit. The coefficients of variation were calculated for repeated measurements and test-retest reliability, and the differences between the means of three tests and the 10 tests were also analyzed. Results: The coefficients of variation for the repeated measurements ranged from 7. 5 % to 27 % for the majority of parameters of APG. The differences between the means of three tests and the means of 10 tests were less than 10 % in this study. The coefficients of variation of method error were approximately 10 % in test-retest measures. Conclusions: This study has shown that evaluations of calf pump function and venous reflux using APG display variations in repeated measurements and in the test-retest measures. The variations found within patients and on retesting patients on different days suggest that APG is very unlikely to be able to detect small changes in the parameters of venous <b>reflux</b> and calf <b>pump</b> function. It is essential to understand the inherent variation of APG measurements when they are used to assess treatments that are designed to improve venous function.

Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) achieve symptom control on once-daily PPI therapy, but approximately 20 %– 30 % require twice-daily dosing. Methods: Patients were ≥ 18 years of age with at least one medical claim for GERD and at least two PPI claims from HealthCore&# 39;s Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM) during 2004 – 2009. Patients were continuously eligible for 12 months before and after the index date (date of first PPI claim). Based on PPI dosing throughout the post-index period (quantity of medication dispensed/number of days supply), patients were classified as once-daily (dose ≤ 1. 5 pills per day) or twice-daily (≥ 1. 5) PPI users. Results: The study cohort included 248, 386 patients with GERD (mean age 52. 8 ± 13. 93 years, 56 % females) of whom 90 % were once-daily and 10 % were twice-daily PPI users. The Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index for once-daily and twice-daily PPI users was 0. 70 ± 1. 37 and 0. 89 ± 1. 54, respectively (P < 0. 05). More once-daily patients had claims for Barrett&# 39;s esophagus (5 % versus 2 %, P < 0. 0001) than twice-daily patients. Post-index, higher proportions of twice-daily patients had at least one GERD-related inpatient visit (7 % versus 5 %), outpatient visit (60 % versus 49 %), and office visit (48 % versus 38 %) versus once-daily patients (P < 0. 0001). Mean total GERD-related health care costs were $ 2065 ± $ 6636 versus $ 3749 ± $ 11, 081 for once-daily and twice-daily PPI users, respectively (P < 0. 0001).

Objectives: To assess the incidence and potential predictors of PTS. Methods: We prospectively followed 111 consecutive patients for 2 years after a first episode of objectively documented DVT of the leg. With non-invasive venous examinations, residual thrombosis, valvular <b>reflux,</b> calf muscle <b>pump</b> function and venous outflow resistance were assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. The Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, and Pathophysiologi classification was used to record the occurrence and severity of PTS. Regression analysis with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to identify potential predictors. Results: The cumulative incidence of PTS was 46 % after 3 months, and the incidence and severity did not increase further. Men appeared to be at increased risk as compared with women (risk ratio [RR] 1. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 9 – 2. 2), as were patients over 50 years as compared with younger patients (RR 1. 4 %, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 2. 1). Patients with thrombosis localized in the proximal veins at diagnosis had an increased risk of PTS as compared with patients with distal thrombosis (RR 2. 3 %, 95 % CI 1. 0 – 5. 6). PTS developed in 32 of 52 patients (62 %) with residual thrombosis in the proximal veins 6 weeks after diagnosis, as compared with 17 of 45 patients (38 %) without residual proximal thrombosis, leading to a 1. 6 -fold increased risk (95 % CI 1. 0 – 2. 5). The presence of valvular reflux in the superficial veins was also a predictor at 6 weeks, with a 1. 6 -fold increased risk as compared with patients without superficial reflux (95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 3). A multivariate analysis of these predictors yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 62 – 0. 82).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to develop new methodologies to assess upper gastro-intestinal function in health and disease. Several different technologies were studied {{in a range of}} upper gastro-intestinal diseases and adapted to try and provide more meaningful insights. The thesis has three main sections. In the first section, High Resolution Oesophageal Manometry (HRM) was used to assess unexplained upper gastro-intestinal symptoms in a group of patients referred to a tertiary centre. 46 patients were diagnosed with rumination syndrome following HRM. A retrospective review was completed of these patients case notes and HRM data. The predominant aim of this section was to identify if common mechanisms exist within rumination and its variations and to establish if the variety of presenting symptoms is due to different underlying problems or a common behavioural response to a variety of stimuli, with symptoms being dependent on the circumstance the behaviour exists in. This would support a generic biofeedback technique being useful regardless of presenting complaint. Comparing the variety of symptoms, exhibited behaviour and manometric findings, a new classification system for rumination was then developed; 1. 	Primary or “classical” rumination a. 	Increase in abdominal strain with corresponding rise in intra-gastric pressure and return of gastric contents to the mouth 2. 	Secondary or reflux-related rumination a. 	Reflux event causes the patient to respond with increase in intra-abdominal muscle strain and subsequent rumination 3. 	Supra-gastric belching independent of meals. a. 	Rise in intra-gastric pressure whilst a closed gastro-oesophageal junction, therefore producing rapid belching of air from the oesophagus without any return of gastric contents Generic biofeedback therapy was used (regardless of presenting symptoms) to control the abnormal behavioural response to symptoms. 20 / 46 patients reported full resolution of their symptoms and a further 13 / 46 reported improvement in their symptoms with this, while underlying mechanisms were targeted e. g. <b>reflux</b> with proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors, pain in functional dyspepsia. In the second main section of this thesis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is considered. GORD is currently diagnosed by 24 hour pH studies. These are often difficult for patients to tolerate and require time off medication. A more attractive method would be for diagnosis to occur {{at the same time as}} gastroscopy. A novel instrument is the EndoFLIP® device. This measures cross-sectional area (CSA) and distensibility at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) via a long catheter with a balloon at the end that straddles the GOJ. It has been hypothesised that these measurements will be increased in those with GORD, as the GOJ is more distensible, allowing more retrograde movement of gastric contents. The aim of this section of the thesis was to establish if GOJ CSA and distensibility differentiate between healthy volunteers (HV) and GORD patients based on i) symptoms and ii) prolonged oesophageal acid exposure. 21 HV and 18 patients with GORD (based on symptoms) had EndoFLIP® measurements and wireless pH studies to assess this. 14...|$|R
40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a {{physiologic}} phenomenon {{occurring in}} healthy subjects, mostly after the meal period. Gastroesophageal reflux disease {{is defined as}} the occurrence of symptoms and/or mucosal lesions due to reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. According to literature, the prevalence of increased reflux in patients with CF is highly variable, ranging from 15 to 91 %. Different patient populations and different methods to study reflux have contributed to this large variability. Using impedance-pH monitoring, we studied reflux in an adult CF population over a time period of 5 years. This technique enabled us to detect not only acid reflux, but also weakly acidic reflux and to examine the proximal extent of reflux. We found that: i) 71 % of CF adults have increased GER, with the majority of the reflux episodes being acidic, and ii) 35 % of CF patients have increased acidic DGER and this seems to be related to high volume reflux. The mechanisms of increased reflux have been extensively studied in GERD, but little was known about the pathophysiology of reflux in CF. To better understand increased reflux in CF we studied gastric emptying, sphincteric factors and esophageal motility. It has been shown that delayed gastric emptying is present in approximately 30 % of the GERD population. However, these studies could not show a clear relationship between gastric emptying data and reflux parameters. Literature on gastric emptying in CF patients is abundant, but the results remain contradictory. Gastric emptying {{has been shown to be}} delayed, accelerated or similar to healthy subjects. In our CF population, using the breath test, gastric emptying was delayed in 15 % of the patients. Similar to the GERD patients, we were unable to show a relationship between rates of gastric emptying and reflux parameters, but we did find a correlation between gastric emptying rates and severity of DGER. It seems that a delay in gastric emptying could lead to an increased number of high volume acidic DGER. A very low basal LES pressure has been implicated as an important mechanism of increased reflux. However, reflux as a result of low or even absent basal LES pressure was confined to patients with severe esophagitis. Although LES pressures in our CF population were lower compared to a group of healthy volunteers, values were not below 10 mm Hg and therefore unlikely to be a significant mechanism for reflux in CF. TLESRs are defined as relaxations of the LES not triggered by swallowing, and are the underlying mechanism for reflux of gas during belching. TLESRs account for the majority of reflux episodes, both in healthy subjects as well as in GERD patients, but not all TLESRs are accompanied by a reflux episode. Almost half of TLESRs in healthy subjects are associated with a reflux episode, in GERD patients 60 - 70 % of TLESRs are followed by reflux. Using HRM-MII, we showed that TLESRs are indeed the main mechanism for reflux in the CF population, however, the number of TLESRs was similar as in a group of healthy volunteers. These findings are in according to what was shown in GERD patients. Scheffer and colleagues studied gastroesophageal pressure gradients (GEPGs) during TLESRs and found that pressure gradients were significantly higher during TLESRs associated with acid reflux compared to TLESRs without acid reflux. Pandolfino et al. demonstrated that patients with typical reflux symptoms have a higher GEPG compared to patients with atypical symptoms. Moreover, GEPGs during a TLESR were significantly higher in GERD patients compared to healthy subjects, and this was due to a higher intra-abdominal pressure, as is seen in obese patients. We monitored a group of 12 CF patients using HRM-MII and studied pressure gradients during TLESRs and compared them with a group of healthy subjects. We found that GEPGs were significantly higher in the CF population compared to the healthy group. However, in contrast to the typical GERD population, this was not due to higher intra-abdominal pressures, but to a more negative intra-thoracic pressure. It seems that reflux in CF patients is at least partly a secondary phenomenon to respiratory dysfunction leading to increased inspiratory effort and lower intra-thoracic pressures. The exact relationship between reflux and respiratory symptoms has not yet been elucidated. However, 3 general mechanisms have been proposed and they can act either together or separated, depending on the respiratory disease: 1) micro-aspiration of gastric contents into the airways; 2) a vagally mediated esophageal-tracheobronchial reflex, and 3) hypersensitivity of the upper airways. We found aspiration in 56 % of the CF patients, by means of presence of bile acids in induced sputum. We were unable to confirm a significant correlation between quantitative severity of reflux and impairment of lung function in CF. In contrast, we found a clearer association between aspiration and deterioration of lung function. It seems logical to assume that increased reflux will increase the likelihood of aspiration. However, our results suggest that even with a physiological amount of reflux, patients with CF might have aspiration with deleterious consequences for their lung function. This might be due to defective anti-aspiration protective reflexes and impaired bronchial clearance mechanisms. Treatment of <b>reflux</b> with proton <b>pump</b> inhibitors (PPI) eliminates the acid component of reflux, without affecting other non-acidic duodeno-gastric components. We have previously demonstrated that increased GER is common in patients with CF and that little over half of the CF patients aspirate duodeno-gastric components into the lungs. Treatment with PPI does not eliminate the risk of aspiration. We aimed to assess the in vitro effect of gastric juice from patients on and off acid suppressive therapy on primary bronchial epithelial cells from a CF patient. The main findings of our study were: i) exposure of PBEC to gastric juice from patients on PPI provoked a significantly higher grade of inflammation, by means of IL- 8, compared to exposure to gastric juice from patients off PPI, both in CF as well as in healthy cells; ii) after exposure of the cells to filtrated gastric juice from patients on PPI, levels of IL- 8 dropped significantly, both in CF as in healthy cells, and iii) in all conditions, production of IL- 8 was significantly higher from CF cells compared to healthy bronchial epithelial cells. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Dolomitization is {{undoubtedly}} the most intensively studied diagenetic process in carbonate rocks. It can induce porosity and permeability changes {{resulting from a}} complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which together with the variety of dolomitizing fluid circulation schemes, makes the prediction of the dolomite geometric distribution and of petrophysical features very challenging. In Southern Italy the dolomitization processes and the induced porosity/permeability changes have never been investigated in detail. Only the Upper Triassic interval of the Apenninic carbonate platform succession outcropping on the Monti Lattari Belt (Southern Apennines) has been studied by Iannace (1991) and Iannace & Frisia (1994), which demonstrated a fundamental difference in dolomitization style between Norian and Rhaetian-Lower Jurassic successions. The present research aims to a detailed genetical and petrophysical characterization of the dolomitized bodies outcropping along the Monti Lattari belt from the Lower Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous. The goal was to complete {{the study of the}} dolomitization processes along the carbonate succession of the Monti Lattari belt, started by Iannace (1991), and to furnish also a complete characterization of the petrophysical properties of the observed different types of dolomites. The research approach was to combine detailed sampling and analysis of well exposed outcrops along road cuts and quarries with a large scale reconstruction along a transect showing platform domains alternating with intraplatform basins. The workflow has been the following: •	Field work including geometric and stratigraphic observations and sampling. •	Petrographic analysis of dolomite types and their porosity (Optical microscopy, SEM and catodoluminescence analyses). •	Geochemical analyses on the separate dolomite phases (O, C, and Sr, trace elements, Ca% and fluid inclusions). •	 Petrophysical analyses including: Helium-porosimetry, Petrographyc and Digital Image Analysis, Mercury Injection porosimetry, Nitrogen Permeability and Sonic Velocity. The field study and the petrographic analyses have shown that the Lower-Middle Jurassic stratigraphic interval mainly consists of a widespread massive dolomite which irregularly replace the carbonate bodies in the Liassic interval and only partially replaces the Dogger facies. This dolomite (called Dolomite 2), which affects also the Rhaetian portion of the succession, is made of coarse crystals with both planar-s and planar-e mosaic with low porosities and permeability. Its occurrence and geometry, together with the light oxygen isotopes signature and the Mg/Ca ratio close to the stochiometry, allow to ascribe this dolomite to a late diagenetic event related to a large scale circulation of marine fluids through the Jurassic carbonate platform driven by thermal convection. In this stratigraphic interval also another type of dolomite has been locally recognized (Dolomite 1). It consists of fine grained crystals with a very low porosity which only partially replace the carbonate bodies. It shows sedimentary structures which indicate, together with the stable isotopes results and the XRD data, a very early diagenetic process, likely related to <b>reflux</b> and tidal <b>pumping</b> mechanisms of fluid circulation. At last, a third type of dolomite (saddle type dolomite, called Dolomite 3) followed by precipitation of poikilotopic calcite has been discriminated. These last two diagenetic phases are concentrated along faults and fracture systems and their oxygen isotopes in addition to the fluid inclusions results, allow to relate them to a precipitation from warm fluids (about 130 °C) raised along extensional faults during a very late stage of diagenesis. The Lower-Middle Cretaceous interval has been studied, in cooperation with Shell, because considered as possible analogue of Val D’Agri reservoirs. In fact, the high similarities between the most productive intervals of the Apulian Platform (Cretaceous in age) and the coeval rocks outcropping in the Apenninic Platform (Monti Lattari belt), allow the characterization of buried bodies via outcropping facies. This interval consists of partially dolomitized bodies, usually stratiform, alternated with low porosity micritic carbonates. Petrographically, it has been possible to distinguish two main different types of dolomites: Dolomite A made of fine crystals (10 to 50 µm) with a low porosity mosaic and Dolomite B made of coarse crystals (70 to 130 µm) with both a tight mosaic and a more porous one (planar-s and planar-e respectively). They are Ca enriched and have positive oxygen isotopes data which indicate an early diagenesis from a normal marine water. The invoked processes for their formation are a capillary rising of fluids in an evaporitic setting, for Dolomite A and a reflux of slightly saline water for Dolomite B. Finally, also in this stratigraphic interval, a third less abundant type of dolomite has been distinguished: Dolomite C (saddle type) followed by precipitation of poikilotopic calcite. Again, these last two diagenetic phases are concentrated along fractures and fault systems and can be related to warm fluids (130 °C, as indicated by fluid inclusion microthermometry), raised along extensional faults. As a consequence, considering the similarity with the Jurassic, and also with some Raethian samples collected by Iannace (1991), these two last diagenetic phases can be ascribed to a unique late diagenetic event that is the rising of warm fluids along the extensional Neogenic faults, which represent the last tectonic phase affectiong the Apenninic fold and thrust belt. From a petrophysical point of view, the dolomites belonging to the two analyzed intervals show very low porosity values. The integration of petrophysics and petrography, show that the main factor affecting the porosity and permeability values is the crystal size and packing which is strictly related to the limestone precursor facies. In fact, both in the Jurassic and in the Cretaceous, the presence of two different textures (Planar-e and s), due to the facies variations of the host rock, strongly drives the porosity differences. As a result, considering an hypothetical hydrocarbon reservoir, both for the Jurassic and for the Cretaceous, the potential permeable horizons could have represented by the layers with the more porous Planar-e mosaic. Finally, {{in order to have a}} complete petrophysical characterization of the sampled dolomites, a detailed study on sonic velocity variations has been carried out. The investigation, aimed to analyze the influence of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters on the sonic velocity variations in low porosity dolomites, involved the characterization of dolomites coming from the same succession but having different stratigraphic heights (Cretaceous and Jurassic from the Apenninic Platform, sharing the same burial and tectonic history) and also of dolomites having the same age but coming from two domains with different burial history (Cretaceous dolomites from the Apenninic and Apulia Platform). The main result of this part of the study has been that, in low porosity dolomites (< 10 %), the factors affecting the sonic velocity propagation drastically reduce. As a consequence, pore types and mostly crystals size result to be the main controlling factors on the sonic velocity variations. In conclusion, the data collected in this PhD thesis, together with the previous studies on the Sorrento Peninsula and on the Tethyan domain, demonstrate that there is a stratigraphic control on the observed different types of dolomites in terms of geometry, petrography and geochemistry. This control appears to be related to the different impact that surface-related, climatic controlled diagenesis and subsurface late diagenetic processes had in the different moments of the Mesozoic. The Norian and the Cretaceous appear as time favorable to the formation of early dolomites. On the other hand, the Rhaetian and the Lower-Middle Jurassic were times characterized by widespread fluid circulation episodes took place during the Jurassic and leaded to the formation of large discordant bodies of coarse grained dolomites. These processes have been active not only in the Lattari Mountain platform but likely affected also other platform domains of Apennines and Alps...|$|R
