25|$|The Blue Line Modernization Project, {{which began}} in the 1990s and is still under way, {{includes}} renovating stations to increase the length of trains from four to six cars, to make all stations wheelchair accessible, and to improve appearance. On June 25, 1994, the line was cut back to Orient Heights at all times to permit reconstruction of the outer stations. Beachmont and Wood Island were completely rebuilt, while Suffolk Downs, Revere Beach and Wonderland were renovated. A simultaneous $8 million noise reduction program added sound walls at Beachmont and Orient Heights, <b>rubber</b> <b>mats</b> under tracks, and soundproofing of nearby homes. The stations reopened on June 26, 1995.|$|E

The stiffness of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mat</b> was determined by conducting a compression test using the MAND axial testing machine. The stress rate was 100  N/s, and the diameter of load bearing plates (top and bottom) (mm) was 150  mm. The rubber stiffness was calculated as 6.45  MPa.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to make of activated carbon from rice husk be useful as filler. To inspect the conformity as filler, the activated carbon from rice husk was applied in the preparation of <b>rubber</b> <b>mat</b> compound, in the case carbon black N 330 was used as the standard of comparison. Activated carbon from rice husk was made by carbonization process at temperature of 450 oC for one hour and activation process with NaCl 4 % for 24 hours, followed by pyrolysis at temperature 500 oC for one hour. Filler was milled and sieved by 400 mesh siefter. <b>Rubber</b> <b>mat</b> compound were prepared with various filler level of activated carbon from rice husk, carbon black N 330 either separately formulated or combination. The vulcanized <b>rubber</b> <b>mat</b> was then physically tested its tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness, an density. The research showed that the addition of filler by combining the activated carbon from rice husk and carbon black with ratio of 40 : 20 phr into the rubber compound could meet the physical properties requirements of <b>rubber</b> <b>mat.</b> Activated carbon from rice husk can be used as filler, but not as reinforcing filler...|$|R

2500|$|The Spitfire was an {{inexpensive}} small sports car {{and as such}} had rather basic trim by today's standards, including <b>rubber</b> <b>mats</b> and a large plastic steering wheel. It was nonetheless considered fairly comfortable by period standards, as it had roll-down windows and exterior door locks, {{as well as a}} relatively full instrumentation. These early cars were referred to both as [...] "Triumph Spitfire Mark I" [...] and [...] "Spitfire 4", {{not to be confused with}} the later Spitfire Mark IV. The [...] "Spitfire 4" [...] name indicated the possibility of the later appearance of a six-cylinder version.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Hens {{from light}} and medium weight strains of turkey hens {{were placed in}} cage and floor regimes. The light weight hens had {{a higher rate of}} egg {{production}} than the medium weight hens in both cage and floor housing regimes. No significant difference was found between these two regimes for rate of egg production. A higher incidence of cracked eggs was found for floor hens compared to caged hens and also for hens on a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>mat</b> compared to a soft <b>rubber</b> <b>mat.</b> Rate of egg production for one hen per cage was higher at a probability of 0. 20 than when hens were placed two per cage...|$|R

40|$|The Composite Armored Vehicle (CAV) is an {{advanced}} technology demonstrator of an all-composite ground combat vehicle. The CAV upper hull {{is made of}} a tough light-weight S 2 -glass/epoxy laminate with embedded ceramic tiles that serve as armor. The tiles are bonded to a <b>rubber</b> <b>mat</b> with a carefully selected, highly viscoelastic adhesive. The integration of armor and structure offers an efficient combination of ballistic protection and structural performance. The analysis of this anisotropic construction, with its inherent discontinuous and periodic nature, however, poses several challenges. The present paper describes a shell-based "element-layering" technique that properly accounts for these effects and for the concentrated transverse shear flexibility in the <b>rubber</b> <b>mat.</b> One {{of the most important}} advantages of the element-layering technique over advanced higher-order elements is that it is based on conventional elements. This advantage allows the models to be portable to other structural [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|A static {{dissipative}} mat that {{rests on a}} conductive surface (commonly the case in military facilities) are typically made of 3 layers (3-ply) with {{static dissipative}} vinyl layers surrounding a conductive substrate which is electrically attached to ground (earth). For commercial uses, static dissipative <b>rubber</b> <b>mats</b> are traditionally used that are made of 2 layers (2-ply) with a tough solder resistant top static dissipative layer that makes them last longer than the vinyl mats, and a conductive rubber bottom. Conductive mats are made of carbon and used only on floors {{for the purpose of}} drawing static electricity to ground as quickly as possible. Normally conductive mats are made with cushioning for standing and are referred to as [...] "anti-fatigue" [...] mats.|$|E
