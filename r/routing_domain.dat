40|$|International audienceOpen Shortest Path First (OSPF), a {{link state}} routing protocol, {{is a popular}} {{interior}} gateway protocol (IGP) in the Internet. Wide spread deployment and years of experience running the protocol have motivated continuous improvements in its operation as the nature and demands of the routing infrastructures have changed. Modern <b>routing</b> <b>domains</b> need to maintain {{a very high level}} of service availability. Hence, OSPF needs to achieve fast convergence to topology changes. Also, the ever-growing size of <b>routing</b> <b>domains,</b> and possible presence of wireless mobile adhoc network (MANET) components, requires highly scalable operation on part of OSPF to avoid routing instability. Recent years have seen significant efforts aimed at improving OSPF's convergence speed as well as scalability and extending OSPF to achieve seamless integration of mobile adhoc networks with conventional wired networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} performance advantages of dividing a network into independent <b>routing</b> <b>domains</b> is well known; however, the actual benefits {{are hard to}} quantify and are often not sufficient to outweigh the added complexity. Justification of domains is especially hard in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETS), because reconfiguration overhead increases and use of single interface routers.

This paper proposes a framework for scalable routing in MANETs based on auto-configured optimized <b>routing</b> <b>domains</b> and an enhanced inter-domain routing scheme. To minimize overall overhead, the inter-domain routing protocol exploits existing messages needed for domain maintenance. The framework allows different routing protocols to run in each domain.

40|$|We have {{designed}} an agent-based architecture for quantitative service provisioning in di�erentiated services capable networks. For each link-state <b>routing</b> <b>domain</b> {{in the network}} there is a topology-aware QoS agent �also known as a bandwidth broker � responsible for admission control. The architecture provides resource reservations for aggregated virtual leased lines between network domains. In this paper, we present performance measurements for resource provisioning in a prototype QoS agent. This includes an evaluation of two data structures for advance reservations and accompanying algorithms. We also compare the cost for on-demand route computations with pre-computation of routes. The objective in {{this paper is to}} evaluate the performance of end-to-end admission control within a single link-state <b>routing</b> <b>domain.</b> In a domain with 15 routers, 28 transition networks and 64 stub networks, our prototype performs approximately 25 000 end-to-end admission decisions per second.

40|$|Abstract—During {{the last}} few years, the {{research}} community has shown an increasing {{interest in the subject}} of inter-domain routing in optical networks, so new approaches like the optical extension of BGP, namely OBGP, have arisen. However, it is widely accepted now that a multi-domain routing model mostly centered on the exchange of reachability information – like the one we have today or the one provided by OBGP – {{is not going to be}} enough in the future. <b>Routing</b> <b>domains</b> must be able to exchange both, reachability, as well as aggregated Path State Information (PSI). Understanding that there is a missing piece in the routing models provided by BGP and OBGP is easy nowadays, but contributing with solutions capable of highly improving the performance of these routing protocols without increasing the number and frequency of the routing messages exchanged between domains is a challenging task. This study makes the following contributions. First, we propose a straightforward strategy to compute highly aggregated PSI between <b>routing</b> <b>domains.</b> Second, we propose OBGP+, an extended version of OBGP that exploits this PSI to compute inter-domain lightpaths in a highly efficient way. Third, in order to avoid the typical increase in the number of routing messages associated with the update of PSI, we propose to piggy-back these updates in non-dummy Keepalive messages exchanged between OBGP+ neighbors. Extensive simulations made with OPNET in the PAN European network topology reveal that: i) OBGP+ is able to drastically reduce the blocking experienced with OBGP; ii) while even needing less number of routing messages than OBGP to achieve this performance.
