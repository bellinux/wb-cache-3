The extension was developed for the INCAA-TR 10 and INCAA-TR 32 <b>recorders.</b> These <b>modules</b> are built in the "CompactPCI" hardware format. It has been demonstrated that measuring with PCI modules under JDAQ is possible. However, the handling of the modules is not as systematic as measuring with CAMAC modules. General problems with implementation of the PCI modules will be discussed in this paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This range is upgraded {{versions of the}} original Alexa cameras, which are equipped with a so-called XR module, which replaces the SxS module on the cameras, and allows direct RAW recording {{without the need for}} an external <b>recorder.</b> This <b>module</b> records on dedicated SSD drives. Further improvements are an internal ND filter unit, a 4:3 sensor and a quieter cooling fan. The range accordingly comprises the Alexa, the Alexa XT, the Alexa XT M, the Alexa XT Plus, the Alexa XT Studio, and the Alexa Fiber Remote. Existing cameras can be upgraded with the XR module for internal RAW recording.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—the {{emerging}} {{scenario of}} real-time voice transmission over wireless medium is being exploited by various {{new set of}} applications to abate the growing need of a secured, low-cost and compact embedded device. In this project a new fully-functional embedded device has been proposed which is able to stream or transmit voice in real-time over WI-FI (IEEE 802. 11) with an acceptable audio quality. The proposed system has features such as feeding recorded audio directly into a remote computer for storage from a voice <b>recorder</b> <b>module.</b> Given the credit-card- sized single-board and low price, Raspberry Pi model B is the most appropriate as a portable device for our wireless requirements. In this project, the Raspberry Pi is intended to have capability of gathering audio from an USB microphone connected to it and transmit it to another remote computer in real time. The Raspberry Pi {{is connected to the}} workstation. So, there is no need of a separate monitor. To do this, SSH(Secure SHell) is used, which is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked nodes. Open source Linux based OS is used in this project to keep the cost low. Index Terms—Raspberry Pi, Wi-Fi, 802. 11, Wireless voice transmissio...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of formal}} methods in {{software}} development seeks {{to increase our}} confidence in the resultant system. Their use often requires tool support, so the integrity of a development using formal methods {{is dependent on the}} integrity of the tool-set used. Specifically its integrity depends on the theorem prover, since in a typical formal development system the theorem prover is used to establish the validity of the proof obligations incurred by all the steps in the design and refinement process. In this thesis we are concerned with tool-based formal development systems that are used to develop high-integrity software. Since the theorem prover program is a critical part of such a system, it should ideally have been itself formally verified. Unfortunately, most theorem provers are too complex to be verified formally using currently available techniques. An alternative approach, which has many advantages, is to include a proof checker as an extra component in the system, and to certify this. A proof checker is a program which reads and checks the proofs produced by a theorem prover. Proof checkers are inherently simpler than theorem provers, since they only process actual proofs, whereas much of the code of a theorem prover is concerned with searching the space of possible proofs to find the required one. They are also free from all but the simplest user interface concerns, since their input is a proof produced by another program, and their output may be as simple as a `yes/no 2 ̆ 7 reply to the question: Is this a valid proof? plus a list of assumptions on which this judgement is based. When included in a formal development system a stand-alone proof checker is, in one sense, superfluous, since it does not produce any proofs [...] the theorem prover does this. Instead its importance is in establishing the integrity {{of the results of the}} system [...] it provides extra assurance. A proof checker provides extra assurance simply by checking the proofs, since all proofs have then been validated by two independent programs. However a proof checker can provide an extra, and higher, level of assurance if it has been formally verified. In order for formal verification to be feasible the proof checker must be as simple as possible. In turn the simplicity of a proof checker is dependent on the complexity of the data which it processes, that is, the representation of the proofs that it checks. This thesis develops a representation of proofs that is simple and generic. The aim is to produce a generic representation that is applicable to the proofs produced by a variety of theorem provers. Simplicity facilitates verification, while genericity maximises the return on the effort of verification. Using a generic representation places obligations on the theorem provers to produce a proof record in this format. A flexible recorder/translator architecture is proposed which allows proofs to be recorded by existing theorem provers with minimal changes to the original code. The prover is extended with a <b>recorder</b> <b>module</b> whose output is then, if necessary, converted to the generic format by a separate translator program. A formal specification of a checker for proofs recorded in this representation is given. The specification could be used to formally develop a proof-checker, although this step is not taken in this thesis. In addition the characteristics of both the specification and possible implementations are investigated. This is done to assess the size and feasibility of the verification task, and also to confirm that the design is not over-sensitive to the size of proofs. This investigation shows that a checker developed from the specification will be scalable to handle large proofs. To investigate the feasibility of a system based on this architecture, prototype proof recorders were developed for the Ergo 5 and Isabelle 98 theorem provers. In addition a prototype checker was written to check proofs in the proposed format. This prototype is compatible with the formal specification. The combined system was tested successfully using existing proofs for both the Ergo 5 and Isabelle 98 theorem provers...|$|E

These advancements have also brought {{about the issue of}} extracting data with different levels of classification that was written to single location.

The functional electrical stimulation cycling system (FESCS) is useful for hemiplegic patients. Because that the muscle of stroke patients is under hybrid activation. The raw electromyography (EMG) represents the residual muscle force of stroke subject whereas the peak-to-peak of stimulus EMG indicates the force enhancement benefiting from ES. It seems that EMG signals {{could be used for}} a parameter of feedback control mechanism. So, we design the feedback control protocol of FESCS, it includes physiological signal <b>recorder,</b> FPGA biomedical <b>module,</b> DAC and electrical stimulation circuit.

Switches fall into the category of network infrastructure. They support the interconnection of nodes and the movement of data in the overall network. Unlike endpoints such as data acquisition units, <b>recorders,</b> and display <b>modules,</b> switches do not collect, store or process data. They are a necessary expense required to build the network. The goal of this paper is to show how a small integrated network switch can be used to maximize the value proposition of a given switch port in the network. This can be accomplished by maximizing the bandwidth utilization of individual network segments and minimizing the necessary wiring needed to connect all the network components...|$|R
