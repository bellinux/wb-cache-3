50|$|RailRadar is a live tracker {{shown on}} an {{interactive}} map which allowed users to watch movements of passenger trains running in India. All passenger trains in India are operated by state-owned Indian Railways.

RailRadar was an outcome of innovation where Indian Railways Center for Railway Information System (CRIS) and RailYatri.in joined hands. and the service was launched on 10 October 2012. RailRadar uses Google Maps as its web mapping software. The software was accessible {{in the form of}} a website and a mobile app. RailRadar was discontinued by the Indian Railways on 6 September 2013. RailYatri relaunched RailRadar in November 2013. However the RailRadar service did not provide the actual <b>running</b> <b>status</b> or the actual location of the train, rather these locations were plotted based on the regular scheduled timetable.|$|E

40|$|With Chinese coal {{exploitation}} {{extending to}} depth rapidly, {{a large number}} of coal and gas outburst accidents happened and resulted in thousands of casualties in the last decade. Coal and gas outburst prevention project has become the prerequisite of underground coal mining, but its process control ability is especially poor. By integrating statistical process control theory into the process of coal and gas outburst prevention, three urgent problems were solved. First at all, data structure of the process inspection parameters was designed asvectors, which only consisted of principle elements and formed data series as time went by. Secondly, based on sample data of the experimental area, statistical characteristic of inspection parameters was gained and their X-Rs control charts were drawn. Finally, performance of process <b>running</b> <b>statuses</b> that might be in control or beyond control were analyzed in detail. When the process was in control, curves should slightly fluctuate around their center lines and between upper control limits and lower control limits. Otherwise, the process was beyond control, in which X control charts were used to identify anomalies of data value fluctuation and Rs control charts were used to identify anomalies of data fluctuation amplitudes. By the experimental application in Hexi colliery of China, the interdisciplinary research was proved to be helpful to improve process control ability and then prevent coal and gas outburst accidents.

40|$|PURPOSE. With the {{introduction}} of spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), changes in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and macular volume (MV) can be detected with high precision. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether there is a physiological quantifiable degree of variation of these structures in humans. METHODS. This study took place during a 10 -km charity run at VU University Medical Center Amsterdam. Weight, height, hydration status, RNFL thickness (ring scan, 12 ° around the optic nerve head), and MV (20 ° × 20 °) were assessed in 69 subjects (44 runners, 25 controls) using SD-OCT with eye-tracking function. The SD-OCT scans were assessed before <b>running</b> (normal <b>status),</b> after <b>running</b> (more dehydrated <b>status),</b> and 1 to 1. 5 hours after finishing the run (rehydrated status). Controls were measured at the same time intervals as the runners but did not participate in the running event. Changes over time were assessed by general linear models, correcting for repeated measurements. RESULTS. In runners, a significant increase in both RNFL thickness (94. 4 μm [baseline] to 95. 2 μm [rehydration], P = 0. 04) and MV (288. 9 μm [baseline] to 291. 0 μm [rehydration], P < 0. 001) over time was observed. Controls did not show significant changes over time. Anatomically, the physiological change of RNFL thickness was most marked in the nasal sectors. CONCLUSIONS. This prospective study demonstrated a significant physiological variation of the RNFL thickness and MV at a proportion that, on an individual patient level, may be relevant for longitudinal studies in neurodegenerative diseases. © 2012 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc...|$|R
