2500|$|Jill and Mal also argue, with Jill clearly regretting {{not having}} worked for fifteen years. In a moment left on her own, Jill weeps and says [...] "God help us". She and Mal go to bed. In the morning, the {{alarm goes off}} again, and this time, it is Jill who reaches for the alarm – except that she only reaches as far as Mal would have <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> In fact, Jill and Mal have {{sometime}} swapped bodies, and the act ends as they make this discovery.|$|E
60|$|It {{was no less}} {{annoying}} a {{fact that}} Bessie and she had only one waste-basket, which was invariably at Bessie's desk when Una <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lem, running in, {{kicked the}} gun just as Belllounds <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When it rolled {{against the fence}} Jim was there to secure it. Lem {{likewise}} grappled with the struggling Belllounds.|$|E
60|$|Her hat fell off, and {{she broke}} from his embrace to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Christmas presents!” {{cried the}} sister. “Jessie, let us open the bundle right away.” And {{she made a}} playful <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Marie Ramirez and Jamie Cardiff are {{the first}} 2 to miss the plate at third base. Later, while the two were <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> simultaneously, the umpire {{incorrectly}} indicates Jamie as the winner.|$|R
60|$|So {{the servant}} {{gave her the}} pot of gold, and then he tried to pluck the apple. First he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and then he climbed for it, and then he shook the limb.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, but {{of course}} that was another mistake, and not intentional. He wouldn't drink it. He set it down." [...] A slight pause, then he added, casually and quite simply: [...] "The {{plaintiff}} <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and hogged it." ...|$|E
60|$|Dick {{had felt}} for his pistol before, {{to find it}} gone. But now he spotted the glint of the shiny barrel among the leaves. The weapon had fallen from his person at the time Crabtree had pitched him into the hollow. He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and to his joy {{found that it was}} fully loaded and ready for use.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can also}} be {{difficult}} for some people with CVI to look at an object and <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> at the same time. Looking and reaching are sometimes accomplished as two separate acts: look, then look away and reach.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic said [...] "A Dreamer's Christmas is one {{of those}} holiday records -- once you hear <b>it,</b> you'll be <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> every season." [...] Consequence of Sound called it [...] "interesting, captivating, and {{pleasing}} for every member of the family at your holiday party." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to {{a police}} dashcam video/audio, after being asked for his license and registration, Castile told the officer he had a firearm, to which the officer replied 'Don't <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> then'. [...] After saying 'Don't pull it out' twice, the officer shot at Castile seven times.|$|R
6000|$|One last incident, as I bade them good-bye on the corner, {{happy with}} a couple of shillings in their pockets and the certain {{prospect}} of a bed for the night. Lighting a cigarette, I was about to throw away the burning match when the Carter <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> I proffered him the box, but he said, [...] "Never mind, won't waste it, sir." [...] And while he lighted the cigarette I had given him, the Carpenter hurried with the filling of his pipe {{in order to have a}} go at the same match.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} every {{pool of water}} vainly, until, as the long {{twilight}} came on, he discovered a solitary fish, {{the size of a}} minnow, in such a pool. He plunged his arm in up to the shoulder, but it eluded him. He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with both hands and stirred up the milky mud at the bottom. In his excitement he fell in, wetting himself to the waist. Then the water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish, and he was compelled to wait until the sediment had settled.|$|E
60|$|In the {{reaction}} that followed he realized how high his hopes had been. It {{seemed as if}} Fortune had but played with him, had put the prize almost within his grasp and then as he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> had snatched it away to tease and mock him. He could have cried with vexation and disappointment had he been of the weeping kind. As it was he swallowed a lump in his throat and leaned forward to peer through the brush for one last glimpse of the royal animal.|$|E
5000|$|In the 13th century Old Norse Thiðrekssaga, Hildibrand defeats his son, Alibrand. Alibrand {{offers his}} sword in {{surrender}} but attempts to strike Hildibrand as he <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Hildibrand taunts him {{for having been}} taught to fight by a woman, but then asks if he is Alibrand and they are reconciled.|$|R
50|$|Currently readying for a May 2015 {{release of}} his second Punjabi film titled Gadaar - The Traitor {{starring}} Harbhajan Mann, Manpneet Grewal, Girija Shankar, Ashish Duggal and others. He dreams for a living and his scripts are original subjects combining a personal vision {{with the requirements of}} a modern and entertaining film thus ensuring a global <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} a man (Adam Rodriguez), later to be {{known to be a}} worker of 50 Cent, calling from Los Angeles, California to San Juan, Puerto Rico where Yandel is. It is a job {{offering}} when at first he rejects but 50 Cent convinces him. Then it shows that 50 Cent is a common person in a bank and that's where the song starts. Later it is shown that Yandel, with Wisin, in a car driving to the bank. Then they rob the bank with T-Pain. They take a hostage which Yandel is found for. They take her to a van and blindfold the girl. They leave her somewhere and she is questioned by the police. Wisin, Yandel, 50 Cent & T-Pain, with money bags, are shown walking away from the van that they blew up. Later the same girl has memories of Yandel in a laundry shop where she drops her laundry she <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but then someone else also <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> it is Yandel. The Music video ends showing that the music video was a music video itself.|$|R
60|$|It was a voice. It {{came from}} above. Was it an angel's voice? Not altogether. It was Albert's. The boy was leaning {{out of a}} window some six feet higher up the castle wall. George, his eyes by now grown used to the darkness, {{perceived}} that the stripling gesticulated as one having some message to impart. Then, glancing to one side, he saw what looked {{like some kind of}} a rope swayed against the wall. He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The thing was not a rope: it was a knotted sheet.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he {{disappeared}} again. From {{the lip of}} the cave I saw him descending. All the horde had gathered outside and in awed silence was looking on. As he descended, the more timid ones scurried for their caves. I could see old Marrow-Bone tottering along as fast as he could. Red-Eye sprang out from the wall and finished the last twenty feet through the air. He landed alongside a mother who was just beginning the ascent. She screamed with fear, and the two-year-old child that was clinging to her released its grip and rolled at Red-Eye's feet. Both he and the mother <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and he got it. The next moment the frail little body had whirled through the air and shattered against the wall. The mother ran to it, caught it up in her arms, and crouched over it crying.|$|E
60|$|Andrew, however, {{was feeling}} the strain. His injured hand was painful, the stones {{he had to}} lift were heavy, his arms and back ached; but he meant to hold out, for the gap between roof and pillar was getting narrow. He had raised a {{ponderous}} piece of rock and was holding {{it up to a}} man who <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> when there was a smashing sound above and a dark mass rushed past him. The tunnel echoed with a crash, and Andrew received a violent blow on his head. The pain of it turned him dizzy, but he heard a clamor of voices and harsh warning cries. They were followed by a smashing of timber; he saw two or three props crush in; and then half the lights went out and he felt the water washing past his boots.|$|E
50|$|After {{the player}} manages to survive through {{numerous}} challenges, many {{reminiscent of the}} challenges faced by Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, he collects several artifacts, presumably of great value. At {{the very end of}} the game, he finds the ultimate artifact of the pyramid. However, as he <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> the pyramid collapses around him and the game ends.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll get it,' exclaimed {{the ever}} ready Dickie; {{and in another}} moment he had mounted the parapet and was <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Whether it were Gertrude's shriek, or the natural recoil away from the {{grasping}} hand, or that his hold {{on the side of}} the adjoining pinnacle was insecure, he lost his balance, and with a sudden cry, vanished from their eyes.|$|R
60|$|As {{they started}} to {{straighten}} up their cabin, Clayton and his wife simultaneously noticed {{the corner of a}} piece of paper protruding from beneath the door of their quarters. As Clayton stooped to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> he was amazed to see it move further into the room, and then he realized that it was being pushed inward by someone from without.|$|R
60|$|So, thinks I, I'll go {{and search}} them rooms. Upstairs {{the hall was}} dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else {{take care of that}} money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their {{footsteps}} coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.|$|E
6000|$|Mumbles had {{finished}} his after-dinner nap {{and was now}} awakening to activity. This dog's size, according to the Major, was [...] "about 4x6; but you can't tell which is the 4 and which the 6." [...] He was distressingly shaggy. Patsy could find the stump of his tail only by careful search. Seldom were both eyes uncovered by hair at the same time. But, as his new mistress had said, he was a wise little dog for one who had only known {{the world for a}} few months, and his brain was exceedingly alert. After yawning at the fire he rubbed his back against the Major's legs, sat up beside Patsy and looked at her from one eye pleadingly. Next he trotted over to Uncle John. The big white handkerchief attracted him and one corner hung down {{from the edge of the}} reclining chair. Mumbles sat up and <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but could not quite get it in his teeth. So he sat down and thought it over, and presently made a leap so unexpectedly agile that Patsy roared with merriment and even the Major grinned. Uncle John, aroused, sat up and found the puppy rolling on the floor and fighting the handkerchief as if it had been some deadly foe.|$|E
60|$|The third {{definition}} {{is by far}} the most precise; indeed as regards clearness it leaves nothing to be desired. But a great difficulty is caused by the temporal contiguity of cause and effect which the definition asserts. No two instants are contiguous, since the time-series is compact; hence either the cause or the effect or both must, if the {{definition is}} correct, endure for a finite time; indeed, by the wording of the definition it is plain that both are assumed to endure for a finite time. But then we are faced with a dilemma: if the cause is a process involving change within itself, we shall require (if causality is universal) causal relations between its earlier and later parts; moreover, it would seem that only the later parts can be relevant to the effect, since the earlier parts are not contiguous to the effect, and therefore (by the definition) cannot influence the effect. Thus we shall be led to diminish the duration of the cause without limit, and however much we may diminish it, there will still remain an earlier part which might be altered without altering the effect, so that the true cause, as defined, will not have been <b>reached,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> will be observed that the definition excludes plurality of causes. If, on the other hand, the cause is purely static, involving no change within itself, then, in the first place, no such cause is to be found in nature, and in the second place, it seems strange--too strange to be accepted, in spite of bare logical possibility--that the cause, after existing placidly for some time, should suddenly explode into the effect, when it might just as well have done so at any earlier time, or have gone on unchanged without producing its effect. This dilemma, therefore, is fatal to the view that cause and effect can be contiguous in time; if there are causes and effects, they must be separated by a finite time-interval τ, as was assumed in the above interpretation of the first definition.|$|E
50|$|On {{the cusp}} of puberty, Jamie {{develops}} an unhealthy obsession with girls. Thus, when his parents go away {{on a business trip}} and leave the attractive psychology student Sandy O'Reilly to babysit him, he falls completely in love with her. His lust for her is first revealed when he drops his napkin at the dinner table and when he <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> he uses the opportunity to look at Sandy's panties.|$|R
50|$|After much searching, Kennedy finally discovers Reilly's {{body on the}} {{exterior}} platform of a car, but the corpse slips off the train as he is <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When he returns to {{what should have been}} his berth, he finds an imposter (Leif Erickson) claiming to be him and in possession of his ticket. The conductor is summoned. Fellow passenger Jeffers vouches for Kennedy and gives him a spare ticket to share his compartment.|$|R
60|$|All the while, they pursued her. She {{had never}} had such a passionate love of the {{beautiful}} things about her. Sitting {{on top of the}} tram-car, at evening, sometimes school was swept away as she saw a magnificent sky settling down. And her breast, her very hands, clamoured for the lovely flare of sunset. It was poignant almost to agony, her <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> She almost cried aloud seeing the sundown so lovely.|$|R
5000|$|There are two legends {{concerning}} {{the formation of}} the long ridge of rocks known as Filey Brigg. According to one of them it was built by the Devil, who, having lost his hammer in the sea, <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with his hand but caught a fish instead. The Devil exclaimed, [...] "Ah! Dick!", which accounts for the name of the fish - haddock. Since then Filey Brigg has carried the marks of the Devil's grasp on its shoulders.|$|E

5000|$|On April 3, 1924, in {{the married}} couple's bedroom, Annan shot Kalstedt in the back. According to her initial story, {{they had been}} {{drinking}} wine Kalstedt had brought over, and got into an argument. There was a gun {{on the bed and}} both <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but Beulah got it first and shot Kalstedt while he was putting on his coat and hat. She played a foxtrot record, [...] "Hula Lou", over and over for about four hours as she sat drinking cocktails and watching Kalstedt die. She then called her husband to say she had killed a man who had [...] "tried to make love" [...] to her.|$|E

2500|$|The second, {{more famous}} {{instance}} involved Winnicott placing a spatula (tongue depressor) within the child's <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> {{him to play}} with. Winnicott considered that [...] "if he is just an ordinary baby he will notice the attractive object...and he will <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>it....</b> {{in the course of}} a little while he will discover what he wants to do with it". From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for transference.|$|R
60|$|At this {{critical}} moment {{they heard a}} noise behind them, and, glancing back, beheld their dogs careering homeward, with the empty sledge swinging wildly in the rear. Cheenbuk looked at Gartok, and then both looked at the bear. Apparently the ridge prevented the distant sound from <b>reaching</b> <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> did not move.|$|R
