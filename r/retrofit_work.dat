40|$|ABSTRACT: The State Highway 3 Cobham Bridge in Wanganui was {{assessed}} for its performance in earthquakes, {{and ability to}} provide access for traffic across the Wanganui River after large events. Detailed assessment of the bridge using a displacement based assessment approach enabled a cost effective strengthening design to be developed. The <b>retrofit</b> <b>works</b> comprised strengthening the plastic hinge region {{of two of the}} piers for shear and ground improvement at the abutments to reduce damage from liquefaction and consequent lateral spreading. Ground improvement comprised an optimum combination of stone columns, vertical drains, and ground replacement. Stone columns and wick drains were installed in a triangular shaped area to economically protect each abutment. The stone columns strengthen the ground against instability and provide drainage in earthquakes. The vertical drains facilitate dissipation of pore pressures generated during stone column vibro-compaction and provide additional drainage capacity during earthquakes. The stone columns were constructed by drilling temporarily cased holes and compacting gravel in place using vibration of the casing and a central probe, as the casing is withdrawn, to maximise drainage capacity and strength. The strengthening measures adopted were designed to provide an acceptable level of performance, that is quick reinstatement of access after major events, cost effectively. ...|$|R

The axial load is kept constant at 30 % of plain concrete axial capacity to model the gravity load. The lateral load given is according to ACI 374. 1 - 05 quasi-static cyclic loading protocol. Lateral load resistance is recorded throughout the cyclic loading, and plotted against the corresponding lateral displacement. Results show that specimens with smaller volumetric ratio of confining element suffered brittle failure (poor ductility). Specimens with adequate confinement show good deformability and ductile failure. In conclusion, the retrofitting method by providing external steel angle collars is very promising...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} method for {{measuring}} air leakage {{is to use}} a single blower door to pressurize and/or depressurize the test unit. In detached housing, the test unit is the entire home and the single blower door measures air leakage to the outside.

However, two significant limitations of the total leakage measurement in attached housing are: for <b>retrofit</b> <b>work,</b> if total leakage is assumed to be all to the outside, the energy benefits of air sealing can be significantly over predicted; for new construction, the total leakage values may result in failing to meet an energy-based house tightness program criterion.

40|$|The {{drive to}} reduce carbon {{emissions}} from domestic housing {{has led to}} a recent shift of focus from new-build to retrofit. However there are two significant differences. Firstly more work is needed to retrofit existing housing to the same energy efficiency standards as new-build. Secondly the remaining length of service life is potentially shorter. This implies that the capital expenditure – both financial and carbon - of retrofit may be disproportionate to the savings gained over the remaining life. However the Government’s definition of low and zero carbon continues to exclude the capital (embodied) carbon costs of construction, which has resulted in a lack of data for comparison. The paper addresses this gap by reporting the embodied carbon costs of retrofitting four individual pilot properties in Rampton Drift, part of an Eco-Town Demonstrator Project in Cambridgeshire. Through collecting details of the materials used and their journeys from manufacturer to site, the paper conducts a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle carbon assessment for each property. The embodied carbon figures are calculated using a software tool being developed by the Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Cambridge. The key aims are to assess the real embodied carbon costs of retrofit of domestic properties, and to test the new tool; it is hoped that the methodology, the tool and the specific findings will be transferable to other projects.

Consequently, it was estimated that the retrofitted building would secure its operability as a municipal government office, even after the largest earthquake.

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory studied 8 {{homes in}} the mixed-humid climate, 4 with vented attics and 4 with sealed attics. ORNL wanted to {{understand}} the moisture performance of the sealed attic and how it affected the interior environment. We found that the attic and interior of sealed attic homes were more humid than the attic and interior observed in vented attic homes. This {{is due to the}} lack of ventilation in the sealed attic. Historically attics have been vented to dehumidify the attic and interior of the home. A sealed attic design greatly reduces the venting potential and thus this drying pathway and can cause elevated interior moisture over a vented attic home. Despite the elevated attic and interior moisture in the sealed attic homes, so far no mold or material degradation has been found. The roof sheathing moisture content has stayed below 20 %, indicating low potential for material degradation. Also the relative humidity at the roof sheathing has stayed within the ASHRAE 160 design criteria except for a short time during the 2011 / 2012 winter. This was due to a combination of the sealed attic design (minimal venting to the outside) and the duct work not being operated in the attic which usually provides a dehumidification pathway. It was also found that when the humidity was controlled using the HVAC system, it resulted in 7 % more cooling energy consumption. In the mixed-humid climate this reduces the cost effectiveness of the sealed attic design as a solution for bringing ducts into a semi-conditioned space. Because of this we are recommending the other alternatives be used to bringing ducts into the conditioned space in both new construction and <b>retrofit</b> <b>work</b> in the mixed-humid climate...|$|E

Around 25 % of UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from domestic housing, a sizeable portion that will need to be reduced to achieve an 80 % cut in emissions by 2050. A recent survey by homeless charity Shelter found that four in ten British homes are not up to standard, and suffer from problems such as persistent damp and condensation which in turn can impact negatively on people’s health.
