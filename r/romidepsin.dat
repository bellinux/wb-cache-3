500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of small, usually heritable, {{molecular}} modifications—or [...] "tags"—that bind DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects. Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in development include valproic acid, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and <b>romidepsin.</b> DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in development include decitabine, azacytidine, and hydralazine.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>romidepsin</b> is uniformly {{associated}} with adverse effects. In clinical trials, {{the most common}} were nausea and vomiting, fatigue, infection, loss of appetite, and blood disorders (including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia).

50|$|<b>Romidepsin</b> {{acts as a}} prodrug {{with the}} {{disulfide}} bond undergoing reduction within the cell to release a zinc-binding thiol. The thiol reversibly interacts with a zinc atom in the binding pocket of Zn-dependent histone deacetylase to block its activity. Thus it is an HDAC inhibitor. Many HDAC inhibitors are potential treatments for cancer through the ability to epigenetically restore normal expression of tumor suppressor genes, which may result in cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis.|$|E

50|$|Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as {{valproic acid}} (VPA), vorinostat, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are {{effective}} in targeting acute myeloid leukemia with the AML1-ETO fusion protein. The HDAC inhibitors are known to induce apoptosis through accumulation of DNA damage, inhibition of DNA repair, and activation of caspases. These inhibitors are extra sensitive to the fusion proteins. Vorinostat has been proven to cause a greater accumulation of DNA damage in fusion protein expressing cells and is directly correlated with the reduction of DNA repair enzymes (Garcia et al., 2008). <b>Romidepsin,</b> a drug in phase two clinical trials, has demonstrated higher efficacy in patients with AML1-ETO fusion protein leukemia (Odenike et al., 2008).

50|$|HDAC inhibitors {{have been}} show to cause antidepressant-like effects in animals. Research shows that {{antidepressants}} make epigenetic changes to gene transcription thus altering signaling. These gene expression changes {{are seen in}} the BDNF, CRF, GDNF, and GR genes (see above sections). Histone modifications are consistently reported to alter chromatin structure during depression by the removal of acetyl groups, and to reverse this, HDAC inhibitors work by countering the removal of acetyl groups on histones. HDAC inhibitors can decrease gene transcription in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that is increased as a characteristic of depression. In animal studies of depression, short-term administration of HDAC inhibitors reduced the fear response in mice, and chronic administration produced antidepressant-like effects. This suggests that long-term treatment of HDAC inhibitors help {{in the treatment of}} depression. Some studies show that administration of HDAC inhibitors like Vorinostat and <b>Romidepsin,</b> hematologic cancer drugs, can augment the effect of other antidepressants. These HDAC inhibitors may become antidepressants in the future, but clinical trials must further assess their efficacy in humans.|$|E

Vorinostat (SAHA) was approved in 2006 for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) that have failed previous treatments. A second HDI, Istodax (<b>romidepsin),</b> was approved in 2009 for patients with CTCL. The exact mechanisms by which the compounds may work are unclear, but epigenetic pathways are proposed. In addition, a clinical trial is studying valproic acid effects on the latent pools of HIV in infected persons. [...] HDIs are currently being investigated as chemosensitizers for cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or in association with DNA methylation inhibitors based on in vitro synergy.

5000|$|Several avenues to {{epigenetic}} {{treatment of}} diabetic retinopathy have been studied. One {{approach is to}} inhibit the methylation of the Sod2 and MMP-9. The DNMT inhibitors 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine have both {{been approved by the}} FDA for the treatment of other conditions, and studies have examined the effects of those compounds on diabetic retinopathy, where they seem to inhibit these methylation patterns with some success at reducing symptoms. The DNA methylation inhibitor Zebularine has also been studied, although results are currently inconclusive. A second approach is to attempt to reduce the miRNAs observed at elevated levels in retinopathic patients, although the exact role of those miRNAs is still unclear. The Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, Vorinostat, and <b>Romidepsin</b> have also been the subject of experimentation for this purpose, with some limited success. [...] The possibility of using Small Interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, to target the miRNAs mentioned above has been discussed, but there are currently no known methods to do so. This method is somewhat hindered by the difficulty involved in delivering the siRNAs to the affected tissues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{intensive}} effort, currently {{no effective}} anti-Ras therapies have successfully reached clinical application. Previous {{studies suggest that}} the histone deacetylatse (HDAC) inhibitor <b>romidepsin,</b> which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple malignancies, can block Ras-dependent signaling and growth transformation. These studies suggest that mutational activation of Ras may be a useful biomarker for sensitivity to <b>romidepsin</b> and that the anti-tumor activity of this HDAC inhibitor may involve inhibition of Ras effector-mediated signaling. Results To rigorously assess <b>romidepsin</b> as an antagonist of Ras, we utilized two well-characterized cell models for Ras transformation. We found that <b>romidepsin</b> blocked the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and RIE- 1 epithelial cells transformed by all three Ras isoforms. However, <b>romidepsin</b> treatment also blocked growth transformation caused by other oncoproteins (B-Raf and ErbB 2 /Neu), suggesting that <b>romidepsin</b> is not selective for Ras. We also observed striking differences in romidepsin-mediated growth inhibition between transformed NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts compared to RIE- 1 epithelial cells, suggesting that the mechanism by which <b>romidepsin</b> blocks transformation is dependent on cellular context. Finally, we found that <b>romidepsin</b> did not inhibit Ras activation of the ERK and AKT effector pathways in NIH 3 T 3 and RIE- 1 cells, suggesting that <b>romidepsin</b> does not directly antagonize Ras. Conclusion Taken together, our results suggest that <b>romidepsin</b> is not selective for Ras-transformed cells and that the anti-tumor activity of <b>romidepsin</b> is not due to direct inhibition of Ras function. </p...|$|E

Two dose cohorts were studied in the phase I component of the trial (13. 3 and 17. 7 mg/m 2 /d). Patients in the phase II component were treated with intravenous <b>romidepsin</b> at a dosage of 13. 3 mg/m 2 /day on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. Eight patients were treated on the phase I component. A similar <b>romidepsin</b> pharmacokinetic profile was demonstrated between patients receiving EIAEDs to those not receving EIAEDs. Thirty-five patients with glioblastoma were accrued to the phase II component. There was no objective radiographic response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8 weeks and only 1 patient had a PFS time ≥ 6 months (PFS 6 = 3 %). To date, 34 patients (97 %) have died, with a median survival duration of 34 weeks.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor <b>romidepsin</b> down-regulates VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) gene expression and abrogates VEGF protein secretion in human epithelial endometriotic cells. Design: In vitro study with human immortalized epithelial endometriotic cells. Setting: University hospital. Patient(s) : Not applicable. Intervention(s) : None. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Real-time reverse-transcriptase {{polymerase chain reaction}} to evaluate VEGF gene expression, immunoblot analysis to evaluate protein expression, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to evaluate VEGF protein secretion into the culture medium. Result(s) : Treatment of 11 z human endometriotic cells with <b>romidepsin</b> statistically significantly inhibited VEGF gene transcription and down-regulated VEGF protein expression.

40|$|Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

The interaction between <b>romidepsin</b> and lenalidomide was evaluated by the Chou–Talalay method, and cell viability and clonogenicity were also evaluated. Apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometry. ER stress, caspase activation, and the AKT, MAPK/ERK, and STAT- 3 pathways were analyzed by Western blot. Combination treatment with <b>romidepsin</b> and lenalidomide had a synergistic effect in Hut- 78 cells and an additive effect in Karpas- 299 cells at 24  hours and did not decrease the viability of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This drug combination induced apoptosis, increased ROS production, and activated caspase- 8, − 9, − 3 and PARP. Apoptosis was associated with increased hallmarks of ER stress and activation of UPR sensors and was mediated by dephosphorylation of the AKT, MAPK/ERK, and STAT 3 pathways.

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease that usually affects elderly people. It has a poor prognosis {{and there are}} limited therapies. Since epigenetic alterations are associated with IPF, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors offer a novel therapeutic strategy to address the unmet medical need. This study investigated the potential of <b>romidepsin,</b> an FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, as an anti-fibrotic treatment and evaluated biomarkers of target engagement that may have utility in future clinical trials. The anti-fibrotic effects of <b>romidepsin</b> were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo together with any harmful effect on alveolar type II cells (ATII). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from IPF or control donors was analyzed {{for the presence of}} lysyl oxidase (LOX). In parallel with an increase in histone acetylation, <b>romidepsin</b> potently inhibited fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation and LOX expression.

40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common extracranial {{pediatric}} solid tumor, arising from the embryonic sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest, and is responsible for 15 % of childhood cancer deaths. Although survival rates are good for some patients, those children diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma have survival rates as low as 35 %. Thus, neuroblastoma remains a significant clinical challenge and the development of novel therapeutic strategies is essential. Given that there is widespread epigenetic dysregulation in neuroblastoma, epigenetic pharmacotherapy holds promise as a therapeutic approach. In recent years, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which cause selective activation of gene expression, {{have been shown to be}} potent chemotherapeutics for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Here we examined the ability of the FDA-approved drug <b>Romidepsin,</b> a selective HDAC 1 / 2 inhibitor, to act as a cytotoxic agent in neuroblastoma cells. Treatment with <b>Romidepsin</b> at concentrations in the low nanomolar range induced neuroblastoma cell death through caspase-dependent apoptosis. <b>Romidepsin</b> significantly increased histone acetylation, and significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of the cytotoxic agent 6 -hydroxydopamine, which has been shown to induce cell death in neuroblastoma cells through increasing reactive oxygen species. <b>Romidepsin</b> was also more potent in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, which is an important prognostic marker of poor survival. This study has thus demonstrated that the FDA-approved chemotherapeutic drug <b>Romidepsin</b> has a potent caspase-dependent cytotoxic effect on neuroblastoma cells, whose effects enhance cell death induced by other cytotoxins, and suggests that <b>Romidepsin</b> may be a promising chemotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of neuroblastoma...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:Most {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib or gefitinib, but many EGFR wild type NSCLCs are resistant to TKIs. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} the histone deacetylase inhibitor, <b>romidepsin,</b> in combination with erlotinib, in NSCLC cell lines and xenografts. Methods:For in vitro studies, nine NSCLC cell lines with varying mutation status and histology were treated with erlotinib and <b>romidepsin</b> alone or in combination. 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium assays were performed to determine the concentration that inhibits 50 % (IC 50) value of each drug or the combination. For in vivo studies, NCI-H 1299 xenografts were inoculated subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. <b>Romidepsin</b> and/or erlotinib were injected intraperitoneally after tumors developed and tumor sizes were measured. Results:We found that <b>romidepsin</b> increased the sensitivity of erlotinib synergistically in all nine NSCLC cell lines including EGFR and KRAS wild type cell lines, KRAS mutant cell lines, and TKI resistant EGFR mutant cell lines. This effect was partially due to enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, cotreatment of erlotinib and <b>romidepsin</b> inhibited NCI-H 1299 xenograft growth in athymic nude mice.

40|$|<b>Romidepsin</b> is a cyclic {{molecule}} that inhibits histone deacetylases. It is Food and Drug Administration-approved {{for treatment}} of cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, but its precise mechanism of action against malignant T cells is unknown. To better understand the biological effects of <b>romidepsin</b> in these cells, we exposed PEER and SUPT 1 T-cell lines, and a primary sample from T-cell lymphoma patient (Patient J) to <b>romidepsin.</b> We then examined the consequences in some key oncogenic signaling pathways. <b>Romidepsin</b> displayed IC 50 values of 10. 8, 7. 9 and 7. 0 nM in PEER, SUPT 1 and Patient J cells, respectively. Strong inhibition of histone deacetylases and demethylases, increased production of reactive oxygen species and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential were observed, which {{may contribute to the}} observed DNA-damage response and apoptosis.

40|$|Therapeutic {{responses}} to Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) in many cancers are well described but development {{of resistance to}} HDACi is a major stumbling block. Whether HDACis induce epigenetic reprogramming and how this contributes to relapse is not reported. A CTCL cell line HuT 78, and a CLL cell line MEC 1, were used to develop HDACi resistant clones (RHuT 78 and RMEC 1 respectively) that persistently grow {{in the presence of}} the clinically used HDAC inhibitor <b>Romidepsin.</b> RHuT 78 cells show perturbed trimethylation of histone H 3 lysine K 4 on <b>Romidepsin</b> treatment which linked to higher protein expression levels of the implicated demethylase KDM 5 A. Following on from these experiments, a qRT-PCR epigenetic gene expression array was used to quantify levels of 84 epigenetic gene transcripts in RHuT 78 cells and significantly altered genes were taken forward for further investigation. Studies of gene expression patterns in parental, resistant and ‘drug holiday’ cell lines of both HuT 78 and MEC 1 led to particular interest in HDAC 8, DNMT 3 A and DNMT 3 B. Functional studies showed that HDAC 8 overexpression increased proliferation and resistance of HuT 78 cells to <b>Romidepsin.</b> Parallel observations suggested an increase in proliferation of resistant cell lines cultured {{in the presence of the}} HDACi. This increased proliferation was seen even with lower concentrations of <b>Romidepsin</b> and argues against prolonged monotherapy using HDACis. Significantly, inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases synergised with <b>Romidepsin</b> in a dose and schedule dependent manner, reversing the changes in epigenetic gene expression associated with resistance and causing increased apoptosis in RHuT 78 cells. Taken together this thesis identifies and characterises an unacknowledged contribution of epigenetic reprogramming to drug resistance and provides insights into the effects of <b>Romidepsin</b> on the epigenome that could potentially contribute to HDACi resistance...|$|E

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important targets for epigenetic treatment in cancer cells. <b>Romidepsin</b> is a HDAC inhibitor used in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treatment but possible effects in B-cells lymphoma are not known in detail. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of <b>Romidepsin</b> on the proliferation, differentiation and death of different human B-cell lymphoma cells lines as well as its effects on BCL 6 expression. Cytotoxic effect of <b>Romidepsin</b> was found in some cells lines, while others were resistant to high doses of <b>Romidepsin.</b> Depending on the cell line, treatment with this drug induces cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase, apoptosis and/or differentiation to plasma cells. Interestingly, these effects were accompanied with increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors and BCL 6 mRNA and protein downregulation. Máster en Biología Molecular y Biomedicin...|$|E
