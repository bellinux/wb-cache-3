5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
25|$|V8 models use <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> {{steering}} (as per previous 5 Series generations), however {{rack and}} pinion steering was used for the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.|$|E
5000|$|Ball splines (Ball Spline bearings) are {{a special}} type of linear motion bearing {{that are used}} to provide nearly {{frictionless}} linear motion while allowing the member to transmit torque simultaneously. There are grooves ground {{along the length of the}} shaft (thus forming splines) for the <b>recirculating</b> ground <b>balls</b> to run inside. The outer shell that houses the balls is called a nut rather than a bushing, but is not a nut in the traditional sense—it is not free to rotate about the shaft, but is free to travel up and down the shaft.|$|R
40|$|The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) is a Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (VHTR) to be {{constructed}} near Idaho Falls, Idaho The NGNP is intrinsically safer than current reactors and {{is planned for}} startup ca. 2021 Safety is more prominent {{in the minds of}} the Public and Governing Officials following the nuclear reactor meltdown accidents in Fukushima, Japan The authors propose that the NGNP should be designed with International (IAEA) Safeguards in mind to support export to Non-Nuclear-Weapons States There are two variants of the NGNP design; one using integral Prismatic-shaped fuel assemblies in a fixed core; and one using <b>recirculating</b> fuel <b>balls</b> (or Pebbles) The following presents the infrastructure required to safeguard the NGNP This infrastructure is required to safeguard the Prismatic and Pebble-fueled NGNP (and other HTGR/VHTR) The infrastructure is based on current Safeguards Requirements and Practices implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for similar reactors The authors of this presentation have worked for decades in the area of International Nuclear Safeguards and are recognized experts in this field Presentation for INMM conference in July 2012...|$|R
50|$|In mineral {{processing}} such as ferrous metals ore (e.g. iron, tin, tungsten, tantalum etc.) and nonferrous metals ores (e.g. lead, zinc, gold, silver and industrial sand etc.), high frequency screens have a crucial role. After the ores get comminuted, high frequency screens such as Sepro-Sizetec Screens {{are used as}} a classifier which selects materials size that is small enough to enter the next stage for recovery. For example, the closed grinding circuit (e.g. <b>recirculating</b> network with <b>ball</b> mill). Firstly, it screens out the coarse particles and recirculates {{them back to the}} grinding mill machine. Then, the fine grain material will be unloaded timely, avoiding over crushing caused by re-grinding. The benefits of using high frequency screens in {{mineral processing}} can meet the requirement of fineness easily for recovery and is able to achieve a smaller size separation, reducing capacity needed for comminution stage and overall energy consumption. Hence, improving the grade of the final product and providing a better recovery and screening efficiency.|$|R
25|$|Braking duties were {{handled by}} 11.3-inch discs {{up front and}} drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front {{suspension}} consisted of unequal-length control arms, coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> design.|$|E
25|$|Unusually, two {{different}} steering systems {{were used for}} the E39, depending on the engine. Models with four-cylinder and six-cylinder models use rack and pinion steering, the first time this system has been used in a 5 Series. This system steers {{from the front of the}} axle. Models with V8 engines use <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering, as per the previous generations of 5 Series.|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is short}} and long control arms with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a rear wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.|$|E
50|$|In {{the on-line}} process, the {{cleaning}} body {{moves through the}} tubes with the conveying medium and cleans them by means of its oversize compared to the tube diameter. In the range of diameters of up to 50 mm these cleaning bodies consist of sponge rubber, in larger diameters up {{to the size of}} oil pipelines {{it is a matter of}} scrapers or so-called pigs. Sponge rubber balls are applied mainly for cooling water, like sea, river, or cooling tower water. For the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, specially adapted cleaning bodies are imaginable but the conveying media flows are so weak that off-line processes are employed in most cases. Given the fact that the cleaning bodies are not allowed to remain in the conveying medium they have to be collected after passing through the tubes. In the case of sponge rubber balls this is done through special strainer sections; for scrapers or pigs an outward transfer station is provided. According to the Taprogge process, the sponge rubber balls are re-injected upstream of the system to be cleaned by a corresponding <b>ball</b> <b>recirculating</b> unit whereas the scraper or pig is mostly taken out by hand and re-injected into another collector. Sponge rubber balls therefore safeguard a continuous cleaning while the scraper or pig system is discontinuous.|$|R
25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
2500|$|Volkswagen added a [...] "Super Beetle" [...] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 {{differed}} from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension {{instead of the usual}} torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering gears in model year 1974 and up. The front of the car was stretched [...] to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.|$|E
2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis {{was just as}} {{important}} to the Sting Ray's success. Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball,</b> or [...] "Ball-Race", steering, and a shorter wheelbase. The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved traction. Stopping power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, for an increase in effective braking area. Sintered-metallic linings, segmented for cooling, were again optional. So were finned aluminum drums, which not only provided faster heat dissipation (and thus better fade resistance) but less unsprung weight. Power assist was available with both brake packages. Evolutionary engineering changes included positive crankcase ventilation, a smaller flywheel, and an aluminum clutch housing. A more efficient alternator replaced the old-fashioned generator.|$|E
2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.|$|E

50|$|<b>Recirculating</b> <b>ball,</b> {{also known}} as <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> and nut or worm and sector, is a {{steering}} mechanism commonly found in older automobiles, off-road vehicles, and some trucks. Most newer cars use the more economical {{rack and pinion steering}} instead, but some upmarket manufacturers (such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz) held on to the design until well into the 1990s for the durability and strength inherent in the design. A few, including Chrysler and General Motors, still use this technology in certain models including the Jeep Wrangler.|$|E

50|$|Alongside {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} (as opposed to the <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> system on previous generations), the Pajero also offered a choice of three transmissions; a five speed manual, a four speed INVECS-II automatic and a five speed INVECS-II tiptronic.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in March 1982 with a Ford 1597 cc CVH {{engine and}} Ford four-speed gearbox until 1984, then a Ford {{five-speed}} gearbox from Ford Sierra. From 1986 steering was {{changed from the}} original cam and peg to a Gemmer <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> system.|$|E

50|$|All XK120s had {{independent}} {{torsion bar}} front suspension, semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear, <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering, telescopically adjustable steering column, and all-round 12-inch drum brakes which were prone to fade. Some cars were fitted with Alfin (ALuminium FINned) brake drums to help overcome the fade.|$|E
50|$|Suspension was {{independent}} at {{the front}} by coil springs and with an anti-roll bar was fitted on a rubber mounted cross member. The rear suspension used a live axle and semi elliptic leaf springs. Steering was of the <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> type. Lockheed hydraulic 8 in drum brakes were used.|$|E
5000|$|CNCs can be {{programmed}} to use the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept, {{but that is not}} the normal way they are used today, because hydraulic anti-backlash split nuts and newer forms of leadscrew other than Acme/trapezoidal, such as <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> screws, effectively eliminate the backlash. The axis can move in either direction without the go-past-and-come-back motion.|$|E
5000|$|A {{rack and}} pinion is {{commonly}} found in the steering mechanism of cars or other wheeled, steered vehicles. Rack and pinion provides a less efficient mechanical advantage than other mechanisms such as <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball,</b> but less backlash and greater feedback, or steering [...] "feel". The mechanism may be power-assisted, usually by hydraulic or electrical means.|$|E
50|$|In September 1967 the Diplomat (along {{with its}} less {{expensive}} siblings) received a work-over consisting of rub strips on its flanks, new <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> steering by ZF and heated rear window. At {{the same time}} a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapitän and Admiral models.|$|E
50|$|Rack and pinion {{steering}} may be susceptible to kickback, as the steering rack transmits forces in either direction. A steering box design, such as worm and sector or <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball,</b> {{is much less}} sensitive. Despite this, the other advantages of rack and {{pinion steering}} have led to its almost universal adoption, at least for light automobiles.|$|E

50|$|It was {{the first}} mass {{production}} off-road vehicle to feature a unibody architecture, independent front suspension with coil springs, and is a predecessor to current crossover SUVs which nearly all follow this format; it inspired the Suzuki Vitara. Like the Vitara, the Lada 4x4 uses a <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> truck steering box for off-road reliability. Pickup and emergency van versions are produced by VAZInterService.|$|E
