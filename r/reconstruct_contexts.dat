40|$|International audienceResuming {{suspended}} {{activities is}} fundamental to knowledge work. As activities grow in complexity or fade from memory, they become increasingly difficult to cognitively resume. Motivated by the efficiency of images for cueing autobiographical memory, we conducted two studies of how visual histories of computer-mediated activity might aid users in restoring the mental context of suspended activities. In the first exploratory study we demonstrate that users provided a visual history consisting of small thumbnail images of their desktop can <b>reconstruct</b> detailed mental <b>contexts</b> of earlier computer work. In the second observational study we examine methods and cues that web developers, scientific writers, and graphic designers currently use to restore mental context. We find that participants from all three professions engage in situated sensemaking, <b>reconstructing</b> <b>context</b> by generating stories to explain cues in their documents with implicit meaning, such as sudden changes in writing quality or the shape of blocks of code. We identify characteristics of each activity that influence the information, artifacts, and strategies participants used to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>context.</b> We conclude that visual histories can help users <b>reconstruct</b> mental <b>context,</b> but that challenges remain in designing lightweight image-based cues that help users <b>reconstruct</b> <b>context</b> {{for a range of}} activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a {{word sense disambiguation}} method by <b>reconstructing</b> the <b>context</b> using the correlation between words. Firstly, we figure out the relevance between words though the statistical quantity(co-occurrence frequency, the average distance and the information entropy) from the corpus. Secondly, we see the words that have lager correlation value between ambiguous word than other words in the context as the important words, and use this kind of words to <b>reconstruct</b> the <b>context,</b> then we use the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>context</b> as the new context of the ambiguous words. In the end, we use the method of the sememe co-occurrence data[10] for word sense disambiguation. The experimental results have proved the feasibility of this method...|$|R

30|$|Activity {{theory is}} not the only way to {{approach}} studies of work, but it does provide an efficient way to bootstrap one’s knowledge of a work context. It also helps designers identify specific work activities that deserve more intensive study, as through cognitive task analysis [41, 42]. Most importantly, however, activity theory helps technology developers build relationships with the people whose work they seek to impact: as Kuutti points out, activity theory “…aims at <b>reconstructing</b> <b>contexts</b> in practice so that people are not just objects or subordinate parts, but regain their role as creators” [43]. In this sense, activity theory is complementary with another paradigm that may be useful to proponents of biologically-informed informatics: namely, participatory modeling.|$|R
40|$|In Ambient Assisted Living {{research}} and development, a significant {{effort has been}} dedicated to issues like gathering continuous information at home, standardizing formats {{in order to create}} environments more easily, extracting further information from raw data using different techniques to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>context.</b> An aspect relatively less developed but also important is the design of personalized end-to-end services for technology users being them either primary (older people) or secondary (medical doctors, caregiver, relatives). This paper explores an effort, internal to the EU project GIRAFFPLUS, for designing such services starting from a state-of-the-art continuous data gathering infrastructure.

We discuss {{the presence of the}} various semiotic resources in the course and how they contribute to meaning-making. On the one hand, their careful implementation at the design level is fundamental to issues concerning usability. On the other hand, semiotic resources can be used to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>context</b> and aid comprehension of the texts used in online exercises. We discuss how in both cases they can contribute to enhancing language learning.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{visualization}} of historical architecture. The application of new Computer-Aided- Architectural-Design techniques for visualization on micro computers provides a technique for reconstructing and analyzing architectural objects from the past. The pilot project describes {{a case study in}} which the historical transformation of a town will be analyzed by using three- dimensional CAD models in combination with bitmap textures. The transformation of the historic town will be visualized in a space-time computer model in which bitmap textures enable us to display complex and relatively large architectural objects in detail. This three-dimensional descriptive model allows us to survey and analyze the history of architecture in its <b>reconstructed</b> <b>context.</b> It also provides a medium for researching the dynamics of urban management, since new combinations and arrangements with the individual architectural objects can be created. In this way, a new synthesis of the graphic material can reveal typologies and the architectural ordering system of a town...|$|R

40|$|The {{eighteenth-century}} English writer Malachy Postlethwayt (1707 - 1767) {{served as}} an advisor to multiple Prime Ministers and leading politicians. He also assisted the Royal African Company in its twilight years. During his political career he wrote several publications discussing topics that ranged from the slave trade to Britain’s system of commerce. Despite this his publications on the political economy have been hitherto-unstudied. In this research his major publications; the Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce and Britain’s Commercial Interest, will be given their deserved attention, {{in addition to his}} other published pamphlets and private correspondence. These works will be analysed, evaluated and categorised under the new conceptualisation 'metropolism'. 'Metropolism' was an approach that went beyond economic concerns and was part of a wider strategic goal of empowering metropolitan traders and the British nation relative to its trade and military rivals. This idea will be articulated and detailed through a close examination of Malachy Postlethwayt's published works and supplementary historiographical details. It is then placed within the wider 'mercantilist historiography', which is argued to be faulty and lacking precision in its terms. The many problems existing within this 'mercantilist historiography', from its unstable foundation in the Wealth of nations through to a core lack of unity between mercantilist writers, are addressed and framed with this <b>reconstructed</b> <b>context</b> of the wider 'mercantilist' historiography and intellectual thought...|$|R

40|$|Appeal to {{the causal}} history of items has been, for the {{etiological}} theory of function, {{an argument for}} realism, against a dispositionnal or causal-role account of functions that makes them relative to an explanatory strategy. The reference to selection and, in the end, to fitness - each functional item being characterized by its enhancing-fitness capacity - gave the etiological theory of function its realistic tone : functions are not relative to the scientist's explanatory strategy, or choice of explanans. But using fitness in determining function can only discriminate between functional effects and side-effects, like the classical difference between heart circulating blood and heart's noise. It needs more than considerations about fitness to decide which of these effects is the real function of the item. Sometimes various effects may be ordered {{in a series of}} more and more general effects, one entailing the other (for example : escaping tiger / escaping predator / flight); sometimes, they are necessary related to another (eat food/ chew the meat); sometimes, they have only a contingent and contextual link (hiding from predators / retain heat). Considering those three cases, this paper will examine several methods of functional attribution, that go further than the purely etiological criterium, and through which identification of functions can satisfy the realistic requirement. Those methods are the comparative method, between different populations in different contexts, or between different species; and the reverse engineering strategy, which search a mechanical integration into systems and subsystems of functional effects in an artificially <b>reconstructed</b> <b>context.</b> I will finally wonder if the initial realistic commitment of the etiological theory has to be weakened in order to account for such an epistemological situation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I place {{detailed}} descriptions of Talang Mamak lives in an historically <b>reconstructed</b> <b>context</b> which focuses upon the Talang Mamak's status as debt-bondsmen of the Sultans {{of the kingdom of}} Inderagiri (1509 - 1963). Information about current Talang Mamak lives is presented in the form of five life-histories, or biographies, in which both local issues (development; deforestation; drought; crime; relationships with wider, Muslim, society; debt- management;) and local practices (leadership, rice-farming, rubber cultivation and tapping, cock-fighting, shamanism, marriage, etc) are described in terms of the biographical subjects' experiences of them. Preceding the life-histories and forming a context in which they can be understood, is an historical reconstruction of Minangkabau and Malay settlements along the Inderagiri river, the establishment of the kingdom of Inderagiri and its relationship with the Dutch and the Republic of Indonesia. In this history I re-describe both the well-documented Minangkabau and the as-yet undocumented Talang Mamak, in terms of relationships between rulers and their debt-bondsmen subjects and show that forms of social organisation such as matrilineal inheritance, duolocal residence and bride-price were enforced, by rulers, upon their debt-bondsmen subjects as a means of maintaining and manipulating social inequalities. After the five life-histories, by way of a conclusion, I suggest that the `culture' of many isolated, non-Muslim groups {{on both sides of the}} Straits of Melaka, including Talang Mamak and Kubu in Sumatra, and Semai and Temuan in Malaysia, can be best understood in terms of their economic relationships with Malay and Minangkabau rulers and recent changes to these ties introduced by modern nation-states. Using this perspective I reject the label `Proto- Malay' which has been customarily used to describe isolated non-Muslim populations in Sumatra, such as Talang Mamak, and in Malaysia, such as Semai, in terms of so-called ethnic characteristics. I propose that what these groups of people have in common is not an ascribed ethnicity but rather similar historical relationships with Muslim kingdoms who they served as debt-bondsmen...|$|R

30|$|The {{simulation}} of moving sources {{is of great}} importance in many audio sound applications, including musical applications, where moving sources {{can be used to}} generate special effects inducing novel auditory experiences. Motion of instruments while they are being played can also subtly affect the sound, and hence the expressiveness of the performance. Wanderley et al. [1] have described, for example, that the motion of the clarinet follows specific trajectories {{depending on the type of}} music played, independently of the player. Although the effect of this motion on sound has not yet been clearly established, it probably contributes to the rendering and should be taken into account in attempts to synthesize musical sounds. Virtual reality is another field, where moving sources play an important role. To simulate motion, the speed and trajectories are crucial to creating realistic acoustical environments, and developing signal processing methods for <b>reconstructing</b> these <b>contexts</b> is a great challenge.|$|R
