5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low circulation. While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had {{a circulation of}} 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be <b>read</b> <b>by</b> many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was <b>read</b> <b>by</b> thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.|$|E
