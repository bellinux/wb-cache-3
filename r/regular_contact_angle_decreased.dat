To access the final edited and published work see [URL] simultaneous spreading and evaporation of droplets of aqueous trisiloxane (super-spreader) solutions onto a hydrophobic substrate has been studied both experimentally, using a video-microscopy technique, and theoretically. The experiments {{have been carried out}} over a wide range of surfactant concentration, temperature and relative humidity. Similar to pure liquids, four different stages have been observed: the initial one corresponds to spreading till the <b>contact</b> <b>angle,</b> , reaches the value of the static advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle,</b> θad. Duration of this stage is rather short and the evaporation during this stage can be neglected. The evaporation is essential during next three stages. The next stage after the spreading, which is referred to below as the first stage, takes place at constant perimeter and ends when  reaches the static receding <b>contact</b> <b>angle,</b> θr.

The examination of wettability of the copoly-mer surfaces showed that the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> of water on the hydrophobic surfaces is an increasing linear function of styrene content in the copolymer. Cell adhesion to the unwettable surfaces is low (within 2 - 4 %). A novel method of modification of the styrene copolymer surfaces was used to render these sur-faces suitable for cell attachment. The modification consists of sulfonation of the surfaces with sulfur trioxide at the gas/solid interface. The <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> of sulfonated copolymer surfaces is a decreasing linear function of styrene content in the copolymer. The <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> <b>decreases</b> due to the increased number of highly hydrophilic sulfonic groups bonded to styrene.
