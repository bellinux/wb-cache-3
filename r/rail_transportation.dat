5|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>transportation</b> to Coney Island {{had been}} {{available}} since 1864. The Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad {{was the first}} steam railroad to Coney Island. It ran from Fifth Avenue and 36th Street {{in what is now}} Sunset Park, to its West End Terminal, at the present-day Coney Island Terminal's location, along what is now the right-of-way of the West End Line. The nearby Culver Depot, along the Atlantic Ocean waterfront near the site of the present-day West Eighth Street station, served the Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway (now the Brighton Line) and Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (now the Culver Line). Other <b>rail</b> <b>transportation</b> included the Manhattan Beach Railroad; the Sea Beach Railroad; the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad; and Long Island City via the Long Island Rail Road.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>transportation</b> in {{the village}} began in 1880 with the small Whitson's Station on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad); the station was rebuilt by Walter Law in 1906 {{in the style of}} his Briarcliff Lodge, with Mission style {{furniture}} and rugs. The old station was moved to Millwood, New York around that time to become its station; it fell out of use and was demolished May 9, 2012, although plans exist {{for the construction of a}} replica. Law's Briarcliff station became the public library in 1959.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the characteristics of}} evaluating synergy of China’s <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system. According to Delphi method, an evaluation indicator system of synergy of the <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system is established and the system is in accordance with railway development strategies and synergic targets. Besides, this article builds up an evaluating model for synergy of China’s <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system and conducts an empirical study with statistical data from 1995 to 2013. The results indicate {{that there is an}} increasing tendency toward the synergy degree of the railway freight system, with a slow growth before the year 2002, and then has a sustained and rapid growth until 2010 as the trends become smooth. The synergy degree of the <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system in 2013 has increased nearly 34 times than 1996 from 0. 016810995 to 0. 57142183. This article concludes that indicators such as synergy in structure, transportation, organization, management, and information have made an outstanding contribution to the synergy degree of the <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNetwork Design Problem (NDP) {{is one of}} the {{important}} problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems. In general, decision making in <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> has three main levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. In the field of <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> planning, MCND occurs in all levels of decision making such as car blocking, train makeup, and empty car distribution. This paper presents a review of MCND problems modeling, their applications in <b>rail</b> freight <b>transportation</b> planning, and solution methods which have been developed to solve them...|$|R

5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and <b>rail</b> <b>transportation.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light <b>rail</b> <b>transportation,</b> but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used forms of medium distance transport in Hyderabad include government owned services such as light railways and buses, as well as privately operated taxis and auto rickshaws. Bus services operate from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station in the city centre and carry over 130 million passengers daily across the entire network. Hyderabad's light <b>rail</b> <b>transportation</b> system, the Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS), is a three line suburban rail service used by over 160,000 passengers daily. Complementing these government services are minibus routes operated by Setwin (Society for Employment Promotion & Training in Twin Cities). Intercity rail services also operate from Hyderabad; the main, and largest, station is Secunderabad Railway Station, which serves as Indian Railways' South Central Railway zone headquarters and a hub for both buses and MMTS light rail services connecting Secunderabad and Hyderabad. Other major railway stations in Hyderabad are Hyderabad Deccan Station, Kacheguda Railway Station, Begumpet Railway Station, Malkajgiri Railway Station and Lingampally Railway Station. The Hyderabad Metro, a new rapid transit system, is {{to be added to}} the existing public transport infrastructure and is scheduled to operate by 2018.|$|E
