40|$|For various {{advantages}} including better {{utilization of}} radio spectrum (through frequency reuse), lower mobile transmit power requirements, and smaller and cheaper base station equipment, future wireless mobile multimedia networks {{are likely to}} adopt micro/picocellular architectures. A consequence of using small cell sizes is the increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> handoffs as mobiles move between cells during the holding times of calls. In a network supporting multimedia services, the increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> handoffs not only increases the signaling load on the network, but makes {{it very difficult for}} the network to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) promised to a call at setup or admission time. This paper describes an adaptive QoS handoff priority scheme which reduces the probability of call handoff failures in a mobile multimedia network with a micro/picocellular architecture. The scheme exploits the ability of most multimedia traffic types to adapt and trade off QoS with changes in the amount of bandwidth used. In this way, calls can trade QoS received for fewer handoff failures. The call level and packet level performance of the handoff scheme are studied analytically for a homogeneous network supporting a mix of wide-band and narrow-band calls. Comparisons are made to the performance of the nonpriority handoff scheme and the well-known guard-channel handoff scheme...|$|E

Attrition <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> center agents is a common issue in many call centers and the practice of Taylorism in call center has often been cited as the possible cause. However, there have been no authoritative studies done in this area that address the Singaporean market specifically.

The second Hypothesis of the paper is the practice of good Human Resource Management strategy can serve to relieve the impact of Taylorism in the attrition rate of Singaporean call center agents. The testing these hypotheses are conducted by using survey that was conducted through the administration of a 18 questions questionnaire that was distributed to 100 Singaporean call center agents and this information is supplemented by interviews conducted with the call center managers of 3 companies. The call center agents are selected from 3 call centers based in Singapore.

Here, we present two intelligent paging strategies for third generation PCSN. They are termed as sequential intelligent paging (SIP) and parallel-o-sequential intelligent paging (PSIP). Both are intelligent {{in the sense that}} cell(s) to be paged in a cycle are determined from the occupancy probability vector. Unlike the conventional blanket paging where all cells in a location area are polled at a time, in SIP (PSIP) one cell (a group of cells) is polled at a time. We compare the proposed methods with the conventional approach (such as GSM) in respect of signaling load, polling cost, delay, and discovery rate of mobile terminals. The proposed schemes lead to a decrease in paging signaling load at the cost of some extra processing power. When high intensity traffic is expected, PSIP is preferred to other paging schemes. However, when <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> arrival is low, SIP performs better when paging cost per cycle is the criterion for choosing a particular scheme of paging.

AimsWe aimed to evaluate the temporal trends between 2002 and 2010 in STEMI management and time delays in an eastern region of France (Cote d’Or). MethodsAll consecutive patients admitted for a first STEMI in the RICO survey (Observatoire des Infarctus de Côte d’Or) from 1 st January 2002 to 31 st december 2010 have been included. We analysed trends in pre-hospital and hospital management times and reperfusion. Results 4114 STEMI patients were included over the study period. Mean age and GRACE risk score increased from 2002 to 2010 (64 to 67 y, p= 0, 001 and 152 to 155 p= 0, 049). At symptom onset, {{there was an increase}} in the rate of patients who called the emergency number (dial 15) and a decrease in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> to GP as first medical contact (from 24. 8 to 39. 4 % and from 57. 1 to 34. 2 %, respectively). However, prehospital times including patient time (from onset of symptoms to call for medical seeking) remained stable over time. There was a significant difference in time to first medical contact according to age, with patients aged under 50 years getting help on average 40 to 100 minutes earlier than patients aged over 50 years. (p= 0. 019). The average time from first medical contact to reperfusion decreased significantly from 339 minutes in 2002 to 239 minutes in 2010 (p= 0. 009). Over the study period, there was an inversion in the distribution of reperfusion strategies, with a decrease in fibrinolysis and an increase in primary PCI (from 35 % to 27 % and from 23. 1 to 36. 7 %, respectively). The rate of patients without acute reperfusion dropped from 41, 9 to 36, 3 % (p< 0, 001).

40|$|M. Tech. (Electrical Engineering) Abstract: Wireless {{communications}} {{have experienced}} massive development remarkably {{in the past}} decade. Networks such as global system for mobile communications (GSM) and universal mobile telecommunication service (UMTS) has enjoyed enormous patronization, hence leading to massive mobile network congestion. The problem of network congestion is a network managerial issue that affects the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by a network. Hence for the sustainability of the system, {{there is a need}} to fully manage the radio resources during peak and off peak periods. Call Admission Control (CAC) schemes are constantly being used extensively in managing mobile network congestion. CAC is an approach that can provide credible QoS by regulating the number of connections into the cellular network thereby allowing good use of the radio resources, reducing network congestions, interference and other QoS problems. Network resources cannot be available for all users at all times especially during busy hour traffic. Hence, these resources require effective and efficient allocation so that more subscribers are being allowed to use the network irrespective of the network traffic at a particular reference time. Mobile network congestion can be controlled by suppressing the mobile network traffic demand. The traffic demand varies proportionally with average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> arrival and the average duration of the calls. Hence marginalizing the average call duration will minimize traffic load, thereby reducing network congestion. Some network users due to their lifestyle of being affluent or business demands, holds on to a particular channel during long duration of calls at the detriment of other network users. CAC scheme cannot solve congestion problems due to the selfishness of these particular sets of users. Here, the combination of a channel reservation CAC scheme with Call Duration Control (CDC) scheme was proposed, in which users that have stayed over a predetermined period in the network will be served a termination notice so as to make the channel available for new users. The motive is to provide the available channels to accommodate more users. A simulation-based approach was used to model the combination of the two schemes and the combination produces good results in reducing the congestion menace. The network type deployed in the research is GSM. The result of the CAC/CDC combination schemes were compared to the result of the ordinary CAC schemes in order to verify the impact of the [...] ...|$|E

For the plan-b (30 paisa/min), profit is about 156 to 158 million per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up to 160 million and during morning, it reduces to 150 million. For the plan-c (50 paisa/ 2 min), profit is about 90 to 95 million per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up to 100 million and during morning, it reduces to 80 million. For the plan-d (3 rupees/ 10 min), profit is about 120 to 130 million per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up to 140 million and during morning, it reduces to 100 million. Similarly, profit of the second company for plan-a (1 paisa/s) is about 165 to 170 million per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up to 175 million and during morning, it reduces to 160 million. For the plan-b (30 paisa/min), profit is about 145 to 148 million per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up to 150 million and during morning, it reduces to 140 million. For the plan-c (50 paisa/ 2 min), profit is about 75 to 78 million per hour, but at night time, the profit arises up to 82 million and during morning, it reduces to 70 million.
