Practical iterative computations show that the station coordinates can be converged to about 1 cm, but there will be a slight discrepancy of the longitudinal components computed by various analysis centers or in different years. There are several factors, one of which is the shift of the right ascension of the Moon, caused by the orientation deviation of the adopted lunar ephemeris, which can make the longitudinal components of all <b>observing</b> <b>stations</b> rotate together along the longitudinal direction with same angle. Additionally, the frame of selenocentric coordinates is stable, but a variation or adjustment of lunar third-degree gravitational coefficients will cause a simultaneous shift along the reflectors' longitudes or rotation around the Y axis...|$|R
