40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Sept. 25, 2014 - Sept. 25, 2016 This study investigated carbon dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a steep, forested catchment in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon, USA. Water samples were collected monthly from a headwater stream and well network during baseflow conditions from July to December 2013 and again in March 2014. We also sampled during one fall storm event, collecting pre-storm, <b>rising</b> <b>leg,</b> and extended high flow samples. The well network {{is located at the}} base of Watershed 1 (WS 1) of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest and spans the full width of the floodplain (14 m) along a 29 m reach of stream. We measured pH, temperature, water level, major anions, major cations, DOC, DIC, and total alkalinity. Flow paths, travel time to wells and hydraulic conductivity were available from previous studies. During baseflow periods, hyporheic DOC decreased with median travel time through the subsurface. DIC concentrations increased with travel time, but the magnitude of this increase in DIC was too large to be explained by metabolism of stream water DOC. This suggests that there are additional sources of DIC and/or DOC in the subsurface, and that hyporheic DIC concentrations are not well linked to stream-source DOC. The most likely supplemental sources of DIC to hyporheic water are soil CO₂ and microbial respiration of DOC leached from buried particulate organic matter and from overlying soils. Overall, the hyporheic zone appears {{to be a source of}} DIC to the stream. In summer, the hyporheic zone is likely isolated from vertical infiltration or lateral inflow of soil water, and particulate organic carbon is not present in stream water. Thus, spatial patterns in hyporheic zone biogeochemistry must result from underlying spatial patterns in hyporheic flowpaths, groundwater inputs, and buried particulate organic carbon. With the transition to the rainy season throughout the fall and early winter, vertical infiltration and leaching of accumulated solutes from the overlying soil appear to become important sources of carbon that help explain patterns in hyporheic zone biogeochemistry. During a small November storm event, DOC and nitrate concentrations in the stream displayed clockwise hysteresis. Travel time appeared to be associated with both nitrate and DOC response patterns in the hyporheic zone. In wells with long travel times, DOC and nitrate concentrations showed a clockwise hysteresis pattern that mimicked and even exceeded that observed in the stream. We hypothesize that these solutes were flushed from overlying soils into the hyporheic zone via vertically infiltrating rainwater. In wells with short travel times, we observed only a small peak in DOC and nitrate concentrations during the storm, potentially due to lateral infiltration of stream water later in the event. Overall, temporal patterns in hyporheic solute chemistry during the November storm differed from patterns we observed in the well network. This suggests that whole-watershed processes that controlled stream water chemistry during this storm event were different than those that controlled solute concentrations in the hyporheic zone. Nonetheless, the hyporheic zone must have been linked to the stream. That measurements in our well network reveal a very different response between the stream and the hyporheic zone suggests that: 1) Our hyporheic zone is not representative of stream-hyporheic riparian processes that occur within the larger watershed, or 2) Hillslope-stream or within-stream processes dominate during storms, and at these times the influence of the hyporheic zone on the stream is much weaker than during baseflow. During both baseflow and storm periods, the hydrology of the WS 1 system is complex – hyporheic exchange flows follow extended, non-linear flow paths through a heterogeneous subsurface and may be augmented by lateral inflows of groundwater and, during storms, vertical infiltration of soil water. Our results from both baseflow and storm sampling suggest that a complex set of physical mechanisms and biogeochemical processes influence carbon transport and transformation within this hyporheic environment...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that an exaggerated, myogenically mediated <b>rise</b> in <b>leg</b> vascular conductance contributes to the push-pull effect, using heart level arterial blood pressure as a measure of G tolerance. The approach was to impose control (30 s of 30 ° head-up tilt) and push-pull (30 s of 30 ° head-up tilt immediately preceded by 10 s of − 15 ° head-down tilt) gravitational stress after administration of hexamethonium (5 mg/kg) to inhibit autonomic ganglionic neurotransmission in seven dogs. Cardiac output or thigh level arterial pressure (myogenic stimulus) was maintained constant by computer-controlled ventricular pacing. The animals were sedated with acepromazine and lightly restrained in lateral recumbency on a tilt table. Following the onset of head-up tilt, the magnitude of the fall in heart level arterial pressure from baseline was − 11. 6 ± 2. 9 and − 17. 1 ± 2. 2 mmHg for the control and push-pull trials, respectively (P < 0. 05), when cardiac output was maintained constant. Over 40 % of the exaggerated fall in heart level arterial pressure was attributable to an exaggerated rise in hindlimb vascular conductance (P < 0. 05). Maintaining thigh level arterial pressure constant abolished the exaggerated rise in hindlimb blood flow. Thus a push-pull effect largely attributable to a myogenically induced <b>rise</b> in <b>leg</b> vascular conductance occurs when autonomic function is inhibited...|$|R

40|$|Planktonic foraminifers were {{examined}} {{in at least three}} samples per core at Site 999 in the western Caribbean Sea (12 ° 45 'N, 78 ° 44 'W; 2829 m water depth) through sediments representing the last ~ 18 m. y. An age model for Hole 999 A was constructed using the available magnetic reversal record (down {{to the top of the}} Gilbert Chron, 3. 58 Ma) and selected planktonic foraminifer datum ages. Near 10 Ma an interval of extremely slow accumulation (5 m/m. y.) corresponds to the "carbonate crash" detected in other Leg 165 studies. Planktonic foraminifer datum ages, as calculated with the Hole 999 A age model, are compared to the astrochronological ages assigned to datums at Ceara <b>Rise</b> (<b>Leg</b> 154) and to other published ages. Although there is general agreement, some significant differences are found that may be attributed to either regional paleoceanographic conditions or to shortcomings of the age model for this site. In the middle Miocene temperate latitude globoconellids (Globoconella praescitula, Gc. panda, and Gc. miozea) and in the upper Miocene Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (s) are found regularly at Site 999, suggesting the existence of an influx of cool Pacific surface water and/or regional seasonal upwelling before the emergence of the Central American Isthmus.

40|$|Introduction Resistance {{training}} has shown to delay or reverse {{the effects of}} ageing on neuromuscular function, with improvements in muscle strength and steadiness in force production. Electromyostimulation alone or superimposed over voluntary contraction (E-V) {{has been used in}} sport training and physiotherapy. However, its effect on control of force production in older adults has not been thoroughly examined. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether an E-V training would affect muscle strength (MVC) and steadiness (ST) differently to a home-based exercise (HBE) program, in older adults. Methods Sixty healthy volunteer participants, in age range of 60 to 77 years, were randomly allocated into three groups, with 10 males and 10 females in each of the control group (CG), HBE group (HBEG) and E-V group (E-VG). The training groups exercised 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks, while the CG maintained normal daily activities. Within each training session, E-VG performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions of isometric MVC in bilateral isometric knee extension and flexion exercises. The MVC was superimposed with electrical stimulation of 100 Hz at the intensity of maximal tolerance, with a duty cycle of 5 s contraction followed by 5 s rest and 1 min recovery between sets. The HBEG performed 3 sets of dynamic (sit and <b>rise,</b> <b>leg</b> curl) and isometric (push wall, hold ball between thigh and calf) exercises, each for 5 s, at moderate to strong intensity, with incremental number of repetitions (5 to 20), and 1 to 2 min recovery between sets and exercises.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on Cenomanian sediments of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 1258 and 1260 from Demerara <b>Rise</b> (<b>Leg</b> 207, western {{tropical}} Atlantic, off Suriname, ~ 1000 and ~ 500 m paleo-water depth, respectively). Studied sediments consist of laminated black shales with TOC values between 3 and 18 % and include the Mid Cenomanian Event (MCE), a positive carbon isotope excursion predating the well-known Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the continuously eutrophic environment at Demerara Rise are characterized by low diversities (? 9 species per sample) and large fluctuations in abundances, indicating oxygen depletion and varying organic matter fluxes. Dominant species at both sites are Bolivina anambra, Gabonita levis, Gavelinella dakotensis, Neobulimina albertensis, Praebulimina prolixa, and Tappanina cf. laciniosa. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages across the MCE show a threefold pattern: (1) stable ecological conditions below the MCE interval indicated by relatively high oxygenation and fluctuating organic matter flux, (2) decreasing oxygenation and/or higher organic matter flux during the MCE with decreasing benthic foraminiferal numbers and diversities (Site 1258) and a dominance of opportunistic species (Site 1260), and (3) anoxic to slightly dysoxic bottom-water conditions above the MCE as indicated by very low diversities and abundances or even the absence of benthic foraminifera. Slightly dysoxic conditions prevailed until OAE 2 at Demerara Rise. A comparison with other Atlantic Ocean and Tethyan sections indicates that the MCE reflects a paleoceanographic turning point towards lower bottom-water oxygenation, {{at least in the}} proto-North Atlantic Ocean and in the Tethyan and Boreal Realms. This general trend towards lower oxygenation of bottom waters across the MCE is accompanied by ongoing climate warming in combination with rising sea-level and the development of vast shallow epicontinental seas during the Middle and Late Cenomanian. These changes are proposed to have favoured the formation of warm and saline waters that may have contributed to intermediate- and deep-water masses at least in the restricted proto-North Atlantic and Tethyan Ocean basins, poor oxygenation of the Late Cenomanian sediments, and the changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages across the MCE...|$|R
