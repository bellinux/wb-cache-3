On that day I and three others saw her. It was in an open place, where the trees are big and wide apart. We started up and chased her when she ran from us, but feared to shoot. And in one moment she climbed up into a small tree, then, like a monkey, passed from its highest branches into a big tree. We could not see her there, but she {{was there in the}} big tree, for there was no other tree near--no way of escape. Three of us sat down to watch, and the other went back to the village. He was long gone; we were just going to leave the tree, fearing that she would do us some injury, when he came back, and with him all the others, men, women, and children. They brought axes and knives. Then Runi said: 'Let no one shoot an arrow into the tree thinking to hit her, for the arrow would be caught in her hand and thrown back at him. We must burn her in the tree; {{there is no way to}} kill her except by fire.' Then we went round and round looking up, but could see nothing; and someone said: 'She has escaped, flying like a bird from the tree'; but Runi answered that fire would show. So we cut down the small tree and lopped the branches off and heaped them round the big trunk. Then, at a distance, we cut down ten more small trees, and afterwards, further away, ten more, and then others, and piled them all <b>round,</b> <b>tree</b> after tree, until the pile reached as far from the trunk as that," [...] and here he pointed to a bush forty to fifty yards from where we sat.|$|E

50|$|During World Wars I and II, Gurkha {{soldiers}} were assembled here before being shipped out to distant battlefields. A large tree {{stood at the}} center which was Tundikhel's symbol. Known as Khariko Bot or Chākalā Simā (<b>Round</b> <b>Tree),</b> it was used by Nepal's heads of state and government to make major proclamations. The tree and circular platform were removed in the mid-1960s. In 1960, a small aircraft even landed on the grass field. The Pilatus Porter was in Nepal to provide support to the Swiss expedition which made the first successful climb of Dhaulagiri in the Himalaya.|$|E

A year later the library was denied extra funds by the township {{to help with the}} operating of the library. On March 25, 1983 the library closed due to lack of funds and waited on a tax proposal to be passed on April 4. On June 15, 1983 the library was mandated to reopen when the new tax was voted in. On April 14, 1984 the deed of the library was signed over from the city to the library, so it owned the building. In 1991 the Superior branch was opened. In 1996 <b>Round</b> <b>Tree</b> branch was opened. Due to financial setback, this branch closed again the same year. In 1998 the community voted to build a new library, renovate the Michigan Avenue facility and purchase a new bookmobile. In 2002 the Whittaker Road branch opened. The following year the Michigan Avenue branch was reopened after extensive renovation. The Ypsilanti District Library received the John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Award for its second annual Ypsilanti Songwriting Festival.|$|E
5000|$|Soon [...] "increasing {{numbers of}} Anglo-Americans began to arrive with new {{materials}} and architectural ideas {{based on those}} of the communities from which they came. Millwork and brick were imported from St. Louis and Kansas City. The small grilled and glass-less windows began {{to give way to}} double hung glazed sashes often provided with slatted shutters on the outside." [...] The Anglos were attempting to create a Greek Revival feel to the vernacular architecture that they found in New Mexico.The Anglos did three things to the adobe architecture. First they added Greek Revival trim to the windows and doors. In some cases shutters were placed by the windows, which were just tacked onto existing structures. Because of the shortage of milled lumber, {{one of the first things}} that Kearney did was import the machinery to create a mill. The next step was to start adding brick coping to the tops of adobe walls, thus making the walls substantially more water tight. The cost of importing bricks along the Santa Fe Trail made building entire houses out of brick prohibitively expensive. It was not long before brickyards were established. Frequently, bricklayers laid the bricks in such a way as to produce dentils in the courses.To further simulate a Greek Revival appearance the Anglos replaced the <b>round</b> <b>tree</b> trunk columns employed by the Hispanic builders with square ones, typically with chamfered corners. Often they were embellished with trim to simulate capitals and bases.|$|E
40|$|Nutrient cycling {{is vital}} to the {{sustenance}} and productivity of trees and other plants. Farmers incorporate stands of exotic trees into their farms to provide shade and fruits thereby, contributing to the rural economy. Despite the importance of these isolated trees in the environment, the biogeochemical implications of hydrologic processes of isolated exotics have not been adequately documented in southern Nigeria. This study examined biogeochemical implications of hydrologic processes under isolated stands of Terminalia cattapa (T. cattapa) in Orogun, southern Nigeria. Throughfall and stemflow were collected from 15 stands of T. cattapa between February 2010 and January 2011; while soil samples were collected underneath the trees. Throughfall and rainfall were collected with funnel-type collectors; stemflow was collected with mm hose wound <b>round</b> <b>tree</b> trunks; and soil samples collected with a core sampler. Samples collected were analysed in the laboratory using standard methods. Data obtained were statistically analysed with both descriptive and inferential techniques using the SPSS 15. 0 version. Annual throughfall and stemflow volumes were 89. 2 % and 6. 5 % of the incident rainfall (4325 mm). Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium returned to the soil via throughfall and stemflow varied, with marked similarity between the isolated tree stands and adjoining rainforest used as control. Potassium returned to the soil via throughfall in T. cattapa and rainforest were 62. 5 kg/ha/yr and 65. 4 kg/ha/yr; while the corresponding values for calcium were 30. 6 kg/ha/yr and 31. 3 kg/ha/yr...|$|E
