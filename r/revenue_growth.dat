40|$|While {{there is}} much {{evidence}} to support the resource curse hypothesis for resource-abundant countries, some studies have found that oil booms raise the economic growth of oil-exporting countries. This paper examines the issue of the existence of the threshold effects in the relationship between oil <b>revenues</b> and output <b>growth</b> in oil-exporting countries, applying panel regressions. The empirical results strongly suggest the existence of a threshold beyond which oil <b>revenues</b> <b>growth</b> exerts a negative effect on output. The results indicate that the threshold of growth rate of oil revenues above which oil <b>revenues</b> significantly slows <b>growth</b> is around 18 - 19 % for oil-exporting countries. In contrast, linear estimation without any allowance for threshold effects would misleadingly imply that an increase in the oil revenues increase the economic growth rate. Failure to account for nonlinearities conceal the resource curse in these countries particularly during extreme oil booms as suggested in previous studies.

25|$|Apple {{was founded}} by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I {{personal}} computer. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, saw significant momentum and <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> for the company. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. Jobs resigned from Apple and created his own company. As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to lower-priced products from competitors, in particular those offered with the Microsoft Windows operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO Gil Amelio in 1997 decided to buy Jobs' company to bring him back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own retail stores in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changed some of the hardware technology used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics and announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking {{the end of an}} era for the company.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how casino {{gambling}} revenues differ from other major tax <b>revenues</b> in <b>growth</b> and variability. We estimate the long-run and short-run income elasticities using state-level casino revenue and state, {{regional and national}} income. Our empirical analysis includes eleven states that have significant casino gambling. To estimate income elasticities, we run separate time-series regressions {{for each of these}} states, controlling for supply-side industry effects. Our findings show that Nevada’s casino <b>revenue</b> base <b>growth</b> is more sensitive to national than state income, while such growth is more tied to state and regional income in riverboat states. Casino <b>revenue</b> base <b>growth</b> is generally faster than taxable sales, but slower than taxable income. Short-run (immediate) elasticity is, on average, lower than estimates for sales and income taxes, with an equal or more rapid adjustment to long-run equilibrium. These estimates also reveal greater variability when regional or national income changes are taken into consideration. This suggests that states that depend heavily on out-of-state visitors in their gambling operations may be more susceptible to changes in regional or national economic activity.

2500|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} began issuing ratings for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the mid-1970s.

[...] Growth was particularly strong and profitable in the structured finance industry during the 2001-2006 subprime mortgage boom, and business with finance industry accounted for almost all of the <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> at at least one of the CRAs (Moody's).|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{the above}} example: instead of {{assigning}} three discrete values to <b>revenue</b> <b>growth,</b> {{and to the}} other relevant variables, the analyst would assign an appropriate probability distribution to each variable (commonly triangular or beta), and, where possible, specify the observed or supposed correlation between the variables. These distributions would then be [...] "sampled" [...] repeatedly – incorporating this correlation – so as to generate several thousand random but possible scenarios, with corresponding valuations, which are then used to generate the NPV histogram. The resultant statistics (average NPV and standard deviation of NPV) will be a more accurate mirror of the project's [...] "randomness" [...] than the variance observed under the scenario based approach. These are often used as estimates of the underlying [...] "spot price" [...] and volatility for the real option valuation as above; see [...] A more robust Monte Carlo model would include the possible occurrence of risk events (e.g., a credit crunch) that drive variations {{in one or more}} of the DCF model inputs.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{a related}} technique, analysts also run {{scenario}} based forecasts of NPV. Here, a scenario comprises a particular outcome for economy-wide, [...] "global" [...] factors (demand for the product, exchange rates, commodity prices, etc...) {{as well as}} for company-specific factors (unit costs, etc...). As an example, the analyst may specify various <b>revenue</b> <b>growth</b> scenarios (e.g. 0% for [...] "Worst Case", 10% for [...] "Likely Case" [...] and 20% for [...] "Best Case"), where all key inputs are adjusted so as to be consistent with the growth assumptions, and calculate the NPV for each. Note that for scenario based analysis, the various combinations of inputs must be internally consistent (see discussion at Financial modeling), whereas for the sensitivity approach these need not be so. [...] An application of this methodology is to determine an [...] "unbiased" [...] NPV, where management determines a (subjective) probability for each scenario – the NPV for the project is then the probability-weighted average of the various scenarios; see First Chicago Method.
