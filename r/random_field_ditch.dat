40|$|Abstract. In studies {{involving}} {{environmental risk}} assessment, <b>random</b> <b>field</b> generators {{such as the}} sequential Gaussian simulation are often used to yield realizations of a Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>field,</b> and then realizations of the non-Gaussian target <b>random</b> <b>field</b> are obtained by an inverse-normal transformation. Such simulation requires a set of observed data for estimation of the empirical cumulative distribution function and covariance function of the <b>random</b> <b>field</b> under investigation. However, such observed-data-based simulation will not work if no observed data are available and realizations of a non-Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>field</b> with specific probability density and covariance function are needed. In this paper we present details of a gamma <b>random</b> <b>field</b> simulation approach which {{does not require a}} set of observed data. A key element of the approach lies on the theoretical relationship between the covariance functions of a gamma <b>random</b> <b>field</b> and its corresponding standard normal <b>random</b> <b>field.</b> The proposed gamma <b>random</b> <b>field</b> simulation technique is composed of three sequential components: (1) covariance function conversion between a gamma <b>random</b> <b>field</b> and a corresponding Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>field,</b> (2) generating realizations of a Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>field</b> with standard normal density and the desired covariance function, and (3) transforming Gaussian realizations to corresponding gamma realizations.

40|$|Abstract—We {{take the}} point of view that a Markov <b>random</b> <b>field</b> is a {{collection}} of so-called full conditional mutual inde-pendencies. Using the theory of-Measure, we have obtained a number of fundamental characterizations related to conditional mutual independence and Markov <b>random</b> <b>fields.</b> We show that many aspects of conditional mutual independence and Markov <b>random</b> <b>fields</b> have very simple set-theoretic descriptions. New insights into the structure of conditional mutual independence and Markov <b>random</b> <b>fields</b> are obtained. Our results have immediate applications in the implication problem of probabilistic condi-tional independency and relational database. Toward the end of the paper, we obtain a hypergraph characterization of a Markov <b>random</b> <b>field</b> which makes it legitimate to view a Markov <b>random</b> <b>field</b> as a hypergraph.
