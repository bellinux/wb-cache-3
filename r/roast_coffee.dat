50|$|<b>Roasting</b> <b>coffee</b> {{transforms}} {{the chemical and}} physical properties of green <b>coffee</b> beans into <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> products. The <b>roasting</b> process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as {{those that have been}} roasted, but lack the taste of <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of processing and roasting on the antioxidant activity of coffee brews. Brews prepared with light, medium and dark <b>roasted</b> <b>coffees</b> were analyzed. The pH, total solids content, polyphenols content, reducing substances and chlorogenic acids content were determined. The antioxidant activity of aqueous extracts, the guaicol decolorizing {{and the capacity to}} inhibit lipid peroxidation were also analyzed. The antioxidant activity of coffee brews were concentration-dependent. A progressive antioxidant activity and polyphenols content was observed decreasing with roasting. The light <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> showed the highest antioxidant activity and dark <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> showed the lowest antioxidant activity. The results indicate that the ingestion of coffee brews prepared with light and medium <b>roasted</b> <b>coffees</b> might protect cells from oxidative stress damages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the contents of essential and non-essential metals in coffee beans. For this matter, seven essential metals such as K, Mg, Ca, Na, Mn, Cu and Zn and two nonessential metals (Cd and Pb) in four <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> samples (washed Yirgacheffe, unwashed Yirgacheffe, washed Sidama and unwashed Sidama) were determined by FAAS. Closed microwave assisted wet digestion method with addition of concentrated (69 - 70 %) HNO 3 and 30 % H 2 O 2 were selected for decomposition of ground <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> samples. Generally, the levels of metals in all <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> samples were found: K> Mg> Ca> Na>Mn> Zn> Cu, but the non-essential metals Pb and Cd were found to be below method detection limit. The digestion method was evaluated by spiking <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> samples and their percentage recoveries were in the range of 95 − 104 %. It is suggested that the consumption of <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> beans could be a source of dietary essential metals and a possible entrance path way for trace metals to the food chain...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOperating {{conditions}} affect Ochratoxin A (OTA) extraction in <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee.</b> It is thus {{that the}} OTA content {{found in the}} beverage is greater than that found in the <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> used to prepare it. Three extraction parameters were studied for <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee</b> : type of extraction solvent (alkaline, neutral, acid), temperature (ambient temperature/ 23 °C, 60 °C and 85 °C) and extraction time (5, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 80 min). The alkaline solvent that {{is used in the}} method recommended by the European Union, extracted OTA better, but a maximum content was obtained at 60 °C after 50 min. At least a 100 % improvement in extraction was obtained when compared to the EU usual quantification method that is carried out at ambient temperature. It turned out that the OTA extraction parameters for <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee,</b> as defined by that method, were not optimum and needed to be modified. These results were verified in double extraction experiments showing that OTA is not completely extracted by this method. Confirmation was obtained by comparison of extraction methods on several commercial samples of <b>roasted</b> <b>coffee...</b>|$|R
