5|$|The major {{development}} of {{weapons in the}} early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved. Initially, iron <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then, latterly, different types of shot were invented.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and <b>round</b> <b>shot.</b> Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and <b>round</b> <b>shot.</b> The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

5|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ship's speed {{would take it}} past Shannon and ordered a 'pilot's luff'. This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{ammunition}} were available, each for different uses: <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> (cannonballs) against ship hulls, chain shot against masts and rigging, and canister shot (wooden cylinders filled with metal balls or fragments), {{which had a}} devastating effect on tightly packed groups of men. For boarding actions Kronan was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – hakebössor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing {{to allow it to}} absorb the recoil of the charges. One hakebössa was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
6000|$|... "An hour passed: {{it seemed}} an age. The <b>round</b> <b>shots</b> still rang overhead, {{and the fire}} was now much more heavy and {{sustained}} than before. Presently I again saw a movement in the jungle, and Norworthy's face appeared, and he waved his arm in greeting.|$|R
50|$|As Montagne, {{the ship}} was the {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse in the Combat de Prairial (known in English literature as the Glorious First of June) in 1794. She was badly damaged by the HMS Royal Sovereign, losing 313 men and receiving 233 <b>round</b> <b>shots</b> in her hull.|$|R
5|$|These {{advances}} {{took place}} under Swedish artillery fire. From 21 March until 29 March (when, according to Aleksander Myshlayevsky, the Russians began firing their artillery), 66 bombs and 1,200 <b>round</b> <b>shots</b> were released by Swedish artillery. Also, the Swedes attempted a ground assault, but were driven {{back into the}} fort.|$|R
5|$|The very {{extensive}} survey {{carried out}} (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually {{to the discovery}} of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about a kilometer further west than the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was {{at the time of the}} battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of field names suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. Experts believe that the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III's death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem, was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.|$|E
5|$|Damage to Forte was extensive. The {{stern and}} side facing Sybille {{had been beaten}} in by gunfire as more than 300 shot holes {{combined}} to form gaping holes in hull above the waterline. As well as the masts the bulkheads had been smashed apart and all deck furniture blasted to splinters. 65 of the crew had been killed, including Captain Beaulieu, and approximately 80 wounded, {{more than a third}} of the crew listed as casualties; many of the wounded later died from the effects of amputation. Damages to Sybille were considerably lighter: only six shot had struck the hull in the entire battle: one gun was dismounted, but the worst damage was to Cooke's cabin where a <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> had destroyed most of his furniture. In addition, most of the damage to the masts and rigging proved superficial. Just five crew were killed outright, with another 17 wounded, the latter including Cooke. The British captain had been struck in the left arm, the shot exiting near his spine, with additional injuries to the chest and right arm. He eventually died after a long and agonising deterioration at Calcutta on 25 May 1799 and was buried under a monument with full military honours. A memorial was subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey in his memory.|$|E
5|$|In naval battles, players {{control a}} fleet of up to twenty varied ships, and use 18th-century tactics to {{overcome}} enemy fleets. As with army units, each ship's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as a battle progresses; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their morale is broken, or in extreme cases may surrender. A battle is won when all hostile ships have been sunk, captured, or have left the map. Individual ships can be maneuvered, or remain in formation with other ships from the fleet. Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship they want a crew to target, making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle: masts can be toppled, sails and gun ports can be destroyed and damage can entirely disable a ship's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it. The types of ammunition can be used during a battle are grapeshot, chain-shot and <b>round</b> <b>shot,</b> which have different uses, from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement. As battles progress, crews can try to board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand {{in an attempt to}} capture the ship. The weather in a naval battle is also important; bad weather can create poor visibility. Ships cannot be repaired in mid-battle unlike its successor, , but fires on board ships can be put out automatically.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 the British Field Archery Association (BFAA) {{was formed}} at Dunster in Somerset. The {{association}} held annual championships, and defined various <b>rounds</b> <b>shot</b> at unmarked distances in woodland. The BFAA {{did not require}} clear lanes between the shooting position and the target - the preference was for the course to be as natural as possible.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 October 1854, Ville de Paris {{launched}} the bombardment of Sevastopol by signaling [...] "France watches you".

25|$|The {{cannonball}} or <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> was {{the most}} frequently used projectile. Both direct and ricochet fire might be used to hit a target. <b>Round</b> <b>shot</b> was most effective when used against troops formed in column {{and to a lesser extent}} against those deployed in line. Most soldiers despised long-range artillery fire because they could not shoot back with shorter-ranged muskets. The British protected their troops from <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> by placing them behind ridgelines when possible, but all other nations normally posted their soldiers in the open. At close range, artillerists switched to canister, an anti-personnel weapon. A canister round contained a large number of musket balls that, when fired, spread out and flew in the direction of the target. When supporting an attack, the cannons advanced with the infantry. Half the guns moved forward, covered by the second half, then the second half moved up, covered by the first half. When under attack by enemy infantry, the cannons first fired at the enemy artillery. As the range closed, the guns aimed at the enemy foot soldiers.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, Nana Sahib's forces {{changed their}} tactics. They started {{concentrated}} firing on specific buildings, firing endless salvos of <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> into the entrenchment. They successfully damaged {{some of the}} smaller barrack buildings, and also tried to set fire to the buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> was the projectile {{used most}} often. Both direct and ricochet fire {{might be used}} to strike a target. <b>Round</b> <b>shot</b> was most effective when used against formed troops, particularly those in column and to a lesser degree against those in line. Most soldiers hated to be under long-range artillery fire because they were unable to shoot back at their tormentors with shorter-ranged muskets. The British avoided exposing their troops to <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> by placing them behind crests when possible, but all other nations customarily deployed their soldiers in the open. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an anti-personnel weapon. A canister round consisted {{of a large number of}} musket balls that, when fired, spread out and flew in the direction of the target. When supporting an attack, the cannons advanced with the infantry. Half the guns moved forward, covered by the remaining guns, then the other half moved, repeating the process. The battalion pieces, usually 4-pounders, fired at the enemy foot soldiers while the heavier guns targeted the enemy artillery. When under attack by enemy infantry, the cannons first fired at the enemy artillery. As the range closed, the guns aimed at the enemy foot soldiers.|$|E
50|$|In September 1819, the French {{engineer}} and Army artillery officer Henri-Joseph Paixhans {{wrote to the}} Ministry of the Navy to propose a fusing system to fire explosive shells at wooden warships, instead of the usual, solid <b>round</b> <b>shots</b> that were then in general naval use. A commission studied the matter, and decided to build two Paixhans howitzers for trial purposes in 1822.|$|R
50|$|The French {{success was}} {{in part due to}} the use of newly {{introduced}} Paixhans guns, even though the frigates had fired 7771 <b>round</b> <b>shots</b> and only 177 Paixhans shells; the bomb ships had themselves fired 302 mortar bombs, and were credited with the destruction of the Mexican ammunition depots. The US observer, Adm. David Farragut, reported the effects of the shells in the fort.|$|R

25|$|By this time, two of {{the boats}} {{had been able to}} drift away: General Wheeler's boat, and a second boat which was holed beneath the {{waterline}} by a <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> fired from the bank. The British people in the second boat panicked and attempted to make it to General Wheeler's boat, which was slowly drifting to safer waters.|$|E
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> was the projectile {{most often}} used. Both direct and ricochet fire {{could be used}} to hit a target. <b>Round</b> <b>shot</b> was most effective when used against formed troops in column and was somewhat less effective against troops in line. Soldiers were frightened of long range artillery fire because their short-ranged muskets could not retaliate against the gunners. The British deployed their soldiers on reverse slopes when possible to avoid losses from artillery fire, but all other nations generally arrayed their soldiers in the open. However, when under a severe bombardment by 50 Austrian guns at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French Imperial Guard redeployed from a 3-deep line to a 1-deep line to minimize losses and keep the appearance of a solid front. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an anti-personnel weapon. When canister was fired, its load of musket balls flew toward the target while spreading out.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} tactical {{decision is}} the choice of shot types. <b>Round</b> <b>shot</b> is the default shot type, with upgrades providing grape shot and chain shot. Each type causes {{a different type of}} damage, and also has different ballistic capabilities. <b>Round</b> <b>shot</b> has the longest range of the three, and greatest speed. Upon impact, it has a great chance of damaging a ship's hull (potentially sinking the ship), and a smaller chance of destroying cannon, killing crew, or damaging the sails. Chain shot has a shorter range and flies at a slower speed in a high trajectory. Its impact is most likely to cause sail damage to the enemy ship, slowing it down or potentially dismasting it. Chain shot also has a small chance of killing enemy crew. Grape shot is very slow and has a short range, but upon impact it can kill large portions of the enemy crew, weakening the ship and slowing its reloading. Grape shot also has the potential of damaging enemy sails.|$|E

25|$|Aside from John André's ballad, the {{consequences}} of the skirmish were the loss of lives and the seizure of cattle. Wayne reported losses of 15 enlisted men killed, plus three officers and 46 enlisted men wounded. Clinton estimated that Wayne had almost 2,000 troops available. He admitted the loss of 21 casualties and reported that 50 <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> penetrated the blockhouse.

25|$|By {{the time}} of Jiao Yu and his Huolongjing (which {{describes}} military applications of gunpowder in great detail) in the mid-14th century, the explosive potential of gunpowder was perfected, {{as the level of}} nitrate in gunpowder formulas had risen to a range of 12% to 91%, with at least 6 different formulas in use that are considered to have maximum explosive potential for gunpowder. By that time, the Chinese had discovered how to create explosive <b>round</b> <b>shot</b> by packing their hollow shells with this nitrate-enhanced gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|Close to the castle, on {{the market}} of Podzamcze village, there is a chapel built out of the castle's {{architectural}} elements (portal, volutes, cornice).
