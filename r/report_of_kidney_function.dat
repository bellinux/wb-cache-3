40|$|Biomarkers of {{inflammation}} and progression <b>of</b> chronic <b>kidney</b> disease. BackgroundChronic kidney disease {{is associated with}} higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Statins have anti-inflammatory properties and may attenuate loss <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Although inflammation may mediate progressive renal injury, the relation between statin use, markers of inflammation, and the rate <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> loss has not been elucidated. We examined the association between pravastatin use, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNFrii), and the rate <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> loss. MethodsWe performed a post hoc analysis of data from a randomized placebo controlled trial of pravastatin 40 mg daily in people with previous myocardial infarction. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) GFR equation. We studied 687 subjects with chronic kidney disease (GFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) who did not experience a cardiovascular event during follow-up. Multivariate linear regression was used to study the relation between baseline CRP and sTNFrii and the rate <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> loss in mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 /year. Cross-product interaction terms were used to determine if these relations varied with pravastatin use. ResultsMedian baseline GFR was 54. 5 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (interquartile range 49. 7, 57. 8) and median duration of follow-up was 58 months. Higher baseline CRP level was independently associated with more rapid <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> loss (highest tertile 0. 6 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 per year faster than lowest tertile) (P = 0. 001). A similar independent relation was observed between tertile of sTNFrii and rate <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> loss (highest tertile 0. 5 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 per year faster than lowest tertile) (P = 0. 006). Subjects with both CRP and sTNFrii in the highest tertile (“inflamed” status) appeared to derive more renal benefit from pravastatin than those without (P for interaction 0. 047). In these 108 subjects, renal function loss in pravastatin recipients was 0. 8 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 /year slower than placebo (95 % CI 0 to 1. 5 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 /year slower) (P = 0. 039). ConclusionHigher CRP and sTNFrii are independently associated with faster rates <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> loss in chronic kidney disease. Pravastatin appears to prevent loss <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> to a greater extent in individuals with greater evidence of inflammation, although this was of borderline significance.

BACKGROUND Anemia and reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> occur frequently in patients with heart failure. The level of hematocrit and its relationship with renal function have not been evaluated as risk factors for mortality in patients with LV dysfunction. METHODS We retrospectively examined the Studies Of LV Dysfunction (SOLVD) database. Glomer-ular filtration rate (GFR) was predicted using a recently validated formula. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare survival times between groups stratified by level <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> (predicted GFR) and hematocrit. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to explore the relationship of survival time to level <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function,</b> hematocrit and their interaction.

The definition of incident CKD required eGFRcys 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 at baseline, blacks had a significantly higher rate <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> decline than whites (0. 31 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 /yr faster on average, P = 0. 001), even after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Among Hispanics, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans had faster rates of decline than whites (0. 55 and 0. 47 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 /yr faster, respectively). Mexicans, South Americans, or other Hispanics had similar rates of decline compared to whites. We did not detect significant differences in the rates <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> decline among Chinese and white participants. Among those with normal or near-normal <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> at baseline, blacks and Hispanics had the highest rates of incident CKD during follow-up.

Different therapeutic interventions {{in the course of}} CKD are shown to be effective in slowing or preventing disease progression. This thesis focused on the progression of CKD from pre-dialysis to dialysis. The main conclusions of this thesis are: A positive first-degree family medical history of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease is associated with increased mortality {{in the first year of}} pre-dialysis care, but not with decline <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Second, increased serum phosphorus levels, but not serum calcium levels, are associated with a shorter dialysis-free survival in the first two years of pre-dialysis care. Furthermore, increased phosphorus levels at start of pre-dialysis care are associated with the rate <b>of</b> decline <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Third, late referral to pre-dialysis care is associated with increased mortality in the first year of dialysis. Fourth, the decline <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> is constant in the period of one year before dialysis initiation until two to four months of dialysis therapy. After that period, the rate <b>of</b> decline <b>of</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> decreases. Finally, in contrast to common believe, in dialysis patients, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality are equally increased. Promotor: F. W. Dekker, Co-Promotores: D. C. Grootendorst, N.
