An important first step in this direction is identification of noise sources and its quantification. For this purpose, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and computational aeroacoustic analyses is performed on centrifugal fans with backward impeller, <b>radial</b> <b>impeller</b> and forward impellers using CFD code FLUENT.

For the computation of flow for a finite number of blades, the approximation method as developed by Munk, Prandtl and Birnbaum, or Glauert is found suitable. The essential idea of this method is to replace the wing by a vortex sheet and compute the flow as the field of these vortices. The shape of the blades is then obtained from the condition that the flow must be along the surface of the blade...|$|R
