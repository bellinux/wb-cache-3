50|$|The last 12 {{issues were}} {{switched}} to <b>revolving</b> <b>features</b> of issue-long stories, {{rather than the}} anthology format.

50|$|In season 2, shows 4 through 13 had a first-run episode and {{a repeat}} {{from the first}} season. The series was {{canceled}} in September 1987 but returned in replays in October 1988 after NBC's live action pre-teen show 2 Hip 4 TV was canceled.

40|$|For molding {{and casting}} processes, {{geometries}} that have undercut-free parting directions (UFPDs) are preferred for manufacturing. However, existing approaches either cannot identify all UFPDs or cannot run at interactive speeds (the best exhaustive algorithm, unimplemented, runs at O(n 4) time theoretically). Our proposed feature-based approach avoids testing the whole Gaussian sphere of potential directions by first efficiently identify all UFPDs for individual {{features such as}} extruded and <b>revolved</b> <b>features,</b> thus significantly reducing test space and running time. In this paper, we describe a fast algorithm to find all UFPDs for solids of revolution. The algorithm is based on analyzing the constructing 2 D generator profiles, building on our previous results for 2 -moldability analysis of polygons. The running time is O(n), where n is the geometric complexity of the 2 D generator profile. For parts containing multiple solids of revolution, the set of possible UFPDs can be significantly reduced based upon an analysis of each such feature, efficiently identifying many as non- 2 -moldable or reducing the search space for exhaustive algorithms that find all UFPDs. ...|$|R
