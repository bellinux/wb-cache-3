40|$|Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is a spoilage-causing {{bacterium}} in fruit juices. The inactivation of this bacterium {{by commercial}} saponin and saponin purified extract from Sapindus saponaria fruits combined with heat-treatment is described. We investigated heat treatment (87, 90, 95, and 99 degrees C) with incubation time ranging from 0 to 50 min, in both concentrated and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice.</b> juices were inoculated with 1. 0 x 10 (4) CFU/mL of A. acidoterrestris spores {{for the evaluation}} of the best temperature for inactivation. For the temperatures of 87, 90, and 95 degrees C counts of cell viability decreased rapidly within the first 10 to 20 min of incubation in both concentrated and reconstituted juices; inactivation at 99 degrees C ensued within 1 and 2 min. Combination of commercial saponin (100 mg/L) with a very short incubation time (1 min) at 99 degrees C showed a reduction of 234 log cycle for concentrated juice A. acidoterrestris spores (1. 0 x 10 (4) CFU/mL) in the first 24 h of incubation after treatments. The most efficient treatment was reached with 300, 400 or 500 mg/L of purified extract of saponins from S. saponaria after 5 days of incubation in concentrated juice, and after 5 days with 300 and 400 mg/L or 72 h with 500 mg/L in <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice.</b> Commercial saponin and purified extracts from S. saponaria had similar inactivation power on A. acidoterrestris spores, without significant differences (P> 0. 05). Therefore, purified extract of saponins can be an alternative for the control of A acidoterrestris in fruit juices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Food ScienceKadri KoppelPomegranate fruits are {{seasonally}} {{produced and}} require processing to provide year round availability. Effects of processing on phenolic compounds, color, and other physical properties {{have been examined}} but {{few studies have examined}} the sensory effects. Juice prepared from fresh Wonderful pomegranates was used to prepare fresh frozen juice, batch pasteurized juice, and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice</b> from dried arils. These juices were evaluated using analytical and affective sensory methods to increase the understanding of processing effects on pomegranate juice properties. A modified consensus flavor profile showed {{that a large number of}} small differences existed. The accumulation of these changes demonstrates the distinction among processing methods. Time intensity multi-evaluation (TIME) profiling, a new method, was used to further understand how multiple attributes, including aromatics, feeling factors, and basic tastes, changed over the course of one sip. Fruity flavor was consistently the first to appear in the profile while bitterness and astringency lasted the longest. The attribute woody displayed longer peak times in the pasteurized and reconstituted samples than seen in fresh frozen juice. Semi-Continuous Consumption (SCC) profiling, another new method, explained product differences over 25 sips that mimicked consumption. Overall, astringent and bitter components increased while fruity and overall sweet attributes declined. These profile changes differed by sample with <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice</b> showing the least increase in astringency over consumption. The juice samples were subjected to an acceptance test that showed four liking clusters, one that accepted all three juices and three clusters that disliked one of each juice type. The results from these studies are an initial step in describing how processing of pomegranate juice can effect flavor. Understanding the flavor differences is beneficial to processors for marketing products and for purchasers of these products for ingredient usage. Furthermore, the process of TIME and SCC profiling are described which are beneficial for understanding how multiple flavors change over single and multiple consumption events of a product respectively. These new methodologies are useful in explaining the experience of complex products such as teas and coffees or products exhibiting build-up such as nutrition aides...|$|E

The {{development}} of off-flavors and volatile compounds was monitored in <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice</b> prepared from 'Golden Delicious' and 'Fuji' apple concentrates stored in glass bottles under fluorescent light (3000 Ix, 8 degrees C). A strong metallic off-flavor was formed by photooxidation. A major contributor to the off-flavor was identified as 1 -octen- 3 -one by gas chromatography-olfactometry. In addition, six volatile compounds, pentanal, 2 -methyl- 1 -penten- 3 -one, hexanal, (E) - 2 -heptenal, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, and (E) - 2 octenal, increased significantly after light exposure and could contribute to the off-flavor. Except for pentanal and hexanal, these volatiles were found only after light exposure. Higher levels of volatiles were observed in juice from 'Golden Delicious' apples than in juice from 'Fuji' apples, and this difference was consistent with higher levels of suspended solids.

40|$|Bostwick consistencies of reconstituted tomato pastes were {{measured}} both immediately after paste production and after storage times {{of up to}} 9 months. Bostwick values measured after storage were more than twice those measured {{on the day of}} paste production. This increase in Bostwick developed over the first month of paste storage at room temperature and could be slowed down but not prevented if the paste was stored at 4 C. Heating the reconstituted paste for 30 min at 90 C or 15 min at 100 C restored the original consistency. Serum viscosities also decreased during paste storage, but the change in serum viscosity was smaller than the changes in Bostwick. As with the Bostwick, heating the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice</b> restored the serum viscosity. For a reproducible evaluation of the consistency of stored tomato paste, it is essential that the reconstituted paste be heated to 90 C or above. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Consistency is an important quality consideration in products prepared from reconstituted tomato paste. During storage, changes occur in tomato paste, which affect the consistency after reconstitution. The results presented here show that for stored tomato paste, heating after reconstitution restores consistency to the same level as measured before storage.

Rice (150 g), red gram (30 g) and a GLV (150 g) forming the meal components were pressure-cooked and homogenised. To each of the meal, {{one of the following}} was added at 400 g or ml/meal level fresh fruit pulp or juice (four varieties), <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice</b> powders (RJP), fruit squashes, ready to drink fruit beverage (RTD) and carbonated beverages (CB). Two brands of each processed beverages were used. Dialysable iron content of diets increased by 16 - 104 % on addition of fruit pulp and by 45 - 263 % on addition of fruit juices over the respective control diets. Among the processed juices, RJP enhanced the dialysable iron by 30 - 81 %, fruit squashes by 20 - 138 %, RTD by 33 - 96 % and carbonated beverages by 1 - 131 % with different brands. Differences observed in the two brands of processed beverages could be attributed to their ascorbic acid and citric acid contents. Hence, it can be concluded that addition of fruit/fruit juice, either in natural or synthetic forms containing organic acids i. e., citric, ascorbic or maleic acids will definitely increase the iron dialysability of cereal meal indicating enhanced iron bioavailability...|$|E

Thus, the aim of the following study was to develop a new non-dairy probiotic food from of pineapple juice containing Lactobacillus casei NRRL B- 442 dehydrated by spray-drying process. Firstly, the pineapple juice underwent a heat treatment (90 Â C / 1 minute) in order to inactivate the proteases present in the juice and evaluate the influence of enzyme inactivation on the microorganism survival. Subsequently, the employment of three temperatures (150, 120 and 100 Â C) on the juice dehydration was appraised, with the purpose of defining an appropriate temperature based on the microorganism survival, after the dehydration process. Other parameters were also studied, such as: the effect of addition of different materials (gelatin, gum arabic, maltodextrin), which were used as protective agents for the microorganism, as well as the concentration of each tested adjuvant. Viability of L. casei (before and after the drying process), powder yield and rehydration levels and the color of the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juice</b> were also assessed. Based on the attained results, it can be concluded that the utilization of lower temperatures (100 Â C) and the appliance of heat treatment in the juice favored the survival of L. casei after dehydration.

40|$|Com o crescente apelo dos consumidores por alimentos minimamente processados, o consumo de sucos tem aumentado significativamente, sendo o suco de laranja pasteurizado e refrigerado um dos mais consumidos pelos brasileiros. No entanto, o processo de pasteurização, mesmo utilizando altas temperaturas por curto período de tempo, altera ligeiramente as características organolépticas do suco, resultando em um produto com sabor diferente ao do suco fresco. Atualmente, uma das alternativas é a utilização de processos de separação por membranas (PSM) na produção de suco de laranja, especificamente na etapa de pasteurização, pois os PSM podem operar em baixas temperaturas. Nestes processos é comum a utilização de hidrólise enzimática como pré-tratamento, tendo como objetivo diminuir a viscosidade do suco, possibilitando uma melhora no fluxo permeado e nas demais condições do processo. Tendo em vista a necessidade de inovação no ramo de sucos, este trabalho estuda a possibilidade de integração de processos de separação por membranas com o processo de pasteurização convencional. Analisa, primeiramente, dois compostos enzimáticos comerciais com o objetivo de verificar qual o mais adequado para a utilização no pré-tratamento de suco de laranja. Para esta análise, a viscosidade do suco foi medida antes e depois das hidrólises em diferentes tempos e temperaturas, assim como a acidez, °Brix e pH. Além disto, foram realizados testes de ultrafiltração em uma unidade de bancada com uma membrana polimérica {{comercial}} de massa molar de corte entre 40 - 50 kDa, nas seguintes condições de operação: pressão transmembrana de 150 kPa, velocidade de escoamento de 7, 47 m. s- 1 e temperatura de 25 °C. Os resultados indicam que o composto enzimático que mais se adequou ao pré-tratamento proposto foi a Pectinex Ultra SP-L, a uma temperatura de 30 °C e tempo de 30 minutos. Na ultrafiltração do suco de laranja foi observado um comportamento de queda do fluxo permeado ao longo do tempo tanto na filtração de suco de laranja hidrolisado com Pectinex Ultra SP-L, quanto na filtração do suco sem hidrólise. Com os resultados das análises microbiológicas, não pôde-se afirmar que o suco reconstituído (90 % de suco pasteurizado + 10 % de suco permeado) apresentou maior vida útil comparado ao suco pasteurizado (100 % pasteurizado). With {{the growing}} appeal of consumers for minimal processed food, {{the consumption of}} juices has been increasing significantly, being the pasteurized and refrigerated orange juice {{one of the most}} consumed by the Brazilians. However, the pasteurization process, even using high temperatures for short period of time, it lightly alters the organoleptics characteristics of the juice, resulting in a product with different flavor compared to the fresh juice. Nowadays, one of the alternatives is the use of membrane separation processes (MSP) in the production of orange juice, specifically in the pasteurization stage, because MPS can operate under low temperatures. In these processes it is common to use enzymatic hydrolises as pretreatment, lookink for a decrease of the juice viscosity, improving the permeated flow and the other process conditions. Due to the need of innovation in the juice market, this work studies the possibility of integrate membrane separation processes with conventional process of pasteurization. It analyzes, firstly, two commercial enzymes with the objective of verifying which one will be the most indicated for the use in the pre-treatment of orange juice. For this analysis, the juice viscosity was measured, before and after the hydrolises, in different times and temperatures, as well as the acidity, °Brix and pH. Besides, ultrafiltration tests were accomplished in an unit with a commercial polymeric membrane with mass court molar among 40 - 50 kDa, in the following operation conditions: transmembrane pressure of 150 kPa, flow speed of 7, 47 m. s- 1 and temperature of 25 °C. The results indicate that the enzymatic composition that most fitted in was Pectinex Ultra SP-L, at a temperature of 30 °C and time of 30 minutes. In the ultrafiltration process of the orange juice a decreasing behavior of the permeated flow along the time was observed for both juices (with and without hydrolises).

40|$|ABSTRACT Grape juice {{contains}} high {{amounts of}} anthocyanins, with {{great potential for}} substituting synthetic food dyes. Carrier agents used in spray drying entraps anthocyanins, allowing their preservation. This work appraised whey protein/ maltodextrin (WM) and soy protein/maltodextrin (SM) blends as alternative carriers for spray drying of grape juice and encapsulation of anthocyanins. The effects of carrier agent concentration (CAC) and ratio protein/carrier agent (R) on grape juice powder properties were evaluated. The grape juice powders presented good solubility, low water content and high anthocyanin retention. WM blends resulted in higher yields and higher anthocyanin retention (from 77. 9 to 94 %) than SM blends, whereas SM blends leaded to higher encapsulation efficiency (> 97 %). Increasing CAC and R resulted in brighter powders, but <b>reconstituted</b> <b>juices</b> presented color parameters {{similar to those of}} fresh juice. WM and SM were suitable for encapsulating anthocyanins of grape juice, resulting in powders with potential applications in food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The grape cultivar BRS violeta contains high levels of anthocyanins and is an alternative to produce antioxidant-rich and highly colored grape juice. Spray drying is applied for producing powdered grape juice with high anthocyanin content. In this technique, the addition of whey and soy proteins blended with maltodextrin as carrier agents avoid problems such as stickiness, which is negative to process yield and product quality. Moreover, the use of carrier agents in spray drying promotes the microencapsulation of bioactive compounds, allowing their protection and preservation during processing and storage. The grape juice powder from cv.

40|$|Monomeric {{anthocyanin}} {{degradation and}} nonenzymatic browning (NEB) index have been determined in <b>reconstituted</b> blackberry <b>juice</b> heated at high temperature in a hermetically sealed cell. Statistical analysis demonstrated that, {{when the temperature}} range (100 - 180 _C) was divided into two subranges (100 - 140 and 140 - 180 _C) for anthocyanin degradation, reaction kinetics were well represented by two sequential first-order reactions. The activation energy for NEB from 100 to 180 _C (106 kJ 3 mol- 1) was slightly higher than the anthocyanin value at the lower temperature range (92 kJ 3 mol- 1), but was {{more than twice the}} value for the higher range (44 kJ 3 mol- 1). The reaction rate constant at 140 _C for anthocyanin degradation (3. 5 _ 10 - 3 s- 1) was two times that for the NEB index (1. 6 _ 10 - 3 s- 1). Hence, anthocyanin degradation was faster than the appearance of NEB products. The non-isothermal method developed allows estimating kinetic parameters and thereby generating temperature profiles of heat processes that would help preserve the nutritional properties of foods during high-temperature processes.

40|$|AbstractLime is an {{agricultural}} {{product that is}} exceptionally expensive during some periods of a year. In this research, juice was squeezed out from the fresh lime prior to exposing to four different processing schemes. They comprised with (1) pasteurization at 85 °C for 30 s, (2) pasteurization at 95 °C for 30 s, (3) UHT sterilization at 136 °C for 4 s and (4) vacuum evaporation at temperature range of 68 - 72 °C and vacuum pressure of 97325. 35 Pa before pasteurization at 72 °C for 15 s. The main objective was to {{study the effects of}} processing methods on the physical prop erties of products so that the proper techniques for preserving lime juice would be identified. The specimens were kept at room temperature and measured their physical attributes every week for 7 weeks; as a result, it appeared that the <b>reconstituted</b> lime <b>juice</b> prepared from the sample manufactured by the fourth processing scheme had the most similar physical characteristics to the freshly squeezed lime juice. Furthermore, the panelists preferred this juice specimen to those produced from the other three methods that applied higher processing temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the sensory acceptability and obtain check-all-that-apply (CATA) responses for fruit-flavored powdered juices, with three different consumer segments: children and women who could be considered target populations, and a convenience sample of foodscience- related consumers (FSRC). The study was conducted with a total of 550 consumers in four cities: Alicante (Spain), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Manhattan (U. S. A.) and 9 de Julio (Argentina). The products were <b>reconstituted</b> powdered <b>juices</b> with the following flavors: apple, cherry, grape, grapefruit, orange and pear. Overall, FSRC consumers had the lowest acceptability scores for these products. Regarding CATA results, multiple correspondence analysis showed cherry and grape juices were associated to artificial-flavor and artificial-color, with the FSRC respondents being mainly responsible for the use of these descriptors. Pear and orange were considered to have natural-flavor and good-color, mainly by children and women. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the effect of “sample,” “city” and “consumer segment” on the percentage of checks given to each descriptor. The “consumer segment” effect was significant for nearly all descriptors, with FSRC checking samples differently to women and childre...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} sporulation medium on guaiacol formation from vanillin and vanillic acid by Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris DSM 3922 in the <b>reconstituted</b> apple <b>juice</b> (pH 3. 82, °Brix 11. 3). For sporulation, potato dextrose agar and Bacillus acidoterrestris agar were used. After heat-activation, spores were turned into vegetative cells and inoculated into juice samples to a final concentration of 103 or 105 CFU/mL. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 264 h and guaiacol concentration was determined using peroxidase enzyme colourimetric assay. Based on the results, the conversion of vanillic acid into guaiacol was faster than that of vanillin among both cell suspensions. Also, {{there were no significant}} differences among any of the samples inoculated into apple juice spiked with vanillin at the end of the incubation period (P > 0. 05). In the case of vanillic acid, the guaiacol concentrations were significantly different among cells activated from spores produced on PDA and BATA (P < 0. 05). The obtained results suggested that type of sporulation medium composition may affect the guaiacol concentration depending on inoculum level and type of precursor present in the apple juice...|$|R
40|$|Shelf life of <b>reconstituted</b> orange <b>juice</b> after {{conventional}} thermal (80 degreesC, 30 s) or high {{hydrostatic pressure}} (500 M Pa, 35 degreesC, 5 min) pasteurisation was comparatively studied. Polypropylene bottles and laminated flexible pouches were used. Ascorbic acid loss, colour, viscosity and sensory characteristics were measured during storage at 0 - 15 degreesC. Ascorbic acid degradation rates were lower for high pressurised juice, {{leading to an}} extension of its shelf life compared to conventionally pasteurised juice. Kinetic modelling established a higher temperature dependence of ascorbic acid loss for high pressurised juice as expressed by activation energy values (61. 1 and 43. 8 kJ/mol respectively for high pressurised and thermally treated bottled juice). Based on ascorbic acid retention, the increase of shelf life of high pressurised juice stored in bottles compared to thermally pasteurised one ranged from 11 % (storage at 15 degreesC) to 65 % (storage at 0 degreesC). Respective values of shelf life increase for juices in pouches were 24 % and 57 %. Colour was not substantially affected by type of processing. Higher viscosity values were determined for high pressurised juice, while its sensory characteristics were judged superior. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Alicyiclobacillus spp. form spores and develop in acid media, leading to the {{spoilage}} of citrus juices. Brazil is the largest exporter of orange juice concentrate, and yet, it has been extensively studied due to changes in taste and smell. Several investigations have reported different culture media used to detect and enumerate Alicyiclobacillus spp. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the recovery of Alicyiclobacillus spp. spores grown in ALI, BAT, K agar and YSG media using the methodology suggested by ABECitrus. Five inocula were used, two from reference strains and three from pasteurized concentrated orange juice. Cell recovery after the enrichment in <b>reconstituted</b> orange <b>juice</b> was also analyzed. An initial population of 6 log CFU/mL was inoculated. ALI, BAT and YSG media were able to recover the initial population of all different inocula, with no significant differences between the results. When compared to BAT, however, the preparation of ALI and YSG media was simpler and had more advantages. The recovery with K agar medium was lower than the other media for all the tested inocula, with significant differences found for Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius 0298 T (3. 66 log CFU/mL) and Alicyclobacillus pomorum-like CBMAI 0278 (4. 11 log CFU/mL) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} storage {{temperature}} on A. acidoterrestris DSM 3922 cells (10 5 CFU/mL) was examined during growth in <b>reconstituted</b> apple <b>juice</b> (pH 3. 8, °Brix 11. 3) containing nisin (0 – 100 IU/mL) and lysozyme (0 – 100 mg/L). The growth curves were obtained at three temperatures of 27, 35 and 43 °C using absorbance data (OD 600 nm). Based on the results, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of nisin were found as 10 IU/mL at all tested temperatures. On the other hand, increasing the temperature decreased the amount of lysozyme for growth inhibition. The MICs of lysozyme were found as 10, 2. 5 and 1. 25 mg/L at 27, 35 and 43 °C, respectively. At selected non-inhibitory doses, nisin (1. 25 – 5 IU/mL) and lysozyme (0. 3 – 2. 5 mg/L) prolonged the lag time compared to the controls at the corresponding temperatures. In addition, {{there was a strong}} linear relationship between the lag time and lysozyme concentrations at 27 and 35 °C (R 2 > 0. 98). The results of this study demonstrated that both nisin and lysozyme could be used to inhibit the growth of A. acidoterrestris cells in the apple juice. The results also indicated that the growth parameters were variable depending on the storage temperature and the type of the antimicrobial agent used in the apple juice...|$|R
