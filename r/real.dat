5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} <b>real</b> income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} <b>real</b> income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither <b>real</b> output nor <b>real</b> investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the possible {{complexity of the}} set of <b>reals</b> belonging to an inner model M of set theory. We show that if this set is analytic then either ℵ 1 M is countable or else all <b>reals</b> are in M. We also show that if an inner model contains a superperfect set of <b>reals</b> as a subset then it contains all <b>reals.</b> On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} have an inner model M whose <b>reals</b> are an uncountable Fσ set and which does not have all <b>reals.</b> A similar construction shows that there can be an inner model M which computes correctly ℵ 1, contains a perfect set of <b>reals</b> as a subset and yet not all <b>reals</b> are in M. These results were motivated by questions of H. Friedman and K. Prikry...|$|R

5|$|Between 1961 and 1989, when <b>Real</b> {{dominated}} La Liga, only Atlético {{offered it}} any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético {{became the first}} team to beat <b>Real</b> at the Bernabéu in eight years. <b>Real</b> Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable. A high point coming in the 2002–03 season, when <b>Real</b> clinched the La Liga title after a 0–4 victory at Atlético at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came with the Copa del Rey win in May 2013. In 2013–14, <b>Real</b> and Atlético were finalists of UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from same city. <b>Real</b> Madrid triumphed with 4–1 in extra time. On 7 February 2015, <b>Real</b> suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss. On 28 May 2016, <b>Real</b> and Atlético met again for the Champions League title in Milan which resulted in a win for <b>Real</b> Madrid via Penalty Shootout.|$|E
5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of <b>real</b> estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's <b>real</b> estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing <b>real</b> estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of <b>real</b> estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of <b>real</b> estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{tactical}} battle Liverpool {{were able to}} score in the 81st minute. A throw-in from Ray Kennedy found Alan Kennedy, whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught <b>Real</b> off-guard. Kennedy went past <b>Real</b> defender Rafael García Cortés into the <b>Real</b> box, his subsequent shot beat the <b>Real</b> goalkeeper to give Liverpool the lead. Soon afterwards Liverpool replaced Dalglish with midfielder Jimmy Case {{in an attempt to}} see out the match. Although Liverpool had chances to extend their lead as <b>Real</b> went all out to score, <b>Real</b> keeper Agustín Rodríguez made a number of saves to keep his team in the game. The score remained 1–0 and Liverpool won their third European Cup, the first British club to do so. Liverpool's victory meant that Bob Paisley became the first manager to win the European Cup three times.|$|E

40|$|We extend in {{a natural}} way the {{operation}} of Turing machines to infinite ordinal time, and investigate the resulting supertask theory of computability and decidability on the <b>reals.</b> The resulting computability theory leads to a notion of computation on the <b>reals</b> and concepts of decidability and semi-decidability for sets of <b>reals</b> {{as well as individual}} <b>reals.</b> Every Pi^ 1 _ 1 set, for example, is decidable by such machines, and the semi-decidable sets form a portion of the Delta^ 1 _ 2 sets. Our oracle concept leads to a notion of relative computability for <b>reals</b> and sets of <b>reals</b> and a rich degree structure, stratified by two natural jump operators.
