40|$|Abstract — The <b>Radio</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Bearer</b> (RAB) is {{the entity}} re-sponsible for {{transporting}} radio frames of an application over the access network in UMTS. The parameters of a RAB, namely the maximum bandwidth and the allowed frame sizes, can be configured {{according to the}} requirements of the application using it. In this paper we take up the issue of identifying the optimal RAB configuration for VoIP applications. For this purpose, we have developed our own simulator, which models accurately all the aspects that have an impact onto the RAB configuration, and have evaluated the voice quality resulting from different RAB configurations. Based on the results obtained, we propose two new RAB configurations for VoIP, one when Robust Header Compression (RoHC) is used and another when it is not used...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} block {{error rate}} (BLER) {{is an important}} indicator of the link quality in UTRA. For every kind of service in UTRA a BER or BLER threshold, that still satisfies the desired quality, can be specified. Then, the target E b /N 0 for that service is the mean E b /N 0 necessary to guarantee the specified BER or BLER threshold. The knowledge of the target E b /N 0 for different services and propagation environments is fundamental for setting the outer loop in the power control algorithms, for system capacity calculations, for system planning and for radio resource management (RRM) in general. This paper presents simulation results of the downlink BER and BLER versus E b /N 0 for different services and propagation environments.

30|$|These days, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in Mobile TV broadcast services shown by customers {{as well as by}} service and network providers. Such services may be based on cellular networks as specified in Release 6 of the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) [1 – 4]. One general problem of Mobile TV broadcast services over cellular networks is the coverage, which may change depending on the user's location within a cell; that is, users at cell boundaries typically get a less strong signal than users closer to the cell center get. This affects the packet loss rate and, respectively, the network throughput, which has a noticeable influence on the received video quality. In order to become widely accepted, Mobile TV services need to offer service reliability throughout the transmission cell. Mobile TV broadcast services may be also based on other <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>bearer</b> techniques as, for example, single frequency networks of DVB-H [5] or DVB-SH [6], which may show similar problems with respect to the coverage. In this paper, we focus on cellular access bearers of 3 GPP Rel. 6 MBMS only.|$|E

Network Operators can make use of this optimization feature by properly adjusting dynamic bearer type switching in their networks. In this paper we show {{an analysis of the}} dynamic bearer type switching based on measurements in a live UMTS network in the city center of Vienna, Austria. Particularly, we present the usage probability and the runlength distribution of the three different <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>bearers</b> which are used for transmission over the UMTS DCH (Dedicated Channel) packet switched (PS) domain in DL (Down Link), namely 384 kbit/s, 128 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s bearer. For the performance evaluation of applications, system level simulators are used, where the lower layers are usually represented via stochastic models. Following the measured statistics we develop a model capable of properly describing the dynamic switching between the mentioned bearers. Furthermore, we show that a four-state Markov model with its geometrically distributed runlengths does not provide sufficient accuracy. We achieve an enhancement by using a four-state renewal process with Weibull distributed runlengths as presented in this document. I...|$|R

40|$|Multi-homing {{support in}} multi-radio {{terminals}} provides improved user experience through increased bandwidth capacity availability {{and reliability of}} wireless access. Furthermore, optimized assignment of application traffic flows to available interfaces and <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>bearer</b> services contributes to economic and power consumption efficiency. The thesis studies the traffic flow assignment problem (TFAP) in a mobile node, multi-homed {{through a set of}} different technology radio interfaces. It introduces an analytical formulation for the problem and proves its hardness through reduction from the Multiple Knapsack Problem with Assignment Restrictions. Problem solutions are approximated with a heuristic algorithm that is based on local search and is characterized by efficient execution time. The quality of approximation is rather satisfactory and is evaluated through comparison of heuristic and exact solutions for a large set of randomly generated problem instances. An evaluation of the approach through simulation also supports these findings and provides an estimation of the associated mobility management overhead. The employment of advanced network selection (or handover decision) or TFAP algorithms cannot be based solely on end-host infrastructure. The decision mechanisms require locally available information and location-based network information that is not practical to be retrieved by the mobile terminal through active scanning. Moreover, reliable and in-time information on resource availability of available access networks may not be provided by a single network operator, e. g., the home operator, as it has no incentives to provide it and let its customers utilize third-party services. The thesis proposes a system architecture for supporting the execution of handover decisions or TFAP algorithms. The architecture spans multiple administrative domains and is based on software agents. The agents represent the users, the network operators, a Multi-Access Provider and the regulatory authority. Handover or traffic flow assignment decisions are delegated to agents that are user representatives and execute in the network for saving the terminal's limited power and computational resources. Decision making is initiated by user agents that execute either in the terminal or the network, depending on the source of handover triggering events. Performance evaluation of the architecture has been performed through simulation with focus on the impact on handover latency. ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} role and {{importance}} {{of some of the}} key aspects of QoS planning, provisioning, monitoring and optimisation (QoS Management) for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) FDD networks {{within the framework of the}} 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP). Firstly, the differences between Quality of end user Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service (QoS) are explained. This is followed by a review of 3 GPP requirements for QoS concept and architecture. Then all models and the main assumptions in this dissertation are presented. Based on these, original QoS mechanisms in the radio access network domain, means and methods for QoS provisioning, planning, monitoring and "optimisation" are discussed. Simulation results showed substantial spectral efficiency gains provided by service (or user) differentiation in UTRAN by means of priorities and differentiated parameter settings. When appropriately configured, the proposed QoS mechanisms can greatly reduce the need for bandwidth. Performance results proved also the proposed virtual time simulator to be an appropriate tool for service driven WCDMA radio interface dimensioning and detailed radio network planning. It is also shown that measuring QoS performance by a proper classification of counters (and or gauges), based on a particular subset of <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>bearer</b> attributes, is a promising technique for assessing performances of service applications through WCDMA networks. With this new method there is no need to trace upper layer protocols at different interfaces or dumping data in mobile terminals. The proposed metrics allow operators to measure the bandwidth required for robust statistical reliability, to assess and exploit statistical sharing of resources, to configure QoS functions effectively, and to monitor QoE. The application of the proposed technique is not limited to the WCDMA Radio Network Subsystem (RNS), yet it can be deployed in any radio access and packet core network supporting mapping of performance indicators onto a particular subset of QoS attributes. Finally, in order to maximise the performance of the available services in UTRAN, at a given QoE, simulation results showed clear needs for the network administrator to adapt the parameter settings to diverse input application traffic conditions and the proposed genetic approach to be an appropriate solution space search algorithm for this purpose. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the state of}} the art for IP {{networks}} and the two most predominant wireless access networks, UMTS and Wireless LANs, has been reviewed with respect to the enhancements required toward the objective of supporting services across different network technologies in a seamless manner. Three main areas of research were identified as key in the path toward All-IP networks: i) IP-based mobility management, ii) IP-based UMTS Radio Access Networks and iii) QoS for Wireless LANs. Future All-IP networks require of an IP-based mobility management protocol to support mobility across heterogeneous networks. Several protocols are being proposed in the IETF for this purpose with Mobile IPv 6, Hierarchical Mobile IPv 6 and Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv 6 being the ones with a higher acceptance. Our contribution in this area has been the thorough study of the performance enhancements provided by each protocol and their associated costs in realistic scenarios to support the design process of Mobile IPv 6 -based networks where the suitability of the different options has to be evaluated. In addition, we proposed a combination of Hierarchical Mobile IPv 6 and Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv 6, based on the description provided in the Hierarchical Mobile IPv 6 draft, that aims to outperform both proposals by adding the advantages of each of them. During the evaluation of the IP-based mobility management protocols, the mobility model influence over the performance results led to an additional line of study where the main characteristics of the Random Waypoint mobility model were analyzed. The random waypoint model is a commonly used mobility model for simulations of wireless communication networks. We gave a formal description of this model in terms of a discrete- time stochastic process which provides a deep understanding on the characteristics of the mobility created by its usage. The results of our work are of practical value for performance analysis of communication networks to avoid misinterpretation of simulation results. UMTS networks being deployed today based on the Release' 99 specifications use ATM transport in the Radio Access Network (RAN). The specifications for future releases include options to support IP transport in the RAN, however, several challenges are introduced with regard to a significant increase in the transport protocol overhead and the provision of QoS guarantees. These challenges have to be addressed to ensure an efficient usage of the scarce RAN resources. Our work focused first in reducing the resources needed in the air interface for the expected most relevant application in future 3 G networks, Voice over IP (VoIP). We designed a <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>bearer</b> for VoIP when Robust Header Compression (RoHC) is used that reduces in about 50 % the resources required in the air interface. Then, a multiplexing scheme for the reduction of the overhead in the wired part of the RAN that allows QoS differentiated scheduling was described and evaluated. The results showed an increase in the efficiency of the RAN resources usage between 100 % and 260 %, in our scenarios, when combined with RoHC. Finally, we proposed and evaluated a QoS differentiated scheduling mechanism based on Earliest-Deadline-First that fulfills the RAN specific synchronization requirements while providing the QoS differentiation required by the applications. The IEEE 802. 11 standard presents relevant defficiencies in order to support applications with QoS requirements. The integration of the Wireless LAN technology in future All-IP networks heavily depends on the success of the upcoming 802. 11 e standard which extends the 802. 11 MAC layer to provide QoS guarantees. With our work in this area we contributed to the 802. 11 e research standardization effort and designed three extensions of the 802. 11 MAC layer to provide delay guarantees (DIME-EF) and bandwidth guarantees, absolute (ARME) or relative (DWFQ). Moreover, we analyzed the implications of introducing Wireless LAN capabilities in battery limited mobile devices as for example cellular phones. Based on the significant impact observed of the 802. 11 power save mode over the 802. 11 e QoS mechanisms we designed and evaluated a solution that provides a soft upper bound of the data frames downlink delay according to the downlink frame interarrival time while minimizing the battery consumption.
