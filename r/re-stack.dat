30|$|In summary, TNTs/GO nanocomposites were {{prepared}} through a facile solution method. The as-prepared TNTs/GO nano-filler can simultaneously improve the flame retardancy and photodegradability of PVC, {{which could be}} attributed to the synergistic effects between TNTs and GO. On the one hand, TNTs can suppress the <b>re-stack</b> of GO and promote the uniform dispersion of TNTs/GO in the PVC matrix; GO nanosheets can act as electron acceptors to reduce the charge resistance and charge recombination rate, and the GO skeleton can also act as a template for the carbonaceous char and promote the formation of multiple char under the help of TNTs. On the other hand, titanium dioxide transformed from TNTs during combustion can be anchored in the char layers to enhance the thermal stability of the char layers and accelerate the photodegradation of PVC matrix under UV irradiation. As a result, TNTs/GO-PVC composites exhibit enhanced flame retardancy and photodegradability than TNTs-PVC and GO-PVC counterparts. The present research, hopefully, would help to provide a promising strategy for constructing polymer-matrix composites with simultaneously improved flame retardancy and photodegradability, thereby shedding light on dealing with the white pollution of commonly used polymers. Further researches are to be conducted concerning the enhancement in the flame-retardant and photodegradation efficiencies of the TNTs/GO nano-filler.|$|E

30|$|In general, active {{materials}} for electrodes with larger surface areas show higher capacitances and stabilities. Two-dimensional (2 D) monolayer LDH nanosheets with extremely large surface areas {{can be prepared}} by a top-down method, in which LDH nanoplates are first prepared and then exfoliated in liquid medium by ultrasonic treatment [26]. However, the nanosheets prefer to <b>re-stack</b> to reduce the surface free energy, which is detrimental to the capacitance and stability of the electrodes. It has been accepted that three-dimensional (3 D) hierarchical structures composed of 2 D nanosheets are more stable than 2 D nanosheets [27, 28]. The unique structure is beneficial to charge and mass transport and the mitigation of volume change during the charge/discharge process [29]. Furthermore, 3 D hierarchical structures can supply more points to connect the conductive matrix in the electrodes, which can provide more electron paths and suppress the separation of {{active materials}} [30, 31, 32]. On the other hand, {{the stability of the}} layered compounds can be improved by modification with organic compounds because they can intercalate and/or adsorb into the layers to reduce the surface energy [33, 34, 35, 36] and further prevent the re-stacking of nanosheets [37]. For example, Xiao et al. found that MoS 2 /PEO [poly(ethylene oxide)] nanocomposites had high reversible capacities with long-term reversibility because the incorporation of PEO can stabilize the disordered structure of MoS 2 [38].|$|E

This paper briefly describes the solenoid and the experimental results obtained during 4. 4 K and 1. 9 K tests. The split solenoid consists of two coils (25 mm inner diameter, 51. 1 mm outer diameter, 12. 9 mm height). The coils were initially separately tested, in an iron mirror configuration, and then tested together in split solenoid configuration. In all the tests at 4. 4 K the coils reached a current higher than 95 % of their short sample limits at the first quench; in split solenoid configuration the maximum field values in the coils and in the aperture were respectively 10. 7 T and 12. 5 T. At 1. 9 K the coils had premature quenches due to self field instability despite the rather high RRR of the two coils (190 and 270).

40|$|Recent advancements in the {{critical}} current density (Jc) of Nb 3 Sn conductors, coupled with a large effective filament size, have drawn attention {{to the problem of}} magnetothermal instabilities. At low magnetic fields, the quench current of such high Jc Nb 3 Sn strands is significantly lower than their critical current because of the above-mentioned instabilities. An adiabatic model to calculate the minimum current at which a strand can quench due to magneto-thermal instabilities is developed. The model is based on an 'integral' approach already used elsewhere [1]. The main difference with respect to the previous model is the addition of the self-field effect that allows to describe premature quenches of non-magnetized Nb 3 Sn strands and to better calculate the quench current of strongly magnetized strands. The model is in good agreement with experimental results at 4. 2 K obtained at Fermilab using virgin Modified Jelly Roll (MJR) strands with a low Residual Resistivity Ratio (RRR) of the stabilizing copper.

This paper reports the beneficial effects of GNSs with a low percolation threshold on electrochemical performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) anodes. The experimental results show that the GNSs with a diameter of 46 μm and a thickness of 4. 5 nm have a percolation threshold of 1. 8 wt%. The prediction based on the interparticle distance concept gives a percolation threshold of 0. 54 wt% for GNSs, which is almost an order of magnitude lower than that for CB particles. The substantially low percolation along with a high electrical conductivity of GNSs explains why the LTO anodes containing only 5 wt% GNSs deliver a much better rate capability than those with 15 wt% CB.

40|$|We {{consider}} an optimization problem of sequencing {{the operations of}} cranes that are used for internal movement of containers in maritime ports. Some features of this problem have been studied in the literature as the stacker crane problem (SCP). However, the scope of most literature (including SCP) is restricted to minimizing the route or distance traveled by cranes and the resulting movement-related costs. In practice, cargo containers are generally stacked or piled up in multiple separate columns, heaps or stacks at ports. So, the cranes need to often rearrange or shuffle such container stacks, in order to pick up any required container. If substantial <b>re-stacking</b> is involved, cranes expend considerable effort in container stack rearrangement operations. The problem of minimizing the total efforts/time of the crane must therefore account for both - the stack rearrangement costs and also the movement-related (route distance) costs. The consolidated problem differs from standard route distance minimization situations if stack rearrangement activities are considered. We formally define the consolidated problem, identify its characteristic features and hence devise suitable models for it. We formulate several alternative MIP approaches to solve the problem.

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are made up of positively charged brucite-like layers with an interlayer region containing charge compensating anions and solvation molecules, are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to the synergistic effects of bi-metal cations, such as reciprocal activation [15, 16]. However, the migration of metal cations can be limited by other cations, which can suppress the aggregation and growth of the active materials [17, 18]. Co–Al-LDHs with divalent Co 2 + ions and trivalent Al 3 + ions {{are one of the most}} commonly studied LDHs because of their excellent electrochemical properties [19, 20, 21]. However, the specific capacitance, rate capability, and stability are usually poor because of the limited conductivity and the <b>re-stacking</b> of 2 D nanosheets [22, 23]. Compositing with highly conductive substrates, such as Ni foil or carbon materials, is considered an effective method to improve the performance of Co–Al-LDHs. For example, the porous Co–Al-LDHs/GO (GO, graphene oxide) nanocomposite exhibits a specific capacitance of 1043  F g− 1 at 1  A g− 1 [24].

However, the cycling stability of LDHs is usually less than 5000 cycles (Table S 1), which is far from the practical demand of 100, 000 – 200, 000 cycles. Therefore, the stability of Co–Al-LDHs is the most prominent problem to overcome.|$|R

Chapter 1 An Overview of Coordination Polymer (CP) Compounds This chapter presents a brief introduction to coordination polymer (CP) compounds. Starting from the brief historical background on coordination compounds, this chapter shed light on some earlier developments in this family of compounds by Yaghi, Robson and others. The usefulness of carboxylate and imidazolates in construction of some important coordination polymer compounds like MOF- 5, HKUST- 1, ZIFs, MIL- 53, UiO- 66, CD-MOF- 1 etc has been described in detail along with its properties. The coordination polymers exhibit many important properties and some of the properties like sorption, separation, ionic conductivity, catalysis and ferroelectricity have been discussed briefly and summerized. Chapter 1 also provides the general synthetic and characterization approaches that have been employed during the present studies. Chapter 2 Part A: Adenine Based Coordination Polymers with Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acids This chapter presents the synthesis, structure and properties of four new coordination polymers [Zn 4 (C 8 H 10 O 4) 2. 5 (C 5 H 4 N 5) 3. 2 H 2 O]. 7 H 2 O. 2 DMA (I), [Cd 3 (C 8 H 10 O 4) 2 (C 5 H 4 N 5) 2. H 2 O] (II), [Cd(C 8 H 11 O 4) 2 (C 5 H 5 N 5) 2. 2 H 2 O] (III), [Cd(C 8 H 10 O 4) (C 7 H 8 N 5 O). H 2 O]. 4 H 2 O (IV), (CHDA = cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, ad = adenine, DMA = dimethylacetamide, 9 -HEA = 9 -hydroxyethyl adenine). The compound I and II forms three-dimensional structure having distinct arrangements of 1, 4 -CHDA and adenine units with Zn and Cd metals respectively. The molecular complex unit is observed in compound III with 1, 2 -CHDA and adenine. Compound IV forms two-dimensional structure with 9 -HEA and 1, 2 -CHDA. The observation of base-pairing interactions in the above compounds is noteworthy. In compounds I, II and IV amino groups are appears to be free and utilized for the detection of nitro aromatic explosives through fluorescence quenching. The results revealed that the emission behavior of the present compounds is greatly influenced by the hydroxyl nitroaromatic analyses like indophenol, dinitrophenyl and trinitrophenols with very low detection limits. The compound I also exhibits considerable sensitivity towards metal ion detection, especially Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +, Cr 3 +, Ag+ and Hg 2 + ions in solution. The presence of free nitrogen sites in compound II has been explored for the base catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation reaction, the quantitative yields are observed with various aldehyde substrates. Part B: Adenine Based Coordination Polymer with Oxydiacetic acid: [Cd 2 (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 5 H 5 N 5) ]. H 2 O. DMA The synthesis, structure and properties of a Cd based coordination polymer with oxydiacetic acid and adenine, [Cd 2 (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 5 H 5 N 5) ]. H 2 O. DMA is described. The compound has a two-dimensional structure formed by the connectivity involving Cd and oxydiacetic acid. The adenine ligand binds with the Cd metal center through the pyrimidine nitrogen and hangs in the inter layer spaces. The layers are stacked in a ABAB [...] fashion and the inter layer spaces occupied by the dimethyl amine and water molecules. The water molecules are very labile and its removal can be accomplished by heating the sample at 100 °C, which is also confirmed by the single crystal XRD, PXRD and IR studies. The availability of free amino groups of adenine molecule has been utilized for the detection of nitroaromatics, especially nitrophenols with good sensitivity. The amino group was also found to be useful in catalyzing Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Chapter 3 : Rare-Earth Metal Carboxylates: Ln 2 (µ 3 -OH) (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4) ]. 2 H 2 O [Ln=Ce, Pr and Nd] This chapter describes synthesis, structure and properties of series of rare-earth based compounds, [Ln 2 (µ 3 -OH) (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4) ]. 2 H 2 O (Ln = Ce, Pr and Nd). The malic acid and fumaric acid form part of the structure. The lanthanide centers are connected by the malate units to form a two dimensional layers, which are pillared by fumarate units forming the three-dimensional structure. Overall, structure can be described as I 2 O 1 type inorganic in two-dimension (Ln-O-Ln layers) and organic in one dimension. The extra framework water molecules form a dimer and occupy the channels. The robustness of the framework was reflected in terms of facile removal and reinsertion of the water molecules, which is also confirmed by single crystal XRD, variable temperature IR and cyclic TGA study. The presence of water dimers and weakly interacting water chain suggested the possibility of proton migration in these compounds. Proton conductivity studies reveal the conductivity values of ~ 2. 85 x 10 - 6 Ω- 1 cm- 1 at 98 % relative humidity. The optical studies revealed an up-conversion behavior involving more than one photon for the neodymium compound. Chapter 4 : Bismuth Carboxylates with Brucite and Fluorite Related Structures The synthesis, structure and properties of three new bismuth based coordination polymers have been described in this chapter. The compounds [C 4 N 2 H 10][Bi(C 7 H 4 NO 4) (C 7 H 3 NO 4) ]. H 2 O (I), [Bi(C 5 H 3 N 2 O 4) (C 5 H 2 N 2 O 4) ] (II) and [Bi(µ 2 -OH) (C 7 H 3 NO 4) ] (III) were isolated employing hydrothermal condition with three different heterocyclicdicarboxylic acids, 3, 6 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 4, 5 -imidazoledicarboxylic acid and 3, 4 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid respectively. The structures of all the compounds have linkages between Bi 2 O 2 and the corresponding dicarboxylate forming a simple molecular unit in I, a bilayer arrangement in II and a three-dimensional extended structure in III. The topological arrangement of the nodal building units in the structures resembles brucite related layers in II and fluorite related arrangement in compound III. By utilizing the secondary interactions, the structure of III can be correlated to a Kagome related net. The observation of such classical inorganic related structures in the bismuth carboxylates is noteworthy. Heterogeneous catalytic studies indicate Lewis acidic nature in the bismuth center in all three compounds. Chapter 5 : Solvent dependent Delamination, Restacking and Ferroelectric studies in a Two-Dimensional Compound [NH 4][Ag 3 (C 9 H 5 NO 4 S) 2 (C 13 H 14 N 2) 2]. 8 H 2 O This chapter describes synthesis, structure, water dependent delamination/restacking and ferroelectric behavior in a layered coordination polymer compound, [NH 4][Ag 3 (C 9 H 5 NO 4 S) 2 (C 13 H 14 N 2) 2]. 8 H 2 O. The compound has a two-dimensional structure with the water molecules occupying the inter-lamellar spaces. The lattice water molecules can be fully removed and reinserted, which accompany the crystalline-amorphous-crystalline transformation. This transformation resembles the collapse/delamination and <b>re-stacking</b> of the layers. This transformation has also been investigated by in-situ IR and PXRD studies. The presence of a natural dipole (anionic framework and cationic ammonium ions) along with the non-centrosymmetric space group gives rise to a room-temperature ferroelectric behavior to the compound with saturation polarization (Ps) of 1. 95 μC/cm 2 and remnant polarization of 0. 63 μC/cm 2. The temperature dependent dielectric measurements indicate that the ferroelectric-paraelectric transformation occurs at 320 K. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transformation also follows the crystalline-amorphous-crystalline transitions...|$|R
