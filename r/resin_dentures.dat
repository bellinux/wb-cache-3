40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Acrylic resin {{complete}} dentures exhibit certain unavoidable dimensional changes. Processing shrinkage {{and expansion}} due to water uptake are 2 important aspects influencing dimensional accuracy. PURPOSE: This study investigated linear dimensional changes and water sorption of dentures processed by dry and wet heat with different rates of cooling. METHODS: Fine crosses marked on tinfoil inserts were {{placed at the}} incisive papilla and tuberosity regions of edentulous maxillary casts and incorporated into the dentures during polymerization by 3 processing techniques. A traveling microscope {{was used to measure}} the distances between the reference points to determine dimensional changes. Water uptake and content were determined by the mass changes of the dentures with an electronic balance. Data of linear dimensional change and water sorption were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance, respectively. Bonferroni simultaneous confidence intervals (95 %) were applied for multiple comparison. RESULTS: Dry heat-processed and water bath-processed acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>dentures</b> did not exhibit significant differences in shrinkage (0. 42 % to 0. 58 %) at water saturation. Amounts of water sorption of dentures processed by dry and wet heat (0. 50 and 0. 48 mass%, respectively) were not significantly different, and their associated expansion did not entirely compensate for the processing shrinkage. The initial water content of dry heat-processed dentures (1. 77 mass%) was unexpectedly slightly higher than that of wet heat-processed dentures (1. 68 mass%). The rate at which the dentures cooled did not affect their initial water content and subsequent water uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Water uptake of dry and wet heat-processed acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>dentures</b> after deflasking was in both cases low, and the dentures did not reveal significant differences in shrinkage at water saturation. Air oven-processed and water bath-processed acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>dentures</b> show similar dimensional shrinkage at water saturation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Impact failure outside the mouth and flexure fatigue failure in the mouth are two most important causes of fracture of denture base. Aim: This study evaluated the transverse deflection and transverse strength of four commercial brands of heat cure acrylic resin (Stellon, Acrylin-H, Trevalon and Trevalon-HI). Materials and Methods: An experimental design was adapted. Twenty-four rectangular strip specimens, six for each group, were prepared. Strips were finished on the edges and equally from the both the molded surfaces to make strips of specific dimensions. The tests were conducted mainly in accordance with the American Dental Association Specification no. 12 /ISO: 1567 - 1981 (ISO: 6887 - 1986) for denture base polymer. The transverse deflection and transverse strength were measured by Instron testing machine. Intergroup differences were assessed using student "t" test.

Materials and Methods: Maxillary casts with shallow and deep palatal forms were selected and duplicated to make 10 casts of each palatal form. Base plates were constructed and teeth were arranged in their anatomic positions. Metal pins with true apex were placed on the central groove of the right and left first molars and one on the incisive papilla area as a reference point. Casts were scanned using i-CAT Vision Q 1. 9 (i-CAT cone beam 3 D dental imaging system by Imaging Sciences International, PA, USA), which has 360 ° rotational tomography. The distances between the apices of metallic pin inserts on the teeth and fitted point of reference were recorded in buccopalatal axes at waxed up stage, after deflasking, and after finishing and polishing. Results: Results showed a statistically significant movement of teeth in shallow and deep palatal forms during all stages of complete denture processing. In shallow palatal form dentures, there was a significant tooth movement in palatal direction between Stages 1 and 2 (P ≤ 0. 05) and buccal movement between Stages 2 and 3.

40|$|Purpose: In implant {{retained}} {{soft tissue}} supported type dentures functioning of attachments, presented bytheir producers as mechanically bio-compatible {{because of the}} ensured freedom of rotational displacements isaccompanied by numerous problems {{that seem to be}} caused by excessive bearing of occlusal loads. Design/methodology/approach: For the purposes of attachments loadings evaluation, built was a threedimensionalFEM model of a denture situated on an atrophic prosthetic foundation with joint supports assumed inthe area of denture attachment to implants. Analysis of attachments loadings has been carried out under unilateraloblique occlusal forces of 100 N in molars and incisors zones. Findings: Used methodology made it possible to determine attachments loading in a quantitative manner. Inspite of free rotational movements implantological supports bear significant part of horizontal occlusal forcescomponents, which reach the value of 66 N during chewing processes. Research limitations/implications: Examined was only the most commonly used type of attachments. Hence,further studies, apart from constrains enabling rotational movements introduced should be also an axial compliancewhich is already offered by some types of attachments, and which additionally enables sedimentation of thedenture towards the axes of implants. Practical implications: Analysis of loadings related to implantological attachments in case of assuming onlya vertical component of occlusal forces leads to a significant underestimation of implantological supports loadsvalues. In the presented analysis, taking into account the influence of the obliquely acting occlusal forces that occurin real chewing conditions, it has been proved that freedom of rotational movements of overdenture`s attachmentsdoes not allow to use the natural supports of mucous membrane. That explains the reason of attachments andacrylic <b>resin</b> <b>dentures</b> damages, as well as the significant number of lost implants of upper denture resultingfrom biomechanical causes. In clinical practice, achieved should be the most anterior implants’ placement, andespecially in case of flat ridges {{because of the lack of}} any bearing surface.

40|$|Statement of problem. Colonization of denture soft lining {{materials}} by Candida albicans {{can result}} in clinical problems. Two experimental silicone soft lining materials have been developed and demonstrate good physical properties. Purpose of study. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the extent of candidal adherence to these materials compared with a commercially available soft lining material and an acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> base. Material and methods. The experimental materials were constructed in a stainless-steel mold, and their surface energies were determined with a dynamic contact angle analyzer. The adherence of three strains of C. albicans was determined with an in vitro assay. In addition, one test strain was used to determine the effect on adherence of precoating the materials with whole saliva. Results. Adhesion to all materials was strain variable, with the lowest adherence recorded for the two experimental materials. Decreased adherence was also apparent after precoating the materials with saliva. Correlation between surface energy of the material and the degree of candidal adhesion was seen for one strain, but no correlation was seen for the other two strains. Conclusion. Adherence of C. albicans to the two experimental silicone soft lining materials was significantly less than that for an acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> base and a commercially available soft lining material...|$|R
40|$|Incorporation of 5 {{layers of}} woven, high-modulus {{polyethylene}} fiber into acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> bases produces substantial improvements in mechanical properties and dimensional changes. A modified split-pack technique {{has been developed}} using conventional dental-laboratory compression molding to accommodate multiple layers of woven fabric in complete denture bases. A recess formed in the resin by a spacer allows the reinforcement to be embedded in the denture base without exposing the fibers. Embedded fibers do not compromise the esthetics of complete dentures.

This study evaluated the influence of microwave treatment on dimensional accuracy along the posterior palatal border of maxillary acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> bases processed by water-bath curing. Thirty maxillary acrylic bases (3 -mm-thick) were made on cast models with Clássico acrylic resin using routine technique. After polymerization and cooling, the sets were deflasked and the bases were stored in water for 30 days. Thereafter, the specimens were assigned to 3 groups (n= 10), as follows: group I (control) was not submitted to any disinfection cycle; group II was submitted to microwave disinfection for 3 min at 500 W; and in group III microwaving was done for 10 min at 604 W. The acrylic bases were fixed on their respective casts with instant adhesive (Super Bonder®) and the base/cast sets were sectioned transversally in the posterior palatal zone. The existence of gaps between the casts and acrylic bases was assessed using a profile projector at 5 points. No statistically significant differences were observed between the control group and group II. However, group III differed statistically from the others (p< 0. 05). Treatment in microwave oven at 604 W for 10 min produced the greatest discrepancies in the adaptation of maxillary acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> bases to the stone casts...|$|R
40|$|Graptophyllum pictum, in Indonesian {{is named}} ‘daun ungu’, {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} plants usually used as haemorrhoids medicament in Indonesia; it is composed from alkaloid, pectin, saponin, tannin, flavonoid and alcohol. Graptophyllum pictum is able to prevent the growth of Streptococcus mutans. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effect of Graptophyllum pictum extract toward the growth of plaque on acrylic <b>resin</b> complete <b>denture.</b> For this plaque growth research, 40 samples of acrylic <b>resin</b> complete <b>denture</b> were used, which divided into four groups. Those samples were first treated by cleansing each denture from saliva with running water. The existence of plaque on the complete denture was known by means of disclosing agent. The plaque was then scored by using modified Quigley Hein index, in this case until the plaque was scored zero. The second treatment was soaking the Group I to IV denture samples in Graptophyllum pictum extract with various concentration 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 40 %, each for 15 minutes. Following this, the dentures were worn by the patients again for four hours, and then removed and washed with water. Then the disclosing agent were rubbed on the dentures and subsequently washed with water. The obtained data were analyzed by One-way variant analysis and t-test. The study result showed there were significant differences among the growth of plaque on acrylic <b>resin</b> complete <b>denture</b> which was soaked in different concentration of Graptophyllum pictum extract (p < 0. 05). Regarding this result it can be concluded that Graptophyllum pictum extract could inhibit the plaque growth on acrylic <b>resin</b> complete <b>denture.</b> And it seems also that the highest plaque growth inhibition on acrylic <b>resin</b> complete <b>denture</b> is caused by the 40 % concentration extract of Graptophyllum pictum. </span...|$|R
40|$|Denture {{stomatitis}} is a {{very common}} disease affecting the oral mucosa of denture wearers. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the antifungal effect of henna against Candida albicans adhered to acrylic resin as a possible method for prevention of denture stomatitis. One-hundred-eighty acrylic plates were prepared of heat-cured acrylic <b>denture</b> <b>resin.</b> The specimens were divided into six groups of 30 samples each. The first group was only polymer and monomer following the conventional manufacturer instruction for processing complete dentures. The other five groups were processed by adding different concentration of Yamani henna powder (Harazi) to the polymer in a concentration of henna: polymer 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 %, respectively. Samples were incubated in artificial saliva rich with Candida albicans at 37 °C, and the effect of henna on Candida albicans was evaluated in two different methods: semi-quantitative slide count and a culture-based quantitative assay (quantitative). Variation in the number of live Candida was observed with the increase in the concentration of Yamani henna powder. It was observed that the variation in live Candida, between control group and group B (concentration of Yamani henna powder was 1 %), was statistically significant with a p-value of 0. 0001. Similarly, variations in live Candida were significant, when the concentration of powder was 7. 5 % or 10 % in contrast with control group and p-values were 0. 0001 and 0. 001 respectively. Adding henna to acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> could be effective in controlling Candida albicans proliferation on the denture surface; however, its effects on the physical properties of acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> need further studies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{discoloration}} of acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> bases {{may lead}} to significant esthetic problems. The aim of this in vitro {{study was to investigate}} the effects of frequently consumed drinks on the color changes of fresh and aged, heat-polymerized, conventional acrylic resin. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four, heat-polymerized acrylic resin specimens (4 mm x 5 mm x 30 mm) were fabricated. Half of the specimens were aged by thermal cycling (between 5 °C and 55 °C, 60 -second dwell time, 3000 cycles). The specimens were stored at 37 °C in different drinks as non-aged and aged subgroups including water (control group), black tea, green tea, sour cherry juice, coke and coffee (n= 7). The discoloration of each specimen after 1 and 7 days storage in the drinks were measured by a colorimeter based on CIE Lab system. The data of colour differences (ΔE) were analyzed by ANOVA and Dunnet’s tests. Results: Thermal cycling and storage in water induced a slight color change. The highest ΔE values were observed in the aged groups, which was also noticeable for black tea and sour cherry juice after 7 days of storage (ΔE> 1. 5) (p< 0. 05). The ΔE values of all test groups were detected within the acceptable clinical limits (ΔE< 3. 5). Conclusion: These results suggest that the color stability of <b>denture</b> base acrylic <b>resins</b> is influenced by ageing. Black tea, sour cherry juice and coke can cause significant discolorations on acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> bases...|$|R

Ten acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>denture</b> teeth brands were evaluated: Art Plus (AP), Biolux (BX), Biotone IPN (BI), Magister (MG), Mondial 6 (MD), Premium 6 (PR), SR Vivodent PE (SR), Trilux (TR), Trubyte Biotone (TB), and Vipi Dent Plus (VP). Teeth were immersed in staining solutions (coffee, cola, and orange juice) or artificial saliva (control) (n = 6) for 1, 7, 15, or 30 days. Specimen colors were evaluated spectrophotometrically {{based on the}} Commission Internationale d'Eclairage L*a*b* system. Color differences (Delta E) were calculated between the baseline and post-staining results. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance and Tukey test (alpha = 0. 05). BI (1. 82 +/- 0. 95) and TR (1. 78 +/- 0. 72) teeth exhibited the greatest Delta E values, while BX (0. 88 +/- 0. 43) and MD (1. 09 +/- 0. 44) teeth were the lowest, regardless of solution and measurement period, and were different from BI and TR teeth (P < 0. 05). Cola and coffee promoted higher denture teeth color alterations than orange juice and saliva (P < 0. 05). Saliva generated the lowest denture teeth color alterations. Greater immersion times caused higher denture teeth color changes.
