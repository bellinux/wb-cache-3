40|$|Purpose: To examine {{changes in}} weight, strength, {{fluoride}} release, and surface {{changes to the}} polyacid-modified resin composite Dyract after immersion in various media for periods up to 16 weeks. Materials and Methods: Properties investigated were change in weight, strength, release of fluoride ions, and surface changes. Specimens were immersed in <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>deionized</b> <b>water</b> (ROW) and in acetate buffer solutions containing calcium hydrogen orthophosphate. The acetate media were of pH 3, pH 5 and pH 7. All solutions were maintained at 37 °C without agitation. Solutions were changed weekly and retained for fluoride analysis and specimens were weighed each week. After periods of 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, some specimens were subjected to shear punch testing and SEM examination. Results: All specimens except those in pH 3 medium gained weight for the first 2 - 5 weeks after which weight was lost until all specimens weighed less than at the commencement of the study. The specimens in pH 3 medium lost considerable weight from weeks 1 and 2. SEM examination showed disintegration of the surface of all specimens examined. Fluoride release peaked at 1 week in all specimens except those in pH 3 medium. Fluoride release was highest in pH 3 media (approximately 46 ppm) after 1 week and remained high for 7 weeks, after which it was reduced to about 50 % of the initial release. Specimens stored in ROW and pH 5 media released approximately 5 ppm after 1 week, and this was reduced to approximately 1 ppm (pH 7) and 2 ppm (ROW) by week 6...|$|E

There are also EDI units that are often referred to as continuous electrodeionization (CEDI) since the electric current regenerates the resin mass continuously.

30|$|Researchers are immensely {{interested}} in nanoparticles synthesis by physical or chemical means and nanoparticles synthesized through these routes are designated as engineered nanoparticles (ENPs). Moreover, improper disposal of ENPs lead to {{their exposure to}} environment and different ecosystems. In the past few years, interest in extracellular synthesis of nanoparticles mainly by fungi has been increased due to easy synthesis, less toxicity, less downstream processing and better optimization control (Pooja et al. 2014). In extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles from fungi, firstly biomass is allowed to grow in suitable medium. Fungi respond to different cultural conditions and compositions differently and secrete different metabolites and different kinds of proteins. Fully grown biomass is harvested and separated completely from media components, which is then transferred to <b>deionized</b> <b>water.</b> In water, enzymes or proteins and metabolites have been secreted by fungal biomass through <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b> In the subsequent stages, removal of biomass from <b>deionized</b> <b>water</b> (cell free filtrate) consists of specific enzymes which catalyze the reduction of aqueous silver ions for synthesis of AgNPs (Birla et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comparison}} of the theoretical and actual energy requirements of forward <b>osmosis</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> seawater desalination. We argue that <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> is significantly more energy efficient and that forward osmosis research efforts would best be fully oriented towards alternate applications. The underlying reason for the inefficiency of forward osmosis is the draw-dilution step, which increases the theoretical and actual energy requirements for draw regeneration. As a consequence, for a forward osmosis technology to compete with <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> the regeneration process must be significantly more efficient than <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b> However, even considering the optimisation of the draw solution and the benefits of reduced fouling during regeneration, the efficiency of an optimal draw regeneration process and of <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> are unlikely to differ significantly, meaning the energy efficiency of direct desalination with <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> is likely to be superior...|$|R
40|$|In this study, fouling {{behavior}} of alginic acid onto {{four types of}} hand-cast and one commercially-available seawater <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes was investigated. Hand-cast membranes included a polyamide thin film composite and a zeolite-polyamide thin film nanocomposite, as well as poly(vinyl alcohol) coated versions of both. Flux decline due to fouling and the structural features of the fouling layers formed during seawater desalination experiments were analyzed using classic Kozeny–Carman cake filtration theory along with a more recently developed crossflow model. Initial rates of flux decline correlated strongly with membrane permeability and root-mean-squared roughness and moderately with alginate–membrane interfacial free energy. The porosity (i. e., hydraulic resistance) of the fouling layers correlated strongly with <b>deionized</b> <b>water</b> contact angle and moderately with surface area difference of the membranes. The contact angle of the membranes also heavily impacted the fouling layer mass and thickness. Membranes with high permeability, strong alginate–membrane interfacial energy of adhesion, and hydrophobic surfaces had the highest propensity for fouling by low porosity, high specific resistance cake layers. Results indicate that <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> membranes should be produced with hydrophilic, smooth, and large peak-to-peak surfaces {{in order to reduce}} flux decline due to cake layer formation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> {{has been}} used for the {{production}} of demineralised water for over 30 years. In <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis,</b> water is transported across a membrane under high pressure, leaving a product that consists mainly of water and a concentrate containing most other components such as minerals and unwanted residues. Many contaminants, including iron, manganese, ammonium, traces of pesticides and medicines, organic micro pollutants, and radioactive particles can be removed with <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> alone. This efficiency has made <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> the primary method of water purification, often being used in combination with other methods, as a final treatment. A downside to <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> is that the removing of most minerals from water can have negative effects on its taste.

40|$|A cost {{analysis}} reveals that hybridisation of electrodialysis with <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> is only justified if {{the cost of}} water from the <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> unit is less than 40 % of that from a stand-alone electrodialysis system. In such cases the additional <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> costs justify the electrodialysis cost savings brought about by shifting salt removal to higher salinity, where current densities are higher and equipment costs lower. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that a simple hybrid configuration is more cost effective than a recirculated hybrid, a simple hybrid being one where the <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> concentrate is fed to the electrodialysis stack and the products from both units are blended, and a recirculated being one hybrid involving recirculation of the electrodialysis product back to the <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> unit. The underlying rationale is that simple hybridisation shifts salt removal away from the lowest salinity zone of operation, where salt removal is most expensive. Further shifts in the salinity at which salt is removed, brought about by recirculation, do not justify the associated increased costs of <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b> Hugh Hampton Young Memorial FellowshipCenter for Clean Water and Clean Energy at MIT and KFUPM (Project R 15 -CW- 11...|$|R
