5000|$|Many of the {{classical}} techniques and theories of psychophysics were formulated in 1860 when Gustav Theodor Fechner in Leipzig published Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics). He coined the term [...] "psychophysics", describing research intended to relate physical stimuli to the contents of consciousness such as sensations (Empfindungen). As a physicist and philosopher, Fechner aimed at developing a method that relates matter to the mind, connecting the publicly observable world and a person's privately experienced impression of it. His ideas were inspired by experimental results on the sense of touch and light obtained in the early 1830s by the German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber in Leipzig, most notably those on the minimum discernible difference in intensity of stimuli of moderate strength (just noticeable difference; jnd) which Weber had {{shown to be a}} constant fraction of the <b>reference</b> <b>intensity,</b> and which Fechner referred to as Weber's law. From this, Fechner derived his well-known logarithmic scale, now known as Fechner scale. Weber's and Fechner's work formed one of the bases of psychology as a science, with Wilhelm Wundt founding the first laboratory for psychological research in Leipzig (Institut für experimentelle Psychologie). Fechner's work systematised the introspectionist approach (psychology as the science of consciousness), that had to contend with the Behaviorist approach in which even verbal responses are as physical as the stimuli. During the 1930s, when psychological research in Nazi Germany essentially came to a halt, both approaches eventually began to be replaced by use of stimulus-response relationships as evidence for conscious or unconscious processing in the mind. Fechner's work was studied and extended by Charles S. Peirce, who was aided by his student Joseph Jastrow, who soon became a distinguished experimental psychologist in his own right. Peirce and Jastrow largely confirmed Fechner's empirical findings, but not all. In particular, a classic experiment of Peirce and Jastrow rejected Fechner's estimation of a threshold of perception of weights, as being far too high. In their experiment, Peirce and Jastrow in fact invented randomized experiments: They randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights. Peirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1900s.The Peirce-Jastrow experiments were conducted as part of Peirce's application of his pragmaticism program to human perception; other studies considered the perception of light, etc. [...] Jastrow wrote the following summary: [...] "Mr. Peirce’s courses in logic gave me my first real experience of intellectual muscle. Though I promptly took to the laboratory of psychology when that was established by Stanley Hall, it was Peirce who gave me my first training in the handling of a psychological problem, {{and at the same time}} stimulated my self-esteem by entrusting me, then fairly innocent of any laboratory habits, with a real bit of research. He borrowed the apparatus for me, which I took to my room, installed at my window, and with which, when conditions of illumination were right, I took the observations. The results were published over our joint names in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The demonstration that traces of sensory effect too slight to make any registry in consciousness could none the less influence judgment, may itself have been a persistent motive that induced me years later to undertake a book on The Subconscious." [...] This work clearly distinguishes observable cognitive performance from the expression of consciousness.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTurbidity such as fog, mist, haze, {{and smoke}} {{progressively}} reduces image contrast and visibility with increasing distance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to degrade the turbid {{degree from the}} turbid image. The turbidity {{can be considered as}} a kind of noise. The basic assumption of the proposed algorithm is that an image consists of a <b>reference</b> <b>intensity</b> level and a characteristic intensity level. The <b>reference</b> <b>intensity</b> level is considered as general or background intensity level and it can be obtained by a low pass filter. The characteristic intensity level can be calculated by subtracting the <b>reference</b> <b>intensity</b> level from the original intensity level in the given image. The human eye has a logarithmic intensity response so the target intensity level will be created by the adaptive logarithmic function to approach the human vision. The turbid image will be degraded by transforming the characteristic intensity level into the target intensity level according to the proportion of the <b>reference</b> <b>intensity</b> level to the chosen target intensity level. The experimental results show the varied degraded turbid image as well as compared with other algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Two new {{approaches}} to quantitatively analyze diffuse diffraction intensities from faulted layer stacking are reported. The parameters of a probability-based growth model are determined with two iterative global optimization methods: a genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results are compared with those from a third global optimization method, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm [Storn & Price (1997). J. Global Optim. 11, 341 – 359]. The algorithm efficiencies in the early and late stages of iteration are compared. The accuracy of the optimized parameters improves with increasing size of the simulated crystal volume. The wall clock time for computing quite large crystal volumes can be kept within reasonable limits by the parallel calculation of many crystals (clones) generated for each model parameter set on a super- or grid computer. The faulted layer stacking in single crystals of trigonal three-pointedstar- shaped tris(bicylco[2. 1. 1]hexeno) benzene molecules serves as an example for the numerical computations. Based on numerical values of seven model parameters (reference parameters), nearly noise-free <b>reference</b> <b>intensities</b> of 14 diffuse streaks were simulated from 1280 clones, each consisting of 96 000 layers (reference crystal).

40|$|The {{available}} calibration experiences about rain intensity gauges {{relying on}} the weighing measuring principle are based on laboratory tests performed under constant reference flow rate conditions. Although the Weighing Gauges (WG) do provide better performance than more traditional Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges (TBR) under constant reference flow rates, dynamic effects do impact on the accuracy of WG measurements under real-world/time-varying rainfall conditions. The most relevant biases are due to the response time of the measurement system and the derived systematic delay in assessing the exact weight {{of the volume of}} cumulated precipitation collected in the container. This delay assumes a relevant role in case high resolution rainfall intensity (RI) time series are sought from the instrument, as is the case of many hydrologic and meteo-climatic applications (the one-minute time resolution recommended by the WMO for rainfall intensity measurements is here assumed). A significant sampling error is also attributable to some kind of weighing gauge, which affects the low intensity range as well. A laboratory investigation of the accuracy and precision of a modern weighing gauge manufactured by OTT (Pluvio 2) under unsteady-state reference RI conditions is here addressed. Three different laboratory test conditions are applied: single and double step variations of the reference flow rate and a simulated real-world event. The preliminary development and validation of a suitable rainfall simulator for the generation of time-variable <b>reference</b> <b>intensities</b> is presented. The generator is demonstrated to have a sufficiently short time response with respect to the expected instrument behavior in order to ensure effective comparison of the measured vs. <b>reference</b> <b>intensities.</b> The measurements obtained from the WG are compared with those derived from a traditional TBR (manufactured by Casella) under the same laboratory conditions. The TBR measurements have been corrected to account for systematic mechanical errors and comparison is also proposed after applying further algorithms to reduce the sampling errors. Results indicate that the performance of the investigated WG under unsteady (real world) conditions in the laboratory is comparable or even lower than what can be obtained from more traditional TBRs, even in case corrections for sampling errors are not applied...|$|R

A phosphorescent dye is added in the form of 10 -μm particles to the sample containing the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator. Both the reference dye and the pH probe are excited simultaneously by a blue LED, and an overall luminescence is measured. In the time-resolved imaging method presented here, two images taken at different time gates were recorded using a CCD camera. The first image is recorded during excitation and reflects the luminescence signal of both the fluorophore (pH) and the phosphor (reference). The second image, which is measured after a certain delay (after switching off the light source), is solely caused by the long-lived phosphorescent dye. Because the intensity of the fluorophore contains the information on pH, whereas phosphorescence is pH-independent, the ratio of the images displays a <b>referenced</b> <b>intensity</b> distribution that reflects the pH at each picture element (pixel).
