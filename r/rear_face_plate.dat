With the addition of an optional <b>face</b> <b>plate,</b> when the phone is waved back and forth rapidly, a light message of text is produced in mid-air. An FM radio can be added on {{with the use of the}} phone's Pop-Port. The 3220 features a 16-bit (65,536) color screen, which is an improvement over the 3200's 12-bit (4096) color screen. The phone also has more internal memory than the 3200. The CIF camera is also upgraded to 0.3 megapixels VGA (640x480 resolution, for photos), and features video recording (128x96) capability.|$|R

In this paper the influence of the optical anisotropy factor 5 of the material on the relative position and sizes of the two constituent branches of the caustic is studied. Nomograms are given for the accurate evaluation of mode I stress intensity factors from the geometrical characteristics of the two branches of the caustic.

40|$|The stress {{singularity}} {{created by}} a concentrated load applied at the boundary of a half-plane was studied by transforming it into an optical singularity by the optical method of caustics. The half-plane {{was considered to be}} elastic, isotropic and under generalized plane-stress conditions. According to the method of caustics, the light rays impinging normally at the thin plate are partly reflected from either the front or the <b>rear</b> <b>faces</b> of the <b>plate.</b> The reflected rays are deviated because of the important constraint of the plate at the vicinity of the applied load and the significant variation of the refractive index there. The deviated light rays, when projected on a reference screen, are concentrated along a singular curve which is, therefore, strongly illuminated and forms a caustic. It is shown that the shape and size of the caustic depends on the stress singularity at the point of application of the load. Thus, by measuring the dimensions of this singular curve, one can evaluate the state of stress at the singularity. The characteristic properties of the caustic created by such a singularity were studied in relation with the loading mode of the plate. © 1973 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|R
40|$|If a {{monochromatic}} {{and coherent}} light beam is normally incident on a thin plate under generalized plane-stress conditions, it is analysed into two plane-polarized bundles, whose directions of oscillation {{coincide with the}} principal stress directions. The plane-polarized rays are retarded when traversing the plate according to the Neumann-Maxwell law. The absolute variations of the optical paths depend on the thickness and the refractive index variations. Interference of the two primary reflections from the front and <b>rear</b> <b>faces</b> of the <b>plate</b> yields a contour map of the thickness and refractive index in the unloaded state, while the variation of the interference pattern express the variations of these quantities due to loading. If the incident light is successively polarized along either of the principal directions, the interference pattern of the reflected light rays along each direction yields the values of principal stresses. Loading of the specimen creates a displacement of the interference fringes along the field. By {{counting the number of}} fringes passing across each point, we can evaluate separately the two principal stresses. This pointwise method is much more sensitive and accurate than classical photoelasticity, since it measures absolute variations of the optical path. The method was applied to a concrete problem of elasticity and compared with other similar methods...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present work aims at {{investigating}} a particular impinging jet configuration throughout a comprehensive experimental approach. A {{preheated air jet}} at 130 °C issues a fully developed circular pipe at Reynolds number 60, 000 and discharges in the laboratory room to impinge a flat plate located 3 diameters downstream. The description of the velocity field and the complete Reynolds stress tensor is provided by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (S-PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements. For the first time, data are reported for the mean and fluctuating temperature of an impinging jet configuration {{with the help of}} cold-wire thermometry (CWT) measurements. The heat transfer distribution on the impinged plate is determined through an inverse method based on infrared thermography measurements on the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> of the <b>plate.</b> The agreement between S-PIV and LDV measurements is shown excellent over the whole flow field. The measured Nusselt number distribution exhibits a secondary maximum at r/D = 2, as observed in previous experiments for short impinging distances. Flow dynamics is characterized through a spectral analysis of time-resolved measurements while flow topology features are identified through coherent structure detection based on S-PIV spatially-resolved instantaneous velocity fields. This analysis shows that the jet column mode, associated with a Strouhal number of 0. 4, {{plays a key role in}} the primary structure dynamics...|$|R

40|$|A {{variant of}} the flash {{diffusivity}} technique has been devised for determining the thermal diffusivities, and thus the thermal conductivities, of individual aligned fibers. The technique is intended especially for application to nanocomposite fibers, made from narrower fibers of polyphenylene benzobisthiazole (PBZT) and carbon nanotubes. These highly aligned nanocomposite fibers could exploit the high thermal conductivities of carbon nanotubes for thermal-management applications. In the flash diffusivity technique as practiced heretofore, one or more heat pulse(s) is (are) applied to the front <b>face</b> of a <b>plate</b> or disk material specimen and the resulting time-varying temperature on the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> is measured. Usually, the heat pulse is generated by use of a xenon flash lamp, and the variation of temperature on the <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> is measured by use of an infrared detector. The flash energy is made large enough to produce a usefully high temperature rise on the <b>rear</b> <b>face,</b> but not so large as to significantly alter the specimen material. Once the measurement has been completed, the thermal diffusivity of the specimen is computed from {{the thickness of the}} specimen and the time dependence of the temperature variation on the <b>rear</b> <b>face.</b> Heretofore, the infrared detector used in the flash diffusivity technique has been a single-point detector, which responds to a spatial average of the thermal radiation from the rear specimen surface. Such a detector cannot distinguish among regions of differing diffusivity within the specimen. Moreover, two basic assumptions of the thermaldiffusivity technique as practiced heretofore are that the specimen is homogeneous and that heat flows one-dimensionally from the front to the <b>rear</b> <b>face.</b> These assumptions are not valid for an inhomogeneous (composite) material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{experimental}} method of caustics {{was used for}} the evaluation of the stress-singularities created by concentrated oblique load applied at the apex of a wedge or on the horizontal straight boundary of a half-plane. The wedge was considered to be elastic, isotropic and under generalized plane stress conditions. According to the method of caustics, the light rays impinging normally at the thin plate are partly reflected from either the front or the <b>rear</b> <b>faces</b> of the <b>plate.</b> The reflected rays are deviated because of the important constraint of the plate at the vicinity of the applied concentrated load and the significant variation of the refractive index there. The deviated light rays, when projected on a reference screen, are concentrated along a singular curve which is strongly illuminated and forms a caustic. It was proved that the shape and size of the caustic depend on the stress singularity at the point of application of the load. The parametric equations of caustics created by such a singularity were studied in relation with the loading mode of the wedge. Thus, by measuring the dimensions of the caustic, one can evaluate the state of stress at the singularity. The experimental evidence, based on the above method on Plexiglas (PMMA) wedges, corroborated existing elastic theories concerning the order of singularities for concentrated loads. The relations for the calculation of the load, the components of stress and the concentration factor based on the geometrical characteristic of caustics, which were reflected from the front face of the wedge, were given...|$|R
