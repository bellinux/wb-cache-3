5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Federal Reserve Act in 1913, {{giving rise to}} the Federal Reserve System. Its {{inception}} drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system's design also considered {{the findings of the}} Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to <b>rediscount</b> facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market.|$|E

In its <b>rediscounting</b> actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|R

[...] The chief reason for this lagging state of development was the lack of a central institution that could <b>rediscount</b> bank promissory notes to facilitate the exchange of promises of future payment for cash.

On the other hand, there were important changes in the monetary regime evolving to a more flexible system as the gold standard was abandoned. Considering the evolution of the emission regime {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century we can distinguish four phases: a metallic system until 1929; a period of transition between 1930 and 1934; the period 1935 - 1946 characterized by the two revaluations of the gold reserves and the introduction of <b>rediscounts</b> and; finally the last years until 1959 with an increasing use of <b>rediscounts</b> of documents as a source for issue money.

50|$|The {{stock market}} crash made it evident that banking systems Americans were relying on were not dependable. Americans looked towards insubstantial banking units for their own {{liquidity}} supply. As the economy began to fail, these banks were {{no longer able to}} support those who depended on their assets - they did not hold as much power as the larger banks. During the depression, “three waves of bank failures shook the economy.” The first wave came just when the economy was heading in the direction of recovery at the end of 1930 and the beginning of 1931. The second wave of bank failures occurred “after the Federal Reserve System raised the <b>rediscount</b> rate to staunch an outflow of gold” around the end of 1931. The last wave, which began in the middle of 1932, was the worst and most devastating, continuing “almost to the point of a total breakdown of the banking system in the winter of 1932-1933.” The reserve banks led the United States into an even deeper depression between 1931 and 1933, due to their failure to appreciate and put to use the powers they withheld - capable of creating money - as well as the “inappropriate monetary policies pursued by them during these years”.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1927, Montagu Norman and other {{governors}} of European Banks asked the Federal Reserve to ease their monetary policy and they agreed, reducing the <b>rediscount</b> rate from 4 to 3.5%, a move that Lional Robbins described as resulting “in {{one of the most}} costly errors committed by it or any other banking system in the last 75 years”. The funds released by the Fed became available to invest in the stock market and “from that date, according to all the evidence, the situation got completely out of control.” [...] Galbraith disagreed with this simplistic analysis by arguing that the availability of money in the past was no sure recipe for a bubble in common stocks and that prices could still be regarded as a true valuation of the stock at the end of 1927. It is early in 1928 that the “escape into make believe” started in earnest, when the market began to rise by large vaulting leaps rather than steady increments. Prominent investors, such as Harrison Williams, the proponent of both the Shenandoah & Blue Ridge Trusts, were described by Professor Dice as “having vision for the future and boundless hope and optimism” and not “hampered by the heavy armour of tradition”.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} adjust to the global changes that {{occurred}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War and to enhance the efficiency of the Central Bank, the Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey No. 1211 was accepted on 14 January 1970. Thus, the Central Bank, turning a new page in its history, was vested with a new structure in line with, albeit partially, novelties in the field of the economy and central banking of the time. The said Law brought significant changes to the legal status, organizational structure, duties and powers of the Bank. As per the Central Bank’s legal status as a joint stock company, its capital was increased from TL 15 million to TL 25 million. Furthermore, it was stipulated that the Treasury’s share should not constitute less than 51 percent of the capital. With Law No. 1211, the “Office of the Governor” was founded to ensure equivalence in terms of international representation, foreign relations and protocol, and Mr. Naim Talu became the first “Governor” to assume this title. Moreover, a new decision-making body composed of the Governor and the Vice Governors was established under the name of the Executive Committee. The top-level decision-making body of the Bank, the Board of Directors, which consisted of eight members, was transformed into the “Board” of the Bank, consisting of six members. Besides, the General Assembly of Shareholders was named the General Assembly; Board of Auditors was named the Auditing Committee; and the General Directorate was named Head Office. The said Law also introduced significant changes in terms of enhancing the Bank’s duties and powers. First of all, the Central Bank’s control over direct and indirect monetary policy instruments was extended and the Bank was authorized to conduct open market operations to regulate money supply and liquidity. Meanwhile, it was decided that the Government would consult the Central Bank while taking measures with respect to money and loans. The Bank was authorized, through <b>rediscount</b> transactions, to lend medium-term loans to support investments and economic development. The upper limit for short-term advances to the Treasury was increased to 15 percent of budget allocations pertaining to the respective year.|$|E
