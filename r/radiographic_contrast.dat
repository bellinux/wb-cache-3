50|$|An {{injection}} of methylprednisolone acetate into the lesion helps reduce {{the levels of}} prostaglandin. Prostaglandin is a fatty acid that reduces cyst’s ability to be reabsorbed into the bone. To begin an operation using steroids, biopsy needles are placed into the cyst and the interstitial fluids are drained. The cyst is then filled with <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> to determine the volume {{and shape of the}} cyst. If the cyst can be filled, it will be injected with methylprednisolone acetate in several intervals for a time span of six to twelve months. Once the level of prostaglandin decreases, the cyst will be reabsorbed into the bone and disappear. Treatments using steroid injections are preferred over curettage, but there are few risks from the method, which are limited to infection, fracture, and reappearance of the cyst.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a {{functional}} obstruction of the bowel {{caused by the}} absence of intrinsic enteric ganglion cells. The diagnosis of total colonic HD (TCHD) based on contrast enemas is difficult in newborns because radiological findings vary. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the <b>radiographic</b> and <b>contrast</b> enema findings in patients with pathologically proven TCHD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1966 to 2007, 17 records from a total of 31 patients with TCHD were retrospectively evaluated for diameter and shape of the colon, diameter of the small bowel, bowel wall contour, ileal reflux, abdominal calcifications, pneumoperitoneum, filling defects, transitional zones and rectosigmoid index. RESULTS: Three colonic patterns of TCHD were found: microcolon, question-mark-shape colon and normal caliber colon. Additional findings included spasmodic colon, ileal reflux, delayed evacuation and abdominal calcifications. Colonic transitional zones were found in eight patients with TCHD. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of TCHD is difficult to establish by contrast enema studies. The length of the aganglionic small bowel and the age of the patient can influence the radiological findings in TCHD. The transitional zone and the rectosigmoid index can be false-positive in TCHD. The colon can appear normal. Consider TCHD if the contrast enema study is normal but the patient remains symptomatic and other causes of distal bowel obstruction have been excluded...|$|R

No studies comparing iodinated <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> media in human stroke have been performed, to our knowledge. We hypothesized that low-osmolal contrast media {{may be associated}} with worse outcomes compared with iodixanol in the Interventional Management of Stroke III Trial (IMS III). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed prospective iodinated <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> media data for 133 M 1 occlusions treated with endovascular therapy.

40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> media on markers of {{complement}} activation and apoptosis {{in patients with}} chronic coronary artery disease are unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the comparative effects of ionic high-osmolar and non-ionic iso-osmolar <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> media on plasma markers of complement activation and apoptosis in patients with chronic coronary artery disease undergoing coronary angiography. Methods and Population: Forty-four patients undergoing coronary angiography for chronic coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to receive the ionic high-osmolar <b>radiographic</b> <b>contrast</b> agent diatrizoate (Group A) or the non-ionic iso-osmolar contrast agent iodixanol (Group B) during angiography. Complement component 5 (C 5 a) and apoptotic markers sFas and sFasL were measured just prior to angiography and one hour after completion of angiography. Results: Forty-four patients (22 in each group, 25 men, age 59 ± 8, 6) were included. Comparison of mean pre- and post-angiography plasma marker levels showed significantly greater increases in plasma levels in group A than in group B of C 5 a (29. 30 + 5. 45 ng/ml for group A and 0. 47 + 0. 70 ng/ml for group B (p< 0. 00001), sFas (2. 36 + 1. 63 ng/ml for group A and 0. 23 + 0. 90 ng/ml for group B (p< 0. 00001) and sFasL (14. 00 + 5. 41 pg/ml for Group A and 0. 01 + 1. 00 pg/ml for group B (p< 0. 00001).
