That conclusion by successive British governments was the basis of their justification given to the British people for an independent nuclear <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{received}} indirect {{support from}} such critics of massive retaliation as Bernard Brodie, William W. Kaufmann, and Henry A. Kissinger, who {{noted that the}} United States and the Soviet Union had or were acquiring the power to destroy each other with strategic nuclear weapons, thus precluding their rational use {{in response to a}} limited attack. Taylor, concluding that the Soviet Union and the United States had achieved mutual nuclear deterrence, believed that limited-war forces would play an active role in future conflicts and that atomic retaliatory forces would play a passive role. The Army did move into missile and space programs in an effort to preserve for itself a part in planning for and fighting a nuclear war, but in the late 1950s it continued to push for adoption of a new national security policy acknowledging the primacy of limited war. While the Eisenhower administration did not adopt the Army's position, by the time Wilson left office it did accept both the need to prepare for limited war and the idea that deterrence of a direct attack on U.S. interests required [...] "sufficient" [...] rather than [...] "superior" [...] <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the {{government}} took {{the view that}} the lack of a European chemical weapons <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> was a [...] "major gap in NATO's armoury".

(1) Urgently {{initiate}} a massive buildup {{of the conventional}} weaponry needed to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities and wipe out its <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capabilities</b> as well as arm Israel to the teeth. Also station Aegis anti-missile ships along our coasts while beefing up homeland security and taking steps to mitigate the effects of an EMP attack. To do any less would be totally irresponsible and reckless.|$|R
5000|$|Overthrow was not {{a viable}} policy option {{given the lack of}} {{organized}} opposition and American intelligence assets on the ground. Positive inducement to behavioral changes was also dismissed due to the Iranian regime's deep distrust of the U.S. Finally, punitive military action was ruled out on the grounds that Iran's <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capabilities</b> were considered too great, and the benefits of these strikes were too uncertain. Thus, it was decided to continue American efforts to prevent Iran's acquisition of ballistic missiles and access to international finance. This approach, known as [...] "active containment," [...] was designed to convince the Iranian elite to pursue rapprochement with the West over time.|$|R
50|$|Flexible Response was {{implemented}} to develop several options {{across the spectrum}} of warfare, other than the nuclear option, for quickly dealing with enemy aggression. In addition, the survivability of the <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> was stressed, leading to the diversification of the strategic force, development of the strategic triad, and half the Strategic Air Command force being put on permanent alert status.|$|E
50|$|In the 1983 made-for-television motion picture, The Day After, {{the fictional}} Soviet nuclear attack on {{civilian}} targets {{begins with a}} nuclear EMP attack in order to disable {{as much of the}} United States' <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> as possible. This scenario accurately conforms to the Cold War nuclear attack scenarios as understood by military officials and nuclear weapons designers (although post-Cold War scenarios are generally much different). Such a scenario is also presented in the programme Threads, again dealing with a fictional Soviet nuclear attack on Britain.|$|E

50|$|K-15 Sagarika (Sanskrit: सागरिका, Sāgarikā Oceanic) is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile {{with a range}} of 750 km. It belongs to the K Missile family and forms a part of Indias nuclear triad, and will provide <b>retaliatory</b> nuclear strike <b>capability.</b>|$|R
25|$|This missile {{will form}} part of the triad in India's nuclear deterrence, and will provide <b>retaliatory</b> nuclear strike <b>capability.</b> The {{development}} of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991.

50|$|Experience {{with the}} Mil Mi-24 in Afghanistan showed the {{vulnerability}} of helicopters to ambushes from infantry, RPG and MANPAD fire, {{as well as the}} need to counter this threat through vigilance and by immediately returning suppressive fire (even if the attack came from behind). As a result, the new scout helicopter would have been designed from the start to have a 360 degree <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> in the form of two gun turrets. These were to be of 7.62 mm calibre and {{it is likely that the}} gun used would have been the new GShG-7.62 machine gun which had been developed primarily as a defensive gun for helicopters (mounted as part of the organic armament of the Kamov Ka-29TB assault transport).|$|E
50|$|China's nuclear forces, in {{combination}} with the PLA's conventional forces, served to deter both nuclear and conventional attacks on the Chinese lands. Chinese leaders pledged to not use nuclear weapons first (no first use), but pledged to absolutely counter-attack with nuclear weapons if nuclear weapons are used against China. China envisioned retaliation against strategic and tactical attacks and would probably strike countervalue rather than counterforce targets. The combination of China's few nuclear weapons and technological factors such as range, accuracy, and response time limited the effectiveness of nuclear strikes against counterforce targets. China has been seeking to increase the credibility of its nuclear <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> by dispersing and concealing its nuclear forces in difficult terrain, improving their mobility, and hardening its missile silos.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{circumstances}} of an ultimatum, the scenario of deterrence is not bound by specific constraints of time, place, or action, and though a threat may be present, there is no formal guarantee of it being acted out. The scenario of nuclear deterrence (particularly the United States and the Soviet Union in the Cold War) {{is a good example}} of this concept: while both nations maintained a sizeable stockpile of nuclear weapons aimed at each other, the intent was to prevent open conflict, and that no formal condition for initiating conflict was ever established, except in retaliation for the other side initiating an attack. In an ultimatum situation, either nation would threaten the use of nuclear weapons if certain demands/constraints were not met independent of that <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> that would have a fixed point of no return—compliance or warfare.|$|E
40|$|Under what {{conditions}} will rivals choose to accept mutual constraints, limitations, and even reductions on their capabilities for waging war? Contemporary political science lacks a strong theoretical basis for understanding this behavior, {{despite the fact}} that states in the modern era continue to negotiate and enter into arms control arrangements. This study contributes a theoretical framework and empirical analysis identifying the conditions under which nuclear-armed rivals might choose to curb their deadly arsenals. Traditional theories grounded in classical deterrence theory suggest arms control serves to preserve a deterrent status quo and prevent expensive and destabilizing arms competition; it should therefore only be expected when rivals feel secure in the strength and effectiveness of their respective <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capabilities.</b> This study suggests a more complicated (yet still predictive) causal logic in which this balance of force is dynamically interactive with militarized hostility and rivals’ convergence or divergence in how they think – both normatively and instrumentally – about the role of nuclear weapons in their national security. The argument is illustrated through qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of bilateral arms control interactions among nuclear-armed strategic rivals from 1949 to the present. Further analysis is provided through in-depth case studies of arms control dynamics between three pairs of contemporary nuclear rivals – the United States and Russia, India and Pakistan, and the United States and China.

50|$|The U.S. Army Chemical Corps was {{reactivated}} in 1976 {{to assess}} and deal with this threat, and with it came the increased desire to acquire a <b>retaliatory</b> chemical <b>capability</b> {{in the form of}} much safer binary chemical weapons. Initially, the United States was in with the Soviet Union, and then-President Jimmy Carter rejected U.S. Army requests for authorization of the binary chemical weapons program. The talks deteriorated, and President Carter eventually granted the request Army request. However, at the last minute Carter pulled the provision from the budget. This action left the decision on a retaliatory binary chemical weapons option to the Ronald Reagan administration.|$|R

40|$|The {{arguments}} {{for and against}} the acquisition of biological and toxin weapons (BTW) are examined. A country's decision to acquire such weapons is analyzed by means of matrix analysis, separating the effects of three parameters: the offensive capability of the aggressor, the <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> of the target, and the military purpose(s) to which the weapons would be applied. The research identifies those circumstances wherein BTW {{are most likely to}} be used. The findings have implications for the type of arms control regime that should be implemented to minimize the probability that these weapons will be used, and to control their proliferation. Specifically, the author makes recommendations concerning proposals to promote compliance with the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. ...|$|E
40|$|The dual-use {{nature of}} active debris removal (ADR) and of on-orbit {{servicing}} (OOS) technology implies the latent possibility of aggressive interference with foreign entities’ space objects. This can {{create an atmosphere}} of escalatory competition in which space actors start or continue to develop offensive or <b>retaliatory</b> space <b>capabilities</b> to protect their space assets. An arms race or conflicts in space could follow, {{to the detriment of}} the peaceful uses of outer space for the benefit of all. Apart from the drafting of non-binding rules of conduct, guidelines and transparency measures and the difficulty of negotiating restrictive binding regulations, this paper discusses a third way to help safeguard security and peace in space that has not received adequate attention in literature: a broad intergovernmental organization of a civilian nature tasked with the research, design, and operation of ADR/OOS missions. Rather than limiting freedom of action, the organization would offer, in principle, a positive means of peaceful collaboration while reducing the need for unilateral ADR/OOS operations. The advantages of this approach are manifold. Through extensive multilateral cooperation many of the legal hurdles surrounding space debris and ADR (e. g. definition, liability, jurisdiction and control) could be surmounted. Moreover, a co-governed, depoliticized, multilateral organization to implement ADR operations, open to all willing and peaceful participants, would promote far-reaching transparency and act as an institutionalized Transparency and Confidence-Building Measure (TCBM). Tensions and misunderstandings could be reduced and the threat of escalation neutralized, while collective experience, institutional learning, and goodwill would be put towards more effective, future international legal instruments on space debris and ADR with global support. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Three {{questions}} are {{addressed in this}} study: (1) Does a nuclear <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> contribute to extended deterrence against a nonnuclear power? (2) If so, is the deterrent value of nuclear weapons contingent upon the prior credible threat of conventional armed engagement by the defender? (3) Or, is the deterrent impact of nuclear weapons so potent that the conventional balance of forces has little deterrent impact? Competing hypotheses are formulated and then tested by probit analysis. The empirical findings indicate that (a) nuclear weapons do contribute to extended deterrence success, but (b) that effect is not contingent upon the prior threat of conventional armed conflict, and (c) there is an inverse relationship between the conventional balance of forces and the extended deterrent role of nuclear weapons...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of HistoryMark P. ParilloThe Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, a key program under President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “New Look” policy, {{prepared}} the United States defense posture for “the long haul” in the Cold War. Eisenhower wanted {{to prevent the}} escalation of military costs while still providing an adequate defense. Eisenhower emphasized a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> and improved continental defenses, the so-called “sword and shield,” which are key features of the New Look. The DEW Line {{would prove to be}} a vital component of both. Whereas the initial emphasis of the DEW Line was to warn against attack providing for both active and passive defense measures, soon there was a definite “counter-offensive” role for the DEW Line as well—the protection of the primary <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> of the United States: the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The place of the DEW Line {{in the history of the}} Cold War has been an under appreciated topic. With the exception of the scholarship from the 1950 s and early 1960 s, only recently have continental defense and particularly the DEW Line been removed from the shadows of other Cold War events, strategies, and military programs. This doctoral thesis is an account of the DEW Line’s conception, implementation, and position in Eisenhower’s New Look and deterrent strategy. The DEW Line proved to be a cardinal feature of Eisenhower’s New Look strategy: it strengthened overall U. S. defenses and defense posture as the one element of U. S. defense policy (“New Look”) that improved and connected both the active and passive measures of continental defense by providing early warning against manned bombers flying over the polar region; it bolstered the deterrent value of SAC; and it was instrumental in developing closer peacetime military cooperation between the United States and Canada. In fact, U. S. - Canadian diplomacy during the 1950 s offers an important case study in “superpowermiddle power” interaction. However, despite the asymmetry in their relationship, U. S. - Canadian defense policies proved to be analogous. All of these objectives could not have been accomplished without the technological and logistical abilities necessary to construct successfully the DEW Line...|$|E
40|$|Whether China will {{abandon its}} long-standing nuclear {{strategy}} of assured retaliation for a first-use posture {{will be a}} critical factor in future U. S. -China strategic stability. In the past decade, advances in U. S. strategic capabilities, especially missile defenses and enhanced long-range conventional strike capacity, could undermine China's nuclear <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability,</b> which is based on a relatively small force and second-strike posture. An exhaustive review of Chinese writings on military affairs indicates, however, that China is unlikely to abandon its current nuclear strategy of assured retaliation. Instead, China will modestly expand its arsenal, increase the sophistication of its forces, and allow limited ambiguity regarding its pledge not to use nuclear weapons first. This limited ambiguity allows China to use the threat of nuclear retaliation to deter a conventional attack on its nuclear arsenal, without significantly increasing the size of its nuclear forces and triggering a costly arms race. Nevertheless, China's effort to maintain its strategy of assured retaliation while avoiding an arms race could backfire. Those efforts increase the risk that nuclear weapons could be used in a crisis between the United States and China, even though China views this possibility as much less likely than the United States does.

40|$|This thesis reconstmcts {{the history}} of the theory of nuclear {{deterrence}} and the discipline of strategic studies in the period 1946 to 1960. The key elements of the theory were the view that nuclear weapons were qualitatively different from conventional weapons, that 2 ̆ 2 deterrence 2 ̆ 2 was the sole purpose of nuclear weapons, and that in order to fulfil this purpose the weapons 2 ̆ 7 <b>retaliatory</b> <b>capability</b> had to be protected from enemy attack. This amounted to a prescription for the non-use of nuclear weapons in any capacity by either side, It is argued that the theory of deterrence underwent a process of systematisation and formalisation during the 1950 s. This process involved the application of systems analysis and game theory to strategic analysis and led to the emergence of strategic studies. It is also argued that strategic studies was developed in emulation of economics, particularly neo-classical and quantitative economics. The strategic theorists who were responsible {{for the development of the}} theory and discipline equated quantitative strategic analysis with good strategic analysis. Both systems analysis and game theory served as vehicles for the application of the methods of quantitative economics to the analysis of 2 ̆ 2 deteixence 2 ̆ 2 and its requirements. As the systematisation and formalisation of the theory took the view that 2 ̆ 2 deterrence 2 ̆ 2 was the sole purpose of nuclear weapons to a higher level of absttaction so did the theory, and the discipline, become increasingly irrelevant to the practical concems of American policy makers and mihtary planners. The policy makers and planners saw no qualitative difference between conventional and nuclear weapons. They therefore did not accept the view that die sole purpose of nuclear weapons was 2 ̆ 2 deten-ence 2 ̆ 2 as die theorists understood die term. Moreover, by die mid 1950 s the military planners in particular had come to the conclusion that die only way to 2 ̆ 2 deter 2 ̆ 2 an enemy nuclear sttike was to pre-empt it. It is argued in the thesis that the theorists 2 ̆ 7 awareness of the yawning gap between their and the policy makers 2 ̆ 7 and planners 2 ̆ 7 conception of the purpose of nuclear weapons was of paradigmatic importance for the theory and the discipline...|$|E
