40|$|Genre-based {{studies of}} {{academic}} texts have mainly focused on research articles written by native English writers. The objectives {{of this study}} are to examine the rhetorical structure of Malaysian <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions</b> and to investigate {{the ways in which the}} rhetorical structure of Malaysian <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions</b> may differ from the internationally published <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions.</b> This study explores the relation of texts generic structure and the context. A corpora of 30 research articles were selected. For the purpose of conducting a comparative study, 15 introductions from locally published journal ‘The English Teacher’ and 15 from internationally published ‘ELT’ Journal' were taken. This study developed a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales CARS and OARO model. It was found that the international research articles complied with the CARS model whereas the Malaysian <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions</b> adhered to the OARO model. It must be mentioned that two of the Malaysian introductions opaquely complied with the CARS model. This may be due to the exposure that the authors may have had in writing introductions the conventional way. Overall, the findings tend to confirm Swales’s claim that the research in the nonnative speakers’ world tend to be less antagonistic and thus geared more towards establishing readership rather than establishing the research. One prominent feature o f both ELT related introductions is that they are prone to discussing theories, personal experience and personal thoughts. As a result, new terms were proposed, CARDS - Create a Research Discussion Space and OARDO - Open a Research Discussion Option. The present study has significant implication for scholars’ writing o f RA introductions. Knowledge o f formal genre structure is useful particularly for scholars to achieve full control of their academic writing process. By comparing two different corpus, this study managed to sensitize scholars to the rhetorical structure of RA introductions in academic texts within the discipline of ELT...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} suggest an alternative solution for writers {{in general and}} graduate students in particular in writing a proper <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introduction.</b> In order to do so, the authors explored how the Swales’ model is applied in writing a <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introduction.</b> The exploration was approached through a library study on the Swales model application. Some previous studies applying Swales Model were gathered and categorized into three categories − application of Swales model on different types of genre besides the <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introduction,</b> different discipline or field and the last is the application of Swales’ on the <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introduction</b> across languages. Another three articles written by professional writers were also collected as samples of introductions that have successfully presented three obligatory moves – establishing a territory (Move 1), establishing a niche (Move 2) and occupying the niche or {{presenting the present work}} (Move 3) − proposed by Swales’ model. Those introductions were segmented into those three moves and analyzed based on a communication purpose in every step derived from each move. In order to add more comprehension about the model, an analysis was also conducted on <b>introductions</b> for seven <b>articles</b> in the English Education Journal (EEJ) published by the Graduate Program in English Language Education at Syiah Kuala University. The purpose of the analysis was to show the differences in structure of introductions organized without following the CARS Swales model. Conclusions are that the CARS Swales model is relevant for the teaching of introductions for research writing and it can be a guideline to teach students the moves and steps of this model for communication purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is twofold. Firstly it seeks to find the generic {{structures}} that are inherent in the introduction sections of entrepreneurship <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and secondly it investigates the role of experiential metafunction and its distribution in realization of obligatory generic elements that are found in the data. The approach applied is a combination of Halliday and Hasan’s (1989) model of genre analysis to find the generic structure potential (GSP) of the introduction sections as well as Halliday’s (1994) model of transitivity analysis to find the typicality of the process types and their contribution in the realization of the obligatory elements. The corpus comprises 20 <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introduction</b> sections that are published from 2010 onward in the Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship and Small Business and Enterprise Development. The analysis reveals that 13 types of generic elements might occur in the entrepreneurship <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>introductions.</b> Two of these elements such as ‘Purpose of study’ and ‘Previous study’ element are present in the whole data while others are found to be optional. Based on the obligatory, optional and recursive elements found on the data, the model of Generic Structure Potential (GSP) of the entrepreneurship <b>research</b> <b>article’s</b> <b>introduction</b> sections is proposed. Moreover, in the second phase of analysis the findings reveal that the typicality of the process types within each obligatory element is mostly in line with the function that each obligatory generic element fulfills in that particular genre. As an instance, in the present study, the ‘purpose of study’ element is mostly recognized with Mental processes and Relational processes while the ‘Previous study’ element is highly characterized with Material and Mental processes...|$|R

The results of the current study indicated that, with respect to both interactive and interactional features, there were no significant gender-based differences in the overall distribution of interpersonal resources in the four sections of the articles (p-value> 0. 05). It also confirmed the view that writing differences are not gender-specific, but rather section-specific.

In many other academic genres, however, there is greater variation in the purpose and structure of introductory sections. Even if they all function to ‘introduce the academic work’ (Bhatia 1997 : 182), practitioners do not necessarily agree about their generic features. Nesi and Gardner (2012 : 98) found considerable variation in the role of introductions in student essays, for example, and Bhatia’s informants disagreed about the distinctions between introductions, prefaces and forewords to academic books (1997 : 183) ...|$|E

40|$|Writing <b>research</b> <b>article</b> to a peer {{reviewed}} publication {{is a complex}} process and involves daunting communication with the referees, co-authors and editors. Publication writing is more challenging than the usual communicative expression yet; prolific writers often pass through the processes without too much difficulty. Prolific writers draw on many writing strategies {{and one of the}} strategies is by highlighting the research gap. Most of the time, the research gaps highlighted are those related to the intended research niche and the intended study. While the strategy has been used and taught in many research writing instances, the strategy has been reported to be unpopular amongst the non-native English research writers. Although many non-native English writers are {{aware of the importance of}} the research gap, not much is known on how this strategy is being practiced. In view of the under-utilization of this strategy and limited studies on the strategy in non-native context, this paper investigates the use of this strategy in 150 <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>introductions</b> in Computer Science disciplines written by academicians in Malaysian Universities.

This research investigated on {{the similarities and differences}} in the citation practices and choices of reporting verbs in Malaysian English <b>Research</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>introduction</b> sections from the Humanities and Social Sciences and, Sciences and Engineering. The data consisted of eighty corpora from eight different disciplines.

Findings show significant differences whereby writers followed different strategies in employing non-integral and integral citation practices due to their specific citation conventions, discourse conventions and style conventions. Based on results of this study, lecturers of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) can understand the citation types and reporting verbs of choices employed in Humanities and Social Sciences RAs and compares them with those in Sciences and Engineering RAs. Moreover, seeing the differences between the disciplines in terms of citation practices and reporting verbs, they can develop the writing and research skills that are needed to use all citation types effectively so as to enhance students’ writing skill in producing quality academic papers...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{definitions}} of genres, {{based on the}} notions of specific conventions such as of content (theme, setting etc.) and form (structure and style) have been disputed. Some scholars {{do not believe in}} the rigid rules of inclusion and exclusion of texts in a particular genre as they can be recognized intutively as instances of repetition and difference because of their 'family resemblences' among texts. Swales (1990) prefers the psycholinguistic concept of 'prototypicality'. Genres usually go through phases or cycles of popularity as the crucial ideological concerns of the time in which they are popular are embodied in the generic conventions. The popular genre of <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> amongst the <b>research</b> and academic community, is undergoing a continuous evolution. Many scholars have attempted to explore this complex process of writing <b>research</b> <b>article.</b> The list is long, to name some: Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995); Montgomery (1996); Salager-Meyer (1998); Atkinson (1999); Valle (1999); Gross et al. (2002). The work of these scholars includes <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> from different disciplines. However, such scholarly work in the field of Computer science is limited. Cooper (1985), Posteguille (1999) and Anthony (1999) studies are either too broad or too narrow. As compared to these works, the present study addresses the issue at a greater length and is more in depth. The increasing use of computer led text corpora containing millions of words inspired the utilization of the corpus-based techniques for the present research. A corpus of 56 <b>Research</b> <b>articles</b> was created electronically. These articles were taken from five different journals of IEEE, the leading Computer society of the world. Wordsmith tools such as word frequency list, key word, collocation and concordance were applied to the corpus. Secondly, Swales (2004) CARS model was applied for the rhetorical analysis. Lexico-grammaticl analysis was done in terms of the rhetorical objectives of writing Introductions. The findings of the research as discussed in Chapter four focus on the syntactic and lexical patterns evident in the data. Theses include interesting N-grams (three and four word clusters); voice of the author (very different from the authors of other disciplines) and passivization of verbs. These stylistic excursions make an initial contribution to our understanding of Computer science <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>Introductions.</b> The last three chapters of the dissertation constitute the heart of the discoursal analysis of the 56 Introductions in the corpus. These examine the structural-rhetorical features of the moves and steps involved, and the possible linkages between form and function.

40|$|The {{significant}} {{purpose of}} the author in the Introduction of a research article is to convince the reader {{about the importance of}} the work to be presented. To achieve this end, a convincing “niche” needs to be built by evaluating, rejecting or indicating gaps in previous related work.

The present paper investigates how Computer scientists use this obligatory step of “Create a Research Space” (CARS) model (Swales & Feak, 1994 & 2004) to highlight their own research work. This paper not only compares the results with other similar studies but also presents an in-depth analysis of various types of gap statements used in Computer Science <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>Introductions.</b> The issue of cyclicity of this step and the linguistic indicators used for the establishment of “niche” (the gap statements) are both discussed...|$|E
40|$|Genre {{analysis}} as a “meta-study” {{is a topic}} that has been deeply investigated {{in the field of}} applied linguistics, one of its more specific areas of interest being <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions</b> (RAIs). However, there are still certain kinds of scholarly activity that have received relatively little attention in this regard, such as literary criticism. The paper presents and discusses the results of a small-scale study of the introductions of ten academic essays in this field. The paper’s aim is to see how Swales’ (1990) CARS model {{can be applied to the}} rhetorical structure of these RAIs. It is found that at the cost of certain modifications necessitated by the structure of the essays in the corpus, it is not impossible to analyze critical texts produced by scholars belonging in the latter area.

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies in recent years of written {{academic}} genres and they have highlighted the importance of genre analysis in the structure of student writing. The study utilised a content document analysis method to investigate the use of rhetorical moves in the introductions to academic exercise written by B. ed TESL students in Universiti Teknologi MARA (“UiTM”) Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. The thesis describes how genre analysis was used to analyse the academic exercise introductions of a corpus composed of 30 texts written in English by Malaysian writers. The analysis reveals that the rhetorical patterns and some moves proposed by Swales in his Open a Research Option model are found in introductions even though not in sequence orders. Another significant finding is that the Malaysian writers did not summarise their finding in the introduction sections compared to Anglo-American writers. The objectives of this analysis are to verify whether the rhetorical patterns of organisation and the moves found in introductions coincide with those proposed by Swales (1993) in his study of <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>introductions.</b> Besides analyzing the CARS model by Swales (1993), it also identifies the alternative model of Open a Research Option (OARO) in the introductions. The finding was different from those for English RA introductions because Malaysian and Anglo-American writers have different backgrounds and environments due to the social-cultural aspects with also reflect the organisation of discourse and rhetoric. Malaysian writers do not like to comment on other peoples’ works compared to cultures who like to give and accept criticism. To conclude the introduction section of their writing, Malaysian writers preferred referring to the consequences of their research. In general, the rhetorical moves and steps were employed in academic exercise introduction sections were less often used in CARS compared to OARO...|$|R

Fifty-one RAIs from three top-tier journals in AL were selected for a corpus-based study. Qualitative analyses of the texts revealed four major types of appeals, that is, appeals to salience, magnitude, topicality, and problematicity of the topic in either the research world or the real world, which ALs made in varied ways. Linguistic devices realizing these appeals were also analyzed with the tool of appraisal. Quantitative analyses further unveiled ALs' frequent use of appeals, their reliance on indirect over direct approaches to promotion, and their preferred patterns in appeal deployment. The pervasion of promotional elements is interpreted as indicative of academic marketization and as discipline-specific, and the indirect way of promotion is viewed as indicating a compromise between the need for promotion and the need to maintain objectivity. postprin...|$|E

Although this research has frequently been conducted from a contrastive viewpoint (comparing different genres or disciplines, or native and non-native speaker productions), the number of studies involving research on academic writing in languages other than English has been far more modest (Carter-Thomas 2007). We believe therefore that a contrastive analysis of articles in English and French in a particular area, in this case economics, can have applications for teachers of French academic writing outside French-speaking countries and for teachers of English academic writing in French-speaking countries. As economics is an important source of demand for translations, the applications are also relevant in translator education.

It introduces IADE (Intelligent Academic Discourse Evaluator), a new web-based AWE program that analyzes <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>Introduction</b> sections and generates immediate, individualized, discipline-specific feedback. The major purpose of the dissertation was to implement IADE as a formative assessment tool complementing L 2 graduate-level academic writing instruction and to investigate the effectiveness and appropriateness of its automated evaluation and feedback. To achieve this goal, the study sought evidence of IADE 2 ̆ 7 s Language Learning Potential, Meaning Focus, Learner Fit, and Impact qualities outlined in Chapelle 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) CALL evaluation conceptual framework. A mixed-methods approach with a concurrent transformative strategy was employed. Quantitative data consisted of Likert-scale, yes/no, and open-ended survey responses; automated and human scores for first and last drafts; pre-/post test scores; and frequency counts for draft submission and for access to IADE 2 ̆ 7 s Help Options. Qualitative data contained students 2 ̆ 7 first and last drafts as well as transcripts of think-aloud protocols and Camtasia computer screen recordings, observations, and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that IADE can be considered an effective formative assessment tool suitable for implementation in the targeted instructional context.

40|$|International audiencePatents {{represent}} a critically important research genre in numerous {{scientific and technological}} fields, yet their rhetorical and other linguistic features remain underexplored relative {{to those of the}} related and much more extensively studied research article. While patents share many common elements with research articles, and sometimes even cover the exact same scientific discoveries as articles, they differ from articles in substantial ways, largely due to differences in their communicative purposes, their intended readerships, and the presence of significant legal constraints that govern many aspects of patent construction. Here, I present a comparative analysis of a corpus containing pairs of U. S. patents and published research articles covering equivalent scientific discoveries in the area of biotechnology. For this analysis, I have focused on the “Background of the Invention” section of the patents and the Introduction section of the research articles. <b>Research</b> <b>article</b> <b>Introductions</b> are perhaps the most widely studied of all sections of IMRAD-type articles, often displaying a rhetorical structure as described by Swales’s CARS model (Swales, 1990, 2004). While the Background section of patents may address similar scientific elements as article Introductions and may thus be expected to include aspects of the CARS model, the two sections often show fundamentally differences, including with respect to their rhetorical structures, the way in which cited work is addressed, and hedging. These differences, and their functional relations to the divergent communicative purposes of each genre, will be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Este artigo é um recorte de um estudo que analisou o gênero textual `introdução de artigo de pesquisa' sob a ótica retórico-discursiva. Os princípios teórico-metodológicos que orientaram esta pesquisa foram: inglês instrumental, leitura e gêneros textuais. A pesquisa realizada é de natureza descritiva focalizada (LARSEN-FREEMAN; LONG, 1991), e o corpus utilizado é formado por introduções de artigo de pesquisa da prova de inglês do teste ANPAD. Neste artigo, será apresentada uma análise linguístico-discursiva das introduções desse corpus. Os resultados mostraram que as evidências linguísticas nem sempre correspondem a um determinado movimento retórico (SWALES, 1990) presente nos textos das introduções analisadas. O estudo teve finalidade pedagógica, pois evidenciou os marcadores linguísticos e as estruturas verbais que realmente ocorrem nesse gênero. This {{article is}} part of a study which {{analyzed}} the textual genre `research article introduction' from the perspective of rhetorical-discursive analysis. The theoretical-methodological principles which guided this research were: English for specific purposes, reading and textual genre. This research was a focused description (LARSEN-FREEMAN; LONG, 1991), and the corpususedwas composed by <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions</b> from the ANPAD English test (ANPAD is a test for postgraduate courses). This article presents the linguistic-discursive analysis of the introductions that comprise the corpusused in the studyof the original study. The results showed that the linguistic evidence not always corresponded to a specific rhetorical movement (SWALES, 1990) in the introductions. The study had a pedagogical purpose because it highlighted the linguistic marks and the verbal structures that really occur in this genre...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} a genre-based {{analysis}} of the rhetorical moves in <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions</b> (RAIs) in Forestry, an established applied science discipline. Based on Swales’ (2004) revised CARS model, this study covers 20 RAs collected from four high impact Forestry journals. Our findings indicate that although Forestry RAIs largely conform to the revised CARS framework, prominent variations in step occurrences are noteworthy in comparison to those in other disciplines. The incidence of centrality claims in Forestry is significantly higher than those in some established disciplines. Research niches in Forestry are predominantly established using gap indications and positive justifications, thus showing (i) considerable similarity compared to those in Wildlife Behaviour, and (ii) notable difference compared to those in Civil Engineering. Hypothesis formulation also appears in half of the Forestry RAIs, thus exhibiting a significant distinction in comparison to those in Wildlife Behaviour and Civil Engineering. In terms of method-related summaries, Forestry resembles Civil Engineering rather than Wildlife Behaviour, given that two-thirds of Civil Engineering RAIs included such summative methodological statements while none of the writers in Wildlife Behaviour considered it necessary to incorporate this step {{in the beginning of}} a research paper. Based on the findings reported in this paper, we argue that rhetorical strategies actually constitute a crucial aspect in which different scientific disciplines can be distinguished and recognised. More importantly, varying degrees of emphasis need to be placed on different rhetorical steps while language instructors design teaching materials aimed at guiding learners in the writing of research introductions in courses on English for Research Purposes (ERP) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the introductions of PhD theses and <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> are similar in their rhetorical features. In contrast, {{it has been suggested that}} metadiscourse as a rhetorical device is constructed in a different manner in these texts. However, very few studies have sought to empirically validate this assumption. This paper investigates how research writers construct metadiscourse in the introductions of their PhD theses and subsequently published <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> The analysis shows that the majority of the writers make greater use of metadiscourse in their <b>article</b> <b>introductions.</b> The most significant changes include greater use of phrases referring to previous research, less reference to other parts of the text, and still less use of phrases signalling authorial presence. Close examination reveals that these variations derive from genre-specific features, including that writers of PhD thesis introductions present previews of the subsequent chapters. This paper closes by arguing that the variations can also be ascribed to the nature of the PhD thesis as an educational genre and that of <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> as a professional genre in which writers need to survive severe competition to get their manuscripts published...|$|R
40|$|Expressing {{doubt and}} {{certainty}} in academic writings requires a cautious use of hedges and boosters. Despite their importance in academic writing, {{little is known}} about how they are used in monolingual and bilingual male and female EFL learners’ academic writings. To shed some lights on the issue, the present study investigated the use of hedges and boosters in <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> written by monolingual and bilingual male and female EFL learners. Based on the collected corpus from twelve academic <b>research</b> <b>articles,</b> the overall rhetorical and categorical distribution of hedges and boosters were identified across four sections of these <b>articles</b> (Abstract, <b>Introduction,</b> Discussion, and Conclusion). The results evinced that the overall distribution of hedges and boosters in <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> written by bilinguals was higher than that of monolinguals. Moreover, there were significant differences between male and female EFL learners in the use of hedges and boosters in their academic <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> These findings not only paved the way for further studies in the use of hedges and boosters but they also presented some beneficial implications for teaching of academic writing to EFL learners...|$|R
