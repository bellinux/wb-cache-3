5000|$|In {{regard to}} terminology, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the term Aryan {{was used to}} refer to the Proto-Indo-Europeans and their descendants. However, Aryan more {{properly}} applies to the Indo-Iranians, the Indo-European branch that settled parts of the Middle East and South Asia, as only Indic and Iranian languages explicitly affirm the term as a self-designation referring to the entirety of their people, whereas the same Proto-Indo-European root (*aryo-) is the basis for Greek and Germanic word forms which seem only to denote the ruling elite of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) society. In fact, the most accessible evidence available confirms only the existence of a common, but vague, socio-cultural designation of [...] "nobility" [...] associated with PIE society, such that Greek socio-cultural lexicon and Germanic proper names derived from this <b>root</b> <b>remain</b> insufficient to determine whether the concept was limited to the designation of an exclusive, socio-political elite, or whether it could possibly have been applied in the most inclusive sense to an inherent and ancestral [...] "noble" [...] quality which allegedly characterized all ethnic members of PIE society.

40|$|Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) {{constitute}} {{a large family}} of signal perception molecules in Arabidopsis. The largest group of RLKs is the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class that has been described to function in development and defense. Of these, CLAVATA 1 (CLV 1) and ERECTA (ER) receptors function in maintaining shoot meristem homeostasis and organ growth, but LRR RLKs with similar function in the <b>root</b> <b>remain</b> unknown. For the interaction of Arabidopsis with the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis the involvement of LRR RLKs has not been demonstrated. A set of homozygous T-DNA insertion lines mutated in LRR RLKs was investigated to assess the potential role of these receptors in root meristem maintenance and compatibility. One mutant line, rlk 902, was discovered that showed both reduced root growth and resistance to downy mildew in a recessive manner. The phenotypes of this mutated line could not be rescued by complementation, but are nevertheless linked to the T-DNA insertion. Microarray studies showed that gene expression spanning a region of approximately 84 kb upstream of the mutated gene was downregulated. The results suggest T-DN...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mine {{tailings}} {{is composed}} of mineral sands and gravel,which usually contains considerable heavy metals[1]. The plants growing in mine tailings area usually have a certain tolerance for heavy metals. According to analyzed the Zoysia sinica Hance and Rumex crispus in {{the upper reaches of}} Jialing river, discussed how local environment effect the resistance, migration, transport for heavy metals Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd. The results show that the heavy metal Pb in Zoysia sinica Hance is leaf>root,the heavy metals Zn,Cu,Cd in Zoysia sinica Hance is root>leaf,and the proportion of heavy metal in leaf and <b>root</b> <b>remain</b> stability and keep positive correlation between each other. Zoysia sinica has strong resistance and accumulation for heavy metals Pb, Zn, Cu. Especially it has potential accumulation for Pb, and poor accumulation for Cd. The heavy metal Zn,Cd in Rumex crispus is leaf>root,but for Pb and Cu is root>leaf. Rumex crispus has a certain accumulation for Pb,Zn and Cu,and has a poor accumulation for Cd. Zoysia sinica Hance and Rumex crispus show resistance to various heavy metals and has accumulation for some heavy metals, Zoysia and crispuscan can be used for repairing the soil of mining district or can be used for Soil recovery...|$|E
40|$|Moving in an {{unstructured}} environment such as soil requires {{approaches that}} are {{constrained by the}} physics of this complex medium and can ensure energy efficiency and minimize friction while exploring and searching. Among living organisms, plants are the most efficient at soil exploration, and their roots show remarkable abilities that can be exploited in artificial systems. Energy efficiency and friction reduction are assured by a growth process wherein new cells are added at the root apex by mitosis while mature cells of the <b>root</b> <b>remain</b> stationary and {{in contact with the}} soil. We propose a new concept of root-like growing robots that is inspired by these plant root features. The device penetrates soil and develops its own structure using an additive layering technique: each layer of new material is deposited adjacent to the tip of the device. This deposition produces both a motive force at the tip and a hollow tubular structure that extends {{to the surface of the}} soil and is strongly anchored to the soil. The addition of material at the tip area facilitates soil penetration by omitting peripheral friction and thus decreasing the energy consumption down to 70 % comparing with penetration by pushing into the soil from the base of the penetration system. The tubular structure provides a path for delivering materials and energy to the tip of the system and for collecting information for exploratory tasks...|$|E

40|$|There are ~ 12 supergroups of complex-celled organisms (eukaryotes), but {{relationships}} among them (including the <b>root)</b> <b>remain</b> elusive. For Paper I, I developed a dataset of 37 eukaryotic proteins of bacterial origin (euBac), representing the conservative protein {{core of the}} proto-mitochondrion. This gives a relatively short distance between ingroup (eukaryotes) and outgroup (mitochondrial progenitor), which is important for accurate rooting. The resulting phylogeny reconstructs three eukaryote megagroups and places one, Discoba (Excavata), as sister group {{to the other two}} (neozoa). This rejects the reigning “Unikont-Bikont” root and highlights the evolutionary importance of Excavata. For Paper II, I developed a 150 -gene dataset to test relationships in supergroup SAR (Stramenopila, Alveolata, Rhizaria). Analyses of all 150 -genes give different trees with different methods, but also reveal artifactual signal due to extremely long rhizarian branches and illegitimate sequences due to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or contamination. Removing these artifacts leads to strong consistent support for Rhizaria+Alveolata. This breaks up the core of the chromalveolate hypothesis (Stramenopila+Alveolata), adding support to theories of multiple secondary endosymbiosis of chloroplasts. For Paper III, I studied the evolution of cox 15, which encodes the essential mitochondrial protein Heme A synthase (HAS). HAS is nuclear encoded (nc-cox 15) in all aerobic eukaryotes except Andalucia godoyi (Jakobida, Excavata), which encodes it in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (mt-cox 15). Thus the jakobid gene was postulated to represent the ancestral gene, which gave rise to nc-cox 15 by endosymbiotic gene transfer. However, our phylogenetic and structure analyses demonstrate an independent origin of mt-cox 15, providing the first strong evidence of bacteria to mtDNA HGT. Rickettsiales or SAR 11 often appear as sister group to modern mitochondria. However these bacteria and mitochondria also have independently evolved AT-rich genomes. For Paper IV, I assembled a dataset of 55 mitochondrial proteins of clear α-proteobacterial origin (including 30 euBacs). Phylogenies from these data support mitochondria+Rickettsiales but disagree on the placement of SAR 11. Reducing amino-acid compositional heterogeneity (resulting from AT-bias) stabilizes SAR 11 but moves mitochondria to the base of α-proteobacteria. Signal heterogeneity supporting other alternative hypotheses is also detected using real and simulated data. This suggests a complex scenario for the origin of mitochondria...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{know the}} {{finishing}} effect, {{in order to}} be able to safely proceed with the cores preparation in the daily clinic, without compromising the prosthetic restoration longevity. Methods: This study used 48 human single-rooted premolars, which after the section of its crowns, were endodontically treated, and its root canal prepared 8 mm deep to receive cores casting in cobalt-chrome alloy. Cementing was made with zinc phosphate and the tensile test performed at different preparation times: G 1 - without re-preparation after cementation (control); G 2 - re-prepared 24 hours after cementation, and G 3 - re-prepared 15 minutes after cementation. Results: Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the tensile strength values in the different groups (p = 0. 233), in other words, the core re-preparation 15 minutes or 24 hours after the cementation caused no significant reduction in tensile strength between the core and the <b>root</b> <b>remaining</b> when using the zinc phosphate cement. Conclusion: The metallic core re-preparation cast 15 minutes or 24 hours after cementation caused no significant reduction in tensile strength between the cast metallic core and the <b>root</b> <b>remaining,</b> although in absolute values there was an important difference...|$|R

40|$|Prompt tillage after crop harvest was {{investigated}} {{as a cultural}} control for the tobacco cyst nematode, Globodera tabacum tabacum, on stalk-cut broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco. Stalk stumps and <b>roots</b> <b>remaining</b> after harvest were destroyed by tilling immediately or from 2 to 6 wk after harvest in field experiments over 4 yr. Cyst nematode Pf/Pi ratios ranged from 0. 65 to 1. 62 when plants were tilled immediately after harvest and 1. 13 to 5. 88 when tillage was delayed. Nematode population development was monitored by inoculating plants in pots placed in fields with J 2 in eggs and sampling over time (8 to 18 wk). Three generations per year were observed, and G. t. tabacum generation time was as short as 6 wk for each generation. Destroying stalks and <b>root</b> systems <b>remaining</b> after harvesting stalk-cut broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco removes the host to preclude development of nematodes {{at the end of}} the second and entire third generation. Early tillage resulted in consistently lower tobacco cyst nematode populations than allowing viable <b>roots</b> to <b>remain</b> in fields for an additional 8 to 18 wk.
