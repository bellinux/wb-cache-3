500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh. I want people to go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 was {{purposely}} {{conceived and}} developed to {{be a different}} kind of Supermarionation series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on characterisation and plotlines subscribing more to the spy thriller genre than science fiction. Co-creator Gerry Anderson explained, [...] "The show majored on its characters, which I thought were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware." [...] Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as The Wicked Lady, handling recording tape on a daily basis. While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities, explaining, [...] "I <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to magnetic recording, where material could be stored or transferred to another tape." [...] When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, Fireball XL5, the surname [...] "Ninety" [...] had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.|$|E
2500|$|Leone {{built upon}} the screenwriter's {{original}} concept to [...] "show {{the absurdity of}} war... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'" [...] An avid history buff, Leone said, [...] "I had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant {{of the fact that}} there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners." [...] The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by Mathew Brady. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.|$|E
50|$|According to Frazer Hines in an {{interview}} on the audio CD of The Invasion, Sally Faulkner's skirt kept getting blown up around her neck whilst climbing up the rope ladder to the helicopter. To avoid the same thing happening to his kilt, he remembered <b>reading</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> The Queen had lead weights sewn into the hem of her skirt to stop this from happening to her. It so happened that Frazer's dresser was a keen fisherman, who sewed some lead weights into his kilt.|$|R

50|$|The {{younger brother}} of former All Black Scott Waldrom, he was {{overlooked}} by the All Blacks selectors while playing in New Zealand, and after making his move to England, had aspirations of eventually {{playing for the}} England national team. Under International Rugby Board (IRB) regulations, {{he would not be}} eligible for England until being resident in the country for three years. However, as Waldrom would tell the Leicester Mercury in March 2011,My agent came round and he brought the pamphlet with the International Rugby Board's rules regarding qualifying after residency. My wife was going through the criteria. She saw the line about being able to qualify immediately if one of your grandparents was born in the respective country. I remembered <b>reading</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> my grandmother was English. I rang up my mum in New Zealand, where it was four o'clock in the morning. I apologised for waking her up and asked if nana was born in England. She said yes, and that she also had the birth certificate to prove it. This development made Waldrom immediately eligible for England selection.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! Gervaise, {{and what}} is the {{vigilance}} of Galleygo to that of the All-seeing eye! It is a terrible thought, at an hour like this, to remember that nothing can be forgotten. I have <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> not an oath is uttered that does not continue to vibrate through all time, in the wide-spreading currents of sound--not a prayer lisped, that its record is not also to be found stamped on the laws of nature, by the indelible seal of the Almighty's will!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Otto Klemperer was an admirer; {{late in life}} he reflected: [...] "At the Kroll we did La Périchole. That's {{a really}} {{delightful}} score. So is Orpheus in the Underworld and Belle Hélène. Those who called him 'The Mozart of the Boulevards' were not much mistaken". Debussy, Bizet, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov loved Offenbach's operettas. Debussy rated them higher than The Tales of Hoffmann: [...] "The one work in which Offenbach tried to be serious met with no success." [...] A London critic wrote, on Offenbach's death: I <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> some of Offenbach's latest work shows him {{to be capable of}} more ambitious work. I, for one, am glad he did what he did, and only wish he had done more of the same.|$|R

60|$|The house, by daylight, {{had proved}} to be six stories high, the same as ever. I could find, with all my {{architectural}} experience, no room in its altitude for those interminable stairways, no width between its walls for that long corridor, where I had tramped at night. And there was yet a greater difficulty. I had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> an aphorism <b>that</b> everything may be false to itself save human nature. A house might elongate or enlarge itself--or seem to do so to a gentleman who had been dining. The ocean might dry up, the rocks melt in the sun, the stars fall from heaven like autumn apples; {{and there was nothing}} in these incidents to boggle the philosopher. But the case of the young lady stood upon a different foundation. Girls were not good enough, or not good that way, or else they were too good. I was ready to accept any of these views: all pointed to the same conclusion, which I was thus already on the point of reaching, when a fresh argument occurred, and instantly confirmed it. I could remember the exact words we had each said; and I had spoken, and she had replied, in English. Plainly, then, the whole affair was an illusion: catacombs, and stairs, and charitable lady, all were equally the stuff of dreams.|$|R

60|$|In {{the evening}} I found myself very feverish, {{and went in}} to bed; but, having <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> cold water drank {{plentiful}}ly was good for a fever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most of the night, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I proceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington, where I was told I should find boats that would carry me {{the rest of the}} way to Philadelphia.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is true," [...] agreed Alora, [...] "for my mother's {{estimate}} of art was undoubtedly correct. I have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> discouragement sometimes destroys one's talent, though in after years, with proper impulse, it may return with added strength. In my father's case," [...] she explained, [...] "he {{was not able to}} sell his work--and no wonder. So now he does nothing at all but read, and even that doesn't seem to amuse him much." ...|$|E
60|$|And so Jimmy, {{having had}} plenty of {{opportunity}} to commune with himself during the journey from New York, was confident {{that there were many}} opportunities awaiting him in Chicago.

6000|$|... [323] I have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> (if I do not err, for I cannot {{recollect}} where,) that Dante was {{so great}} a favourite of Michael Angelo's, that he had designed {{the whole of the}} Divina Commedia: but that the volume containing these studies was lost by sea.|$|R
60|$|His one enemy {{among the}} wood folk, {{so far as}} I have observed, is the beaver. As the latter is also a peaceable animal, it is {{difficult}} to account for the hostility. I have heard or <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> Keeonekh is fond of young beaver and hunts them occasionally to vary his diet of fish; but I have never found any evidence in the wilderness to show this. Instead, I think it is simply a matter of the beaver's dam and pond that causes the trouble.|$|E
60|$|Home! Would we {{ever see}} it again? We tried to urge Felicity on, {{but she only}} {{repeated}} drowsily that she must lie down and rest. Cecily, too, was reeling against me. The Story Girl still stood up staunchly and counselled struggling on, but she was numb with cold and her words were hardly distinguishable. Some wild idea was {{in my mind that}} we must dig a hole in the snow and all creep into it. I had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> people had thus saved their lives in snowstorms. Suddenly Felix gave a shout.|$|E
6000|$|November 1--noon. [...] A fine day, a {{brilliant}} sun. Warm in the sun, {{cold in the}} shade--an icy breeze blowing out of the south. A solemn long swell rolling up northward. It comes from the South Pole, with nothing in the way to obstruct its march and tone its energy down. I have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> an acute observer among the early explorers--Cook? or Tasman?--accepted this majestic swell as trustworthy circumstantial evidence that no important land lay to the southward, and so did not waste time on a useless quest in that direction, but changed his course and went searching elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|... "When a young man, I <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> the following: God the Almighty said, 'All that is {{too complex}} is unnecessary, and it is simple that is needed' ...

5000|$|On her unusual name, she said, [...] "It's an Irish name. In fact, my {{last name}} was O'Heelahan {{back in the}} day. And Briga, I <b>read</b> <b>somewhere,</b> is some pagan Celtic goddess, which sounds great, so I really like saying that. But I was named after my grandmother's best friend, who was Irish and came from Dublin." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{these words}} {{from a great}} philosopher: [...] "The woman who bears a child to any man should {{instantly}} be lawfully seized of one-half his goods, for by that sublime act she takes her life in her hand as truly as the soldier who charges upon an invading host. The anguish of maternity should sanctify every woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Eustace {{had heard}} or <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> such {{expressions}} in a woman's mouth were mere facons de parler, {{and on the}} whole signs {{that she had no}} objection to be alone, and did not intend to call for help; and he only grasped her hands the more fiercely, and looked into her face with keen and hungry eyes; but she was in earnest, nevertheless, and a loud shriek made him aware that, if he wished to save his own good name, he must go: but there was one question, for an answer to which he would risk his very life.|$|E
6000|$|Though a mauvish pink in complexion, Lady Pollacke was so {{like her}} own white horse that whinnyingly rather than winningly would perhaps {{have been the}} apter word. I have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> this human {{resemblance}} to horses sometimes accompanies unusual intelligence. The poet, William Wordsworth, was like a horse; I have seen his portrait. And I should like to see Dean Swift's. Whether or not, the unexpected arrival of this visitor betrayed me into some little gaucherie, {{and for a moment}} I still sat on, as she had discovered me, literally [...] "floored" [...] by my novel. Then I scrambled with what dignity I could to my feet, and chased after my manners.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} against that," [...] said Crosby slowly, [...] "is the {{probability}} that it is already devoted to some other use by the Government. Ever since we've been here I've been thinking--I don't know why--that we've been put {{in a sort of}} quarantine. The desertion of the place, the half hospital arrangements of this building, and the means they have taken to isolate us from themselves, must mean something. I've <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>that</b> in these out-of-the-way spots in the tropics they have a place where they put the fellows with malarious or contagious diseases. I don't want to frighten you boys: but I've an idea that we're in a sort of lazaretto, and the people outside won't trouble us often." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was always}} {{influenced}} by a sentence he had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> about [...] "one of those globe-trotters you meet carrying a monkey-wrench in Calcutta, then in raiment and a monocle at the Athenaeum."

6000|$|... "And {{yet such}} {{questions}} have been answered before now by people far less intuitive than you," [...] I went on. [...] "Why, I've <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> how, when the war between Napoleon the First and the Prussians broke out, in 1806, Jomini predicted that the decisive battle of the campaign would be fought near Jena; and near Jena it was fought. Are not YOU better than many Jominis?" ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{curious fact}} {{with respect to}} this animal, is the overpoweringly strong and {{offensive}} odour which proceeds from the buck. It is quite indescribable: several times whilst skinning the specimen which is now mounted at the Zoological Museum, I was almost overcome by nausea. I tied up the skin in a silk pocket-handkerchief, and so carried it home: this handkerchief, after being well washed, I continually used, and it was of course as repeatedly washed; yet every time, for a space of one year and seven months, when first unfolded, I distinctly perceived the odour. This appears an astonishing instance of the permanence of some matter, which nevertheless in its nature must be most subtile and volatile. Frequently, when passing at the distance of half a mile to leeward of a herd, I have perceived the whole air tainted with the effluvium. I believe the smell from the buck is most powerful at the period when its horns are perfect, or free from the hairy skin. When in this state the meat is, of course, quite uneatable; but the Gauchos assert, that if buried for some time in fresh earth, the taint is removed. I have <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> the islanders in the north of Scotland treat the rank carcasses of the fish-eating birds in the same manner.|$|R
