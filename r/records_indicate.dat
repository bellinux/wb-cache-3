5|$|Archaeologic <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that {{dogs were}} present in the Society Islands from the period of initial {{settlement}} up to the point of European contact. Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{for total}} death toll range from 55 to 153. Death toll {{estimates}} for Texas range from 17 to 38, though official <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that the 38 deaths occurred in Mexico rather than Texas. Estimates {{of the deaths}} in Mexico, where records are less complete, vary more widely. Several of the deaths in Texas were homeless people attempting to enter the United States, {{and as a result}} their deaths were not counted. Monetary damage figures are not available, but it is known that flooding from Alice caused considerable damage to crops, primarily cotton.|$|E

5|$|First Officer John Rachuba, 30, {{was hired}} by Piedmont in 1989. At {{the time of the}} accident, company <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that he had {{accumulated}} approximately 4,507 flying hours, of which 29 hours were in the F28. Rachuba held a flight engineer certificate with ratings for turbojet-powered aircraft and an expired instructor certificate issued on August 16, 1987. He also held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license for non-federal control towers. Previously, he had served as a flight engineer on Boeing 737s and Boeing 727s.|$|E
5|$|Fossil <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's {{third most}} common bird {{and it was}} {{widespread}} on all three main islands. However, the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts {{have been made to}} prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1989 and continues.|$|E
5|$|Historical <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that a {{semi-circular}} {{structure or}} barbican {{was built by}} Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower. Records from 1335 indicate {{the purchase of a}} lock and key for the lions and leopards, also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the Tower. By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie.|$|E

5|$|However <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that Lochner's {{talent was}} {{recognised}} {{from an early}} age. He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master, possibly Robert Campin. Lochner's work seems influenced by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden; elements of their styles can be detected in the structure and colourisation of Lochner's mature works, especially in his Last Judgment, although neither {{is thought to be}} the master with whom he studied.|$|E
5|$|Jainism, {{though in}} decline {{during the late}} medieval period, also enjoyed the {{patronage}} of the Mysore kings, who made munificent endowments to the Jain monastic order at the town of Shravanabelagola. <b>Records</b> <b>indicate</b> that some Wodeyar kings not only presided over the Mahamastakabhisheka ceremony, an important Jain religious event at Shravanabelagola, but also personally offered prayers (puja) during the years 1659, 1677, 1800, 1825, 1910, 1925, 1940, and 1953.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that {{it used to be}} more widely {{distributed}} in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species may have led to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, is threatened by human development.|$|E

5|$|Soegija {{arrived in}} Muntilan in September 1926, where he began {{teaching}} algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little {{is known about}} his period as an instructor at the school, although <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that he based his teaching style on that of van Lith, {{who had died in}} early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's gamelan and gardening programs and became the chief editor of Swaratama. Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty.|$|E
5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It {{is likely that the}} clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. <b>Records</b> <b>indicate</b> that the bulk of the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of outlying records at Kaltukatjara (south-western Northern Territory), Mount Isa (north-western Queensland) {{and the area}} south of Bourke (north-western New South Wales) indicate that the bristle-faced free-tailed bat may have a greater distribution in the arid and semi-arid regions of NSW, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia than available <b>records</b> <b>indicate.</b> However its range and status remain relatively poorly known. In 2008 it had been recorded at 26 localities and few additional locations have been recorded in subsequent years.|$|E

5|$|This time, the Burmese king {{received}} the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. The Burmese chronicles {{say that the}} king was so insulted {{that he had the}} envoys executed. But both Burmese inscriptional evidence and Yuan <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that the envoys were not executed. At any rate, the imperial envoys did not get back to Yunnan in due time. The newly formed Yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route.|$|E
5|$|While {{the period}} when the name Cabernet Sauvignon became more {{prevalent}} over Petite Vidure is not certain, <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that the grape was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century Médoc region.

5|$|After {{more than}} 210years of {{relations}} with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official <b>records</b> <b>indicate</b> that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted {{in some of the}} first recorded explorations of much of the area. Seminoles continue to live in the Everglades region, and support themselves with casino gambling on six reservations located throughout the state.|$|E
