30|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{descriptive}} statistics and multivariate analyses, it can be concluded that the As content in rice does not significantly differ among climatic zones and rice types while Se differs among rice types. However Cd content in rice differs drastically according to <b>rice</b> <b>type</b> and climate zone. The elevated levels of toxic elements, Cd and As in rice suggests that paddy soils have been subject to a high input of anthropogenic contaminants that are most likely related to the agrogenic activities such as application of fertilizer used to improve production and quality since the geogenic input is not considerable in Sri Lanka. Interestingly, native rice varieties contained significantly higher content of Se which is an essential trace element that is considered as being deficient among Sri Lankan population. Since the Se intake among Sri Lankans seems to be low and critical while the main staple food does not supply adequate amounts, assessing the Glutathione peroxidase in blood in the population is highly warranted. It is also important to adopt regulations to control the agrogenic trace metal inputs.|$|E
