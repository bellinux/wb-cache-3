50|$|For the <b>Retaining</b> <b>Ring</b> connection, {{a groove}} will be {{machined}} onto the pipe end {{to hold the}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring.</b> The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a segmented stainless steel ring covered by a steainless steel spring and is used to fix the flange. For the assembly, the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> flange has to be put onto the machined pipe end. The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> has to be widened for getting it on the pipe end to snap into the before machined groove. The inside contour of the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> flange will cover the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> from the outside.|$|E
50|$|A <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is a {{fastener}} that holds components or assemblies onto a shaft or in a housing/bore when {{installed in a}} groove. Once installed, the exposed portion acts as a shoulder which retains the specific component or assembly. Circlips are a type of <b>retaining</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|The special inside contour of the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> flange {{covers the}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring,</b> which is {{installed}} onto the machined pipe end. A form-closed connection {{results from the}} tightening of the flange, which will be sealed by bonded seal or pipe seal carrier on the face side.|$|E
50|$|Bowed <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> are curved {{versions}} of standard flat {{internal and external}} <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> and exert a pre-load on an assembly when installed in the groove. This takes up the end-play and acts like a spring, which keeps the assembly in compression.|$|R

40|$|Case StudyRetaining {{rings are}} used to locate pump {{impellers}} axially on the shafts of high speed, high pressure Siemens Delaval boiler feed pumps. Upon repairing and refurbishing the inner barrels, the <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> {{were found to be}} badly worn and in some instances broken. This damage was eliminated by using a ?profiled? key. This case study discusses the pump design, the location and function of the <b>retaining</b> <b>rings,</b> the location and function of the keys and the failures observed. The reason for redesigning the key to a ?profiled? is presented. The new key design shields {{the leading edge of the}} retaining from impinging water and this is discussed in detail. No damaged <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> were observed after implementing ?profiled? keys...|$|R

50|$|The tire is fitted by heating to a {{controlled}} temperature, avoiding overheating. This causes the tire to expand. The wheel centre, usually already {{mounted on the}} axle, is lowered into the tire which is flange side up. The tire cools, and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> (a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop) is fitted into the groove. Hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down on to the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Retaining</b> <b>rings</b> are {{typically}} made from carbon steel, stainless steel or beryllium copper and may feature {{a variety of}} finishes for corrosion protection {{depending on the type}} of environment in which they are used.|$|R
50|$|Self-locking <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> can be {{installed}} in a housing/bore or on a shaft that {{has not had a}} groove machined into it. Self-locking rings with no lug holes are impossible to remove without either destroying the ring or warping it out of specified tolerances.|$|R
50|$|Removal of a worn tire is by {{machining}} out the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> {{and heating}} the tire to relax the interference fit.|$|E
50|$|The most usual {{cause of}} damage is drag braking on severe gradients. Because the brake blocks apply {{directly}} on the tire, it is heated up, relaxing the interference fit. It is not feasible to fit the tire with such a heavy interference as to eliminate this risk entirely, and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> will ensure that the tire can only rotate on the wheel center, maintaining its alignment. In rare instances the rotation could be so severe as to wear the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> down till it breaks, which could result in derailment.|$|E
50|$|Dodge Military trucks had {{the first}} beadlocks, called Combat Wheels; The 'combat wheels' were a divided-rim, that used a {{bolted-on}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> replacing the normal split ring wheels. They were designed for quick and easy tire replacement during combat, hence the name.|$|E
50|$|Axially {{assembled}} <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> {{are installed}} into machined grooves in housings/bores (internal) or on shafts (external). These rings are manufactured with lug holes—small {{holes in the}} lugs of both axial internal and external retaining rings—that are used to install/remove them, using pliers designed for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|New tool {{eliminates}} {{damage to}} ring through improper tool use. Tool installs spiral-wound <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> quickly, reliably, and safely. Tool inserts rings in splined or irregularly shaped bores, bores at bottom of deep ring and slides it along bore until it nests in groove. Pistons are moved by variety of linkages...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retaining</b> <b>rings</b> are {{assembled}} {{onto each}} end of electric generator rotors to support the rotor end-turn windings against rotational forces. They {{are attached to the}} ends of the slotted portion of the rotor body with an interference fit. Many of the rings presently in service are susceptible to intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) in the presence of moisture. IGSCC seems to occur first, and tends to be more severe, at stress concentrations in the rings and adjacent to geometric discontinuities in the mating rotor surface, such as, the edges of the rotor teeth. These same geometric features also tend to cause ultrasonic reflections that are difficult to discriminate from real damage. The capability of SAFT processing of TOFD data to discriminate IGSCC from geometric reflectors was investigated using several retired <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> assembled to mandrels simulating the generator rotor...|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is placed. The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is made of steel and is a press fit. The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|E
50|$|The tire is {{primarily}} {{held in place}} by its interference fit. The shoulder on the outside and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> also keep the tire in place if the interference fit is lost. This is most often due to severe drag braking down a gradient, or due to an error in the machining.|$|E
50|$|The process uses an {{abrasive}} and corrosive chemical slurry (commonly a colloid) {{in conjunction}} with a polishing pad and <b>retaining</b> <b>ring,</b> typically of a greater diameter than the wafer. The pad and wafer are pressed together by a dynamic polishing head and held in place by a plastic <b>retaining</b> <b>ring.</b> The dynamic polishing head is rotated with different axes of rotation (i.e., not concentric). This removes material and tends to even out any irregular topography, making the wafer flat or planar. This may be necessary to set up the wafer for the formation of additional circuit elements. For example, CMP can bring the entire surface within the depth of field of a photolithography system, or selectively remove material based on its position. Typical depth-of-field requirements are down to Angstrom levels for the latest 22 nm technology.|$|E
40|$|Proposed combustion-testing chamber burns {{specimens}} of materials in fully contained, high-pressure oxygen atmosphere. Test operator uses handles on threaded <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> to attach or remove top or bottom plates sealing combustion chamber. Tests conducted in static or flowing oxygen. Oxygen inlet and outlet far enough above burning specimen, little danger of entrainment of burning fragments in oxygen flowing out...|$|R
50|$|Inverted <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> are a {{variation}} of axially assembled rings in which the lug holes are inverted to fit {{in the bottom of}} the groove. Inverting the lugs allows greater clearance on a shaft or in a housing and forms a higher uniform shoulder good for retaining bearings and other components with large corner radii or chamfers.|$|R
50|$|A linear bushing is {{not usually}} pressed into a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such {{examples}} include two <b>retaining</b> <b>rings,</b> or a ring that is molded onto the OD of the bushing that matches with a groove in the housing. This is usually a more durable way to retain the bushing, because the forces acting on the bushing could press it out.|$|R
50|$|The sealing of the Parflange F37 <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> {{connection}} {{is done by}} a bonded seal on the face side of the pipe end or alternatively by a pipe seal carrier ("PSC"). The pipe seal carrier has soft seales (o-rings or F37-Seals) on both sides. On one side, the pipe seal carrier has a centering aid to improve assembly.|$|E
50|$|The cooling shroud {{could be}} removed without tools by {{unscrewing}} the front <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> from the barrel by hand. The aluminium cooling fins inside were in two pieces {{and once the}} shroud was removed, came loose from the barrel. A cold barrel could be unscrewed for field exchange. An integral bipod {{was attached to the}} shroud.|$|E
50|$|Six {{spring-steel}} folding fins {{are then}} {{added to the}} tube-like tail of the warhead body and pinned down with a plastic <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> {{so that they will}} unfold upon the warhead leaving the launch tube. The warhead body is then attached to the propellant charge via threads behind the tail fins, and the completed projectile-propellant assembly is inserted into the launcher tube to complete the weapon.|$|E
40|$|A pair of spaced collars {{are mounted}} {{at right angles}} on a clamp body by <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> which enable the collars to rotate {{with respect to the}} clamp body. Mounting posts extend through aligned holes in the collars and clamp body. Each collar can be clamped onto the {{inserted}} post while the clamp body remains free to rotate about the post and collar. The clamp body is selectively clamped onto each post...|$|R
50|$|Constant section <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> (snap rings) {{feature a}} uniform, {{constant}} section. In other words, the material {{used to make}} the ring is the same width at any point along the circumference of the ring. When they are contracted or expanded, they take on an elliptical deformation. As a result, they contact the groove at three or more isolated points but never continuously around the periphery. These rings are made from either flat or round wire.|$|R
