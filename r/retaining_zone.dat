40|$|The {{formation}} of deformation zones at the backfill soil of wrap faced retaining wall {{is governed by}} the shear strain accumulation. The performance of reinforced soil wall can be improved by observing the location of peak shear strains at dif-ferent depths. The wrap faced reinforced soil walls are modeled using FLAC 3 D. In modeling of wrap faced soil retaining walls, soil is modeled as elasto-plastic with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion modified with hyperbolic soil modulus model. The geotextiles are modeled by using shell structural element. The interfaces are used between shell elements and soil elements for proper interaction. The wall is formed in layers with facing support and after placing last layer the facing support is removed. The octahedral shear strains are determined along length of backfill at different elevations of the wrap faced walls. Horizontal displacements and vertical settlements are also determined to understand the location of shear deformations of reinforced zone and unreinforced backfill. Three deformation modes: localized deformation near face, relative movement of reinforced <b>zone</b> from <b>retained</b> <b>zone</b> and relative compaction at end of reinforcement are observed. 1...|$|R

The {{fact that there was}} no significant difference in N 2 O emissions between urea and high N brown coal granules suggests that the availability of nitrate for denitrification over the duration of the experiment was similar in these two treatments. In contrast, the reduction in N 2 O emissions from the low N urea-BC granules treatment suggests a lower nitrate availability over the duration of the incubation, or, alternatively, that the nitrate was <b>retained</b> in a <b>zone</b> where the activity of denitrifying organisms was inhibited. There is also speculation that low N (high C:N) biochars can reduce N 2 O emissions by catalysing the further reduction of N 2 O to N 2 [25, 26], which could represent an additional mechanism by which brown coal blends can reduce N 2 O emissions.

5000|$|Starting in the 1860s, the Tsarist {{occupation}} of Central Asia both {{increased the number}} who veiled and raised the status of veiling. Russia ruled Central Asia as one unit, called Turkestan, although certain <b>zones</b> <b>retained</b> domestic rule. The Tsarist government, while critical of veiling, kept separate laws for Russians and Central Asians {{in order to facilitate}} a peaceful, financially lucrative empire. Separate laws allowed prostitution in Russian zones, encouraging veiling as a firm way for Central Asian women to preserve their honor. Russian conquest also brought wealth and, subsequently, more Hajj participation. Hajj participation sparked a rise in religious observance, and in public displays of piety via the veil. Tsarist control thus primarily served to indirectly increase the veil's use. [...] Russian control shifted Central Asian's attitude toward the veil by encouraging Tatar immigration. Tatars had spent centuries under Russian rule and had adopted many European customs, including forgoing the veil. As Turkic speaking Muslims they also had a unique engagement with Central Asian life. Faced with this synthesis of Islamic and western practice, Central Asian women began to question, if not outright attack, veiling. By opening up Central Asian society to Tatar immigration, Russians enabled the spread of ideas that conflicted with traditional Central Asian mores.|$|R

The simulated results were in reasonable agreement with the nitrate, dissolved organic N and dissolved total N measurements from the study catchment and with other results in the literature. According to the simulations, the major sinks of N after clear-cutting were immobilisation by soil microbes, uptake by ground vegetation and sorption to soil. These sinks increased downslope from the clear-cut area, indicating the importance of an uncut buffer zone between the stream and the clear-cut area in reducing N exports. The buffer <b>zone</b> <b>retained</b> 76 % of the N flux coming from the clear-cut area.

Electropherograms that would be produced by whole column imaging and by single detectors placed at different locations along the focusing column are presented. Upon mobilization, peak heights of the Hb zones decrease, but the <b>zones</b> <b>retain</b> a relatively sharp constant profile and are migrating at a constant velocity. A further peak decrease occurs during readjustment at the locations of the original buffer/column interfaces, indicating that detection sensitivity is the lowest at these locations. An anionic carrier ampholyte mobility smaller than that of its cationic species produces a cathodic drift which is smaller than the transport rate used for electrophoretic mobilization. Compared to the case with equal mobilities of carrier ampholyte species, a small increase (decrease) is predicted for the cationic (anionic) mobilization rate within the focusing column. Simulation data suggest that electrophoretic mobilization after focusing and focusing with concurrent electrophoretic mobilization are comparable isotachophoretic processes that occur when there is an uninterrupted flux of an ion through the focusing column. Cathodic drift caused by unequal mobilities of the species of carrier ampholytes, electrophoretic mobilization, and decomposition occurring at the pH gradient edges are related electrophoretic processes...|$|R

Seedlings of Nicotiana tabacum grown in agar-filled Petri dishes were subjected to light intensities of 60 and 300 micromol m(- 2) s(- 1), respectively. Seedling biomass, sucrose, glucose and fructose concentration as well as primary root growth increased significantly with light intensity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} dynamics of estuarine shorelines in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES). Shoreline change is influenced by human activities (e. g., shoreline modification), and natural processes (e. g., waves, storms, and sea-level rise) on variable temporal and spatial scales in the coastal zone. This research examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of shoreline change, the drivers of that change, {{and the role of}} shoreline erosion in the sediment dynamics of the larger estuarine system. Historical rates of change were found to be comparable to previous studies at - 0. 5 ± 0. 07 m yr⁻¹. Decadal and sub-annual rates of change were highly variable over the study, both spatially and temporally. However, linear regression models indicate that the large changes in shoreline position observed in high-frequency (bi-monthly) surveys are captured within the long-term (historical) average rate of shoreline change. Simulations from a coupled hydrodynamic and wave model indicate that waves and storms (hurricanes) are important drivers of shoreline change. Wave energy along different shorelines was found to be dependent on shorezone characteristics such as shoreline orientation, wind direction and fetch, and nearshore bathymetry. The role of shoreline erosion in the sediment dynamics of the larger estuarine system was also investigated for a region of the APES, the Tar-Pamlico estuary. Shoreline erosion and shoreline modification were examined within the estuary in order to explore the significance of erosion as a source of fine sediment to the estuary. Sediment storage was also evaluated for the Tar-Pamlico estuary using rates of sediment accumulation determined from the radionuclide tracers of ²¹⁰Pb and ¹³⁷Cs. A fine sediment budget was constructed for the Tar-Pamlico estuary. The budget indicates that eroding wetland shorelines represent a significant (43 % of total fine sediment input) source of material to the estuary. Also, the majority of fine sediment is <b>retained</b> within <b>zones</b> of accumulation within the estuary, with only about 7 % potentially exported to the adjacent Pamlico Sound. Overall, this research highlights the dynamic process of estuarine shoreline change, and the role of that change in the functioning of the larger estuarine system.

A dynamic electrophoresis simulator {{was first used}} to provide {{a detailed description of}} focusing in a 100 -carrier component, pH 6 - 8 gradient using phosphoric acid as anolyte and NaOH as catholyte. These results are compared to an identical simulation except that the catholyte contained both NaOH and NaCl. A stationary, steady-state distribution of carrier components and hemoglobins is produced in the first configuration. In the second, the chloride ion migrates into and through the separation space. It is shown that even under these conditions of chloride ion flux a pH gradient forms. All amphoteric species acquire a slight positive charge upon focusing and the whole pattern is mobilized towards the cathode. The cathodic gradient end is stable whereas the anodic end is gradually degrading due to the continuous accumulation of chloride. The data illustrate that the mobilization is a cationic isotachophoretic process with the sodium ion being the leading cation. The peak height of the hemoglobin zones decreases somewhat upon mobilization, but the <b>zones</b> <b>retain</b> a relatively sharp profile, thus facilitating detection. The electropherograms that would be produced by whole column imaging and by a single detector placed at different locations along the focusing column are presented and show that focusing can be commenced with NaCl present in the catholyte {{at the beginning of the}} experiment.

The broad parameter {{space spanned by}} {{the wide range of}} effective viscosities, yield stresses, relaxation times, and strain rates encountered in the ductile lithosphere is explored systematically for weak and strong inclusions, the effective viscosity of which varies with respect to the matrix. Most inclusion studies to date focused on elastic or purely viscous rheologies. Comparing our results with linear-­viscous inclusions in a linear-­viscous matrix, we observe significantly different shape evolution of weak and strong inclusions over most of the relevant parameter space. The evolution of inclusion inclination relative to the shear plane is more strongly affected by elastic and plastic contributions to rheology in the case of strong inclusions. In addition, we found that strong inclusions deform in the transient viscoelastic stress regime at high Weissenberg numbers (≥ 0. 01) up to bulk shear strains larger than 3. Studies using the shapes of deformed objects for finite-­strain analysis or viscosity-­ratio estimation should establish carefully which rheology and loading conditions reflect material and deformation properties. We suggest that relatively strong, deformable clasts in shear <b>zones</b> <b>retain</b> stored energy up to fairly high shear strains.

40|$|The {{application}} of gradients in simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography has recently attracted interest {{as a method}} for further improving the performance of this continuous separation process. One possible implementation of gradients consists in setting the solvent strength in the desorbent stream higher than that in the feed stream. As a result, the components to be separated are more <b>retained</b> in the <b>zones</b> upstream of the feed position and more easily eluted in the zones downstream of the feed position. If a liquid mobile phase is used, gradients can be created by, dosing different solvents into the feed and desorbent ports. In a closed-loop gradient SMB arrangement the solvent strength within the unit {{will depend on the}} two feed compositions and on the characteristic flow-rates of the process. In this work an equilibrium stage model describing a true moving bed process is used to analyze, numerically the main features of a two-step gradient SMB process.

The European Committee on AST (EUCAST) has abandoned or decreased the intermediate zone for several drug/species combinations. This study focused on the effects of discontinuing the intermediate category on the rate of interpretation errors. In total, 10 341 non-duplicate clinical isolates were included in the study. For susceptibility testing the disc diffusion method was used. Error probabilities were calculated separately for diameter values flanking the interpretative category borders. Error probabilities were then applied to the actual numbers of clinical isolates investigated and expected rates of ME and vME were calculated. Applying EUCAST AST guidelines, significant rates of ME/vME were demonstrated for all drug/species combinations without an intermediate range. Virtually all ME/vME expected were eliminated in CLSI guidelines that <b>retained</b> an intermediate <b>zone.</b> If wild-type and resistant isolates are not clearly separated in susceptibility distributions, the retaining of an intermediate zone will decrease the number of ME and vME.

However, in such a case, turbulent burning velocity cannot grow with time during interaction of an initially laminar flame with a turbulent flow. Therefore, the analysis indicates a vital role played by local perturbations of reaction zone structure in premixed turbulent combustion. The dominance of these two terms and the important role played by the difference between them are confirmed by analyzing three DNS databases associated with both the corrugated flamelets and thin reaction zones regimes of premixed turbulent burning. Moreover, the DNS data show that perturbations of local displacement speed due to perturbations of local flamelet structure are also of paramount importance for modeling transport of flame surface density even in weakly turbulent flows. Finally, by simulating curved and/or strained laminar premixed flames and integrating the transport equation for W across the flames, the integral is shown to depend linearly on the stretch rate even in highly perturbed flames, with results obtained from variously stretched flames being close to each other. Based on this finding, {{the difference between the two}} dominant terms in the transport equation for the mean rate W̃ is hypothesized to depend linearly on the stretch rate conditioned to the reaction zone. Application of this hypothesis to the DNS data associated with the corrugated flamelets combustion regime yields encouraging results, thus, confirming a crucial role played by local perturbations of reaction zone structure even in weakly turbulent flames...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic foraminifera {{are used}} to {{identify}} late Pliocene-Quaternary near surface water masses on the northeastern flank of Chatham Rise by comparison with faunas in core-tops east of New Zealand. In an overview study, distance measures, ordinations, and discriminant analysis are applied to 32 faunas from Site 1123 B to identify similar faunas among 35 core-tops between 35 and 61 °S east of New Zealand. Many Site 1123 B faunas in the 2. 72 myr interval sampled compare with those in core-tops on the northern side of Chatham Rise from a similar latitude, and are identified as transitional zone assemblages now associated with the subtropical gyre. This result is consistent with studies of late Quaternary planktonic foraminifera from this region and suggests that, typically, the Subtropical Front was locked to Chatham Rise through glacial and interglacial periods, at least back to the late Pliocene. However, a fauna at ca. 1. 17 Ma compares with subpolar assemblages in core-tops between 44 and 48 °S and identifies cooler surface water. Expectedly, closer sampling may reveal additional periods when southern water moved over the northeastern flank of Chatham Rise. Although the dominance of Globorotalia inflata, a species typical of the southern margin of subtropical gyres, is a principal feature of Site 1123 B faunas, in a minority it is replaced as the most abundant species by dextral populations of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, particularly {{about the time of}} the middle Pleistocene transition. Close analogues of these variant transitional assemblages are not present in core-tops about Chatham Rise but sediment trap and coretop data from other regions suggest that they identify high fertility in the mixed layer associated with upwelling or mixing of water masses. The proportion of sinistrally coiled Neogloboquadrina pachyderma rises to ca. 0. 6 between ca. 2. 45 and 2. 57 Ma, soon after the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Although the coiling data indicate subantarctic near surface water, the species remains rare. As the faunas <b>retain</b> their transitional <b>zone</b> character, only minor entrainment of subantarctic water may have occurred...|$|R

It has been proposed that the great majority of women and men have been infected with HPV at least once during their lifetime. HPV infection is associated with a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from benign lesions to cervical cancer. In most cases, the infection is transient, where most of the individuals are healing, eliminating the virus without the presence of any clinical manifestation. Actually, more than 120 HPV types have been cataloged, of which approximately 40 can infect the mucosa of the anogenital tract and are collectively known as mucosal HPV, which are classified based on their oncogenic potential as either low- or high-risk HPV types. The low-risk HPV type causes benign hyperproliferative lesions or genital warts, with a very limited tendency for malignant progression, while the high-risk HPV type is strongly associated with premalignant and malignant cervical lesions. The HPV cycle initiates when the virus gains access to undifferentiated cells of the basement membrane of the squamous columnar junction epithelium of the ectocervix, after these regions are exposed to mechanical or chemical trauma. The basal cells in the transformation <b>zone</b> <b>retain</b> the ability to differentiate, a property required for virion production. Cervical infection with high-risk HPV typically lasts from 12 to 18 months and in most cases is cleared spontaneously. However, in some women the immune response is insufficient to eliminate the virus, resulting in a persistent, long-term infection that may progress to a malignant lesion. In this review, we discuss the biology and natural history of HPV infection and its association with cervical cancer. Keywords: biology, HPV, cance...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{wetlands}} {{provide important}} ecological {{services to the}} coastal zone, {{one of which is}} sediment retention. In this study we investigated sediment retention across a range of geomorphological settings and across vegetation zones comprising coastal wetlands. We selected six coastal wetlands dominated by mangroves over a gradient from riverine to tidal settings in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Each site was comprised of three distinct vegetation communities distributed as parallel zones to the coast line: seaward fringe mangroves, landward scrub mangroves and saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat of the high intertidal zone. We measured suspended sediment retention and sedimentation rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment transported and deposited in the mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon tracer, was used. Our results show a mean average sedimentation of 0. 64 +/- 0. 01 mg cm(- 2) spring tide(- 1), which was variable within sites, regardless of geomorphological setting. However, geomorphological setting influenced spatial patterns of sediment deposition. Riverine mangroves had a more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the fringe zone. Overall, the fringe <b>zone</b> <b>retained</b> the majority of sediment entering the coastal wetland during a tidal cycle with 0. 90 +/- 0. 22 mg cm(- 2) spring tide(- 1), accounting for 52. 5 +/- 12. 5 % of the total sedimentation. The presence of glomalin in suspended sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting, with riverine mangroves receiving more glomalin in suspended solids than tidal mangroves. Glomalin was also differentially deposited within the vegetation zones at different geomorphological settings: primarily at the fringe zone of tidal mangroves and within the scrub zone of riverine mangroves. The differences we observed in the spatial distribution of sedimentation and the difference in the origin of the sediment deposited in riverine and tidal mangroves are likely {{to have an impact on}} ecological processes.

40|$|Analysis and {{interpretation}} of soil properties dynamics is a keystone in understanding the hydrologic responses and yield potential of floodplain wetlands. This study characterizes the distribution and spatial trends of selected soil physical properties in the Kilombero floodplain, Tanzania. A total of 76 composite soil samples were taken from 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm depth in a regular grid design across three hydrological zones, related to flooding intensity defined as fringe, middle, and riparian {{during the rainy season}} of 2015. The samples were analyzed for soil texture, bulk density, organic carbon, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Seasonal soil moisture content was monitored at depths of 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm, using 17 frequency domain reflectometry profile probes type PR 2, installed at each hydrological zone for 18 months (March 2015 –August 2016). Data were subjected to classical statistical and geostatistical analyses. Results showed significant (p < 0. 05) differences in bulk density, texture, soil organic carbon (SOC), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) across the hydrological zones. Bulk density showed a clear increasing trend towards the fringe zone. Mean Ksat was highest at the riparian zone (69. 15 cm·d− 1), and clay was higher in the riparian (20. 3 %) and middle (28. 7 %) zones, whereas fringe had the highest percentage of sand (33. 7 – 35. 9 %). Geostatistical spatial results indicated that bulk density, silt, and SOC at 0 – 20 cm had intermediate dependence, whereas other soil properties at both depths had high spatial dependence. Soil moisture content showed a significant (p < 0. 05) difference across the hydrological zones. The riparian <b>zone</b> <b>retained</b> the highest soil moisture content compared to the middle and fringe zone. The temporal soil moisture pattern corresponded to rainfall seasonality and at the riparian zone, soil moisture exhibited a convex shape of sloping curve, whereas a concave sloping curve for topsoil and for the middle zone at the subsoil was observed during the start of the dry season. Our results are seen to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the spatial distribution of soil properties and as a reference for soil and water management planning in the floodplain...|$|R
40|$|Microbial sulfidogenesis plays a {{potentially}} {{important role in}} Fe and As biogeochemistry within wetland soils, sediments and aquifers. This study investigates the specific effects of microbial sulfidogenesis on Fe mineralogy and associated As mobility in mildly acidic (pH 6) and mildly basic (pH 8) advective-flow environments. A series of experiments were conducted using advective-flow columns, with an initial solid-phase comprising As(III) -bearing ferrihydrite-coated quartz sand. Columns for each pH treatment were inoculated with the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and were compared to additional abiotic control columns. Over a period of 28 days, microbial sulfidogenesis (as coupled to the incomplete oxidation of lactate) caused major changes in Fe mineralogy, including replacement of ferrihydrite by mackinawite and magnetite at the in-flow end of the inoculated columns. At pH 8, the Fe 2 + produced by electron transfer between sulfide and ferrihydrite was mainly <b>retained</b> near its <b>zone</b> of formation. In contrast, at pH 6, much of the produced Fe 2 + was transported with advecting groundwater, facilitating the downstream Fe 2 +-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite. At both pH 6 and pH 8, the sulfide-driven reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite and its replacement by mackinawite at the in-flow end of the inoculated columns resulted in substantial mobilization of As into the pore-water. At pH 8, this caused the downstream As concentrations within the inoculated columns to be greater than the corresponding abiotic column. However, the opposite occurred under pH 6 conditions, with the Fe 2 +-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite in the inoculated columns causing a decrease in downstream As concentrations compared to the abiotic column. Although thermodynamically favorable at intermediate times and depth intervals within the inoculated columns, solid As sulfide phases were undetectable by As XANES spectroscopy. Our findings show that microbial sulfidogenesis can trigger significant As mobilization in subsurface environments with advective groundwater flow. The results also demonstrate that formation of mackinawite by sulfidization of ferric (hydr) oxides is not effective for the immobilization of As, whereas the Fe 2 +-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite under mildly acidic conditions may mitigate As mobility...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Currently, we lack a {{theoretical}} {{explanation for why}} squamous cell cervical cancer develops predominantly in specific sites (i. e., along the squamocolumnar junction). We therefore implanted human cervical tissues containing the transformation zone in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice and studied morphology, steroid effects, gene expression, and human papillomavirus (HPV) factors. Methods. Normal and dysplastic human cervical tissues (3 x 2 mm) were placed subcutaneously in SCID-beige mice and later assessed by in situ hybridization for HPV 16 / 18 DNA and by immunohistochemistry for expression of CD 31, keratin, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen, HPV 16 E 6, p 53, and Notch- 1 (a binary cell fate determination protein). Some normal tissues were implanted with either a 90 - day release 1. 7 -mg 17 β-estradiol pellet or a 5 -mg tamoxifen pellet; others were infected prior to implantation with human recombinant adenovirus 5 vector containing a human cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase gene and later assessed by X-gal staining. Results. Murine and human vessels formed anastomoses by 3 weeks. For at least 11 weeks, normal tissue <b>retained</b> the transformation <b>zone</b> and normal cell-type-specific keratin expression and exhibited normal proliferation; Notch- 1 was present only in the basal cell layer. Dysplastic tissues exhibited koilocytosis, increased levels of cellular proliferation, and aberrant keratin, p 53, and Notch- 1 expression; HPV 16 / 18 DNA and HPV 16 E 6 protein were detected for at least 6 weeks. Squamous metaplasia of normal cervical epithelium resulted from estrogen exposure, and a predominant columnar differentiation pattern was associated with tamoxifen administration. Through stable adenovirus infection, β- galactosidase was expressed for at least 6 weeks. Conclusions. This small manipulatable xenograft model maintains normal and dysplastic human cervical epithelium through neovascularization. Neoplastic tissue retains HPV 16 / 18 DNA and a premalignant phenotype, including elevated levels of cellular proliferation and aberrant keratin, p 53, and Notch- 1 expression. These attributes constitute essential features of a biologic model through which one may study HPV-mediated human disease and may be superior to cell culture and transgenic murine systems. Furthermore, this {{may serve as a}} model for gene therapy. Finally, we suggest that the normal cervical epithelium is maintained through putative interactions between the Notch locus and cell cycle growth regulators such as p 53 and pRb. Neoplastic cervical epithelium may arise through disruption of this pathway. This theory may be testable in our animal model. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R
