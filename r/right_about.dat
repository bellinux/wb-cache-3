5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably.

Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London.

Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been.

After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai.

Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
