50|$|The new {{lifeboat}} hull {{was constructed}} using the clench method fixed with copper fastenings. The keel was 4 in deep and 5 in wide, {{with an iron}} keel plate and a belt of cork. She was 35 ft long with a breadth of 10 ft. The inside depth was 4 ft. There were fourteen oars which were double banked and she was also equipped with a dipping lug sail. The lifeboat would be steered by either a rudder or sweep oars. Benjamin Bond Cabbell II had a watertight deck, with copper tubes and self-acting valves to release the water, and portable airtight cases round {{the sides of the}} boat between the deck and the thwarts. Cork-packed air-cases were placed under the deck in the wings of the lifeboat. These cases weighed 4.5 tons and drew 18 in of water clear of ballast. The boat had a relatively light construction with a high bow and a <b>raking</b> stem. The <b>keel</b> was curved, typical of the north country-designed lifeboats first built in the late eighteenth century. The water ballast tanks had ten relieving valves and the rudder was retractable to prevent it being damaged when beach launched or during the recovery procedure.|$|R
