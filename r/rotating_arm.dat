40|$|This paper {{describes}} the feasibility study on vibration suppression by attaching two <b>rotating</b> <b>arms</b> to a torsionally vibrating body, which is suspended by cables. The effects of angular velocities and phase angles of <b>rotating</b> <b>arms</b> to the vibrating body on vibration suppression are examined. Accordingly, it is clarified experimentally and theoretically that torsional vibration is quickly suppressed {{by using the}} <b>rotating</b> <b>arms...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Langley {{attempted}} to make a working piloted heavier-than-air aircraft. His models flew, but his two attempts at piloted flight were not successful.

2500|$|In the Faraday's disc example, {{the disc}} is rotated {{in a uniform}} {{magnetic}} field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On {{the far side of}} the figure, the return current flows from the <b>rotating</b> <b>arm</b> through {{the far side of the}} rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to decrease the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the increase in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the <b>rotating</b> <b>arm</b> through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field increases the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the decrease in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.|$|E

50|$|A triple variant was custom {{designed}} for the Marriott Corporation, each ride had three main components: the wheels with their passenger cars; a set of supporting arms; and a single central supporting column. Each wheel rotated {{about the end of}} its own supporting arm. The arms in turn would either pivot or rotate together as a single unit about the top of the supporting column. The axis about which the <b>rotating</b> <b>arms</b> turned was offset from vertical, so that as the <b>arms</b> <b>rotated,</b> each <b>arm</b> and its corresponding wheel was raised and lowered. This allowed one wheel to be horizontal at ground level, and brought to a standstill for simultaneous loading and unloading of all its passenger cars, while the other wheel(s) continued to rotate vertically at considerable height.|$|R

50|$|Some water {{treatment}} filters use surface wash systems that {{break up the}} heavily clogged, granular media surface layer. Surface wash systems are buried {{in the top of}} the filter media or are suspended above the filter media surface. John R. Baylis developed a fixed grid system which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion. <b>Rotating</b> <b>arms</b> use jets of water to break up the clogged filter surface and to <b>rotate</b> a movable <b>arm</b> through the filter material. A surface wash step in a backwash cycle usually takes place at the beginning of the filter bed cleaning process.|$|R

50|$|Handcuffs are {{restraint}} devices {{designed to}} secure an individual's wrists close together. They comprise two parts, linked {{together by a}} chain, a hinge, or rigid bar. Each half has a <b>rotating</b> <b>arm</b> which engages with a ratchet that prevents it from being opened once closed around a person's wrist. Without the key, the handcuffs cannot be removed and so the handcuffed person is unable to move his or her wrists {{more than a few}} centimetres/inches apart, making many tasks difficult or impossible. This is usually done to prevent suspected criminals from escaping police custody.|$|E

The Nickelodeon original movie Splitting Adam was also filmed at Playland's water park.|$|E
50|$|The Darmstadt impact {{abrasion}} test was developed {{at a similar}} time but was not adopted by European Committee for Standardization. It involves dropping the test specimen onto a block of concrete and measuring the amount of wear or formation of holes. The specimen is held on {{the outer edge of}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>arm</b> and is travelling at speeds of up to 120 km/hr when it hits the surface. As the specimen holder is no longer driven, once dropped, the sample will slide on the concrete surface until it stops due to surface friction between it and the concrete surface.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also {{patented}} a TBM {{that employed}} Wilson's cutting discs, {{although they were}} mounted on <b>rotating</b> <b>arms,</b> which in turn were mounted on a rotating plate.
