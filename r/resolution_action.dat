5000|$|Cases are logical syllogisms {{that attempt}} to prove the {{resolution}} morally permissible (Affirmative) or morally incorrect (Negative) [...] The typical (though not mandated) case is divided into a framework, which outlines the conditions for discussing the resolution, and contentions. The most {{essential part of the}} framework is the value structure, which is composed of an ultimate value (often called the value premise or value criterion) that the case attempts to demonstrate the <b>resolution</b> <b>action</b> achieves/is in accordance with, and a value criterion. The value criterion is a way to attain, achieve and quantify the nebulous value. In most modern NFL resolutions, a value is often stated in the resolution. For example, [...] "Resolved: Just governments ought to ensure food security for its citizens." [...] Due to the fact that Justice is used in the resolution, it is an appealing value for many debaters. Morality is a common value due to its inclusion in many resolutions, followed by justice, social welfare, or other values depending on the topic. The framework also may contain definitions for purposes of clarity and/or excluding certain lines of argumentation, and preemptions/"spikes" [...] {{that attempt to}} preclude certain arguments that one's opponent is expected to make. A narrow definition can be a spike. The contention(s), of which this type of case must have at least one, links the resolution to the value structure. A proper contention necessarily has a claim, which summarizes the argument, at least one warrant, which is a reason the claim is true, and an impact, which explains the importance of the argument—or specifically why this argument meets the value criterion. In addition, contentions often include sub-points.|$|E

40|$|IIn {{recent decades}} the {{application}} of UV disinfection technology in water treatment has rapidly increased on a global scale, however important uncertainties remain regarding; the methods to achieve consistent and accurate measurement of polychromatic UV output, the fluence-response of microorganisms to UV wavelengths over the entire polychromatic lamp output range, and the optimal lamp conditions and compositions to optimise polychromatic UV disinfection performance. This research aimed to address {{each of these areas}} of uncertainty. First, limitations in the existing methods that are used for lamp output measurement were identified and quantified in terms of their potential to cause significant errors in polychromatic UV fluence calculation; solutions are proposed to overcome these limitations in future polychromatic fluence measurements. Next, a novel experimental apparatus was constructed, achieving the necessary spectral requirements to produce a high <b>resolution</b> <b>action</b> spectra for waterborne microorganisms over the 200 - 300 nm wavelength range. Application of this experimental setup to the comparison of the fluence-response of T 1 and T 1 UV phage, common organisms used in UV reactor validation, identified important differences in UV sensitivity dependent on host selection, and high <b>resolution</b> <b>action</b> spectra were then produced for T 1 UV with two hosts over the full polychromatic UV range for the first time. Also, new viral surrogates were identified using a theoretical genomic model to predict their UV sensitivities, two of which were identified as having the potential to extend the upper UV fluence validation test limits. Finally, the production of a novel high pressure plasma discharge polychromatic lamp was achieved without the use of mercury, showing considerable potential for future applications. Open Acces...|$|E

A potential solution is to capture and record just the minimum amount of information needed to perform a task of interest. In this paper, we propose a fully-coupled two-stream spatiotemporal architecture for reliable human action recognition on extremely low resolution (e. g., 12 x 16 pixel) videos. We provide an efficient method to extract spatial and temporal features and to aggregate them into a robust feature representation for an entire action video sequence. We also consider how to incorporate high resolution videos during training {{in order to build}} better low <b>resolution</b> <b>action</b> recognition models. We evaluate on two publicly-available datasets, showing significant improvements over the state-of-the-art. Comment: 9 pagers, 5 figures, published in WACV 201...|$|E

In that context, the Paper explains why a statutory approach is more effective than a contractual approach at removing obstacles in cross-border resolutions of those firms, and thus a better method to achieve financial stability. The Paper also recommends that the FSB establish a working group on statutory mechanisms for the cross-border resolution of financial firms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recognizing {{spontaneous}} expressions in real environments often {{works on}} face images captured in lower resolutions or with larger variation of head poses. In this paper, we analyze {{the effects of}} face image resolution for performance of automatic facial expression analysis (AFEA) systems. Different approaches are compared for face acquisition, facial feature extraction and representation, and facial expression recognition. Our evaluations are conducted at five different resolutions of the head region on two databases: 1) Cohn-Kanade expression database; and 2) FABO database. There is no obvious difference {{in the performance of}} expression analysis when the head region resolution is higher than 72 x 96 pixels. The performance of AFEA is acceptable for head regions with a resolution of 36 x 48. For head regions with lower resolutions than 36 x 48, the performance decreases quickly and AFEA systems become impractical.

40|$|Optimistic {{replication}} {{is often}} viewed as essential for large scale systems and for supporting mobile computing. In optimistic replication, updates can be made concurrently to different file replicas, resulting in multiple versions of the file. To recover from these conflicting updates, after-the fact conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>actions</b> are required to recombine multiple versions into one. This paper defines these concepts and discusses approaches to measure them in optimistically replicated systems. Measurement {{of the number of}} conflicting updates and conflict resolution is important to judge the practicality of optimistic replication. An environment where conflicting updates are frequent will not be attractive since users cannot assume they have up-to-date data. Although many conflicts can be automatically resolved, some conflicts require user intervention; such conflicts cannot be too common. This paper shows an approach to measure the number of conflicting updates. From this measurement we [...] ...|$|R
