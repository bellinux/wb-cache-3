5000|$|The Morris Fourteen Series III is most readily {{distinguished}} {{in having}} a painted, rather than chromed, <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl</b> [...] - [...] as also happened with its larger sibling, the Morris Twenty-Five.|$|R
5000|$|The Twenty-Five [...] "Series III" [...] {{had a new}} {{over-head}} valve Morris OPEM engine, still displacing 3485cc and {{rated at}} 25 hp. The model is distinguished by {{a small number of}} cosmetic changes including a painted, rather than chromed, <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl.</b>|$|R
25|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1923–1924 the car {{was sent to the}} {{aircraft}} maker Boulton Paul at Norwich, for wind tunnel tests. They streamlined the car with a narrow <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl</b> at the nose and a long tapered tail. The rear wheels were also fitted with disk covers. Engine compression was raised by new pistons.|$|R
5000|$|Prices for the Model A {{ranged from}} US$385 for a {{roadster}} to US$1400 for the top-of-the-line Town Car. The engine was a water-cooled L-head inline 4-cylinder with a displacement of 201 CID L. [...] This engine provided [...] Top speed was around 65 mph. The Model A had a 103.5 in wheelbase {{with a final}} drive ratio of 3.77:1. The transmission was a conventional 3-speed sliding gear manual unsynchronized unit with a single speed reverse. The Model A had 4-wheel mechanical drum brakes. The 1930 and 1931 models were available with stainless steel <b>radiator</b> <b>cowling</b> and headlamp housings.|$|E
5000|$|... "Galloping Goose" [...] motor rail buses {{kept the}} Rio Grande Southern {{railroad}} viable from the 1930s by carrying mail {{until they were}} used to scrap their own line in 1953. Knott also purchased this efficient and unique rail vehicle, the RGS Motor #3, which soldiers on at the GT&C on quieter days during the off-season - serving its original purpose when patronage does not justify hostling a steam engine to pull an entire train. It is [...] "kitbashed" [...] from its original Pierce-Arrow limousine frame, engine, <b>radiator,</b> <b>cowling</b> and body which was converted to rail use by replacing the front axle with a four-wheel bogie truck and fitting the rear axle with flanged wheels at first, then a bogie truck which linked the powered axle to its mate with a chain drive. A RGS shop-built freight box (converted with trolley seats for passenger service in 1950) articulates on the kingpin over the chain driven center truck. The wooden limousine sedan body was replaced after World War II with a 1939 Wayne military-surplus bus body with both left and right doors. Its Pierce-Arrow gasoline engine has been replaced, first with a war-surplus GMC gasoline engine at the RGS, then at Knott's with first a war-surplus in-line 6 cylinder Diamond-Reo gasoline engine, and since 1997 with a Cummins Diesel engine supported with an I-beam frame extension salvaged from the demolished Windjammer Surf Racers roller coaster.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the model tests is to clarify the motions in the {{alighting}} on water of a land plane. After discussion of the model laws, the test method and test procedure are described. The deceleration-time-diagrams of the landing of {{a model of the}} Bf 109 show a high deceleration peek of greater than 20 g which can be lowered to 4 to 6 g by <b>radiator</b> <b>cowling</b> and brake skid...|$|E

5000|$|The {{chromium-plated}} radiator shell was {{succeeded in}} August 1934 by a <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl</b> painted in body colour {{and the body}} given more modern wings with valances for better protection. The Harley was dropped for 1935.Sports variants were added in August 1933 with a lowered chassis and higher compression engine. A 4-seater sports tourer and a saloon named Greyhound. In 1936 another body named Kempton was available on the same chassis. These cars carry a distinctive radiator shell. The sports models shared the new illuminated semaphore direction indicators and synchromesh gears.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian term Superleggera (meaning [...] "super-light") was trademarked by Carrozzeria Touring for {{lightweight}} sports-car {{body construction}} that only resembles a space-frame chassis. Using a three-dimensional frame {{that consists of}} a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the <b>radiator,</b> <b>cowl,</b> and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure. A skin {{is attached to the}} outside of the frame and is often made of aluminium. This body construction is however not stress-bearing, and still requires the addition of a chassis.|$|R
25|$|P-40K, an Allison-engined P-40L, {{with the}} nose-top scoop {{retained}} and the Allison-configured nose <b>radiators</b> scoop, <b>cowl</b> flaps and vertical-stabilizer-to-fuselage fillet. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the Kittyhawk Mk III, {{it was widely}} used by US units in the CBI.|$|R
50|$|Ahead of the car's forward {{bulkhead}} the brake cylinders, fire extinguisher system, battery and radiator were {{carried on a}} tray-like extension to the cockpit floor pan, constructed in lighter 20 gauge aluminium sheet. Herd did consider using side-mounted radiators, but these were too complex to design and build in the time available. The car's fibreglass nose bodywork enclosing the radiator was relatively square, with a near-rectangular opening for the radiator intake. On {{either side of the}} radiator opening Herd placed small wings to generate downforce, moulded with the <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl</b> as a single unit. These wings were fixed in position, braced with a steel tube that spanned their full width, and carried adjustable trim tabs along their trailing edges. At the rear of the car a large, single-plane, adjustable wing was mounted atop the gearbox, between the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|This {{installation}} {{was subsequently}} redesigned into the 'Universal Power Plant' (UPP) <b>radiator</b> and <b>cowling</b> installations {{developed for the}} Avro Lincoln (Merlin 65, 68, and 85) and also used on the Vickers Windsor (Merlin 85), and subsequently used on the Avro Tudor (Merlin 100-series), Canadair North Star/Argonaut (Merlin 600-series), and Avro Shackleton - Griffon 61 and 62.|$|R
50|$|In 1933 Alfa Romeo {{experienced}} economic difficulties, {{and withdrew}} its in-house team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari became the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo, when the factory {{released to the}} Scuderia the up-to-date Monoposto Tipo B racers. In 1935 Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the Alfa Romeo Bimotore, the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl.</b> Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably Tazio Nuvolari, Giuseppe Campari, Achille Varzi and Louis Chiron) and several talented rookies (such as Tadini, Guy Moll, Carlo Maria Pintacuda, and Antonio Brivio) from his headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, Modena, Italy, until 1938, at which point Alfa Romeo made him {{the manager of the}} factory racing division, Alfa Corse. Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from January 1, 1938, the official racing activity to Alfa Corse whose new buildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at Portello (Milan). The Viale Trento e Trieste facilities then remained active for assistance to the racing customers. In October 1939 Enzo Ferrari left Alfa when the racing activity stopped; his company became Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which manufactured machine tools. The deal with Alfa included the condition that he not use the Ferrari name on cars for four years. In future years, SEFAC was used, for Scuderia Enzo Ferrari Automobili Corsa.|$|R
50|$|The Westfall Sport uses a {{welded steel}} tube {{fuselage}} with fabric covering. It was originally {{equipped with a}} model A Ford engine. The prototype used a radiator with a hole cut out for the prop shaft, but later changed to a modified OX-5 <b>radiator</b> below the <b>cowling.</b> A second prototype was built with a 65 hp. LeBlond engine in 1935.|$|R
50|$|These {{doodlebug}}s {{were used}} to plow, make hay, haul logs, and pull out stumps. To do all this, the doodlebug needed good ground clearance for use in any conditions and climbing almost any terrain. For protection they had a hood, <b>cowl</b> <b>radiator,</b> a small seat, some had a small truck bed, and most had a hitching point with which to tow.|$|R
25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, <b>radiator</b> <b>cowl,</b> cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R
5000|$|... 1934 Jock Leith of Inverness for £10 [...] "badly burnt {{extremely}} rusty", {{engine block}} and head cracked. Leith had the car rebuilt at Pavilion Road, Knightsbridge. Work included repair or replacement of cylinder block, pressure oiling was installed and accordingly the dash drip feed removed. Modified body installed with a 1924 <b>cowled</b> <b>radiator,</b> a [...] "square stubby tail" [...] replaced the original. ‘Motor Sport’ (October 1934) observed the works and reported [...] "Chassis is stamped No. 4, {{so it is}} possibly a practice car".|$|R
50|$|For {{its next}} outing, Chitty 1 was refitted, as a {{two-seater}} with a <b>cowled</b> <b>radiator</b> and a properly plumbed exhaust. It attained nearly 120 mi/h km/h on one occasion, and had its race handicap consistently reappraised. It subsequently crashed, removing three fingers from a timing official. The car was rebuilt, and {{passed into the}} ownership of the sons of Arthur Conan Doyle, but was quickly retired as a racing car, and was later bought for spare parts by John Morris, the Maybach engine being offered to W.Boddy, editor of Motor Sport.|$|R
50|$|The custom {{was based}} on the idea of “Dieselpunk” style model, rocket shaped and with maximal functionalism. Harley-Davidson XR 1200 of 2009 model year was the basis. The model is {{equipped}} with sports slick tires RSD, braking systems and machines from PM, running boards and damper from LSL. The rear suspension was designed on the basis of racing technology — with a single shock absorber under the engine. Creators made the custom’s back lighter by shifting down the center of gravity. Oil tank is moved under the engine and control unit — to the tail of the model. Under the lower <b>cowling</b> <b>radiator</b> and other parts are located. Titanium exhaust system of the company Zard is installed.|$|R
40|$|This report {{gives the}} results of {{measurements}} of the lift, drag, and propeller characteristics of several wing and nacelle combinations with a tractor propeller. The nacelles were so located that the propeller was about 31 % of the wing chord directly ahead of {{the leading edge of}} the wing, a position which earlier tests (NASA Report No. 415) had shown to be efficient. The nacelles were scale models of an NACA cowled nacelle for a radial air-cooled engine, a circular nacelle with the V-type engine located inside and the radiator for the cooling liquid located inside and the radiator for the type, and a nacelle shape simulating the housing which would be used for an extension shaft if the engine were located entirely within the wing. The propeller used in all cases was a 4 -foot model of Navy No. 4412 adjustable metal propeller. The results of the tests indicate that, at the angles of attack corresponding to high speeds of flight, there is no marked advantage of one type of nacelle over the others as far as low drag is concerned, since the drag added by any of the nacelles in the particular location ahead of the wing is very small. The completely cowled nacelle for a radial air-cooled engine appears to have the highest drag, the liquid-cooled engine appears to have the highest drag, the liquid-cooled engine nacelle with external radiator slightly less drag. The liquid-cooled engine nacelle with <b>radiator</b> in the <b>cowling</b> hood has about half the drag of the cowled radial air-cooled engine nacelle. The extension-shaft housing shows practically no increase in drag over that of the wing alone. A large part of the drag of the liquid-cooled engine nacelle appears to be due to the external radiator. The maximum propulsive efficiency for a given propeller pitch setting is about 2 % higher for the liquid-cooled engine nacelle with the <b>radiator</b> in the <b>cowling</b> hood than that for the other cowling arrangements...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943, a brand-new La-5 made a forced landing on a German {{airfield}} providing the Luftwaffe {{with an opportunity to}} test-fly the newest Soviet fighter. Test pilot Hans-Werner Lerche wrote a detailed report of his experience. He particularly noted that the La-5FN excelled at altitudes below 3,000 m (9,843 ft) but suffered from short range and flight time of only 40 minutes at cruise engine power. All of the engine controls (throttle, mixture, propeller pitch, <b>radiator</b> and <b>cowl</b> flaps, and supercharger gearbox) had separate levers which forced the pilot to make constant adjustments during combat or risk suboptimal performance. For example, rapid acceleration required moving no less than six levers. In contrast, contemporary German aircraft, especially the BMW 801 radial-engined variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 front line fighter, had largely automatic engine controls with the pilot operating a single lever and electromechanical devices, like the Kommandogerät pioneering engine computer on the radial-engined Fw 190s, making the appropriate adjustments. Due to airflow limitations, the engine boost system (Forsazh) could not be used above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). Stability in all axes was generally good. The authority of the ailerons was deemed exceptional but the rudder was insufficiently powerful at lower speeds. At speeds in excess of 600 km/h (370 mph), the forces on control surfaces became excessive. Horizontal turn time at 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and maximum engine power was 25 seconds.|$|R
2500|$|The {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} Bee was of novel construction, built around a wide box formed from four spanwise spruce members connected with ply, constant in chord but tapering in thickness. [...] Aerofoil shaped ribs were then slipped around the box and fabric covered. The wings had almost constant chord, tapering in plan only slightly and carrying long ailerons. A 40hp (30kW) four-cylinder water-cooled Carden-Ford engine lay buried in each wing immediately behind the box spar, driving a small two-bladed propeller via a gearbox, which increased the output speed by 10%, and a shaft to the trailing edge. These shafts were horizontal in flight, and so emerged above the wing surface on the way rearwards, contained in a shallow <b>cowling.</b> <b>Radiators</b> were mounted inside the wing, next to the engine, the cooling air ducted from under {{the front of the}} wing and exited via slots {{in the rear of the}} cowling. Fuel was stored in leading-edge tanks.|$|R
5000|$|Inline and radial engines {{were both}} {{incorporated}} into the Kraftei concept : the Junkers Jumo 211 was a pioneering example of engine unitization, as used on both the Junkers Ju 88 using a novel annular radiator for both main engine coolant and engine oil cooling needs, with exactly the same nacelle packaging used to power the Messerschmitt Me 264 V1's first flights. Both the examples of the Dornier Do 217 medium bomber powered by inline engines, and the Axis Powers' largest-flown powered aircraft of any type, the Blohm & Voss BV 238 flying boat used essentially the same unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants, complete with [...] "chin" [...] radiators under the nacelles as integral components. A differing Kraftei physical packaging is also {{believed to have been}} crafted by the Heinkel firm for the DB 603 engines used on its Heinkel He 219A night fighter, as {{what appears to be the}} same exact engine installation design used for the He 219A was also used for the quartet of ordered airframes for the same firm's He 177B four-DB 603-engined heavy bomber design's prototype series, as both airframe types' engine [...] "units" [...] used annular <b>radiators</b> and cylindrical <b>cowls</b> of identical appearance to enclose them. The air-cooled BMW 801 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row radial engine was also provided in both formats for a number of German designs, especially for twin and multi-engined airframes, with the [...] "M" [...] or [...] "T" [...] first suffix letter designating whether it was a Motoranlage (the original format of the Kraftei concept) or the more comprehensively consolidated Triebwerksanlage format unitized powerplant — the BMW-designed forward cowling ring always used with the 801 incorporated the engine's oil cooler, making it an easy task for aviation engineers to use for such a [...] "unitized" [...] mounting concept.|$|R
