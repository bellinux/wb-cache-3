5000|$|Rolling cone {{motion is}} the rolling motion {{generated}} by a cone rolling over another cone. In rolling cone motion, {{at least one of}} the cones is convex, while the other cone may be either convex, or concave, or a flat surface (a flat surface can be regarded as a special case of a cone whose apex angle equals [...] ). The distinguishing characteristic of a rolling cone, in relation to other axially symmetrical <b>rollers</b> (<b>cylinder,</b> sphere, round disk), is that while rolling on a flat surface, the cone's center of gravity performs a circular motion rather than a linear one. Another unique characteristic is that one of its points (its apex) is at rest throughout the entire motion.|$|R

Roller bearings typically have higher radial load capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads. If {{the inner and}} outer races are misaligned, the bearing capacity often drops quickly compared to either a ball bearing or a spherical roller bearing.|$|R

Structure optimization and parameter modification is the key step of seeking better performance in the ink system. In this paper, the ink system of modern offset press was the research object, seeking the discrepancy of different structures and parameters. The surfaces of ink <b>rollers</b> and <b>cylinders</b> were discreted by computer simulation,based on this,established the math model of steady time in batch and continuous ink feeding system, then analysised the feeding system and vibration system. The simulation result indicates that the ink feeding system, the way of vibrator oscillation, plate coverage have great influence on the dynamic property. In batch ink feeding system, the property of ink system would be improved by increasing ductor roller swing frequency, and approached to continuous ink feeding system. On the machine with adjustable ductor roller swing frequency, the steady time would be reduced by regulating ductor roller swing frequency, improved efficiency with reducing paper wasting...|$|R

50|$|The single gear-driven {{camshaft}} {{is arranged}} {{so that each}} lobe operates the exhaust valves {{on a pair of}} <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Roller</b> cam followers are used. In the middle of the camshaft is a speed governor. The governor causes lengthwise movement of the camshaft, and the cam-lobes are slightly widened to allow for this. The speed-regulation caused by the governor is set by a lever on the steering column and the same mechanism advances the spark with increased engine speed. The operation of the governor is overridden by the foot throttle (either slower or faster - the pedal is of a type allowing it to be raised or depressed), but for normal running the governor offers an early form of cruise control.|$|R

40|$|With the popularization of the inverter-driven air-conditioner and the {{requirement}} of comfort and energy saving, the operating frequency of inverter-driven air-conditioner is lower and lower, even to 1 Hz. But when the air-conditioner operates under the frequency of 10 Hz, a periodic sound {{will appear in the}} air-conditioner outdoor unit, which should be researched and solved. According to the experiment test and theoretical analysis, it is found that the periodic sound is the excited resonance when the valve opens. The resonator is composed by the discharge port of top-flange and discharge cavity which is made up by <b>cylinder,</b> <b>roller,</b> top-flange and bottom-flange. In one cycle the characteristic of the periodic sound is that the sound will be only taken place when the valve opens and the frequency of the sound will be higher and higher with the crank angle increasing.

50|$|Since the {{effectiveness}} of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were steam rollers. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs in a low gear to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls {{in much the same way}} as a vibrating <b>roller.</b> The double <b>cylinder</b> or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as 'chip chasers' which followed behind the hot tar and chipping laying machines. Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} kraft handsheets of {{controlled}} pH and water absorbency was prepared and printed on a single-sheet flexographic proofpress, with a water-based ink. Ink transfer increased with increasing water absorbency. Ink penetration also increased with water absorbency, although {{the effect is}} small in the commercial range of ink levels. There is {{a slight increase in}} transfer of this alkaline ink to more acidicpapers, but there is no apparent influence of pH on ink setting. A series of newsprint samples was also printed. Within related wood species, print density on newsprint increases with fines content, while set-off decreases with increasing suqlace fines. The correlation between print-through and opacity is much better than was found with oil-based inks on the same newsprints, due to the absence of oil penetration effects. [11, capable of printing single handsheets made under a wider range of conditions and properties than is possible with webs. We report here the results of quantitative ink transfer measurements. We have printed handsheets made from a bleached kraft pulp at controlled pH and controlled water absorbency. Print density, printthrough, and set-off measurements have also been made on a well-characterized range of newsprints. EXPERIMENTAL Press A simple schematic diagram of the press is shown in Fig. 1. Typically, about 1 mL of ink forms the ink pond between the engraved inking <b>roller</b> (anilox <b>cylinder)</b> and the first doctor blade. After the ink is distributed on the anilox cylinder, the plate is inked and the sample printed. The press normally runs at 200 rpm (1. 6 d s). For set-off, a Kromecote cast-coated paper is used as reference. The nip between the print and the reference paper is closed immediately after printing.

40|$|Today {{small metal}} parts are mass-produced as for example <b>rollers</b> in <b>cylinder</b> bearings. At high {{velocity}} cutting the metal is {{cut with a}} great force in a scissor-like device. Both precision and repeatability {{is important to be}} able to guarantee good quality, but from an economical point of view {{it is also important to}} keep a great manufacturing capacity. The part of the process that is most time consuming is when the metal bar, that is about to be cut, is fed to the right position. Therefore it is interesting to examine if the time used for positioning can be reduced. This thesis examines if more advanced automatic control can be used to speed up the process while maintaining the precision. In order to test and evaluate different theories, two different mathematical models have been developed. The models where implemented in the simulation program SIMULINK in MATLAB and they where compared to and adapted to data measured on the physical machine. One model is developed from physical relationships and mostly used for simulations while the other one, a condition state model, has been used for regulator design. The first question to answer was if it is at all possible to control the process any faster. When a theoretical limit was found the next step was to design a regulator to show that the theory of automatic control does not imply too great limitations. The design that was chosen was condition state feedback where the states were appraised with an observer. A faster system will raise the demands on cycle times and precision. To make sure that the hardware isn’t the limiting factor, design requirements have been set up. A small list of what hardware is available has also been put together (and shows that it is possible to implement such a system). The conclusion is that it is, theoretically, possible to radically increase the manufacturing capacity. The assumptions for this to be accomplished is especially that the uncertainty of the model is minimizedand that hardware with enough capacity can be found...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{accordance}} with environmental sustainability {{and in order}} to optimize the recycling process of prints from indirect electrophotography with liquid toner the results of investigating the effects of changes in printing conditions on the characteristics of recycled fibres is presented. Changing of printing machine conditions, respecting of voltage variations, comprises of the reverse <b>rollers</b> and intermediate <b>cylinder.</b> Based on the results it can be concluded that the change in the voltage of the reverse rollers more affect the recycling efficiency with respect to the voltage change of the intermediate cylinder. Brightness gain is higher when the print for recycling is made on uncoated paper compared to coated, and dependent on the voltage changes. Effective residual ink concentration decreases far more on handsheets obtained from recycled samples on uncoated paper in relation to both sides coated paper. Increasing the positive voltage of intermediate cylinder and increasing the negative charge of reverse rollers increases the 3 D gamut CIE L*a*b* color cubic units. Guidelines for the size of the voltage in order to obtain optimal print reproduction are provided. The further research will include the development in area of clean technologies, advanced materials, closed loop systems; therefore the significant terms in the area of environmental sustainability...|$|R
30|$|Conventional {{spinning}} is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small plastic deformation after each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different sizes of rollers for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two <b>cylinder</b> <b>rollers</b> with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically clamp the sheet metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with conventional spinning, the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in conventional spinning, and the plastic deformation in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the roller path, not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from conventional spinning processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|R
