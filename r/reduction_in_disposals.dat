40|$|This paper explores public {{policies}} for reduction of municipal solid waste. We parameterize a simple model of waste disposal using {{supply and demand}} elasticities from the economics literature and 1990 prices and quantities of recyclable and recycled materials. Using this model, we calculate the waste <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> response to three {{public policies}}: (i) deposit/ refunds, (ii) advance disposal fees, and (iii) recycling subsidies. The results illustrate {{the effects of the}} three policies on source reduction and recycling of five recyclable materials that comprise 56 percent of municipal solid waste: aluminum, glass, paper, plastic, and steel. The calculated responses provide information about the cost of reducing municipal solid waste through various policies. This analysis suggests that a 7. 5 percent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> of the solid wastes in the model might have been optimal in 1990 from a benefit-cost perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|Policies that {{encourage}} recycling {{may be used}} to reduce environmental costs from waste disposal because direct restrictions on disposal are difficult to enforce. Four recycling policies have been advanced: (i) taxes on the use of virgin materials, (ii) deposit/refund programs, (iii) subsidies to recycled material production, and (iv) recycled content standards. In this article, I analyze the structure of these policies and their cost-effectiveness <b>in</b> achieving <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal.</b> I then examine the policies in the empirical context of the recycling of lead from automobile batteries. In order to calculate the effects of recycling programs, I estimate the elasticities for primary and secondary lead supply and demand. My results suggest that price-based policy mechanisms can be successful in increasing lead recovery and that the difference in efficiency between the four approaches is similar. ...|$|R

40|$|The Efficient Separations and Processing (ESP) Crosscutting Program {{was created}} in 1991 to identify, develop, and perfect separations {{technologies}} and processes to treat wastes and address environmental problems throughout the DOE Complex. The ESP funds several multi-year tasks that address high-priority waste remediation problems involving high-level, low-level, transuranic, hazardous, and mixed (radioactive and hazardous) wastes. The ESP supports applied research and development (R and D) leading to demonstration or use of these separations technologies by other organizations within DOE-EM. Treating essentially all DOE defense wastes requires separation methods that concentrate the contaminants and/or purify waste streams for release to the environment or for downgrading to a waste form less difficult and expensive to dispose of. Initially, ESP R and D efforts focused on treatment of high-level waste (HLW) from underground storage tanks (USTs) {{because of the potential}} for large <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> costs and hazards. As further separations needs emerge and as waste management and environmental restoration priorities change, the program has evolved to encompass the breadth of waste management and environmental remediation problems...|$|R

40|$|An {{electrolytic}} decontamination {{technology has}} been developed and successfully demonstrated at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for the decontamination of actinide processing gloveboxes. The technique decontaminates the interior surfaces of stainless steel gloveboxes utilizing a process similar to electropolishing. The decontamination device is compact and transportable allowing it to be placed entirely within the glovebox line. In this way, decontamination {{does not require the}} operator to wear any additional personal protective equipment and {{there is no need for}} additional air handling or containment systems. Decontamination prior to glovebox decommissioning reduces the potential for worker exposure and environmental releases during the decommissioning, transport, and size reduction procedures which follow. The goal of this effort is to reduce contamination levels of alpha emitting nuclides for a resultant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> waste level category from High Level Transuranic (TRU) to low Specific Activity (LSA, less than or equal 100 nCi/g). This <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> category results in a 95 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> and disposition costs for the decontaminated gloveboxes. The resulting contamination levels following decontamination by this method are generally five orders of magnitude below the LSA specification. Additionally, the sodium sulfate based electrolyte utilized in the process is fully recyclable which results in the minimum of secondary waste. The process bas been implemented on seven gloveboxes within LANL`s Plutonium Facility at Technical Area 55. Of these gloveboxes, two have been discarded as low level waste items and the remaining five have been reused...|$|R

40|$|For 13 years, {{low-level}} waste (LLW) generator fees and disposal volumes for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office (NNSA/NV) Radioactive Waste Management Sites (RWMSs) {{had been on}} a veritable roller coaster ride. As forecast volumes and disposal volumes fluctuated wildly, generator fees were difficult to determine and implement. Fiscal Year (FY) 2000 forecast projections were so low, the very existence of disposal operations at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) were threatened. Providing the DOE Complex with a viable, cost-effective disposal option, while assuring the disposal site a stable source of funding, became {{the driving force behind the}} development of the Waste Generator Access Fee at the NTS. On September 26, 2000, NNSA/NV (after seeking input from DOE/Headquarters [HQ]), granted permission to Bechtel Nevada (BN) to implement the Access Fee for FY 2001 as a two-year Pilot Program. In FY 2001 (the first year the Access Fee was implemented), the NTS Disposal Operations experienced a 90 percent increase in waste receipts from the previous year and a 33 percent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> fee charged to the waste generators. Waste receipts for FY 2002 were projected to be 63 percent higher than FY 2001 and 15 percent lower in cost. Forecast data for the outyears are just as promising.

50|$|Oakland’s Zero Waste Policy evolved out of {{a series}} of {{mandates}} originating with the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which required every city and county in California to reduce their solid waste disposal amounts by 50% by year 2000. Soon after, in 1990, the Alameda County Waste Reduction and Recycling Initiative Charter Amendment (Measure D) mandated a 75% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> waste <b>disposal</b> countywide, allowing the Alameda County Source Reduction and Recycling Board to set a deadline for the goal. This board set 2010 as the deadline date. In 2002, the City of Oakland advocated for this goal by adopting a 75% reduction waste goal through Resolution 77500. This resolution called upon the Environmental Service Division of the City of Oakland’s Public Works Agency to identify strategies to accomplish this goal. The City also amended the Oakland Municipal Code to establish requirements for construction and demolition debris waste <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> 2002 through Ordinance #612253.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of its}} EMS, Sandia {{performs}} {{an annual}} environmental aspects/impacts analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the environmental aspects associated with Sandia's activities, products, and services and the potential environmental impacts associated with those aspects. Division and environmental programs established objectives and targets based on the environmental aspects associated with their operations. In 2007 the most significant aspect identified was Hazardous Materials (Use and Storage). The objective for Hazardous Materials (Use and Storage) was to improve chemical handling, storage, and on-site movement of hazardous materials. One of the targets supporting this objective was to develop an effective chemical exchange program, making a business case for it in FY 07, and fully implementing a comprehensive chemical exchange program in FY 08. A Chemical Exchange Program (CEP) team was formed to implement this target. The team consists of representatives from the Chemical Information System (CIS), Pollution Prevention (P 2), the HWMF, Procurement and the Environmental Management System (EMS). The CEP Team performed benchmarking and conducted a life-cycle analysis of the current management of chemicals at SNL/NM and compared it to Chemical Exchange alternatives. Those alternatives are as follows: (1) Revive the 'Virtual' Chemical Exchange Program; (2) Re-implement a 'Physical' Chemical Exchange Program using a Chemical Information System; and (3) Transition to a Chemical Management Services System. The analysis and benchmarking study shows that the present management of chemicals at SNL/NM is significantly disjointed and a life-cycle or 'Cradle-to-Grave' approach to chemical management is needed. This approach must consider the purchasing and maintenance costs {{as well as the}} cost of ultimate disposal of the chemicals and materials. A chemical exchange is needed as a mechanism to re-apply chemicals on site. This will not only reduce the quantity of unneeded chemicals and the amount spent on new purchases, but will also avoid disposal costs. If SNL/NM were to realize a 5 percent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> chemical inventory and a 10 percent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> of unused chemicals the total savings would be $ 189, 200 per year...|$|R

40|$|CG- 4 H 2 S adsorbent, an {{iron oxide}} based solid, has high sulfur {{capacity}} (20 - 25 % w/w) and thus finds favor in users’ eyes in North America. This product, imported from CLEAN Catalysis and Purification Technologies Development Company in Shanxi Province, China, {{is now being}} used in gas processing companies in Alberta, Canada and Texas, USA. However, due to the elemental sulfur deposition on the adsorbent, the recovered sulfur capacity by regeneration is only about 1 / 3 as that of fresh adsorbent. This limits the adsorbent use to be once, which results in higher operating cost due to the frequent changeover and cost for landfills. The problem of sulfur deposition is also the limitation to the utilization and regeneration of other desulfurization adsorbent or catalyst. This study developed a process to recover the sulfur capacity of CG- 4 adsorbent by ammonia leaching to remove elemental sulfur. The leaching was conducted in a stainless steel cylindrical reactor at room temperature and a pressure higher than the vapor pressure of liquid ammonia. The leaching process does not deleteriously change the physical strength, but improve the properties of surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution. The new regeneration process is able to recover over 90 % sulfur capacity in the first adsorption-regeneration cycle. The sulfur capacity recovery declined when CG- 4 had been leached {{for more than one}} time. Nonetheless, even after the third time leaching, the sulfur capacity was recovered by 60 %. The conditions of leaching process were optimized in a laboratory-scale experiment. Additionally, the elemental sulfur collected from leaching process has 91. 5 % w/w purity and can likely be used as an additive to asphalt or used as a soil amendment for agricultural applications. The separation of solid wash-offs and liquid ammonia was simply fulfilled by depressurizing the leaching vessel and vaporizing the ammonia. CG- 4 adsorbent is verified capable of at least three times reuses, which results <b>in</b> 60 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> amount per unit H 2 S being treated. This not only reduces the cost <b>in</b> <b>disposal</b> to landfills but also the cost in CG- 4 adsorbent and brings the revenue from the recovered elemental sulfur.

Six days of dexamethasone therapy was associated with a 30 % (95 % confidence interval, 19. 1 - 40. 0 %) fall in insulin sensitivity. Despite this, {{there was no difference in}} insulin-mediated vasodilation between phases. Dexamethasone had no effect on circulating markers of endothelial function, such as D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, and tissue plasminogen activator. By short-term exposure to high dose dexamethasone we were able to differentially affect the metabolic and vascular actions of insulin. This implies that, using this model, there is physiological uncoupling of the effects of insulin in different tissues...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic {{programming}} model {{was developed to}} determine the optimum replacement policy of dairy cows. In the model cows were {{described in terms of}} lactation number, stage of lactation and the level of milk production during the previous and present lactations. The objective in determining the optimum replacement policy was to maximize the present value of net revenues from the present and subsequent replacement cows over a 20 -year planning horizon. Milk and calf revenues, feed costs, carcass value, cost of replacement heifers and the probability of and financial loss associated with involuntary replacement were considered. The optimum replacement decisions corresponded with an average herd life of 42. 9 months. Voluntary replacement accounted for 26 % of all replacements. Changes in the price of a replacement heifer or the carcass price for culled cows had a considerable effect on the optimum replacement policy. A <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the difference between the carcass value of culled cows and the replacement costs resulted in a higher rate of voluntary replacement. Changes in the price of milk, calves or feed, the production level of the herd or the rate of genetic improvement did not greatly affect the optimum replacement policy.

40|$|ABSTRACT Insulin {{action was}} {{assessed}} by using the hyperinsulinemic (8 #{ 174 } pmol/L) euglycemic clamp in rats fed equal amounts of glucose or fructose (35 % of calories) for 4 wk. The glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia was decreased in fructose-fed animals (14. 6 ± 1. 4 vs 21. 8 ± 1. 1 for glucose-fed rats, p < 0. 001) with this whole-body effect contributed to equally by an impairment in hepatic insulin action and a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> peripheral glucose <b>disposal</b> <b>in</b> a range oftissues. There {{was no difference in}} basal glucose turnover, energy expenditure, or postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses to the diets. In the fructose-fed rats there was an increase in fasting triglyceride levels by 2 wk. Euglycemic clamp glucose disposal correlated positively and clamp hepatic glucose output correlated negatively with fast-ing triglyceride levels. In summary, fructose but not glucose feeding led to impaired insulin action in both the liver and peripheral tissues, effects that may depend on antecedent circulat-ing triglyceride levels.

40|$|Household waste {{recycling}} centres (HWRCs) evolved from civic amenity sites (CAS) {{introduced by the}} Civic Amenities Act 1967, and provide householders with an outlet for the disposal {{of a wide range}} of materials. Sites are now handling significant volumes of recyclables (66 % of total household recyclables), and the transport impacts associated with increasing visitor numbers to HWRCs are of interest to traffic managers and land use planners. The transport logistics associated with servicing sites, including the collection, treatment and disposal of different materials, is complex. The <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> landfill <b>disposal</b> coupled to more stringent requirements for material recycling and treatment has resulted in short journeys from HWRCs to landfill being replaced by complex road trips to different facilities at various locations. The operational, environmental and social impacts associated with these potential increases in commercial transport activities can be quantified through modelling current and projected fleet operations under various future scenarios. This can be achieved through routing and scheduling applications, which can be used to optimise transportation fleets and identify the optimal locations for waste treatment facilities. This paper provides an overview of the literature, identifying the transport arisings associated with the movement of waste to HWRCs by site users, and from HWRCs to treatment or disposal facilities by service operators. It also discusses the potential impacts on waste transportation from current and impending legislation, and the use of routing and scheduling applications to maximise commercial service vehicle operating efficiency...|$|R

The reference point is that of considering the use of road materials in a closed cycle, in which a natural material, previously used in road construction, should not be rejected in the following life-cycle. The objective {{of this paper is}} that of analysing flexible pavement recycling alternatives techniques, including reclaimed material from flexible pavements recycled with emulsion, cement and reused in a hot-mix. Based on the results obtained from field and laboratory tests (stiffness modulus, resistance to fatigue and permanent deformation), carried out using different materials, a set of numerical simulations were made for the design of pavement structures where those mixtures would be used, according to their characteristics and traffic specifications. The results of pavement design were obtained using the linear elastic theory in the BISAR program. With the results obtained from the pavement design, the cost savings of using recycled materials in the different pavement structures were quantified and compared to a standard option, where new natural aggregates and binders would be used. In this analysis, the consideration of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>disposal</b> of reclaimed pavement materials was also addressed.

Final enzyme partition between solid and liquid phases was investigated, the solid-bound enzymes being efficiently recovered by alkaline washing. RPS hydrolysis and fermentation was conducted over four rounds, recycling the cellulases present in both fractions. A great overall enzyme stability was observed: 71, 64 and 100 % of the initial Cel 7 A, Cel 7 B and -glucosidase activities, respectively, were recovered. Even with only 30 % of fresh enzymes added on the subsequent rounds, solid conversions of 92, 83 and 71 % were achieved for the round 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

Construction and demolition waste is currently {{one of the most}} significant problems facing the Irish construction industry. The volume of construction and demolition (C &D) waste generated in Ireland has continually increased since the publication of the first C & D waste estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 1995. The most recent C & D waste volume published by the EPA in 2001 estimated that 3. 6 million tonnes of C & D waste was generated in that year. There is a lack of Irish sourced C & D waste statistics for the estimation of C & D waste volumes on a national basis, and within construction companies. Construction waste volumes are estimated by the EPA using waste data from Irish waste management facilities, and C & D waste rates from the United States. The EPA has highlighted the need for extensive C & D waste audits to generate C & D waste statistics and waste rates specific to the Irish construction industry. This is the first long term C & D waste assessment that includes an extensive analysis of the C & D waste management techniques used on selected case study construction projects. This research has provided previously unavailable C & D waste rates and waste data for the building contractors involved. It has also been established that increased segregation of selected high volume C & D wastes such as timber, metals and insulation, can lead to <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> waste <b>disposal</b> costs...|$|R

We investigated the impact of acute CNTF treatment on insulin action in the presence of lipid oversupply. To avoid confounding effects of long-term high-fat feeding or genetic manipulation on whole-body insulin sensitivity, we performed a 2 -h Intralipid infusion (20 % heparinized Intralipid) with or without recombinant CNTF pretreatment (Axokine 0. 3 mg/kg), followed by a 2 -h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (12 mU/kg·min) in fasted, male Wistar rats. Acute Intralipid infusion increased plasma free fatty acid levels from 1. 0 ± 0. 1 to 2. 5 ± 0. 3 mM, which subsequently caused <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> skeletal muscle (insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate) and liver (hepatic glucose production) insulin sensitivity by 30 and 45 %, respectively. CNTF pretreatment completely prevented the lipid-mediated <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> insulin-stimulated glucose <b>disposal</b> rate and the blunted suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin. Although lipid infusion increased triacylglycerol and ceramide accumulation and phosphorylation of mixed linage kinase 3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 in skeletal muscle, CNTF pretreatment prevented these lipid-induced effects. Alterations in hepatic and muscle insulin signal transduction as well as phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 / 2 paralleled alterations in insulin sensitivity.

We designed, fabricated, evaluated, and optimized a laboratory-scale microchannel reactor system for controlled direct combination of H 2 and O 2 in all proportions including explosive regime, at a low pressure and a low temperature to produce about 1. 5 wt% H 2 O 2 as proposed. In {{the second phase of}} the program, as a prelude to full-scale commercialization, we demonstrated our H 2 O 2 production approach by ‘numbering up’ the channels in a multi-channel microreactor-based pilot plant to produce 1 kg/h of H 2 O 2 at 1. 5 wt% as demanded by end-users of the developed technology. To our knowledge, we are the first group to accomplish this significant milestone. We identified the reaction pathways that comprise the process, and implemented rigorous mechanistic kinetic studies to obtain the kinetics of the three main dominant reactions. We are not aware of any such comprehensive kinetic studies for the direct combination process, either in a microreactor or any other reactor system. We showed that the mass transfer parameter in our microreactor system is several orders of magnitude higher than what obtains in the macroreactor, attesting to the superior performance of microreactor. A one-dimensional reactor model incorporating the kinetics information enabled us to clarify certain important aspects of the chemistry of the direct combination process as detailed in section 5 of this report. Also, through mathematical modeling and simulation using sophisticated and robust commercial software packages, we were able to elucidate the hydrodynamics of the complex multiphase flows that take place in the microchannel. In conjunction with the kinetics information, we were able to validate the experimental data. If fully implemented across the whole industry as a result of our technology demonstration, our production concept is expected to save > 5 trillion Btu/year of steam usage and > 3 trillion Btu/year in electric power consumption. Our analysis also indicates > 50 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> waste <b>disposal</b> cost and ~ 10 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> feedstock energy. These savings translate to ~ 30 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> overall production and transportation costs for the $ 1 B annual H 2 O 2 market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two public notices for PPP (Public-Private Partnerships - Law 11. 079 / 2004) for {{solid waste}} management and verifies the suitability of these contracts to the new guidelines of Law 12. 305 / 2010 - National Solid Waste Policy - PNRS. The online versions of 2 public notices and draft PPP Contracts, recently signed {{in the city of}} São Carlos and the Metropolitan Area of Belo Horizonte and Colar Metropolitano were analyzed. The mapping of the performance indicators of these documents was carried out according to 4 criteria: (a) minimization of waste in landfills, (b) recovery and valorization of solid waste (recycling, composting, etc.); (c) pickers inclusion; and (d) social participation. The results indicate that the analyzed contracts meet only part of the guidelines set by PNRS, mainly the eradication of the dumps and the final <b>disposal</b> of waste <b>in</b> landfills. The main object of these contracts remains linked to the old paradigm of waste management: collection and transportation of waste and operation of landfills. To meet the waste minimization policies, there are financial incentives that reward the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the final <b>disposal</b> <b>in</b> landfills. However, there are no fixed contractual targets for the minimization of waste at landfills. If waste minimization policies, like reverse logistics and responsibility shared are implemented by the government, the contracts have clauses allowing periodic reviews for gradual adjustments, ensuring the economic and financial balance of the contract. It is yet to determine the efficiency of these mechanisms to meet the guidelines of PNRS, in the curse of the concession...|$|R
40|$|The {{formula for}} saltstone {{includes}} approximately 25 per cent wt slag {{to create a}} reducing environment for mitigating the subsurface transport {{of a number of}} radionuclides, including technetium- 99. Based on laboratory measurements and mass balance calculations, it was estimated that the Z-Area saltstone waste form will maintain a reducing environment for more than a thousand years and likely for more than 10, 000 years. The calculations were very sensitive to infiltration flow rate, underscoring the importance of the proposed moisture barrier for mitigating contaminant transport. Laboratory measurements indicated that the slag used in the formulation of the saltstone has an exceptionally high reduction capacity. Furthermore, measurements of a subsurface SRS sediment indicated that it also had a significant reduction capacity, albeit almost an order of magnitude less than that of the slag. Approximately 78 percent of the <b>reduction</b> capacity <b>in</b> the <b>disposal</b> system came from the saltstone, 1 4 percent from the geological materials in the overlying moisture barrier, and 9 percent from the vault made from reducing grout. This version differs from the original (WSRC-RP- 2003 - 00362, Rev. 0) in that additional text was added to further explain the assumptions of the calculations and some typographical errors were corrected...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol (ETOH) on muscle {{metabolism}} was assessed in both normal (NC) and noninsulin-dependent (NIDDM) {{subjects in the}} basal state and during isoglycemic hyperinsulinemia (450 pmol/L) clamp studies carried out either with systemic (NC, n = 5; NIDDM, n = 5) or intrabrachially (NC, n = 5; NIDDM, n = 5) ETOH infusion. On a repeat study, each subject underwent the same experimental procedures, except that saline was infused instead of ETOH. Systemic ETOH significantly decreased whole body glucose <b>disposal</b> <b>in</b> both NC and NIDDM patients. In NC, ETOH infusion decreased basal forearm glucose uptake (FGU) from 1. 22 +/- 0. 20 to 0. 32 +/- 0. 04 mumol/min. 100 mL tissue (P < 0. 01), whereas in NIDDM, this decrement was not significant (from 0. 95 +/- 0. 31 to 0. 66 +/- 0. 23). With saline infusion, hyperinsulinemia significantly stimulated FGU to 4. 09 +/- 0. 46 mumol/min. 100 mL tissue in NC and to 2. 50 +/- 0. 76 in NIDDM. During ETOH, FGU was depressed by 81 % in NC (delta = 3. 32 mumol/min. 100 mL tissue) and by 48 % (P < 0. 05) in NIDDM (delta = 1. 21 mumol/min. 100 mL tissue). Local ETOH infusion did not affect FGU in either NC (1. 18 +/- 0. 23 vs. 1. 1 +/= 0. 11 mumol/min. 100 mL tissue in the baseline condition and 4. 12 +/- 0. 65 vs. 3. 97 +/- 0. 35 in insulin-stimulated conditions) or NIDDM (1. 05 +/- 0. 29 vs. 1. 1 +/- 0. 19 mumol/min. 100 mL tissue in baseline condition and 2. 72 +/- 0. 82 vs. 2. 83 +/- 0. 51 in insulin-stimulated conditions) subjects. With systemic ETOH, but not local infusion, there was a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> baseline plasma free fatty acid level {{and an increase in}} blood lactate concentration during isoglycemic hyperinsulinemia. In summary, systemic ETOH infusion impairs both whole body and forearm glucose uptake in NC and NIDDM subjects; this effect was more apparent in NC than in NIDDM at both the whole body and forearm level. On the contrary, intrabrachial ETOH infusion did not affect forearm glucose balance in either group. These results suggest that the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> muscle glucose <b>disposal</b> associated with increased systemic ETOH concentrations is not caused by a direct ETOH effect on muscle glucose metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{conductivity}} of fine-grained soils {{has assumed}} greater importance <b>in</b> waste <b>disposal</b> facilities. It {{is necessary to}} understand better the factors controlling hydraulic conductivity of fine-grained soils which are used as liners <b>in</b> waste <b>disposal</b> facilities. Hydraulic Conductivity study with ten soils with two fluids having extreme dielectric constants(epsilon) namely water and CCl 4 has shown that intrinsic permeability (K) increases drastically with decrease in epsilon. These changes are attributed to the significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the thickness of diffuse double layer which in turn mainly dependent on the epsilon of the permeant. Hydraulic Conductivity with water of each pair of soils having nearly same liquid limit but different plasticity properties {{is found to be}} vastly different, but found to correlate well with shrinkage index, defined as difference between the liquid and the shrinkage limits. Also the ratio Kccl(4) /K-w is found to significantly increase with the increase in the shrinkage index...|$|R
