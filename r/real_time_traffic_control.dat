40|$|Abstract- Traffic load {{computation}} {{for real}} time traffic signal control system {{has become a}} challenging problem {{as well as the}} need of hour to make road traffic decent, safe, less time and fuel consuming. CCTV Cameras can prove to be a robust and sufficient solution in this direction. Images of the traffic captured with the help of CCTV Camera, can be processed to retrieve the required output about current traffic. This presents a model to count the traffic load by some parameters such as edge detection, histogram equalization, labeling and removing the noise with the help of median filter. The load computed can then be used to control the traffic signals. The main purpose of the developed algorithm is to compute total traffic load at a particular junction, which is then further used for <b>real</b> <b>time</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> by generating green light timing of the traffic signal.

Using channel geometry, bathymetry, counter traffic, and surface currents as input, the model simulates possible maneuvers according to probable hydrodynamic conditions. The decision making algorithm starts after computing the probable trajectory tree of the vessel by forward-mapping its position distribution with respect to an initial position vector. The proposed software tool uses an experimentally verified container ship model and a proportional-derivative (PD) auto-pilot to represent the captain’s response. Two different algorithms are used for cases with and without clear and present collision risk. For both cases, the route with minimum casualty risk is found. In case of multiple “quasi-risky ” routes, some safety based tie-breaker criteria are taken into account. Within certain restrictions on vessel geometry, the proposed tool predicts the safest route for transit vessels in the Strait based on the navigational parameters including position, speed, and course of the vessel.

The focus of this presentation is on the prototype as a novel architecture for knowledge based traffic control. The prototype is called the Intelligent Urban Traffic Control System (IUTCS), and was developed under DRIVE 1. The IUTCS is now receiving further development and a subsequent testing as part of a DRIVE 2 project. The tests will be performed in four European cities; Trondheim, Cologne, Madrid and Genova. 1. INTRODUCTION In a developed prototype for urban traffic control, the IUTCS, we have researched the possibilities for supporting <b>real</b> <b>time</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> more efficiently by applying techniques {{from the field of}} Artificial Intelligence.

The high performance microscopic simulators capable of achieving such objectives should meet a set of basic requirements regarding the accuracy and performance of the traffic modeling, the {{ability to deal with}} the dynamic effects of <b>time</b> dependent <b>traffic</b> demands and, consequently, the time dependent route choices from each origin to each destination.

30|$|Traffic Signal Priority Systems (TSPS) {{are giving}} less {{attention}} in the literature compared to TSCS. Such systems can be classified into six cathegories [40] which are; pre-emption versus priority (pre-emption {{can be considered as}} the highest level of priority), one approach versus conflicting approaches, active transit signal priority versus passive transit signal priority, signal mode versus multiple mode, signal intersection versus coordinated intesection, and one request at a time versus multiple request. The majority of TSPS in the literature relies on electronics techology allowing the detection of EVs, the communication between those vehicles and traffic signals. Such technology includes Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [4], RFID [31], national transportation communications for Intelligent Transport System protocol (NTCIP) [5], centralized server that supportes real traffic information and calculates the shortest path for EVs to pass by [13]. Shibuya, et al. [32] have presented an attempt for traffic management that supports EVs, called FAST emergency preemption system.
