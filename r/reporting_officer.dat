40|$|Interpretation {{rules for}} {{standard}} 28 cycle PCR {{have been described}} previously {{for the analysis of}} mixed STR profiles. In this study the same guidelines are applied to 200 mixtures derived from pairs of known donors combined in ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 5 : 1 which have been profiled in duplicate with SGM Plus(®) at total inputs ranging from 1 ng to 50 pg. The paired profiles were distributed among 35 FSS (Forensic Science Service) <b>reporting</b> <b>officers</b> trained in low copy number (LCN) interpretation who analysed them blind following standard casework procedures. Based upon the results from initial duplicate 34 cycle PCR reactions, the <b>reporting</b> <b>officers</b> made appropriate decisions regarding the benefits of processing the reserved third aliquot. Using the combined results, 49 consensus profiles were successfully resolved into major and minor contributor peaks. This demonstrates the reliability of the interpretation rules used in standard 28 cycle SGM Plus analysis when applied to 34 cycle generated profiles by trained and experienced <b>reporting</b> <b>officers.</b> No minor contributor peaks were assigned to a major profile in the final reported results.

500|$|The CIA's 1995 damage {{assessment}} report singled out former SE Division reports chief Robert Lubbehusen for sending reports without disclosing {{that they were}} from double agents, despite Agency rules requiring warnings on such reports. He and other mid-level officers allegedly saw the controlled-agent reporting as genuine and feared that revealing the reports' sources would distract officials from the supposedly valuable intelligence. He may have also been swayed by pressure from the Defense Department for more intelligence. According to reporter James Risen, <b>reports</b> <b>officers</b> were sometimes more knowledgeable about CIA sources than case officers, and were [...] "often {{the first to see}} the raw intelligence and thus had the opportunity to describe the sources in the reports." [...] Following approval by the SE Division's chief, CIA intelligence analysts would then view the reports, but had to rely on the <b>reports</b> <b>officers</b> to describe the sources. However, one anonymous source backed Lubbehusen, saying that some of the intelligence may have been genuine material sent by the Soviets to bolster their moles' bona fides. Even after Lubbehusen was removed, his successors continued to leave out disclosures on reports, although Lubbehusen's reprimand was reputedly the strongest of the seven Deutch issued.|$|R
