50|$|Since the Sperry-New Holland TR70 Twin-Rotor Combine {{came out}} in 1975, most {{manufacturers}} have combines with rotors in place of conventional cylinders. However, makers have now returned to the market with conventional models alongside their rotary line-up. A rotor is a long, longitudinally mounted rotating cylinder with plates similar to <b>rub</b> <b>bars</b> (except for in the above-mentioned Gleaner rotaries).|$|R
50|$|Solid {{shampoos}} or shampoo bars use {{as their}} surfactants soaps or other surfactants formulated as solids. They {{have the advantage}} of being spill-proof. They are easy to apply; one may simply <b>rub</b> the <b>bar</b> over wet hair, and work the soaped hair into a low lather.|$|R
5000|$|Egging is {{sometimes}} associated with certain events and holidays. For example, {{in parts of}} England and the United States, October 30 {{is referred to as}} [...] "Mischief Night", when mischievous teens <b>rub</b> soap <b>bars</b> on car windows, throw eggs at houses, adorn trees with toilet paper, and run away after ringing doorbells. In some areas of Queens, New York, [...] "Cabbage Night" [...] involved throwing rotten fruit at various neighbors, cars, and buses.|$|R
5000|$|First, the header, {{described}} above, {{cuts the}} crop and feeds {{it into the}} threshing cylinder. This consists {{of a series of}} horizontal rasp bars fixed across the path of the crop and {{in the shape of a}} quarter cylinder. Moving rasp <b>bars</b> or <b>rub</b> <b>bars</b> pull the crop through concaved grates that separate the grain and chaff from the straw. The grain heads fall through the fixed concaves. What happens next is dependent on the type of combine in question. In most modern combines, the grain is transported to the shoe by a set of 2, 3, or 4 (possibly more on the largest machines) augers, set parallel or semi-parallel to the rotor on axial mounted rotors and perpendicular Flow" [...] combines.) In older Gleaner machines, these augers were not present. These combines are unique in that the cylinder and concave is set inside feederhouse instead of in the machine directly behind the feederhouse. Consequently, the material was moved by a [...] "raddle chain" [...] from underneath the concave to the walkers. The clean grain fell between the raddle and the walkers onto the shoe, while the straw, being longer and lighter, floated across onto the walkers to be expelled. On most other older machines, the cylinder was placed higher and farther back in the machine, and the grain moved to the shoe by falling down a [...] "clean grain pan", and the straw [...] "floated" [...] across the concaves to the back of the walkers.|$|R

I've nothing to work with now, but a few <b>rubs</b> with your <b>bar</b> will finish the job. Ah, dear! You are right, and we are fairly treed!" ...|$|R
40|$|Degummed {{silk fabric}} was dyed with the flower extract of Spathodea campanulata along with varying {{concentrations}} of different mordants. Colour values {{with respect to}} K/S and CIE L* a* b* were influenced by the mordants and the mordanting techniques. Pre-mordanting {{was found to be}} better in the case of stannous chloride whereas meta-mordanting was found better in case of potassium aluminium sulphate and tannic acid with respect to colour values. The unmordanted dyed samples exhibited good fastness to washing, <b>rubbing</b> and perspiration, <b>barring</b> light. A very slight improvement in fastness to light was recorded with the use of tannic acid as mordant...|$|R
40|$|The {{azimuthal}} anchoring {{energy of}} the nematic liquid crystal 4 -pentyl-T-cyanobiphenil (5 CB) oil a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (teflon, PTFE) film is measured for the first time. The PTFE film is deposed using the Wittmann and Smith technique which consists on <b>rubbing</b> a <b>bar</b> of this polymer against a glass substrate at a controlled temperature and pressure. Measurements of the azimuthal anchoring energy are made with a reflectometric technique which provides high accuracy and sensitivity. The dependence of the azimuthal anchoring energy on temperature and on the rubbing pressure is investigated. The extrapolation length remains virtually constant in the whole temperature range of the nematic phase except for an increase of 2. 5 % close to the clearing temperature. The azimuthal anchoring energy is somewhat strong and increases with increasing the deposition pressure of PTFE. The observation of a relevant pre-transitional anisotropy of the reflection coefficients in the isotropic phase proves that the surface interactions favor an excess of orientational order. Ageing of the anchoring energy and gliding of the easy axis are experimentally observed. Both these phenomena suggest {{the presence of an}} anisotropic adsorbed layer of nematic molecules on the PTFE film...|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{friction}} blisters on the hands, gloves {{should be}} worn when using {{tools such as}} a shovel or pickaxe, doing manual work such as gardening, or using sports equipment like golf clubs or baseball bats. Oars used for competitive rowing are known for causing frequent blisters on the hands of oarsmen. Weightlifters are also prone to blisters as are gymnasts from the friction developed by the <b>rubbing</b> against the <b>bars.</b> To further reduce the occurrence one can tape the hands, {{and there are also}} a number of products on the market that claim to reduce the occurrence of blisters. These are all intended to be worn as a liner underneath a glove. The majority of these offerings simply add padding and create a layer that reduces the coefficient of friction between the skin and the glove.|$|R
5000|$|The rhinos, under {{constant}} watch by specialists and staff, lived in specially constructed bomas {{with access to}} a 400Ã—400-metre paddock area, allowing them to acclimatize to their new surroundings. To prevent any unnecessary injuries they might inflict on each other while interacting in their fenced area, and give their horns an opportunity to regrow to a natural shape (as their front horns had grown bent by much <b>rubbing</b> against enclosure <b>bars</b> in captivity), all the rhinos were sedated and their horns were sawn off. This also made them less vulnerable to the poaching that drove their species to near extinction, as the horn is what the poachers are after. In place of their horns, radio transmitters have been installed to allow closer monitoring of their whereabouts. They are protected round-the-clock by armed guards. Poachers have been selling their horns for $50,000 per kilo.|$|R
5000|$|Following Alec and Topaz's eviction, the HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Chicken Flew the Coop" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests had to reach through a wired fence and carry eggs to their correct slots. Jillian was the winner. Fearing that Andrew and Talla would turn against him, Emmett {{attempted}} to convince Jillian to nominate {{the two of them}} together. On Day 51, the HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Rub a Dub Dub" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests split into pairs; one member of the pair had to <b>rub</b> a <b>bar</b> of soap on their partner to get to a key in the middle. The first team to get their key and unlock a box would be the Haves for the week; Emmett and Peter were the winners, meaning Andrew and Talla were the Have-Nots for the week. On Day 52, Jillian chose to nominate Andrew and Peter for eviction, with Peter being her main target. On Day 53, the HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Sleep Tight with the PoV" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests participated in an obstacle course themed after preparing for bed. Andrew was the winner of the Power of Veto, as well as a $10,000 shopping spree from The Brick. On Day 53, the HouseGuests were given the task of freezing on command, and succeeding in the task would earn the HouseGuest a reward from home; the group was successful, and earned a video chat with their families. On Day 54, Andrew chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Talla being nominated in his place. On Day 57, Peter became the eleventh HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of two to zero. He became the fifth member of the Jury of Seven. Following this, the HouseGuests learned that the viewers had been voting for one of the four Jury members to return to the house; Gary received the most votes, and returned to the house as an official HouseGuest that night.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in properties of unidirectional materials grown on highly oriented polymer surfaces such as the poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) films coated onto smooth glass surfaces. In this technique, a thin PTFE film is deposited by sliding or <b>rubbing</b> a Teflon <b>bar</b> over a heated glass surface at a specific temperature. Depending on the pressure, temperature and sliding rate the thickness of deposited layers can be varied from 30 A to 150 A. The PTFE-coated substrate is simple yet surprising versatile for oriented growth of many organic, inorganic and polymer. The significant aspect of PTFE films is their unusual ability to molecularly align a wide variety of materials grown onto them from solution, melt or vapor phase deposition, at temperature below the melting point of PTFE (approx. 340 C). The PTFE structure may be derived, in part, from the multitude of ridges forming in the film and these ridges can presumably provide effective nucleation sites to induce the unidirectional growth of variety of materials. Electron diffraction studies of these films revealed that the PTFE macromolecules are oriented parallel to each other along the sliding direction. Direct observation of the film thickness, molecular structure and individual fluorine atoms from these highly oriented films were achieved using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this paper, we also report the first direct observation of individual fluorine atoms, and the measurement of the fluorine-helix and carbon-helix radii to be 1. 70 A and 0. 54 A, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Salad Fingers wears a beret and {{declares}} {{that he is}} going to try to find France. However, he is oddly frightened by a mutated boy with disproportionately large eyeballs that has been [...] "watching him for a while". Salad Fingers becomes uncomfortable with the child's proximity and begins to leave. The boy, who speaks only in growls and grunts, approaches Salad Fingers, having apparently fallen in love with him. Salad Fingers holds out his hand to stop the boy coming closer, but the boy licks his hand, much to Salad Fingers' disgust and fear.Inside his house, Salad Fingers sees a grey woodlouse coming out from a hole in the wall. He addresses the bug as [...] "Bordois" [...] and his [...] "little sister". After asking what [...] "she" [...] has been collecting, he acts as though the bug gives him a response. Salad Fingers announces his enjoyment in the bug's body and goes to touch it, accidentally crushing it and looking at it in curiosity which turns to disgust. He then says to Bordois that she's [...] "gone flat" [...] and become [...] "all gooey", and that he [...] "shalln't play with her again, until she's had a wash." [...] Salad Fingers then hears a knock on the door, which he opens to find a [...] "grubby tap" [...] attached to a string on the ground. Salad Fingers becomes excited about this [...] "gift" [...] and begins to fantasize about taps. He attempts to fetch it, but it is drawn away on the string as bait. He is caught in a bear trap which causes him to lose blood and consciousness while savouring the desanguination blissfully. He wakes up in a cage, and enjoys <b>rubbing</b> the rusted <b>bars.</b> The grotesque boy approaches the cage and holds out a ring (on which is mounted a human tooth) as if proposing marriage. Salad Fingers becomes distraught, states [...] "I don't like this game" [...] and announces that he is [...] "going home now". This angers the boy, who makes an unintelligible noise that sounds like [...] "You're my wife now." [...] A rope appears, hanging down from the ceiling, which Salad Fingers pulls to draw down a curtain. When the curtain lifts, the boy, seeing that Salad Fingers has disappeared, begins to cry. The episode closes with Salad Fingers, wearing his beret, flying away gleefully on a giant tap, presumably to France.|$|R
