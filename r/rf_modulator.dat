5|$|Video {{output is}} through an <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> and was {{designed}} for use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in <b>RF</b> <b>modulator.</b> It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E

25|$|All {{versions}} {{incorporate a}} top-loading slot for game cartridges, although {{the shape of}} the slot differs between regions to match the different shapes of the cartridges. The MULTI OUT connector (later used on the Nintendo 64 and GameCube) can output composite video, S-Video and RGB signals, as well as RF with an external <b>RF</b> <b>modulator.</b> Original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover {{on the bottom of the}} unit and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back; the redesigned models output composite video only, requiring an external modulator for RF.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} IBM CGA {{graphics card}} {{was equipped with}} 16kilobytes of video memory and could be connected either to a dedicated direct-drive CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) RGBI interface, such as the IBM 5153 color display, or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector. The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> unless the TV had an RCA jack though with the former combined with an amplifier sometimes was more practical since one could then hook up an antenna to the amplifier and get wireless video.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "2channel" [...] is {{allegedly}} {{a reference}} to how <b>RF</b> <b>modulators,</b> commonly used for connecting earlier-generation game consoles (such as Family Computer by Nintendo) to television sets, default to VHF channel 2 in Japan.|$|R
50|$|<b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> {{are used}} to convert signals from devices such as media players, VCRs and game {{consoles}} to a format that can be handled by a device designed to receive a modulated RF input, such as a radio or television receiver.|$|R
50|$|<b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> {{may also}} be used to take the audio and video signal from a PAL or NTSC {{composite}} video, RGB, YUV or other composite AV source, and generate a broadcast RF signal that can be fed into a television's aerial/coaxial connector.|$|R
25|$|Commodore {{sold the}} C64 {{not only through}} its network of {{authorized}} dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a composite video signal (avoiding the <b>RF</b> <b>modulator)</b> that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered {{to have been a}} major catalyst in the North American video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors.|$|E
500|$|The console {{can supply}} video through several {{different}} accessories. [...] The console came with A/V cables, considered {{at the time}} to be the standard for video and audio connectivity. [...] Sega and various third parties also manufactured <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> connectors and S-Video cables. A VGA adapter allows Dreamcast games to be played on computer displays or Enhanced-definition television sets in 480p.|$|E
500|$|Seated {{on top of}} a Genesis, the 32X {{measures}} [...] [...] The 32X {{contains two}} Hitachi SH2 32-bit RISC processors with a clock speed of 23 MHz, which Sega claimed would allow the system to work 40 times faster than a stand-alone Genesis. [...] Its graphics processing unit is capable of producing 32,768 colors and rendering 50,000 polygons per second, which provides a noticeable improvement over the polygon rendering of the Genesis. [...] The 32X also includes 256 kilobytes of random-access memory (RAM), along with 256 kilobytes of video RAM. [...] Sound is supplied through a pulse-width modulation sound source. [...] Input/output is supplied to a television set via a provided A/V cable that supplies composite video and stereo audio, or through an <b>RF</b> <b>modulator.</b> Stereo audio can also be played through headphones via a headphone jack on the attached Genesis.|$|E
5000|$|The UK's namesake [...] "Channel 37", while {{different}} in frequency, was formerly {{part of a}} small group of channels reserved for non-broadcast purposes such as <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> in video players. The UK-named 34-37 channel range is no longer reserved in this manner.|$|R
50|$|In North America, <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> {{generally}} output {{on channel}} 3 or 4 (VHF), {{which may be}} selectable, although the Atari consoles offer channels 2 and 3. In Europe standard modulators usually used channel 36 (UHF) by default, but are usually tunable over part {{or all of the}} UHF band.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the composite video output jack, the IIc, IIc Plus, and the IIGS featured a two-row, 15-pin output. In the IIc and IIc Plus, this connector was a special-purpose video connector for adapters to digital RGB monitors and <b>RF</b> <b>modulators.</b> In the IIGS it was an output for an analog RGB monitor specially designed for the IIGS.|$|R
2500|$|Video output {{connections}} {{varied from}} one {{model of the}} console to the next. The original HVC-001 model of the Family Computer featured only radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>modulator</b> output. When the console was released in North America and Europe, support for composite video through RCA connectors was added {{in addition to the}} <b>RF</b> <b>modulator.</b> The HVC-101 model of the Famicom dropped the <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> entirely and adopted composite video output via a proprietary 12-pin [...] "multi-out" [...] connector first introduced for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Conversely, the North American re-released NES-101 model most closely resembled the original HVC-001 model Famicom, in that it featured <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> output only. Finally, the PlayChoice-10 utilized an inverted RGB video output.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Japanese Famicom {{hardware features}} an <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> audio/video output connector, but more Japanese television sets had dropped RF connectors {{in favor of}} higher-quality RCA composite video output by the early 1990s. A revised Famicom (HVC-101 model), often referred to unofficially as the AV Famicom, was released in Japan in 1993, largely to address this problem. It borrowed some design cues from the Super NES. The HVC-101 model replaced the original HVC-001 model's <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> with RCA composite cables, eliminated the hardwired controllers, and features a new, more compact case design. Retailing for ¥4,800 to ¥7,200 (equivalent to approximately $42 to $60 USD), the HVC-101 model remained in production {{for almost a decade}} before being finally discontinued in 2003. The case design of the AV Famicom was adopted for a subsequent North American rerelease of the NES. The NES-101 model (sometimes referred to unofficially as the [...] "NES 2", and nicknamed the [...] "top-loading model" [...] or the [...] "Top Loader") differs from the Japanese HVC-101 model in that it omitted the RCA composite output connectors that had been included in the original NES-001 model, and sports only RF output capabilities.|$|E

50|$|The aerial {{connector}} {{is standard}} on all TV sets, even very old ones. Since later television designs include composite, S-Video, and component video jacks, which skip the modulation and demodulation steps, modulators {{are no longer}} included as standard equipment, and <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> are now largely a third-party product, purchased primarily to run newer equipment such as DVD players with an old television set.|$|R
5|$|Mach-Zehnder interferometers {{are being}} used in {{integrated}} optical circuits, in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are externally modulated to vary their relative phase. A slight tilt {{of one of the}} beam splitters will result in a path difference and a change in the interference pattern. Mach-Zehnder interferometers are the basis {{of a wide variety of}} devices, from <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> to sensors to optical switches.|$|R
50|$|Audio <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> {{are used}} in low-end car audio to add devices like CD changers without {{requiring}} dashboard hardware upgrades. For example, a portable CD player's headphone jack {{is connected to the}} modulator, which outputs a low-power FM radio signal that is played through the car radio. Car FM modulators suffer from loss of quality and interference issues. Later devices which would use these types of modulators would be iPods and similar portable media players.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, the HVC-001 model {{featured}} audio/video output via <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> only. By {{the early}} 1990s, many Japanese television sets featured composite input jacks. The HVC-101 replaced the HVC-001's RF output connector {{with the same}} AV connector used in the Super Famicom, thus the name AV Famicom. This represented the biggest difference between the Japanese HVC-101 and the North America NES-101, which included only <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> output functionality (even though the original NES-001 had composite as well as <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> outputs). However, Nintendo sold an external <b>RF</b> <b>modulator</b> (HVC-103) for those who wished to connect their HVC-101 to a TV which lacked a composite video input. In an unusual move, Nintendo did not package an AV cable or AC adapter with the HVC-101, which either had to be purchased separately or shared with a Super Famicom.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{techniques}} {{for the full}} integration of radio frequency (RF) transmitter with CMOS technology. The theory and implementation of high performance digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for radio frequency (RF) transmitters have been studied. A linear interpolation DAC architecture is proposed. By employing the linear interpolation, the attenuation of DAC's image components is significantly increased. The proposed linear interpolation DAC {{has been applied to}} direct digital quadrature modulators. The reconstruction filter, usually employed after the DAC in modulators to remove the image components, is eliminated due to this linear interpolation DAC's high attenuation to the image components. Therefore, the costly discrete components are reduced, and the system-onchip (SOC) design can be realized conveniently. A CMOS current injection direct digital <b>RF</b> quadrature <b>modulator</b> and A CMOS current-folded direct digital <b>RF</b> quadrature <b>modulator</b> have been implemented. In the architecture of current injection direct digital <b>RF</b> quadrature <b>modulator,</b> the DAC's differential current signals are directly fed to the mixer, which improves the linearity of the modulated RF signal. In the architecture of current-folded direct digital <b>RF</b> quadrature <b>modulator,</b> the DAC's differential current signals are fed to the mixer by current-folded structures, which realize the low voltage design and improves the linearity of the modulated RF signal also. The proposed modulators generate quadrature modulated RF signals directly and are able to operate with different types, constant and non-constant envelope, of modulations...|$|R
40|$|Multi-wavelength lasers (MWLs) play an {{important}} role in wavelength division multiplexing networks, and also in photonic radar beam steering applications. In this paper we study different options for realizing such lasers, monolithically integrated with radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>modulators</b> that can be modulated up to 40 GHz. Configurations of arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) -based MWLs integrated with Mach-Zehnder modulators are discussed. Depending on the application, they can have spatially separated modulated outputs or the modulated signals can be multiplexed onto a common output. A novel configuration, that exploits the reflection and transmission properties of on-chip reflectors is presented. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{modulating}} RF {{with the original}} video signal, and then demodulating the original signal again in the TV, introduces several losses. This conversion also typically adds noise or interference to the signal as well. For these reasons, it is typically best to use composite connections instead of RF connections if possible. Almost all modern video equipment has at least composite connectors, so this typically is not a problem; however, older video equipment and some very low-end modern televisions have only RF input (essentially the antenna jack); while <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> are no longer common, they are still available to translate baseband signals for older equipment.|$|R

50|$|The {{launch of}} Channel 5 in 1997 added a fifth {{national}} television network to UHF, requiring {{deviation from the}} original frequency allocation plan of the early 1960s and the allocation of UHF frequencies previously not used for television (such as UK Channels 35 and 37, previously reserved for <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> in devices such as domestic videocassette recorders, requiring an expensive VCR re-tuning programme funded by the new network). A lack of capacity within the band to accommodate a fifth service with the complex over-lapping led to the fifth and final network having a significantly reduced national coverage {{compared to the other}} networks, with reduced picture quality in many areas and the use of wide-band aerials often required.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to introduce combined audio/video connectors for direct signals, {{but in the}} analog realm none of these has ever become common, {{with the exception of}} Europe where the SCART connector is very successful. [...] For a time the 5-pin DIN connector was popular for bi-directional stereo connection between A/V equipment, but it has been entirely displaced on modern consumer devices. Though <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> inherently transmit combined A/V signals in video applications, they depend on broadcast television systems and RF connectors which are not universal worldwide; RF signals are also generally inferior to direct signals due to protocol conversion and the RF limitations of the three major analog TV systems (NTSC, PAL and SECAM).|$|R
50|$|Multi-channel <b>RF</b> <b>modulators</b> are {{commonly}} used in home audio/video distribution. These devices have multiple audio and video inputs and one RF output. Audio/video outputs from source devices such as a DVD player, VCR, or DSS receiver {{are connected to the}} audio/video inputs on the modulator. The modulator is then programmed to broadcast the signals on a certain frequency. That RF broadcast is then received by the connected TV. When the TV is tuned to the programmed channel, the video and audio signal of the source device is accessed. RF modulation can become difficult in a CATV system. High pass, low pass, and notch filters must be used to block certain frequencies, or channels, so that the modulator can broadcast the audio/video signal of the source device on that channel.|$|R
