If no horizontal thrusting forces are generated this becomes an arch-shaped truss, essentially a bent beam - see moon bridge for an example. If horizontal thrust is generated but the apex of the arch is a pin joint, this is termed a three-hinged arch - see The Iron Bridge for an example. If no hinge exists at the apex, it will normally be a two-hinged arch.In the Iron Bridge shown below, the structure of each frame emulates the kind of structure that previously had been made of wood. Such a wood structure uses closely fitted beams pinned together, so the members within the frames are not free to move relative to one another, as they are in a pin-jointed truss structure that allows rotation at the pin joint. Such rigid structures (which impose bending stresses upon the elements) were further developed in the 20th century as the Vierendeel truss.|$|E

We report the design of a multipoint sensor, a cheap alternative to the most common fiber sensors. The sensor is implemented using Arduino board, standard LEDs for optical communication in POF (λ = 645 nm) and a silicon light sensor. The Super ESKA® plastic fibers were used to implement the fiber intensity sensor, arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. During the breathing cycles, the force transmitted from the lungs to the thorax is in the order of tens of Newtons, and the respiration rate is of one breath every 2 – 5 s (0. 2 – 0. 5 Hz). The sensor has a <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> applied on a single point of 2. 2 – 4. 5 %/N on the normalized voltage output, and a bandwidth of 10 Hz, it is then suitable to monitor the respiration movements.

The qPlus sensor, a quartz cantilever that utilizes the piezoelectric effect for deflection detection, is particularly well suited for higher harmonic AFM because the physics of piezoelectric detection inherently magnifies the signal level of higher harmonics.

40|$|International audienceThe impact <b>of</b> the {{atmospheric}} <b>forcing</b> on the winter ocean convection in the Mediterranean Sea was studied with a high-resolution ocean general circulation model. The major {{areas of focus}} are the Levantine basin, the Aegean-Cretan Sea, the Adriatic Sea, and the Gulf of Lion. Two companion simulations differing by the horizontal <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> {{the atmospheric}} <b>forcing</b> were compared. The first simulation (MED 16 -ERA 40) was forced by air-sea fields from ERA 40, which is the ECMWF reanalysis. The second simulation (MED 16 -ECMWF) was forced by the ECMWF-analyzed surface fields that have a horizontal resolution {{twice as high as}} those of ERA 40. The analysis of the standard deviations of the atmospheric fields shows that increasing the <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the atmospheric <b>forcing</b> leads in all regions to a better channeling of the winds by mountains and to the generation of atmospheric mesoscale patterns. Comparing the companion ocean simulation results with available observations in the Adriatic Sea and in the Gulf of Lion shows that MED 16 -ECMWF is more realistic than MED 16 -ERA 40. In the eastern Mediterranean, although deep water formation occurs in the two experiments, the depth reached by the convection is deeper in MED 16 -ECMWF. In the Gulf of Lion, deep water formation occurs only in MED 16 -ECMWF. This larger sensitivity of the western Mediterranean convection to the forcing resolution is investigated by running a set of sensitivity experiments to analyze the impact <b>of</b> different time-space <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>forcing</b> on the intense winter convection event in winter 1998 - 1999. The sensitivity to the forcing appears to be mainly related to the effect of wind channeling by the land orography, which can only be reproduced in atmospheric models <b>of</b> sufficient <b>resolution.</b> Thus, well-positioned patterns of enhanced wind stress and ocean surface heat loss are able to maintain a vigorous gyre circulation favoring efficient preconditioning of the area at the beginning of winter and to drive realistic buoyancy loss and mixing responsible for strong convection at the end of winter...|$|R

40|$|Data sets of climatic {{variables}} and other geographic characteristics are becoming available in increasingly higher resolutions, resulting in substantial computing burdens for simulation {{models of the}} terrestrial biosphere. But by how much do higher <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> data actually contribute to higher accuracy in model predictions? I investigated this question using the Cramer-Leemans climatology as an example for a high resolution forcing data set and a model of net primary productivity (NPP). I first used cluster analysis to reduce the complete grid of the climatology to a few grid points, each representative of regions with similar values. A global map of NPP was reconstructed by using the simulated values of the representative grid points for the respective regions. I then compared the reconstructed map of NPP to the one obtained from all grid points. The results show that a high accuracy in simulating the high resolution pattern and magnitude {{can be achieved by}} only considering a comparatively small subset of representative grid points. What this suggests is that, while high resolution data sets provide the necessary means to determine the typical regions, they do not add much accuracy to the overall outcome of model simulations because they contain many grid points with similar values. By reducing this redundancy, the methodology used here allows model simulations to be considerably more computing-time efficient while still retaining the accuracy in predicted quantities...|$|R
40|$|The spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> atomic <b>force</b> {{microscopy}} (AFM) can be drastically {{increased by}} terminating the tip {{with a single}} CO molecule. However, the CO molecule is not stiff, and lateral forces, such as those around the sides of molecules, distort images. This issue begs a larger question of how AFM can probe structures that are laterally weak. Lateral force microscopy (LFM) can probe lateral stiffnesses that are not accessible to normal-force AFM, resulting in higher spatial resolution. With LFM, we determined the torsional spring constant of a CO-terminated tip molecule to be 0. 24 N/m. This value is {{less than that of}} a surface molecule, and an example of a system whose stiffness is a product not only of bonding partners but also local environment...|$|R

These vibrations are known to result in physical disorders such as Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, which can be debilitating {{to the point where}} workers can no longer do their job effectively. Research groups have taken an interest in finding what vibration characteristics are most harmful and choose to record vibration information using data-logging devices. Often, many devices, whether they are commercial or custom-built devices, use frequency weightings and full day estimations to measure vibration exposure, in which data can be lost due to pre-software filtering and short measurement durations. Using surface mount components on a custom-designed printed circuit board, a portable device that captured full vibration waveforms over multiple force and acceleration channels was created.
