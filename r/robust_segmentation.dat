40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a local likelihood-based active contour model for {{subcortical}} structure segmentation. As a generalization of the Chan-Vese piecewise-constant model, our solution uses Bayesian a posterior probabilities as the driving forces for curve evolution. Distribution prior for {{the structure of}} interest, e. g., caudate nucleus, can be seamlessly integrated into the level set evolution procedure, and no thresholding step is needed for capturing the target. Unlike other region-based active contour models, our solution relaxes the global piecewise-constant assumption, and uses locally varying Gaussians to better account for intensity inhomogeneity and local variations existing in many MR images. More accurate and <b>robust</b> <b>segmentations</b> are therefore achieved. ...|$|R

The estimates obtained at time t are integrated in the deformation model as a priori knowledge for the segmentation at time t + 1. Deformation modes are updated on line using a Principal Component Analysis of the distorsions computed from the shapes estimated previously in the image sequence.

30|$|Image {{segmentation}} plays a {{vital role}} in MRI abnormality detection. This paper presents a <b>robust</b> MRI <b>segmentation</b> method to outline potential abnormality blobs. Thresholding and boundary tracing strategies are employed to remove background noises, and hence, the ROIs in the whole process are set. Subsequently, a polyfit surface evolution is proposed to approximately estimate bias field, which makes <b>segmentation</b> <b>robust</b> to image noises. Simultaneously, customized initial level set functions are devised so as to detect subtle bright and dark blobs which are highly potential abnormality regions. The proposed method improves bias field estimation and level set method to acquire fine segmentation with low computational complexities. Analysis of experimental results and comparisons with existing algorithms demonstrates that the proposed method can segment weak-edged, low-resolution MR brain images, and its performance prevails in accuracy and effectiveness.|$|R

40|$|Multifractal {{analysis}} {{is becoming more}} and more popular in image segmentation community, in which the box-counting based multifractal dimension estimations are most commonly used. However, in spite of its computational efficiency, the regular partition scheme used by various box-counting methods intrinsically produces less accurate results. In this paper, a novel multifractal estimation algorithm based on mathematical morphology is proposed and a set of new multifractal descriptors, namely the local morphological multifractal exponents is defined to characterize the local scaling properties of textures. A series of cubic structure elements and an iterative dilation scheme are utilized so that the computational complexity of the morphological operations can be tremendously reduced.

40|$|Fractal theory {{provides}} a powerful mathematical tool for texture segmentation. However, {{in spite of}} their increasing popularity, traditional fractal features are intrinsically of less accuracy due to the difference between the idea fractal model and the fractal reality of digital images. In this paper, we incorporated the multifractal analysis method into the idea of fractal signature, and thus proposed a novel type of texture descriptor called multifractal signature, which characterizes the variation of multifractal dimensions over spatial scales. In our approach, the local multifractal dimension of each scale was calculated by using the measurement acquired at two successive scales so that the time-consuming and less accurate least square fit was avoided. Based on three popular multifractal measurements, the differential box-counting (DBC) based multifractal signature, relative DBC based multifractal signature, and morphological multifractal signature were presented in this paper. The performance of the proposed texture descriptors was evaluated for segmentation of texture mosaics by comparing to the corresponding multifractal dimensions. The experimental results demonstrated that multifractal signatures can differentiate textured images more effectively and provide more <b>robust</b> <b>segmentations.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R
