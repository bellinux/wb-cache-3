In {{the field of}} automated driving, however, uncertainty about the roadway—and especially about {{the understanding of the}} roadway—is yet mostly neglected. In this paper it is argued that this uncertainty should be represented and considered in the process of behavior generation. A <b>road</b> <b>representation</b> capable of representing multiple hypotheses about the roadway is presented. The representation language allows to express where and how hypotheses differ and to infer this information in an efficient way. The focus of this paper is on the qualitative representation of uncertainty. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} autonomous navigation of UGV in an unstructured environment. Generally, state-of-the-art approaches use color based segmentation of road/non-road regions in particular. There arises an important question, how is the distance between an input pixel and a color model measured. Many algorithms employ Mahalanobis distance, since Mahalanobis distance better follows the data distribution, however it is assumed, that the data points have a normal distribution. Recently proposed Polynomial Mahalanobis Distance (PMD) represents more discriminative metric, which provides superior results in an unstructured terrain, especially, if the road is barely visible even for humans. In this paper, we discuss properties of the Polynomial Mahalanobis Distance, and propose a novel framework- A Three Stage Algorithm (TSA), which deals with both, picking of suitable data points from the training area as well as self-supervised learning algorithm for long-term <b>road</b> <b>representation...</b>|$|E

In this paper a tool chain approach is presented that combines automatically generation of 3 D landscapes with precise real world data (like cadastral plans, road measurement, aerial photographs, navigation data, etc.) for usage in more than one field of application. This tool chain is developing by the Institute of Transportation Systems within the project called “SimWorld”. SimWorld sets up a database in the domain for transportation research.

40|$|Book chapter {{partially}} available at: [URL] is {{a strong}} demand for accurate and up-to-date road network information. Road network knowledge is crucial for the creation and the update of maps, geographic information system (GIS) database, transportation or land planning. For local authorities, cartography of the road network is needed for urban planning, dirty water collection through gutter network (most often located under roads), traffic flow analysis or pollution mapping. Closely related applications are geo-marketing, electricity and telecommunication networks, databases for car navigation [...] . Currently, road network cartography is essentially done by human interpretations of high resolution aerial images and additional in situ information. This is a long and tedious work that requires to be done again for each update of the road network. High spatial resolution imagery is recently available for civilian applications and reveals the very fine details of the imaged area. Examples of high resolution satellites are SPOT 5, Ikonos, Quickbird, OrbView or EROS. The term ‘high resolution' is relative and refers to satellites with spatial resolutions better than 5 meters in the panchromatic channel (one can even talk about very high resolution when the image resolution is better than 1 meter). The current availability of high spatial resolution images represents an undeniable asset to Earth observation. The urban environment, {{that is the most}} difficult context because of its high complexity and information density, could benefit the most from high resolution imagery (Puissant and Weber, 2002). In addition to the increased precision for the road detection and location, high resolution satellite imagery can be used for numerous cases where the access to the studied area is difficult: administrative constraints, authorization to overfly the area, conflicts, wars or natural catastrophes [...] . Moreover, satellite means is significantly cheaper than aerial or in situ data acquisition campaigns. As promising as it is, the use of high resolution images for road extraction induces a change in the <b>road</b> <b>representation,</b> and a significant increase of noise. Moreover, quantitative assessment of the results has to be redesigned when dealing with such images. In this chapter, a new method suitable for high resolution images is proposed. Originally designed for urban area, this method can naturally be applied on easier cases such as rural or semi-rural areas. The chapter is structured as follow: the change in the <b>road</b> <b>representation</b> induces by high resolution imagery is first presented. A short survey on road extraction with the evolution from linear to surface models for road is proposed (section 2). A new method for extracting road networks from high spatial resolution images is then described. It models roads as a surface and is built on cooperation between linear and surface representation of roads. In order to overcome local artifacts, the method makes use of advanced image processing tools, such as active contours and the wavelet transform (section 3). An example of application of the method on a high resolution image from the Quickbird satellite is proposed. The result is quantitatively assessed compared to human interpretation (section 4). This chapter concludes with a discussion on the principal benefits of the method and on future prospects (section 5) ...|$|E

The variety of phenomena to be studied makes it necessary to characterise tyres in various ways. This paper focuses on empirical and physical tyre models for passenger car ride-comfort and handling applications on roads with short wavelength unevenness. Rigid ring models, in which the tyre tread-band is represented by one elastically supported rigid body, are suitable for tyre dynamics typically up to 50 Hertz. SWIFT is such a rigid ring model. Spring/damper systems represent the sidewall stiffness and damping for both in-plane and out-of-plane motions.

Low-level image features (e. g., color and texture) and pre-trained models are commonly used for this task. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to detect roads from a single image, which avoids the supervised model training that typically relies on {{a considerable number of}} labeled images. The key idea is to leverage unsupervised feature learning to obtain good <b>road</b> <b>representations.</b> Specifically, we first represent an input road image as a set of image patches. The K-means clustering algorithm is then applied to these image patches (after pre-processing) to generate K cluster centroids. Thus obtained centroids will be used together with a nonlinear mapping function and a bag-of-words projection to derive the image&# 039;s feature representation in pixel and region levels respectively. All pixels (of the input image) using the former mapping will be clustered by Density Peaks algorithm into several regions, and the regions represented by the latter feature will be grouped by a graph cut method into two classes: road and non-road. Experimental results on several complicated road images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, vehicle routing {{problems}} are defined {{on a network}} in which the customer locations and arcs are given. Typically, these arcs somehow represent the distances or expected travel time derived from the underlying road network. When executed, {{the quality of the}} solutions obtained from the vehicle routing problem depends largely {{on the quality of the}} <b>road</b> network <b>representation.</b> This paper explicitly considers path selection in the road network as an integrated decision in the time-dependent vehicle routing problem, denoted as path flexibility (PF). This means that any arc between two customer nodes has multiple corresponding paths in the road network (geographical graph). Hence, the decisions to make are involving not only the routing decision but also the path selection decision depending upon the departure time at the customers and the congestion levels in the relevant road network. The corresponding routing problem is a time-dependent vehicle routing problem with path flexibility (TDVRP–PF). We formulate the TDVRP–PF models under deterministic and stochastic traffic conditions. We derive important insights, relationships, and solution structures. Based on a representative testbed of instances (inspired on the road network of Beijing), significant savings are obtained in terms of cost and fuel consumption, by explicitly considering path flexibility. Having both path flexibility and time-dependent travel time seems to be a good representation of a wide range of stochasticity and dynamics in the travel time, and path flexibility serves as a natural recourse under stochastic conditions. Exploiting this observation, we employ a Route-Path approximation method generating near-optimal solutions for the TDVRP–PF under stochastic traffic conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims to categorise {{road network}} recorded trajectory data using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{such that the}} travelled road class can be revealed. This would inform on the feasibility of implementing an automated road update system that would rely on user recorded trajectory data to automate the discovery, classification, and update of candidate road network segments to existing road network database. End-users of digital GIS road network database are increasingly {{the major source of}} road change error reports. At present, vendors of digital road network database only provide web forms for user to report road errors. To investigate these errors they travel such roads and analyse satellite images to register changes. However, the major limitations to this method are that it is time consuming and logistically challenging to visit all locations of reported road error. Also the accuracy of road user road error report depends on the user's interpretation of the <b>road</b> network <b>representation</b> offered on the device in relation to the road in the real world, and the user's geographic knowledge and familiarity of the area. In the literature, different solutions have been proposed to deal with the key road update functions <b>road</b> change detection, <b>representation</b> and update. But most of these approaches are exclusively tied to remote sensing images. While these methods of road updating have been successfully used to extract roads from images, their accuracy is directly tied {{to the quality of the}} images and object model used for road extraction. Hence, existing solutions are image-specific and cannot be applied to other image type obtained from another sensor without significant adjustments of the parameters. An alternative approach investigated in this thesis uses the trajectory of moving vehicles to automate the detection of new roads and thus update a road network database. GPS recorded trajectory data were collected during field tests from a range of road types. The trajectory data are an abstraction of the road segments travelled and this study assumes for the sake of experimentation that these road segments are not present in the GIS road coverage and seeks to group the GPS-based trajectory data using an ANN to reveal the presence and class of public thoroughfares. This will establish the extent to which drive characteristics naturally fall into road feature classes. The results suggests that from the ANNs investigated, the unsupervised Snap-Drift Neural Network (SDNN) and the supervised Snap-Drift Adaptive Function Neural Network (SADFUNN) have the potential to support vehicle trajectory similarity grouping (classification) that can inform whether the road feature travelled is a new road feature that needs to be added to existing road database.

Road switchbacks can result from digitization errors such as kinks and kickbacks. Route planning can be defeated by breaks in the network. Much of the digital map data used to represent the physical environment comes from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). While the NGA has a large holding of internally-produced geospatial data, the agency’s current strategy includes substantial data production under contract and a large cooperative effort with other nations under the Multinational Geospatial Co-production Program (MGCP). The development, codification, and enforcement of detailed quality standards are critical to this acquisition strategy. This paper uses the modeling and simulation application area to exemplify problems that can arise when digital feature data is used for command and control purposes such as automated route planning.

We develop a framework for dynamic allocation of SAVs to passenger trips, empty-vehicle routing and multi-criteria evaluation with regard to passenger waiting time, trip time and fleet size. Using a representation of current private trip demand for the Stockholm metropolitan area and a detailed <b>road</b> network <b>representation,</b> different scenarios (varying levels of accepted passenger waiting time at origin and accepted increase in travel time) are compared with respect to passenger travel time, number of vehicles needed and vehicle mileage. In a second step {{the environmental impacts of}} the different scenarios are assessed and compared using a life cycle approach. The assessment includes both a fleet consisting of currently in use gasoline and diesel cars as well as electrical cars. The results show that an SAV-based personal transport system has the potential to provide an on-demand door-to-door transport {{with a high level of}} service, using less than 10 % of today's private cars and parking places. In order to provide an environmental benefit and lower congestion an SAV-based personal transport system requires users to accept ride-sharing, allowing a maximum 30 % increase of their travel time (15 % on average) and a start time window of 10 minutes. In a scenario where users are not inclined to accept any reduced level of service, i. e. no ride-sharing and no delay, empty vehicle drive of an SAV-based personal transport system will lead to increased road traffic increasing environmental impacts and congestion. Envisioning a future using electrical cars a SAV-based system and electrical vehicle technology seems to be a “perfect” match that could definitely contribute to a sustainable transport system in Stockholm. ...|$|R

Many of the people working towards creating a better and stronger Spanish radio station did so because they wanted to rebuild a patriotic citizenry, that promoted literacy and sobriety that focused more on the folkloric and nationalist elements, for Mexicans not only in the United States but also in Mexico. Pedro J. Gonzalez along with his group Los Madrugadores (The Early Risers) were listened to by many agricultural workers, there music was an inspiration to many however they were also a direct opposing force towards the U.S government and their efforts to deport Mexicans during the Great Depression. Pedro and his group helped pioneer the <b>road</b> for media <b>representation</b> of Latinos and they were a building block that allowed Spanish language radio broker Raoul Cortez to be granted, in 1946, the first U.S radio station to be licensed to a Latino.|$|R
40|$|Modeling and {{interactive}} rendering of urban environments are {{difficult as it}} is {{telling the story of}} simulating our real and complex world. Urban environment contains various buildings with different kinds of materials and different shapes, modeling such objects with conventional triangle mesh are not reasonable. It's not difficult to create the models, but to store and transmit the enormous data caused by the mesh models. Such amount of data is also very difficult to be put into computer memory for realtime rendering. Besides, roads and trees are also important parts of an urban environment. It is obvious that they share almost the same complexity of modeling and rendering with buildings due to similar problems. Therefore realtime interactive rendering with good visualization quality is very difficult to achieve. In this thesis, we are going to introduce various techniques for different objects in an urban environment to overcome mentioned problems. The first part of this thesis introduces a compact representation of urban building models called Non-uniform Texture, NUT for short. The representation is able to model a building with memory footprint more than two orders of magnitude smaller than that of its mesh counterpart, while impressive details and rendering performance are preserved. The second part introduces a compact <b>representation</b> of urban <b>roads.</b> The <b>representation</b> is also very efficient in data storage and memory consumption. Combing with NUT, the representation also offers great visual quality. The third part introduces an efficient rendering pipeline of trees. The pipeline requires no details to be stored to achieve data efficiency. The pipeline uses almost all functionality of mainstream GPU to provide stunning visual and rendering performance. The final part of this thesis introduces a robust computation of up vector, {{to solve the problem of}} camera rotation during video capture. With all the mentioned features, we are going to produce a living urban environment within one system. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|US Geological Survey (USGS) based {{elevation}} {{data are}} {{the most commonly used}} data source for highway hydraulic analysis; however, due to the vertical accuracy of USGS-based elevation data, USGS data may be too “coarse” to adequately describe surface profiles of watershed areas or drainage patterns. Additionally hydraulic design requires delineation of much smaller drainage areas (watersheds) than other hydrologic applications, such as environmental, ecological, and water resource management. This research study investigated whether higher resolution LIDAR based surface models would provide better delineation of watersheds and drainage patterns as compared to surface models created from standard USGS-based elevation data. Differences in runoff values were the metric used to compare the data sets. The two data sets were compared for a pilot study area along the Iowa 1 corridor between Iowa City and Mount Vernon. Given the limited breadth of the analysis corridor, areas of particular emphasis were the location of drainage area boundaries and flow patterns parallel to and intersecting the road cross section. Traditional highway hydrology {{does not appear to be}} significantly impacted, or benefited, by the increased terrain detail that LIDAR provided for the study area. In fact, hydrologic outputs, such as streams and watersheds, may be too sensitive to the increased horizontal resolution and/or errors in the data set. However, a true comparison of LIDAR and USGS-based data sets of equal size and encompassing entire drainage areas could not be performed in this study. Differences may also result in areas with much steeper slopes or significant changes in terrain. LIDAR may provide possibly valuable detail in areas of modified terrain, such as <b>roads.</b> Better <b>representations</b> of channel and terrain detail in the vicinity of the roadway may be useful in modeling problem drainage areas and evaluating structural surety during and after significant storm events. Furthermore, LIDAR may be used to verify the intended/expected drainage patterns at newly constructed highways. LIDAR will likely provide the greatest benefit for highway projects in flood plains and areas with relatively flat terrain where slight changes in terrain may have a significant impact on drainage patterns...|$|R
