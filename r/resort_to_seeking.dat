50|$|Accessing Health {{facilities}} and services {{remains one of}} the biggest challenges as the whole chiefdom has only one clinic (oldest) as a health center which is not only understaffed but also understocked. Patients have to be transported over long distances of more than 30 km to reach the clinic, usually on either ox-carts or/and traditional stretchers. This results in patients shunning the health facility and resorting to staying at home, while others die in the clinic due to late admittance. Health needs urgent attention from government and well wishers (the Church and NGOs) to prevent the local people from dying from preventable diseases due to inability to access the health services.

40|$|In recent times, {{microfinance}} {{has emerged}} as a major innovation in the rural financial marketplace. Microfinance largely addresses the issue of access to financial services. In trying to understand the innovation of microfinance and how it has proved to be effective, the author looks at certain design features of microfinance. He first starts by identifying the need for financial service institutions which is basically {{to bridge the gap between}} the need for financial services across time, geographies, and risk profiles. In providing services that bridge this gap, formal institutions have limited access to authentic information both in terms of transaction history and expected behaviour and, therefore, <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> excessive information thereby adding to the transaction costs. The innovation in microfinance has been largely to bridge this gap through a series of trust-based surrogates that take the transaction-related risks to the people who have the information — the community through measures of social collateral. In this paper, the author attempts to examine the trajectory of institutional intermediation in the rural areas, particularly with the poor and how it has evolved over a period of time. It identifies a systematic breach of trust as one of the major problems with the institutional interventions in the area of providing financial services to the poor and argues that microfinance uses trust as an effective mechanism to address one of the issues o...|$|E

The option of registering in absentia through a friend acting on his behalf was turned down and Caesar opted for the consulship.

In both The Life of Cato and The Life of Pompey he wrote that after the agrarian bill was defeated the hard pressed Pompey <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> the support of the plebeian tribunes and young adventurers, the worse of whom was Publius Clodius Pulcher (see below).

Therefore, the two texts seem contradictory. In The Life of Caesar he wrote Caesar started his policy to reconcile Pompey and Crassus soon after entered the city.

Khushal's critics differ about his greatness: some consider him the greatest with reference to his poetry. some consider him to be the greatest warrior, others confirm him to be the greatest Philosopher and statesman and still others consider him the great preacher of love and amity. He loved humanity, he loved Pashtoons, he loved knowledge and beauty in all its forms whether of mountains, trees flowers, birds and women. Born almost four hundred years ago (1613) he still lives in the memory and history, the time never ever seems to be able to humble his thoughts and vibrant personality, as the providence intends to keep him living. While expressing his nationalist theory and unfolding his philosophy of Pashto, he often <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help from his ideal man as Jangyal (Warrior), Toorzan (Bold and courageous), Miranay (Brave) Mard (the man) and Nangyal (committed to Nang-honour).Khushal wrote excellent poetry in Pashto about such things as unity, honor, war, love, and everyday life. He also wrote about philosophy and ethics. His poetry is still widely read. Khushal faced the hard Life. The victim of old age, the hard life of wars and worries and his head-on collisions with the Mughal imperial power had indeed eroded his strength and energy but his courage, bravery and perseverance was intact.. His major and principal aim and target was to snatch independence for Pashtuns from the Mughals whose incentives and biog and attractive offers to reclaim him had repeatedly failed in breaking his will power. However the Mughal diplomacy, bribes and intimidations succeeded in dividing the Pashtun tribes. The Mughals repaired their broken image and obviously Khushal had lost his war for independence and the Mughals had won. The disunity in Pashtun ranks helped in restoring the Mughal superiority. The great Khushal cleanly and unambiguously defined the Mughals hostile approach towards Pashtuns tribe.|$|R

Divorce rates for women who suffer from an obstetric fistula range from 50% to as high as 89%. Now marginalized members of society, girls are forced {{to live on the}} edges of their villages and towns, often to live in isolation in a hut where they will likely die from starvation or an infection in the birth canal. The unavoidable odor is viewed as offensive, thus their removal from society is seen as essential. Accounts of women who suffer obstetric fistulae proclaim that their lives have been reduced to the leaking of urine, feces, and blood because they are no longer capable or allowed to participate in traditional activities, including the duties of wife and mother. Because such consequences highly stigmatize and marginalize the woman, the intense loneliness and shame can lead to clinical depression and suicidal thoughts. Some women have formed small groups and <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> walking <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> medical help, where their characteristic odor makes them a target for sub-Saharan predatory wildlife, further endangering their lives. This trip can take on average 12 hours to complete. Moreover, women are sometimes forced to turn to commercial sex work as a means of survival because the extreme poverty and social isolation that result from obstetric fistulae eliminate all other income opportunities. With only 7.5% of women with fistulae able to access treatment, the vast majority of women end up with the consequences of obstructed and prolonged labor simply because options and access to help is so limited.|$|R
40|$|Many schools {{throughout}} the world are facing constant pressure {{to cope with the}} violence and drug abuse of learners who show little or no respect for acceptable and desirable social norms. These delinquent learners tend to harbour feelings of being beyond reproach because they strongly believe that it is well within their rights to engage in violent and destructive behaviour. Knives, guns, and other weapons appear to be more readily used by them on the school premises than before. It is known that learners smoke, drink alcohol, and use drugs during school hours, hence, their ability to concentrate, work, and learn, is affected. They become violent and display disruptive behaviour in their classrooms {{as well as on the}} school premises, and this atrocious behaviour makes it possible for drug dealers and gangsters to gain access onto the school premises. The primary purpose of this exploratory quantitative study was therefore to establish how tobephobia (TBP), caused by school violence and drug abuse, affects teaching and learning in schools. The findings of this study affirmed that poor discipline resulted in producing poor quality education. Most of the teachers in this study agreed that educating learners who consumed alcohol and other drugs on the school premises resulted in them suffering from TBP. These learners are frequently abusive and disrespectful, and <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> violence <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> attention.
