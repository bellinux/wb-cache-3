40|$|The vault {{damage in}} a railway tunnel, caused by damps in a granite massif, {{produced}} the <b>granite</b> <b>slabs</b> roof detachment. Sustitution of these <b>granite</b> <b>slabs</b> by concrete, including damping voids between {{the roof and}} the granite massif, was the most optimal solution concerning {{the preservation of the}} railway interior tunnel size (gallbo). The volume of concrete necessary to cover the vault and the gables of the tunnel was determined using a ground penetrating radar SIR 70 from GSSI, with a 500 MHz center frecuency antenna. Twelve radar profiles along the tunnel, covering the vault and the tunnel walls, were made to determine the total volume of concrete necessary to replace the old <b>granite</b> <b>slabs,</b> the void location and the identification of the tunnel region to be repaired. Ground penetrating radar measurements allowed to know the thicknesses of the <b>granite</b> <b>slabs</b> and the distance between these slabs and the massif rock of the irregular voi...|$|R

50|$|On {{the western}} flank, {{the area has}} been excavated, {{resulting}} in the unearthing of family homes of circular and rectangular plans, with <b>granite</b> <b>slabs</b> patios. Various layers of wall indicate successive periods of occupation in the locale. During the 1960s, excavations detected rectangular plans, organized in barrios and organized around <b>granite</b> <b>slabs.</b> Near the locale, they discovered a possible ceramic kiln constructed in brick: today little remains. Also, {{at the base of}} the hill, in the east, they detected a necropolis, however, it has since been destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Design of the 1,150-foot {{bridge was}} {{complicated}} by the tides in the area known as Will's Gut. It was decided to build a cobwork bridge, using <b>granite</b> <b>slabs</b> as cribstones, acquired from local quarries in nearby Yarmouth, Maine. The slabs, longer than they are wide, are laid horizontally, first lengthwise, and then crosswise, in several layers. No mortar or cement is used. <b>Granite</b> <b>slabs</b> were considered sufficiently heavy to withstand wind and wave, while the open cribbing allowed the tide to ebb and flow freely without increasing tidal current to any great degree.|$|R

25|$|The pyramid {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{examples}} of Richardson's work west of the Mississippi River, the other being the Isaac H. Lionberger House in St. Louis less than two miles from the river. Richardson's monolithic structure employed <b>rough-hewn</b> <b>granite</b> boulders in its construction. The monument's stones at the base are five feet by eight feet and weigh thousands of pounds each. The pyramid narrows from the base to become progressively smaller towards the top at a ratio of four inches to the foot.|$|R
2500|$|There {{took place}} the {{sacrificial}} offerings {{for the king}} after his death. The offering chapel was directly adjoining the main pyramid eastern side as was customary. The focus of the chapel was a false door, a roughly worked <b>granite</b> <b>slab</b> {{that would have given}} Sahure's spirit access to the food offerings made for him according to ancient Egyptian beliefs. Unusually, this false door was uninscribed when it should have borne the name and titles of Sahure as well as magical spells. This observation led Borchardt to propose that the <b>granite</b> <b>slab</b> was once covered by a copper or golden panel bearing the necessary inscriptions, of which no trace remains today.|$|R
60|$|There {{were many}} who felt an {{interest}} in Fanshawe; but the influence of none could prevail upon him to lay aside the habits, mental and physical, by which he was bringing himself to the grave. His passage thither was consequently rapid, terminating just as he reached his twentieth year. His fellow-students erected to his memory a monument of <b>rough-hewn</b> <b>granite,</b> with a white marble slab for the inscription. This was borrowed from the grave of Nathanael Mather, whom, in his almost insane eagerness for knowledge, and in his early death, Fanshawe resembled.|$|R
