40|$|Nanoscale {{devices that}} are {{sensitive}} to measurement history enable memory applications, and memristors are currently under intense investigation for robustness and functionality. Here we de-scribe the fabrication and performance of a memristor-like device that is comprised of a single TiO 2 nan-owire in contact with Au electrodes, demonstrating both high sensitivity to electrical stimuli {{and high levels of}} control. Through an electroforming process, a population of charged dopants is created at the interface between the wire and electrode that can be manipulated to demonstrate a range of device and memristor characteristics. In contrast to conventional two-terminal memristors, our device is essentially a diode that exhibits memristance in the forward bias direction. The device is easily <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> the <b>off</b> state by a single voltage pulse and can be incremented to provide a range of controllable conductance states in the forward direction. Electrochemical modification of the Schottky barrier at the electrodes is proposed as an underlying mechanism, and six-level memory operations are demonstrated on a single nanowire...|$|R
50|$|On 2 October 2003 Yung-Hsun Lin, {{also known}} as Andy Lin, changed code on a server at Medco Health Solutions Inc.'s Fair Lawn, New Jersey headquarters, where he was {{employed}} as a Unix administrator, creating a logic bomb set <b>to</b> go <b>off</b> on his birthday in 2004. It failed to work due to a programming error, so Lin corrected the error and <b>reset</b> it <b>to</b> go <b>off</b> on his next birthday, but it was discovered and disabled by a Medco computer systems administrator {{a few months before}} the trigger date. Lin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in jail in a federal prison in addition to $81,200 in restitution. The charges held a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of US$250,000.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2012 American Institute of PhysicsPhase-change devices exhibit {{characteristic}} threshold {{switching from}} the <b>reset</b> (<b>off)</b> <b>to</b> the set (on) state. Mainstream {{understanding of this}} electrical switching phenomenon {{is that it is}} initiated electronically via the influence of high electric fields on inter-band trap states in the amorphous phase. However, recent work has suggested that field induced (crystal) nucleation could instead be responsible. We compare and contrast these alternative switching “theories” via realistic simulations of device switching both with and without electric field dependent contributions to the system free energy. Results show that although threshold switching can indeed be obtained purely by electric field induced nucleation, the fields required are significantly larger than experimentally measured values...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, poly(2 -(N-carbazolyl) ethyl methacrylate) (PCEM) brushes {{have been}} {{prepared}} on the indium-tin oxide (ITO) surfaces via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using a silane coupling agent containing the initiator moiety. Films of PCEM brushes between bottom ITO electrode and Al top electrode are sandwiched to fabricate the ITO-g-PCEM/Al device. The device exhibits two conductivity states and can be switched from the initial low-conductivity (<b>OFF)</b> state <b>to</b> the high-conductivity (ON) state at the switching threshold voltages of - 1. 5 V with the ON/OFF current ratio up to 10 6. The ON state of the device is nonvolatile and can withstand 10 6 pulse read cycles at - 0. 8 V under ambient conditions. Upon reversing the bias, the ON state cannot be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> the initial <b>OFF</b> states. The ITO-g-PCEM/Al device behaves as a write-once read-many-times (WORM) memory. Compared {{with that of the}} conventional ITO/PCEM/Al device fabricated by spin-coating, the switching voltage is lower in the ITO-g-PCEM/Al memory device. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
