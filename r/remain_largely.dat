5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, prostitution, and arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> uneducated.|$|E

5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|Little {{remains of}} the eastern walls, but in the {{north-east}} corner several towers still <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> intact, including Polymond tower, a powerful drum tower largely reconstructed during the Victorian period. Further west is the Bargate; this was originally a simple archway but was expanded with drum towers and arrow slits in the early 14th century, and then expanded again in the early 15th century with battlements and parapets, before being heavily restored in the 19th century. The Bargate remains an elaborate building, taking military symbolism and combining it with rich civic heraldry and decoration above the gateway.|$|E
5|$|Some Lucian calypsonians {{recorded}} in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played {{an increasing number of}} programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.|$|E

5|$|The coyote is a {{prominent}} character in Native American folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> negative.|$|E
5|$|The smaller {{islands of}} Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely {{share in the}} same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> unstudied. Saba {{is home to a}} vital percussive music tradition, most closely {{associated}} with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the ponum, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like quimbe song form, that remains {{a major part of the}} island's culture.|$|E
5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E

5|$|In 1565, the Ottomans {{attacked}} {{again in}} the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By {{the end of the}} siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. The city walls, which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls. The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{features}} prominently as a trickster {{figure in}} the folktales of America's indigenous peoples, alternately assuming {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote acts as a picaresque hero which rebels against social convention through deception and humor. The coyote was likely given its trickster role in light of the actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike the gray wolf, which has undergone a radical improvement of its public image, cultural attitudes towards the coyote <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> negative.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{season of}} Homicide {{established}} a realistic visual style that would <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> intact throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among the stylistic elements were the near-constant movement with hand-held Super 16 cameras to give the show a naturalistic documentary look and an editing style involving jump cuts that was unusual for television at the time. Wayne Ewing had used Super 16 cameras while filming promotional material for Toys, and that format allowed Homicide producers to film cheaply and with a smaller crew, giving them more time to focus on the actor's performances. While filming, Levinson said he would simply allow the actors to perform while he switched back and forth between them with the hand-held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles. Levinson said the camera and editing style was partially inspired by the Jean-Luc Godard film Breathless (1960), which he would often ask his directors to watch before filming Homicide episodes.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home is {{assisting}} in research towards preventing some viruses, such as influenza and HIV, from recognizing and entering biological cells. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme RNase H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion <b>remain</b> <b>largely</b> unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.|$|E
