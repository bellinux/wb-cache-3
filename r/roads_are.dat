5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|All public roadways in Michigan {{that are}} not state {{trunklines}} or city streets are maintained by the county road commission, including streets in communities that {{are a part of}} a township.

Other <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> assigned double- or triple-letter designations in addition to any names assigned to the roadways by a city or township.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance design {{must take}} into account local {{conditions}} and infrastructure.

Fuel must be available and service facilities are necessary to maintain the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Amman is the 4th most visited Arab {{city and}} the ninth highest {{recipient}} of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.

The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of <b>roads,</b> <b>are</b> intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.|$|E
5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> present near it. The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads. The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools may be used as breeding grounds for mosquitos.|$|E

5|$|From Compiègne it now {{follows a}} 260km winding route north to Roubaix, hitting the first cobbles after 100km. During the last 150km the cobbles extend more than 50km. The race culminates with 750m {{on the smooth}} {{concrete}} of the large outdoor Vélodrome André-Pétrieux in Roubaix. The route is adjusted {{from year to year}} as older <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> resurfaced and the organisers seek more cobbles to maintain the character of the race— in 2005, for example, the race included 54.7km of cobbles.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|The A57 and A61 <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> {{the major}} trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, {{crossing}} {{in the city}} centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner ring road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring, allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south east and north, nearer {{the edge of the}} city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.|$|E
50|$|The Myitkyi Moegaung Tanai to Putao city <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} by the British rules. But the <b>road</b> <b>is</b> in very bad condition these days due to the Kachin Rebel KIA.

5|$|The chief Roman {{contributions}} to architecture were the arch, vault and the dome. Even {{after more than}} 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, {{due in part to}} sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even {{after the collapse of the}} central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.|$|E
5|$|The {{congestion}} tax {{is being}} introduced at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden {{in order to}} reduce traffic jams in peak periods, and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden, the surrounding <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> expected to have shorter tailbacks. The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the aviation industry was accompanied by the disruption of road transport; many <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> frequently blocked by militia checkpoints which demand payment (between $3 and $300, depending on goods carried) {{in order to allow}} the cars to continue their journey. A BBC report claimed there were seven such checkpoints in the 50km between an airstrip and the capital, Mogadishu. Most of the money is used to buy khat, a drug used by the militiamen.|$|E
