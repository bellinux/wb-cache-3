2500|$|On 13 July 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox {{outlined}} to MPs {{the findings}} of an independent review into the 1994 crash, which found that the two pilots who were blamed for the crash had been cleared of gross negligence. In doing so, the Government accepted Lord Philip's confirmation that the Controller Aircraft Release (CAR) was [...] "mandated" [...] upon the RAF. Issued in November 1993, the CAR stated that the entire navigation and communications systems used on the Chinook HC2 {{were not to be}} relied upon in any way by the aircrew, and therefore it had no legitimate clearance to fly. Knowledge of the CAR had been withheld from the pilots; by withholding this when issuing their <b>Release</b> <b>to</b> <b>Service</b> (RTS) (the authority to fly), the RAF had made a false declaration of compliance with regulations. In December 2012, the Minister for the Armed Forces, Andrew Robathan, confirmed such a false declaration did not constitute [...] "wrongdoing", despite it leading directly to deaths of servicemen.|$|E

50|$|From the beginning, the E {{cars were}} {{organised}} into fairly fixed consists, {{as demonstrated by}} their delivery dates. 28 August and 30 October 1906 each had the release of an AVE-AVE-AVBE-BVE-BVE-DVE consist, with the accompanying Parlor cars <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> a few months later; Yarra on 31 October and Murray on 19 December 1906. These trains ran from Melbourne to Albury, connecting to the New South Wales express trains to Sydney at Albury station. All of these cars save for Murray had been <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> by the 1906 Melbourne Cup.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} war recovery, more S type {{carriages}} were built. Starting from 1948 further AS {{cars were}} constructed, with 9AS and 10AS <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> on 2 December 1948; 11AS on the 22nd and 12AS on 29 March 1949, and 13AS on 20 May that year. 14AS entered service a year later, on 9 May 1950, while 15AS and 16AS were added on 4 and 12 December 1952. All of these carriages were <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> in the same livery as the previous red cars, with silver lines. The only noticeable change is the picking-out of some large underframe equipment in silver.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{completed}} aircraft {{arrived at}} RAF Brize Norton in December 2011; after a prolonged certification process, it began training flights in April 2012. [...] Following technical {{issues with the}} new Cobham-designed High Speed-Variable Drag Drogue when refuelling the Tornado the drogues on the wing tip pods were replaced in early 2012 with standard Sargent Fletcher drogues, delaying the <b>Release</b> <b>To</b> <b>Service</b> clearance required to conduct Air to Air Refuelling (AAR) operations.

50|$|One of {{the three}} Nimrods on {{strength}} was retired {{at the end of}} November 2009 with the other two remaining in service until June 2011. The Nimrods were replaced by three Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft in 2014. In January 2011 personnel from 51 Squadron began training at Offutt Air Force Base in the US for conversion to the RC-135. Crews will deploy on joint missions with the USAF 343rd Reconnaissance Squadron until the new aircraft are available.

50|$|A Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA), or an {{airworthiness}} certificate, {{is issued}} for an aircraft {{by the national}} aviation authority {{in the state in}} which the aircraft is registered. The airworthiness certificate attests that the aircraft is airworthy insofar as the aircraft conforms to its type design. Each airworthiness certificate is issued in {{one of a number of}} different categories. A certificate of airworthiness is issued when the aircraft is registered in the name of the owner. Thereafter, a yearly currency fee is payable to renew the Certificate of Airworthiness. If this fee is not paid when due, the certificate expires and the owner must apply again for this certificate to be issued. The Certificate of Airworthiness can only be issued when a certificate of <b>release</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> from the maintenance facility declares that the maintenance due has been carried out and the aircraft is then certified as being airworthy.|$|E
5000|$|... 52 58ft-body ABW {{cars were}} built between 1911 and 1925. The earlier Clerestory-roof stock was {{initially}} numbered 1ABW <b>to</b> 42ABW and <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> between 1911 and 1914. In 1918-19, cars 43-47ABW {{were added to}} the fleet. Then, in early 1925 cars 48ABW through 52ABW were constructed, with the new design of a curved roof, but still retaining all other dimensions of the earlier group.|$|R
50|$|From the {{experience}} gained with Taggerty, four all-steel S type buffet cars were constructed, using a similar body shell {{to that of}} the previous builds. Two buffet cars were constructed initially, Number 2, <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> on 19 December 1938, and Number 3, <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> on 14 Feb 1939. Both these cars were fitted with a kitchen area and a full-length buffet, with no regular passenger seating or compartments. A few months later, cars 5 (1 June 1939) and 4 (31 July 1939) were <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service.</b> All cars were later named; respectively, Wimmera, Mitta Mitta, Tanjil and Moorabool. All four cars, when built, were painted in a deep red intended as a rough approximation of the red scheme then in use on the timber passenger fleet; this red extended over the roof. Additionally, a pair of silver stripes, 2 in above the window line and 3 in below the window line, were added. The silver colour was also used when applying the Art Deco style carriage names and Buffet Car lettering; the former about halfway between the 3-inch line and the underframe of the car, and the latter immediately above the 2-inch line. All lettering was located centrally on the car. Window frames were painted silver. Wimmera and Mitta Mitta had full-length buffets with 27 seats, while Tanjil and Moorabool had only 19 seats along a shorter buffet, plus two first-class compartments. The kitchen of each car included an Esse Fuel Stove, similar in design to that included in the Spirit of Progress's Dining Car. In all cases the kitchen area was located {{at one end of the}} car, rather than being placed centrally like in Taggerty.|$|R
50|$|The wagons from 381-637 are {{a curiosity}} because from 1982 to 1984 an {{improved}} design of wagon was <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service,</b> {{known as the}} VHHY. These wagons were about 2 ft longer and had an extra 10 LT capacity over their predecessors, being able to carry 65 LT each. The first three, 401, 412 and 414, were <b>released</b> <b>to</b> traffic in July 1982, but within a month they had been renumbered to 801, 812 and 814 respectively. By late 1984 the class had expanded to cover numbers 801-915.|$|R

50|$|On 18 September 2012 at the InnoTrans Trade Fair in Berlin the E4MSU {{locomotive}} {{had been}} premiered. At {{the end of}} April 2013 the locomotive was transported to the experimental track near Żmigrod Railway Institute where the testing on the locomotive began. On the 16 May 2013 locomotive together with two carriages began being used PKP Intercity in Nowy Sacz, and in the following days the locomotive was tested at the Olsztyn - Nidzica railway line (where the turning of the locomotive was tested). The locomotive returned {{to the south of}} the country of Poland, where at the beginning of June 2013 had passed the static tests at the Kraków Railway Institute, then the locomotive went to Żmigród. On the 18 July 2013 to the 31 July 2013 PKP Cargo and conducted a driving test which is necessary to obtain a certificate of <b>release</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> the locomotive.

40|$|Safety-critical {{embedded}} systems go through rigorous verification processes before {{being put into}} service. Verification is {{a major source of}} cost in the development process because of the rigour with which the verification is carried out. Most designs are subject to high levels of change traffic during development. This greatly increases the cost of the development as the complete system may need to be re-verified to full rigour several times before <b>release</b> <b>to</b> <b>service.</b> Thus there is potential benefit in designing to support ease of change, and focused re-verification after change. We briefly consider the current change management approaches, which have mainly targeted object-oriented software, and indicate some of their limitations when applied to safety-critical software. We then set out a number of proposed principles for the design of systems that facilitate change, and assess their effectiveness by discussing changes made to an aerospace system demonstrator.

50|$|Like all {{the early}} A4 {{locomotives}} prior to Mallard, Golden Shuttle was <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> {{with a single}} chimney and side valances covering the wheels. The valances were removed to aid in maintenance during a general overhaul on 30 January 1942. Experimental Automatic Train Control equipment was fitted on 23 June 1950. A double chimney and Kylchap double blastpipe was installed to help performance, during an overhaul 20 August 1958. A Smith-Stone type speed indicator was installed 30 June 1960.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} further wagons were constructed, {{again to the}} steel design. The wagons were outshopped as VHGY, numbers from 351 to 380 in 1979, then 381-450 in 1984-85 and finally 451-637 (at least) from 1988. It is not known whether or not 637 was the last number, or when it was <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service.</b> However, it can be assumed that these {{additions}} to the fleet were intended to replace {{the large numbers of}} four-wheeled wagons as quickly as finances became available.|$|R
5000|$|As at {{the time}} the code for the new {{carriages}} had not yet been decided, the passenger cars were <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> unclassed and simply numbered 1 through 9 without a class. Some official correspondence refers to the carriages as [...] "Steel E type carriage" [...] - for example, [...] "Steel AE 1" [...] when referring to the first of the passenger cars. The Dining and Parlor cars apparently began life with those identities, and the guards van was known as the Steel CE Van.|$|R
40|$|Strong {{claims are}} {{made about the}} {{potential}} of opening government data to drive service innovation. Yet {{little is known about}} the detailed processes of how hackers create or reshape services out of new releases of public datasets, and the conditions for the move from data <b>release</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> innovation. We argue the utility of open data is accrued through the creation of new artifacts with enhanced performativity transformed by human and material agency. In a multimethod study of the open data hackers in the UK we identified a series of interlocking processes involved in the conversion of public data into services of public value. We found that few of the ‘rapid prototypes ’ developed through hack day events are maintained or sustained as service innovations beyond those events. Five artifacts provided the value stack of complementarities: cleaned data available through APIs or bulk downloads, linkable data, shared source code and configuration, source code repositories, and web technologies. Our findings also suggest that only a few open datasets induce the process of change, and that initial contributions are driven by the use values but can only be sustained through an open innovative approach to induce further collaboration within a wider open data community...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} process of redesign and installation of new avionics equipment in the cockpit of a Pilatus PC- 6 Turbo Porter, with registration EC-LZI. This redesign consists on install, remove and replace avionics equipment in the cockpit on the aircraft, in particular, communications and navigation equipment. Specifically, it is explained {{from the point of}} view of an approved maintenance organization, to which a customer entrusts this work, how to carry out the modification and how to certify it to the authorities. This process will require a major change in the electrical system of the aircraft, so it will be a complex installation. The cockpit design change is motivated by the Single European Sky initiative, which says that all the aircraft flying in European airspace must have installed communications equipment with a 8, 33 kHz channel spacing, before December 31 st 2017 and all aircraft flying with Mode S transponder in near future. Taking advantage that the aircraft will be a must stop for installation time, other equipment such as, a new attitude indicator or a power socket for portable devices are installed. The process of redesign and installation has a first stage of obtaining permits and documentation from the competent authority. Then, there is a second stage of wiring manufacturing and subsequent installation of the equipment onto the aircraft. Finally, it becomes {{the process of}} certification of the whole installation in order to issue a certificate of <b>Release</b> <b>to</b> <b>Service,</b> which ensures that all the installation has been installed properly and that the airplane can fly safely again. All processes are carried out under the current regulations, documentation and permits to do so...|$|E
