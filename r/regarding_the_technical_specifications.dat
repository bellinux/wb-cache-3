40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{determine}} the adequacy of the High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR) <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> for 40 MW operation by comparison with the HFBR Final Safety Analysis Report, particularly the accident analyses chapter. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> were compared against the Design Basis Accident (DBA) Analyses presented in the Addendum to the HFBR FSAR for 60 MW Operation. The 60 MW DBA analyses was used since it is more current and complete than the analyses presented in the original FSAR which is considered obsolete. A listing of the required systems and equipment was made for each of the accidents analyzed.

40|$|Pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 90, PSEG Nuclear LLC hereby {{requests}} {{a change}} to <b>the</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> (TS) for Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS).

30|$|An overlay {{cognitive}} radio communication which induces an opportunistic secondary communication through the small-scale fading mechanisms inherently present into the mobile channels was proposed here. The SC-FDMA system became {{in the study}} object of this proposal, being the delay spread of the signal, and the time variance of the LTE mobile channel the crucial points of analysis. So, whereas the frequency selectivity of the channel provides the information about which subcarriers along the entire transmission bandwidth are undergoing the best, the worst, and intermediate conditions, the fading rapidity indicates (i.e., depending on the carrier frequency and UE speed) approximately how long time the conditions over those subcarriers will be steady. In this <b>regard,</b> <b>the</b> 3 GPP-LTE <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> and <b>the</b> model given by Young and Beaulieu [20] were utilized for implementing an LTE mobile channel corresponding to an urban area. From the implemented channel {{it was possible to}} find that for a UE moving at 15 km/h and operating at 1850.7 MHz, the channel remains invariant approximately during 16.462 ms, which is equivalent to transmitting around 230 SC-FDMA symbols. Subsequently, and under these bases a multiuser mobile environment was implemented aiming at incorporating a CR user as a listener of the primary network, which was focused on opportunistically exploiting (and as function of the coherence time) the extreme conditions of the primary channel being tracked. So, the deployed scenario was analyzed by inducing opportunistic interference through the peaks and nulls of a primary channel, and under the static and dynamic allocations of radio frequency resources. From the system’s performance evaluation, it was found that an overlay transmission through the channel nulls resulted in a much more significant degradation of the conventional transmission than the originated by opportunistically transmitting over the channel peaks, this is attributed to the MMSE equalizer embedded in the system. So, after finding that co-transmitting over the primary channel peaks seems to be a better choice for accessing to the primary resources, we can point out {{that in the case of}} the static allocation of resources the best interfered bit error rate we got was 1.116 × 10 – 6 with 21 dB, which is better than an un-interfered communication with 18 dB (3.125 × 10 – 5). In the case of a dynamic allocation of resources the best interfered BER we got was 1.004 × 10 – 5, which is certainly poorer than the one got previously, but we have to take into account that the threshold enabling the secondary access was modified (i.e., it was much more restrictive in the second case). We can conclude that of course there is a price to be paid at the moment of introducing a secondary communication in parallel; however, the operators could try to find a tradeoff aiming at receiving an extra benefit for having more costumers (i.e., secondary users paying fees) attached to their networks almost in a transparent way.|$|R
