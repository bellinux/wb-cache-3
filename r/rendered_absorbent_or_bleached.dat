30|$|The {{removal of}} sulphur oxide {{emissions}} {{can be achieved}} using either dry or wet methods. Typical absorbents for a wet sulphur removal process are limestone, caustic soda, seawater, ammonium hydroxide, or magnesium hydroxide, of which caustic soda and seawater are the most feasible options for ship installations. Closed loop systems can also be operated with zero discharge in enclosed areas. The other solutions offered are either seawater scrubbers, needing no additional <b>absorbent,</b> <b>or</b> a hybrid scrubber able to operate in both modes.|$|R
