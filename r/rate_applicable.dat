50|$|It is {{also worth}} {{bearing in mind}} {{that if there is}} more than one {{interest}} <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> - for example for credit cards where there may be a different purchase rate and balance transfer rate - the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> to the most common drawdown mechanism must be shown.

50|$|Although banks can {{refuse to}} repay FDs before the expiry of the deposit, they {{generally}} don't. This {{is known as}} a premature withdrawal. In such cases, interest is paid at the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> at the time of withdrawal. For example, a deposit is made for 5 years at 8%, but is withdrawn after 2 years. If the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> on the date of deposit for 2 years is 5 per cent, the interest will be paid at 5 per cent. Banks can charge a penalty for premature withdrawal.|$|E

50|$|An intra-Community {{acquisition}} of goods is a taxable transaction for consideration crossing {{two or more}} member states.

5000|$|... "Ad valorem" [...] tax, most {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} property tax, relates to the tax that results when the net assessed value of a property is multiplied times the millage <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> to that property. This millage rate is usually expressed as a multiple of 1/1000 of a dollar. Thus the fractional amount of 0.001 will be expressed as 1 mill when expressed as an ad valorem tax millage rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} major {{tax legislation}} (Tax Reform Act of 1969) {{had established a}} 10% minimum tax and while it had left long-term capital gains under $50,000 to continue {{to qualify for the}} 25 percent alternative capital gains tax rate, it increased the rate on gains over $50,000 to 29.5 percent in 1970, 32.5 percent in 1971, and 35 percent (one-half the 70 percent top tax <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> to ordinary income) in 1972 and later years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{general rule}} for {{determining}} the place of supply {{is the place where}} the supplier of the services is established (or [...] "belongs"), such as a fixed establishment where the service is supplied, the supplier's permanent address, or where the supplier usually resides. VAT is then charged at the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> in the member state where the place of supply of the services is located and is collected by that member state.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} for collecting VAT when {{the place of}} supply {{is not in the}} same member state as the supplier is similar to that used for Intra-Community Acquisitions of goods, i.e. zero-rating by the supplier and reverse charge by the recipient of the services (if a taxable person). But if the recipient of the services is not a taxable person (i.e. a final consumer), the supplier must generally charge VAT at the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> in its own member state.|$|E
50|$|If {{sales to}} final {{consumers}} in {{a member state}} exceed €100,000, the exporting vendor is required to charge VAT at the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> in the importing member state. If a supplier provides a distant sales service to several EU member states, a separate accounting of sold goods in regards to VAT calculation is required. The supplier then must seek a VAT registration (and charge applicable rate) in each such country where the volume of sales in any 12 consecutive months exceeds local threshold.|$|E

5000|$|In recent years, a {{reduction}} in the tax <b>rates</b> <b>applicable</b> to capital gains and received dividends payments, has significantly reduced the tax burden on income generated from savings and investing. An argument is often made that these types of income are not generally received by low-income taxpayers, and so this sort of [...] "tax break" [...] is anti-progressive. Further clouding the issue of progressivity is that far more deductions and tax credits are available to higher-income taxpayers.|$|R

50|$|Goods {{imported}} from non-member states {{are subject to}} VAT at the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> in the member state into which the goods are imported, {{regardless of whether the}} goods are received for consideration and regardless of who imports the goods. VAT is generally charged at the border, {{at the same time as}} customs duty and using the price determined by customs. However, as a result of the action of EU administrative VAT relief, an exception called Low Value Consignment Relief is allowed on shipments of a low value.|$|E

In {{addition}} to one diploma/degree holder working on contract {{at the level of}} the Village Panchayat, there is a system of accredited engineers. Such engineers are drawn from amongst retired engineers, staff working in Engineering Colleges, Polytechnics/ ITIs, engineers working in NGOs etc. These engineers are paid for their work, at rates fixed by Government. The engineer from a government department or agency, willing to help the Village Panchayat over and above his normal work, is allowed and paid at 50% of the <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> to others.|$|E
5000|$|If the Roth IRA owner {{expects that}} the tax <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> to {{withdrawals}} from a traditional IRA in retirement will be higher than the tax <b>rate</b> <b>applicable</b> to the funds earned to make the Roth IRA contributions before retirement, then {{there may be a}} tax advantage to making contributions to a Roth IRA over a traditional IRA or similar vehicle while working. There is no current tax deduction, but money going into the Roth IRA is taxed at the taxpayer's current marginal tax rate, and will not be taxed at the expected higher future effective tax rate when it comes out of the Roth IRA. There is always risk, however, that retirement savings will be less than anticipated, which would produce a lower tax rate for distributions in retirement. Assuming substantially equivalent tax rates, this is largely a question of age. For example, at the age of 20, one is likely to be in a low tax bracket, and if one is already saving for retirement at that age, the income in retirement is quite likely to qualify for a higher rate, but at the age of 55, one may be in peak earning years and likely to be taxed at a higher tax rate, so retirement income would tend to be lower than income at this age and therefore taxed at a lower rate.|$|E

Tax law may provide for different treatment (from GAAP) of items of income and expenses {{as a result of}} tax policy. The differences may be of permanent or temporary nature. Permanent items are in the form of non taxable income and non taxable expenses. Things such as expenses considered not deductible by taxing authorities ("add backs"), the range of tax <b>rates</b> <b>applicable</b> to various levels of income, different tax rates in different jurisdictions, multiple layers of tax on income, and other issues.|$|R
