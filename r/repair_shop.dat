5|$|The owner at {{the time}} of the building's {{nomination}} to the National Register of Historic Places, Phil Becker, grew up living on Mazon Street (Illinois Route 17). He had been hanging out at the station since he was nine and began working at the station in 1964. One year after Becker's employment began, Ambler sold the station to Earl Kochler. Kochler sold the station to Royce McBeath, who ran it between 19651970. The station changed hands once again when Becker bought the station from McBeath on March 4, 1970. About a year after Becker took over operation of the station, Texaco suddenly stopped supplying the location with gasoline and Becker contracted with Marathon Oil. The brand change was accompanied by a name change to Becker's Marathon Gas Station, a name the station would be known by for over 26years. Becker operated the station, along with his wife Debbie, from the time of purchase until 1996. After closing the station, the couple leased the building out as an auto <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> and eventually donated the building to the village of Dwight.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub {{with a focus on}} the Digital Creative sector. As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> built in 1887.
