2500|$|Mario Cárdenas Guillén, {{wearing a}} black {{bullet-proof}} vest and flanked by two ski-masked marines, was presented on national television on 4 September 2012. According to reports issued by the Mexican Navy, Cárdenas Guillén was arrested a day before {{in the city of}} Altamira, Tamaulipas. At the time of his arrest, Cárdenas Guillén was carrying a rifle in front of a building entrance, along with $10,000 in cash, <b>radiocommunication</b> <b>equipment,</b> ammunition, several credit cards, and four envelopes containing cocaine. The arrest of Mario is one of the [...] "highest-profile arrests in months" [...] and a powerful blow to the Gulf Cartel, which lost much of its influence after it separated from Los Zetas in early 2010.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the electromagnetic (EM) radiofrequency (RF) radiation hazards onboard a ship arising from shipboard <b>radiocommunication</b> and navigation <b>equipment.</b> EM field effect on personnel and equipment can be harmful if field levels exceed the threshold values. These fields {{need to be}} controlled for proper protection. Ships are equipped with lots of EM RF radiation sources with different frequencies and output power levels. Typical shipboard EM RF radiation sources include: terrestrial radiocommunication transmitters, navigational radars and satellite ship earth stations (SES). Examples of these sources are analyzed in the paper. EM field estimation using simple worst-case calculation is given for a typical HF transmitter, X-band navigational radar and the Inmarsat SES A, B, C, F and M. The estimation problems are discussed. The calculation results are compared with international civil and military standards. The results show that potential hazards exist and that {{a reasonable amount of}} caution is needed...|$|R

Following a cross layer approach, interoperability test purposes on <b>radiocommunication</b> <b>equipment,</b> networking layer algorithms, C 2 X applications and use cases are analyzed. Along with this analysis the main conclusions {{gathered from the}} execution of the proposed test cases on a concrete C 2 X prototype system will be presented...|$|E
