40|$|CD-Rom included; A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MSc in Computer ScienceABSTRACT International telecommunication has become a very important sector in the present day communication. IDD traffic {{is one of the}} main sources of revenue for national telecommunication service providers (Telcos). Hence, it has to be managed properly and driven effectively to gain maximum profit. / Telco’s usually deal with multiple international operators (carriers) e. g. SingTel, Telstra, in order to use latter's networks for international traffic. These carriers offer different charging structures which vary with the time, volume and the destination. Most Telcos incur high costs due to lack of a proper system to analyse and forecast an optimized IDD <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> / Therefore, a system which is capable of producing a cost-effective <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> by analyzing the current IDD usage pattern and the traffic cost would be much beneficial for all Telco’s. The objective of this research work is to find a suitable methodology for Telcos to produce a cost-effective <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> for the IDD traffic in near real time. In our approach, the main tasks are, • Forecasting the IDD traffic pattern to each destination • Determining the optimized <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> Forecasting the future traffic was based on past traffic, current IDD traffic trend and the subscriber growth rate of Telcos. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to obtain the optimized <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> Dynamic behavior of the problem domain was successfully addressed in the GA structure. / The GA parameters, population size, number of generations and the GA operations (crossover, mutation and reproduction) ratio were determined experimentally. Experimental results show that our solution is capable of producing a cost-effective <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> in near-real-time which reduces the cost by 30 % to 50 % against the manual <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> Our solution could be used by national Telco’s to save significant costs in the international traffic and to pass some of that cost savings to their customers...|$|R

40|$|In nearly {{saturated}} station {{areas the}} limited capacity {{is one of}} the main reasons of delay propagation. Spreading the trains well in time and space in these areas has a big impact on the passenger robustness, i. e. the total travel time in practice of all passengers in the railway network in case of frequently occurring small delays. We focus on improving the performance in the bottleneck of the network in order to improve the performance of the whole railway network. This paper proposes a method that builds from scratch a <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> and a cyclic timetable that optimizes the infrastructure occupation and the passenger robustness. An integer linear routing model assigns, without considering a timetable, every train to a route such that the maximal node usage is minimized and that the number of times that each node is used, is quadratically penalized. Thereafter, a mixed integer linear timetabling model assigns to each train the blocking times at which the nodes on its route, assigned by the routing model, are reserved and released. Different from other approaches is that we focus on the occupation of the railway infrastructure before constructing the timetable. The approach is validated on the complex railway station area of Brussels (Belgium). Our <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> and timetable from scratch improve the passenger robustness up to 11 % compared to a reference timetable and <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> composed by the Belgian railway infrastructure manager Infrabel and by up to 2 % compared to a reference timetable and <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> from literature. status: publishe...|$|R

It is for searching linked data sources on the web. There is a method for computing top-k <b>routing</b> <b>plans</b> based on their potentials to contain results for a given keyword query. Keywords and the data elements mentioning them are related by using a keyword-element relationship. A multilevel scoring mechanism is for computing the relevance of <b>routing</b> <b>plans</b> based on scores at the level of keywords, data elements, element sets, and subgraphs that connect these elements. Experiments carried out using 150 publicly available sources on the web showed that valid plans (precision@ 1 of 0. 92) that are highly relevant (mean reciprocal rank of 0. 89) can be computed in 1 second on average on a single PC. However, queries with more keywords could not be handled efficiently. For instance, queries with more than two keywords needed several seconds up to one minute. Thus, while this setting produced results of highest quality, it is not really affordable in a typical web scenario demanding high responsiveness.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} {{study is to}} solve the {{multi-modal}} transportation <b>routing</b> <b>planning</b> problem that aims to select an optimal route to move a consignment of goods from its origin to its destination through the multi-modal transportation network. And the optimization is from two viewpoints including cost and time. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the multi-modal transportation <b>routing</b> <b>planning</b> problem. Minimizing the total transportation cost and the total transportation time are set as the optimization objectives of the model. In order to balance the benefit between the two objectives, Pareto optimality is utilized to solve the model by gaining its Pareto frontier. The Pareto frontier of the model can provide the multi-modal transportation operator (MTO) and customers with better decision support and it is gained by the normalized normal constraint method. Then, an experimental case study is designed to verify the feasibility of the model and Pareto optimality by using the mathematical programming software Lingo. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the demand and supply in the multi-modal transportation organization is performed based on the designed case. Findings: The calculation {{results indicate that the}} proposed model and Pareto optimality have good performance in dealing with the bi-objective optimization. The sensitivity analysis also shows the influence of the variation of the demand and supply on the multi-modal transportation organization clearly. Therefore, this method can be further promoted to the practice.
