5|$|It {{was played}} between Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona, at the Camp Nou, the latter club's home ground. Barcelona won the match 3–1, {{achieving}} their record 27th {{title in the}} competition. Lionel Messi and Neymar gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead at half time, and although Athletic <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goal by Iñaki Williams, Messi scored another goal late on to confirm his team's victory.

5|$|Within {{the naval}} bureaus, however, {{there was still}} much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone {{continued}} to lobby the General Board while C protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns—and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> design of his own creation, which he called USS Possible and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims, {{who was able to}} cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.|$|E

5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Alloa faced another away game, {{this time}} at fellow Second Division club Ross County. George Shaw scored to give Ross County a 1–0 lead before half-time and Alloa {{equalised}} late {{in the second half}} through Mark Donaghy in the 82nd minute which made the score 1–1 to force extra time. Willie Irvine scored the winner for Alloa in the 113th minute to send the club through to the semi-finals. With the last four clubs left in the tournament, Alloa was drawn against local rival Stirling Albion with both clubs aiming to reach the first national cup final in their history. Stirling took the lead in the first half but were reduced to 10-men after Chris Wood was sent off in the 71st minute. Alloa <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goal from Scott Bannerman and then a penalty in the 80th minute from Willie Irvine to win 2–1 and reach the final.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1653, {{the peasants}} {{delivered}} ultimatums to Bern and Lucerne and raised 16,000 troops. When {{the city of}} Bern <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> protest note, the peasants marched to Bern {{under the leadership of}} Leuenberger, arriving on May 22, 1653. A second army led by Emmenegger laid siege to Lucerne. The city authorities were unprepared for an armed conflict and immediately engaged in negotiations. Within days, peace agreements were concluded. In the peace on the Murifeld (Murifeldfrieden, named after the field just outside Bern where the peasant army's camp lay) signed by Leuenberger and the mayor of Bern, Niklaus Dachselhofer, the city council of Bern promised on May 28, 1653, to fulfill the peasants' fiscal demands in return for the dissolution of the Huttwil League. In view of this development, the city of Lucerne and the besieging peasants agreed on a truce. Leuenberger's army lifted the siege of Bern and retreated, but the people refused to follow their leaders and objected to dissolving the Huttwil League.|$|E
5|$|As the IX Corps {{gave up on}} Triangle Hill, the PVA 31st Division of the 12th Corps was in {{position}} to take back Sniper Ridge. Under the cover of inclement weather, an assault was launched by the 92nd Regiment at 4pm on November 11. The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment, but Chung Il-kwon immediately <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> counterattack by the ROK 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12. After two hours of fighting, the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment recaptured two-thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment. The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14, but the ROK 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to blunt the attack. By November 17, {{with the help of}} the ROK 1st Field Artillery Group, the ROK 2nd Battalion returned to the 1st Battalion's original position after a two-hour battle. Undeterred by heavy casualties, the PVA 106th Regiment of the 34th Division, 12th Corps relieved the weakened 93rd Regiment during the night of November18. For the next six days, 'seesaw' fighting continued on Sniper Ridge. By November 25, the ROK 2nd Infantry Division was relieved by the ROK 9th Infantry Division on Sniper Ridge and the fighting finally died down.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 {{as if trying}} a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the secondquarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime. The secondhalf was dominated by Texas as they scored fiveunanswered touchdowns to win the game.

5|$|The 2006 Gator Bowl {{began on}} January 2, 2006, at 12:30p.m. EST in Jacksonville.

Tech's offense <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> field goal, but Louisville was able to add another touchdown {{before the end of the}} quarter, extending its lead to 14–3. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech fought back and narrowed Louisville's lead to a single touchdown. At halftime, the score was 17–10 in Louisville's favor. In the second half, Virginia Tech's offense began to have success. Tech earned the only points of the third quarter—a 28-yard field goal from kicker Brandon Pace—to narrow Louisville's lead to 17–13. In the fourth quarter, the game fully turned in the Hokies' favor. Though Louisville scored a touchdown early in the quarter, Virginia Tech scored 22unanswered points in the final 13minutes of the game to take a 35–24 lead and earn the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle the American wounded were loaded onto wagons and carried back to Fort Harrison for medical care. Most of the militia was {{released}} from duty on November 9 and returned home, {{but many of the}} long-time soldiers remained in the area a bit longer. In his initial report to Secretary William Eustis, Harrison informed him of a battle having occurred near the Tippecanoe River, giving the battle the river's name; he added that he feared an imminent reprisal. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the United States victory clear, and the defeat of Tecumseh's confederacy became more certain when no second attack occurred. Eustis <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lengthy note demanding to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp. Harrison replied that he had considered the position strong enough without fortification. This dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War; as a result, he resigned from the army in 1814.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E

5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spirited run by Ellison, but {{he failed to}} break through the Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
5|$|In March 1622, {{governor}} of Yucatán Diego de Cardenas ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano {{to launch an}} assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, {{where there was a}} lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king <b>replied</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, {{but as soon as the}} Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods, with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town. After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.|$|E

Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum, and killed them all. Spanish reinforcements arrived too late. A number of local Maya men and women were killed by Spanish attackers, who also burned the town.|$|E
