40|$|The Oil Spill <b>Response</b> Cost-Effectiveness Analytical Tool (OSRCEAT) was {{developed}} to compare costs of <b>response</b> to benefits of <b>response</b> for hypothetical or actual oil spills. The web-based analytical tool can assist spill responders and contingency planners in decision-making processes and act as a basis of discussion in for evaluating <b>response</b> options. With user input on spill parameters, location, and <b>response</b> options, OSRCEAT calculates <b>response</b> cost, costs of environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the oil, and <b>response</b> impacts. Oil damages without any <b>response</b> are contrasted to oil damages with <b>response</b> (improvements that <b>response</b> offers). <b>Response</b> damages are subtracted from difference in damages with and without <b>response</b> to derive the <b>response</b> benefit. <b>Response</b> cost can then be compared to <b>response</b> benefit. The user can test various <b>response</b> options to compare potential <b>response</b> benefits so as to maximizing <b>response</b> benefit.

40|$|An {{intrusion}} <b>response</b> decision-making model {{based on}} hierarchical task network (HTN) planning {{is presented in}} the paper. Compared with other <b>response</b> decision-making models, the <b>response</b> decision-making model consists of not only the <b>response</b> measure decision-making process but also <b>response</b> time decision-making process that is firstly proposed in the paper. The <b>response</b> time decision-making model is able to determine <b>response</b> time for different <b>response</b> HTN subtasks. Owing to the introduction of the <b>response</b> time decision-making, the intrusion <b>response</b> system can apply different <b>response</b> strategies to achieve different <b>response</b> goals set by administrators. The proposed <b>response</b> measure decision-making model can optimize a <b>response</b> plan by balancing the <b>response</b> effectiveness and the <b>response</b> negative impact in both a single <b>response</b> measure and a set of <b>response</b> measures. The <b>response</b> decision-making model is self-adaptive and has the ability of tolerating to false positive IDS alerts. The proposed model has been used in the intrusion detection alert management and intrusion <b>response</b> system (IDAM 2 ̆ 6 IRS) developed by us. The functions and architecture of IDAM 2 ̆ 6 IRS are introduced in this paper.

Recently, theauthorsdevelopeda suite of linear <b>response</b> algorithms for low frequency <b>response</b> of large scale climate dynamics {{to external}} perturbation, including the novel blended <b>response</b> algorithmwhich combines the geometrically exact general <b>response</b> formula using integration of a linear tangent model at short <b>response</b> times, and the classical quasi-Gaussian <b>response</b> algorithm at longer <b>response</b> times, overcoming numerical instability of the tangent linear model for longer times due to positive Lyapunov exponents.
