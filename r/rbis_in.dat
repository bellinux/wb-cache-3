5|$|Flick {{was known}} {{predominantly}} for his solid batting and speed. He led the National League in <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> 1900, {{and led the}} American League in stolen bases in 1904 and 1906, and in batting average in 1905.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, in Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols {{became the}} first player to get at least four hits, two home runs, and five <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a World Series game in a 16–7 victory over the Rangers. Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored, and six <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in {{baseball}} history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), {{became the first}} player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBIs the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, in a 10–5 {{win over}} the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Posey hit two three-run home runs {{en route to a}} career-high six runs batted in. It is the second most <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a single game by a Giants catcher in the San Francisco Era.|$|E

5|$|After {{enduring}} {{seven months}} of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> {{a game against the}} Oakland Athletics. That personal best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager Billy Martin's Twins won the new American League West division as a result.|$|E
5|$|Playing as the Rays' primary catcher, on April 4 he went 2-5 with {{a three-run}} homer in a win over the Texas Rangers. Two weeks later he hit two home runs with six <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a 16-1 win over the New York Yankees. In May, Hanigan, plagued for nearly two weeks by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28. On June 17 he had a home run and a walk against the Baltimore Orioles, but he then missed several more games due to neck stiffness and later with soreness in his left side.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{also holds}} the single-season {{record for most}} unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley {{is also known as}} the only man to be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was not looking. He had over 100 <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player in {{baseball}} history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.|$|E

He ended the season with the Tampa Smokers, and had 28 home runs in 113 between the three teams.|$|E
5|$|The final {{series of}} the home stand {{featured}} the Washington Nationals. After Burnett's poor pitching led some {{to suggest that he}} would retire after the season, he dominated game one by striking out 12 batters and allowing one run in seven innings for a 3–2 win. The Phillies' success continued the next day, when Sandberg started Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf in place of Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Ruf and Galvis combined for four hits, two runs and three <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a 4–3 victory. The team swept the series when Sizemore entered the game as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning, and his two-run homer helped the Phillies to an 8–4 final score.|$|E

5|$|David Price {{recorded}} the first complete {{game in a}} tie-breaker game since Al Leiter in 1999. The game counted as a regular season game in baseball statistics. For example, Evan Longoria's third-inning home run broke Stan Musial's record for the most home runs in the last game of the season, setting the mark at seven. He went 3-for-4 with a double, a home run, and two RBI in the game overall. This left him 11-for-19 with seven home runs and ten <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> season finales from 2009–2013. Tampa Bay's win clinched the team's fourth post-season berth in franchise history. The Rays played the Cleveland Indians in the American League Wild Card Game and advanced to the American League Division Series (ALDS) with a 4-0 win. However, the Rays lost to the eventual World Series champions, the Boston Red Sox in the ALDS, 3 games to 1.|$|E
5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch with nobody out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway in the bottom of the 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E
25|$|On June 27 of that year, in {{the first}} game of a two-stadium, day-night doubleheader against the Yankees, Carlos Delgado scores 9 RBIs ({{including}} a grand slam) in a 15–6 victory for the Mets, setting a team record for most <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a single game and tying the record for most <b>RBIs</b> <b>in</b> a single game by a visiting player at Yankee Stadium. For just the second time, the Mets won the season series against the Yankees, 4–2, including the Mets' only sweep at the old Yankee Stadium.|$|E

5000|$|That {{earned him}} a September call-up to the majors in 1990, where he batted [...]231/.362/.231 with no homers and one <b>RBI.</b> <b>In</b> 1991, Gómez became the Orioles' {{everyday}} third baseman though he spent June back in Rochester (.257/~.359/.495), batting [...]233/.302/.409 for the O's with 16 HR's and 45 <b>RBI</b> <b>in</b> 118 games.

25|$|The 1988 Game was {{surrounded}} by tacit accusations against Oakland A's fans of stuffing the ballot box in favor of catcher Terry Steinbach, whose qualifications as a starter were questioned by some sportswriters.
