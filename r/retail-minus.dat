40|$|In this paper, two {{instruments}} of access price regulation, cost-based and <b>retail-minus,</b> are {{compared with the}} full deregulation hypothesis. For this purpose, a model that considers an upstream monopolist firm that sells a vital input to an independent firm and to a subsidiary firm in the downstream market is developed. The main conclusion of the paper is that <b>retail-minus</b> regulation avoids foreclosure and leads to better results than cost-based regulation in terms of investment level and consumer surplus. Moreover, <b>retail-minus</b> regulation allows a higher consumer surplus than deregulation of access price {{as long as the}} regulator carefully defines the <b>retail-minus</b> instrument.

40|$|Forward-looking {{long run}} average {{incremental}} cost (LRAIC) bottom-up models have now established {{themselves as a}} popular methodology to guide European telecommunications regulators' setting of interconnection charges between the incumbent and other operators. The {{purpose of this article}} is to discuss the adequacy of using bottom-up LRAIC models or <b>retail-minus</b> to calculate bitstream access charges [...] the charges typically applicable to wholesale xDSL services. In particular, the author is interested in the cost drivers of such services, how different they are from circuit-switched voice services, and ultimately whether <b>retail-minus</b> should be preferred over LRAIC models when setting these bitstream charges.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the anticipated economic effects {{arising from the}} introduction of the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) system in the mobile communications service market. For the analysis, actual data (or estimated data) [...] such as price elasticity, the number of subscribers, traffic volume, rate, and access charge [...] were combined with an assumption about a competition scenario in the future market. Based on this analysis, consumer surplus, and change in the service provider's profits were estimated according to the type of policy that may be adopted for the MVNO system by the regulator. The results of the analysis indicate that consumer surplus appears to increase largely because of the reduction of the mobile service rate by the promotion of "service-based competition," which occurs upon adoption of an MVNO policy in the mobile communication service market. Moreover, the introduction of an MVNO system into the mobile communication market seems to be socially beneficial regardless of policy type if access charges are set reasonably by a cost-plus or <b>retail-minus</b> method. In particular, in order {{to make sense of the}} introduction of a special MVNO, whether by the cost-plus method or the <b>retail-minus</b> method, the correct discount rate must be used in setting an access charge between the special MVNO and the significant market power (SMP) mobile network operator (MNO).

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of fixed network liberalisation in Europe in the late 1990 s, the main concern of regulators was to lower retail call prices. This was done by introducing wholesale regulation and promoting service-based competition. Some years later, the concern of some regulators turned from too high retail call prices to too low call prices, which might 'squeeze' entrants {{out of the market}}. This paper looks at a simple model in which this development is explained by increasing competitive pressure from an 'outside opportunity', most notably mobile telephony and cable. It is concluded that a margin squeeze is not necessarily used by the incumbent as a device to drive competitors out of the market and to increase market power but can also result from increased inter-modal competition. If this is the case, it is argued that the appropriate response would be deregulation or - under particular circumstances - a switch from cost-oriented access prices to alternatives such as <b>retail-minus</b> or capacity-based interconnection.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the effects of {{different}} forms of wholesale and retail regulation on retail competition in fixed network telephony markets. We explicitly model two asymmetries between the incumbent operator {{and a group of}} homogenous entrants: (i) while the incumbent has zero marginal costs, the entrant has the wholesale access charge as (positive) marginal costs; (ii) while the incumbent sets a two-part tariff at the retail level (fixed fee and calls price), the entrant can only set a linear price for calls. We model the product of the incumbent as horizontally differentiated from the products of the entrants, who are homogenous and do not have any market power. Competition from other infrastructures such as mobile telephony or cable is modelled as an outside opportunity for consumers. We find that entrants without market power might be subject to a margin squeeze if the wholesale access price is set at average costs and competitive pressure from other infrastructures increases. We argue that wholesale price regulation at average costs is not optimal in such a situation and discuss other forms of cost-based regulation, <b>retail-minus</b> and deregulation as potential alternatives. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasingly}} observable {{excess capacity}} in the fixed networks {{calls into question the}} established long-standing pricing standards for wholesale services based on forward-looking long-run incremental costs (FL-LRAIC). The FL-LRAIC standard has worked quite well in expanding markets, although even there price-squeeze problems have appeared. In contracting markets the price-squeeze issue, however, becomes paramount and lower prices both at the wholesale and retail levels would be efficient. This would favor a <b>retail-minus</b> approach (RM) under long-term contraction. Because both expansion and contraction could be relevant in the future, we propose an optional approach based on the wholesale price formula p = min(FL-LRAIC, RM). This will generally protect alternative competitors against price-squeeze {{while at the same time}} allowing the fixed-network incumbent full downward price flexibility. It also protects alternative competitors and end users against excessively high prices. Hence, implementing this option successfully at wholesale level would eliminate the need to regulate retail markets. The combination of RM and FL-LRAIC seems to be most realistic, because it is relatively simple and internationally partly tested already. We show that this option is superior to FL-LRAIC or RM alone and to other approaches, such as short-run marginal costs. We also consider a possible combination with capacity-based charging, which may have particular merits for converged services in next generation networks (NGNs).

40|$|We {{examine a}} {{situation}} where asymmetric MNOs (Mobile Network Operators) are competing a la Cournot and a potential MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) is attempting to enter the market by purchasing a wholesale service from one of MNOs. We present two scenarios: (1) if the MVNO can choose the wholesale service provider first and a bargaining game is {{used to determine the}} wholesale price, the most efficient (largest) MNO is chosen as the wholesale provider; or (2) if the MNOs play an auction game to determine the wholesale provider and the wholesale price at the same time, the outcome depends on the MNOs cost difference. Regarding the cost difference, (a) if the MNOs cost difference is large, the most efficient MNO will become the wholesale provider, and (b) if the cost difference is small, any MNO can become the wholesale provider. In any case, the wholesale price is determined at each providers monopoly level and does not fall to the marginal cost level. Furthermore, we show that if the MVNOs efficiency level is low and/or the MNOs have been colluding to restrict outputs, the MNOs have an incentive to (collectively or individually) refuse to provide wholesale service. This situation calls for a policy of mandating wholesale provisions. Additionally, we show that the <b>retail-minus</b> regulation - the simple form of the ECPR (Efficient Component Pricing Rule) - is more favorable to MNOs compared with the complicated ECPR form and that the retail price is lower under the complicated ECPR form. ...|$|E
