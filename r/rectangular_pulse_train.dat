40|$|Injected {{beam energy}} and energy spread are {{critical}} parameters affecting {{the performance of}} our rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS). A real-time energy monitoring system is being installed to examine the H- beam out of the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) 50 MeV linac. The 200 MHz Alvarez linac serves as the injector for the 450 MeV IPNS RCS. The linac provides an 80 ms macropulse of approximately 3 x 1012 H- ions 30 times per second for coasting-beam injection into the RCS. The RCS delivers protons to a heavy-metal spallation neutron target for material science studies. Using a number of strip-line beam position monitors (BPMs) distributed along the 50 MeV transport line from the linac to the RCS, fast signals from the strip lines are digitized and transferred to a computer which performs an FFT.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to investigate the effect of electrical stimulation of different subcortical structures (dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, midbrain reticular formation, medial forebrain bundle, lateral septum, olfactory bulb) on the lordosis reflex and limbic electrical activity in the female rat. Electrical stimulation to the female rat was applied by experimenter for two or three seconds just before the male rat's mount during sexual behavior. The parameter of electrical stimulation was <b>rectangular</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> with 100 Hz, 0. 1 msec, and about 100, μA. The summary of the results is shown below. 1) The lordosis reflex was significantly suppressed by stimulation of lateral septum. It might be considered that lateral septum exerted a strong inhibitory influence on the lordosis reflex in the female rat. 2) Desynchronization of dorsal hippocampal activity and high voltage burst activity of amygdala were elicited by stimulation of lateral septum. These EEG changes synchronized and increased in duration as intensity of stimulation increased. 3) Dorsal hippocampal desynchronizations were observed in either case whether lordosis reflex was disturbed or not by stimulation of lateral septum. But the significant difference was not recognized between these desynchronization patterns. Consequently it seemed to suggest that the timing of application of septal stimulation was very important. 4) Though hippocampal desynchronization increased in duration as the intensity of septal stimulation increased, the inhibitory offect of lateral septum on lordosis reflex seemed to be constant as a general rule. Consequently, there was no evident correlation between the duration of hippocampal desynchronization and inhibitory effect of lateral septum on lordosis reflex. (Received October 16, 1981...|$|E

The bilayers were exposed to a train of sixteen 100 - s duration pulses. Threshold voltage and the sequence number of the <b>pulse</b> in the <b>train,</b> where onset of the electroporation occurred, were recorded for six inter-pulse intervals (, 1000 s, 100 s, 10 s, 1 s, 0 s). The threshold voltage of the <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> decreased linearly with the logarithm of the inter-pulse interval. When the inter-pulse interval was 1 m, electroporation threshold dropped {{to that of a}} single pulse with duration 1600 s (equal to the sum of all pulse durations in the train). In this case, the occurrence of bilayer rupture was almost equally frequent for all <b>pulses</b> in the <b>train.</b> When the inter-pulse interval between the pulses exceeded 1 s, the influence of the previous pulse on the response to the following pulse declined. It became more likely that the bilayer ruptured {{during the first half of}} the train.
