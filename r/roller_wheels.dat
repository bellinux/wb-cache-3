50|$|A roller {{container}} is {{a container}} type {{that can be}} carried by trucks to be pushed to ground level by help of a hook and level arm with the container possibly sliding on steel <b>roller</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
50|$|As in all funiculars, on the Gubałówka, a {{continuous}} steel cable {{is attached to}} a pair of tram-like carriages set at a steep angle on narrow gauge rails. These two carriages travel up and down the steep mountain slope, the ascending and descending vehicles counterbalancing each other in turn. The line is single, apart from one automatically controlled passing place situated roughly halfway up. The cable runs between the rails, guided by numerous <b>roller</b> <b>wheels.</b> Street style lighting is provided along the whole length of the line.|$|E
50|$|The DIN roller {{containers}} have a hook that {{is directed}} 45° upwards with the handle bar positioned at {{a height of}} 1570 mm. The <b>roller</b> <b>wheels</b> have an inner distance of 1560 mm and an outer distance of 2160 mm. The width of the containers does mostly follow intermodal shipping containers and there are undercarriage frames available for twenty-foot containers to be handled as a roller container. The length of DIN roller containers is standardized in steps of 250 mm from an overall length of 4000 to 7000 mm. The height has not been standardized and roller containers are commonly not used for stacking.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of roller based manual lawn edgers. Both are driven by pushing a <b>roller</b> <b>wheel</b> along a hard surface {{adjacent}} to the lawn edge. One type causes a solid steel cutting disc to cut {{the edge of the}} lawn. The other type causes two star spoked discs to rotate against each other shear cutting the edge of the lawn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{program was}} {{involved}} in NBC's first cross-game promotion, held on St. Patrick's Day in 1975 and called [...] "Shamrock Sweepstakes". Players from NBC's six daytime game shows at the time (Sweepstakes, High <b>Rollers,</b> <b>Wheel</b> of Fortune, Hollywood Squares, Jackpot!, and Blank Check) answered a set of questions dealing with Ireland and Irish/Irish-American people; {{the one who got}} the most correct won $100,000.|$|R
50|$|According to Bennetts and others, {{the rear}} tire may be {{constructed}} of polyurethane by a <b>roller</b> coaster <b>wheel</b> manufacturer.|$|R
5000|$|There is an {{additional}} term [...] "hooklift container" [...] that {{is related to the}} common designation of the hoist gear on trucks used for roller containers to be called [...] "hook lift". This has influenced languages like Dutch where the truck is called haakarmvoertuig (hook arm vehicle) and the container being a haakarmbak (hook arm pod). These terms refer to the level arm that matches with the grip hook on the container to lift it from the ground. Note that the term hooklift container may refer to any container type with {{an additional}} hook bar which does not necessarily include <b>roller</b> <b>wheels</b> - this includes the NATO standard STANAG 2413 variations of 20' ISO containers having an additional hook bar.|$|E
50|$|Fine {{pulverized}} coal exits the outlet section through multiple discharge coal pipes {{leading to the}} burners, while oversized coal particles are rejected {{and returned to the}} grinding zone for further grinding.Pyrites and extraneous dense impurity material fall through the nozzle ring and are plowed, by scraper blades attached to the grinding table, into the pyrites chamber to be removed.Mechanically, the vertical roller mill is categorized as an applied force mill. There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the <b>roller</b> <b>wheels</b> provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E
40|$|Anovel {{materials}} handling system {{is being developed}} at Carnegie Mellon University's Mechanical Engineering Department. This systems contains an array of cells, {{each of which has}} two actuators. The two actuators are orthogonally oriented motorized <b>roller</b> <b>wheels</b> which, in combination, can generate a vector of motion in any planar direction. This work develops control laws for transporting and manipulating objects which rest on the array. Towards this goal, we consider the dynamics of parcel transport and manipulation. The parcel dynamics are based on an exact discrete representation of the system, unlike other methods where a continuity assumption is made. Two types of contact models are considered. This work extends the previous one-dimensional discrete model into two-dimensions...|$|E

2500|$|The first skateboards {{started with}} wooden boxes, or boards, with <b>roller</b> skate <b>wheels</b> {{attached}} to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate {{attached to the}} nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today. An American WAC, Betty Magnuson, reported seeing French children in the Montmartre section of Paris riding on boards with <b>roller</b> skate <b>wheels</b> attached to them in late 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Steel <b>roller</b> coaster <b>wheels</b> {{are made}} with {{polyurethane}} which increase ride efficiency and have no chemical bond to the rail. Steel <b>roller</b> coaster <b>wheel</b> assemblies can change slightly with different manufacturers. A {{good example of this}} is the difference between B&M's track style and Arrow's. On B&M's coasters, the trains have their side friction wheels {{on the outside of the}} track, allowing the rails to connect from their inner edges. On Arrow coasters, the train has side friction wheels on the inside of the track, so the rail connectors must [...] "wrap around" [...] the outside of the rail and under the train.|$|R

40|$|A {{device for}} {{stringing}} rackets for {{sports such as}} tennis, squash and badminton, said device being used in particular for threading in the strings in the provided bores of the racket and for pulling through the threaded string, consists of a feed unit and a guide unit acting with the former. The feed unit is designed either as a drivable roller or belt conveyor, whereby two <b>roller</b> <b>wheels</b> or continuous belts which are provided with a centre groove running along the perimeter and which is retained against a common frame {{so that they can}} be brought together friction-tight. The guide unit has gripping elements which are designed as releasable funnel-shaped guide jaws. The feed and guide units can be arranged together on a handling system for the partial or fully automatic stringing of rackets for ball sports...|$|E
40|$|Army {{tractors}} such as {{this were}} used to haul heavy artillery and long trains of supply wagons over the roads of France and Germany. They could jog along at a lively rate, and no load seemed too heavy for them. It was no unusual sight to see one coming along {{with a string of}} vicious-looking French 75 's (75 mm. rapid fire guns), or a long line of transport wagons attached to it Apparently these tractors could go anywhere, no matter what the nature of the ground. It seems incredible that one could climb a steep bank like the one before us, yet they could, and did. As the large sprocket wheels at the ends of the machine turn, the tractor goes forward, laying down its own track as it moves. The "track" is composed of flat pieces of steel attached to the endless chain tread with which the running gear of the machine is equipped. The small <b>roller</b> <b>wheels</b> beneath the channel bar section of the frame carry the load of the tractor. In the distance can be seen the city of Koblenz, at the confluence of the Rhine and the Moselle. It is a beautiful city, with wide, clean streets and substantial stone buildings. Charming pleasure gardens, the Rhein-Anlagen, lie along the river front, which is further embellishe d by princely homes. The river sweeping off in a wide curve to the right is the Moselle. In midstream one can see one of the tows so common on the Rhine. The current of both rivers is very swift, yet most of the traffic is done by barges, which must be towed up the rivers by powerful tugs, Of the Rhine itself a mere strip can be seen over the front of the tractor, and beyond this strip, barely discernible, the colossal statue to William 1 st, the first Emperor of Germany...|$|E
