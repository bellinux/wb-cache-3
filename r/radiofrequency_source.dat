40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{report the}} {{outcomes}} of non-endoscopic percutaneous cervical discectomy by anterior blunt approach {{for the treatment of}} degenerative disc disease. Methods: A review of the medical records of patients with axial cervical pain resulting from degenerative disc disease and treated with discectomy and percutaneous nucleoplasty by anterior blunt approach with <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>source</b> was carried out. The data were evaluated according to modified MacNab and pre- and postoperative VAS criteria at 3, 12 and 24 months. Results: Sixty-two procedures were performed in 48 patients between 2008 and 2014. The mean age of the population was 52. 4 years. MacNab results were 84. 6 %, 92. 3 %, and 89. 2 % improvement (excellent and good results) at 3, 12 and 24 months, respectively. The VAS changed from 7. 4 to 2. 3 two years after the procedure, showing a statistically significant difference (p= 0. 000). There were no major complications or re-interventions related to the technique. Conclusions: Anterior non-endoscopic discectomy and nucleoplasty for the treatment of discogenic axial cervical pain may be an effective alternative to open surgery. In the two-year follow-up, our blunt technique proved to be a safe procedure with no approach-related complications, and provided outcomes comparable to those reported using the original needle technique...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a {{preliminary}} investigation of the enhanced cyclotron radi-ation observed in the afterglow of our experimental electron-cyclotron discharge appa-ratus. l A low-density (~ 108 /cc) plasma is produced by RF breakdown of low-pressure hydrogen gas in a cylindrical microwave cavity. The plasma is confined by a mirror mag-netic field (mirror ratio = 3) of such value that the exciting RF frequency equals the local electron-cyclotron frequency at certain points within the cavity. Excitation at the cyclo-tron frequency produces a hot-electron plasma with observed energies around 20 - 40 keV. The <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>source</b> is a magnetron producing 1 -jisec pulses at ~ 3 kMc. The source is operated with repetition rate of 1 kc, and at power levels of ~ 100 kW peak (100 watts average). A more complete description of the apparatus and the plasma that it produces has been reported previously. In all of the observations reported here, the excitation frequency is 2. 85 kMc, and the background pressure of hydrogen is 2 x 10 - 5 Torr.

40|$|The {{exposure}} {{of a subject}} in the far field of <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>sources</b> operating in the 10 - 900 -MHz range has been studied. The electromagnetic field inside an anatomical heterogeneous model {{of the human body}} has been computed by using the finite-difference time-domain method; the corresponding temperature increase has been evaluated through an explicit finite-difference formulation of the bio-heat equation. The thermal model used, which takes into account the thermo regulatory system of the human body, has been validated through a comparison with experimental data. The results show that the peak specific absorption rate (SAR) as averaged over 10 g has about a 25 -fold increase in the trunk and a 50 -fold increase in the limbs with respect to the whole body averaged SAR (SAR(WB)). The peak SAR as averaged over I g, instead, has a 30 - to 60 -fold increase in the trunk, and up to 135 -fold increase in the ankles, with respect to SAR(WB). With reference to temperature increases, at the body resonance frequency of 40 MHz, for the ICNIRP incident power density maximum permissible value, a temperature increase of about 0. 7 degreesC is obtained in the ankles muscle. The presence of the thermoregulatory system strongly limits temperature elevations, particularly in the body core...|$|R

We present our early results with this technique employing a monopolar <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>source</b> through a right thoracoscopy {{in patients with}} lone atrial fibrillation (LAF). Methods Between June 2009 and December 2010 nineteen consecutive patients (mean 60. 8 [*]±[*] 8. 6 [*]years, 84. 2 % male) underwent right unilateral minimally invasive hybrid procedure for LAF at our Institution. Ten patients (52. 6. 6 %) had long-standing persistent AF while four (21. 1 %) had persistent and five (26. 3 %) paroxysmal AF. All patients were followed-up according the Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (HRS/EHRA/ECA) and Society of Thoracic Surgeon (STS) guidelines. Results There were neither early nor late deaths. It was possible to complete all the procedures as planned without any conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass. No patient died during the follow up. At one year, 7 / 19 (36. 8 %) patients were in sinus rhythm with no episode of AF and off antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD). Time-related prevalence of postoperative AF peaked at 44. 4 % (41. 3 – 47. 4) at two weeks, was 30. 4 % (27. 3 – 34. 9) at three months, fell to 14. 2 % (11. 6 – 18. 1) by 6 [*]months and was 13. 3 % (11. 0 – 17. 4) at 12 [*]months Among patients with long-standing persistent (LSP) AF, 20 % (2 / 10) were in Sinus rythm and off AAD. One-year success rates were 50 % (2 / 4) in persistent and 60 % (3 / 5) in paroxysmal AF. At 12 [*]months estimated prevalence of antyarrhythmic drugs and Warfarin use were 26 % (22. 4 – 33. 1) and 48 % (37. 2 – 53. 2), respectively. Conclusions One year results combining the percutaneous endocardial with the right thoracoscopic epicardial technique were, in our experience, not satisfactory, particularly in patients with LSP and persistent AF.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMF), specifically related {{to the use of}} mobile telephones, on the nervous system in humans {{have been the subject of}} a large number of experimental studies in recent years. There is some evidence of an effect of exposure to a Global System for Mobile Telecommunication (GSM) -type signal on the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG). This is not corroborated, however, by the results from studies on evoked potentials. Although there is some evidence emerging that there may be an effect of exposure to a GSM-type signal on sleep EEG, results are still variable. In summary, exposure to a GSM-type signal may result in minor effects on brain activity, but such changes have never been found to relate to any adverse health effects. No consistent significant effects on cognitive performance in adults have been observed. If anything, any effect is small and exposure seems to improve performance. Effects in children did not differ from those in healthy adults. Studies on auditory and vestibular function are more unequivocal: neither hearing nor the sense of balance is influenced by short-term exposure to mobile phone signals. Subjective symptoms over a wide range, including headaches and migraine, fatigue, and skin itch, have been attributed to various <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>sources</b> both at home and at work. However, in provocation studies a causal relation between EMF exposure and symptoms has never been demonstrated. There are clear indications, however, that psychological factors such as the conscious expectation of effect may play an important role in this condition...|$|R

40|$|An {{indispensable}} ingredient for nanoscale imaging {{within the}} field of Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) is a <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>source.</b> Conventional RF-sources constitute a significant impediment for MRFM experiments at extreme low temperatures and consequently form a major obstacle towards the single-spin measurement. In this thesis we have introduced a non-trivial method where an intrinsic property of an MRFM force sensor is exploited for the generation of an ultra-low dissipative RF-field. Using MRFM as a probe for local nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on copper nuclei at millikelvin temperatures, we have demonstrated that the correct implementation of this feature resulted in an amplification of the NMR signal by more than a factor 2. Based on these findings, we propose an adjusted design of the force sensor that could contribute towards a significantly improved imaging sensitivity as established in MRFM experiments to date...|$|R

Epitaxial layers were grown on [001] GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy using solid sources for group-III and As elements, and a <b>radiofrequency</b> plasma <b>source</b> for N. The nitrogen content, measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy, was in the range 5 × 10 - 5 - 7 × 10 - 2.

Peak 10 g average SAR in the whole head and in just the temporal region was compared for three phantom arrangements; no cap, 64 -electrode 'Electro-Cap,' and 64 -electrode 'Quick-Cap'. Relative to the 'no cap' arrangement, the Electro-Cap and Quick-Cap caused a peak SAR (10 g) reduction of 14 % and 18 % respectively in both the whole head and in the temporal region. Additional computational modeling confirmed that SAR (10 g) is reduced {{by the presence of}} electrode leads and that the extent of the effect varies according to the orientation of the leads with respect to the <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>source.</b> The modeling also indicated that the nonconductive shell between the electrodes and simulated head material does not significantly alter the electrode lead shielding effect.

The device and the method are based on an electromagnetic-mechanical pulser (EMMP) that consists {{of a series of}} transverse deflecting cavities and magnetic quadrupoles. The EMMP modulates and chops the incoming dc electron beam and converts it into pico- and sub-pico-second (100 fs to 10 ps) electron pulse sequences at > 1 GHz repetition rates. Applying the EMMP to a transmission electron microscope (TEM) with any dc electron source, a GHz stroboscopic high-duty-cycle TEM can be realized. Unlike in many recent developments in time-resolved TEM that rely on a sample pumping laser paired with a laser launching electrons from a photocathode to probe the sample, there is no laser in the presented experimental set-up. This {{is expected to be a}} significant relief for electron microscopists who are not familiar with laser systems. The EMMP and the sample are externally driven by a <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>source</b> synchronized through a delay line. With no laser pumping the sample, the problem of the laser induced residual heating/damaging the sample is eliminated. As many RF-driven processes can be cycled indefinitely, sampling rates of 1 - 50 GHz become accessible. Such a GHz stroboscopic TEM would open up a new paradigm for in situ and in operando experiments to study samples externally driven electromagnetically. Complementary to the lower (MHz) repetition rates experiments enabled by laser photocathode TEM, new experiments in the high rep-rate multi-GHz regime will be enabled by the proposed RF design.

40|$|Neurons {{serve as}} the basic unit of {{computation}} within the nervous system. As the nervous system is involved with the encoding, transmission, processing, and decoding of information at every level, characterization {{of the nervous system}} is of the utmost interest to neuroscience. However, techniques for probing the nervous system have previously focused primarily of characterizing single cell behavior, which does not provide insight as to the functioning of the system as a whole. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} functional network of neurons are typically spatial interwoven, rendering spatially-limited stimulation techniques ineffective. The desire to characterize the system in its entirety necessitates the development of neuronal probes that can target functional subpopulations of cells. A proposed system for such stimulation is the genetic targeting of neurons via expression of gated ion channels, and the selective stimulation of them using a transmitter-receiver pair. This thesis describes the design and optimization of such a transmitter-receiver pair that activates ion channels via the dissipation of heat. Magnetic losses in superparamagnetic metal ferrite nanocrystals are modeled to determine the optimal operating parameters for dissipation of heat. Optimal nanocrystals are then synthesized via high-temperature thermolysis of a mixed metal oleate precursor, and stabilized in the aqueous phase through functionalization with polyethylene glycol. A solenoid is designed and constructed to serve as a <b>radiofrequency</b> excitation <b>source,</b> and subsequently optimized to maximize the power transfer from solenoid to magnetic nanocrystals. A susceptometer and lock-in amplifier are designed for characterization of colloidal nanocrystals in the aqueous phase.

During growth of ZnO films, the temperature of elemental zinc source (with a purity of 99.99999 %) was maintained at 330 °C, and the oxygen partial pressure was kept at 1 × 10 - 5 mbar with the power of plasma source at 180 W. All the films reported in this work were grown at these conditions for 60 min. The only growth parameter that changed for each film is the substrate temperature, which ranges from 100 °C to 480 °C. In situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) was used to examine the surface structure of the MgO substrate (before depositing ZnO) and the ZnO films (after the deposition). The film roughness was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The polar and nonpolar structures of the ZnO films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Cu anode (λKα 1 = 1.54056 Å). The electronic structures of the thin films were probed by synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). The component analysis of XAS was done through first principles' all-electron calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) [8] using generalized gradient approximations [9], as implemented in the Wien 2 k package (Vienna, Austria) [10]. A dense k-point mesh of 22 × 22 × 12 was used to obtain a well-converged charge density, and the projected density of states (PDOS) of ZnO was calculated and compared with the experimental XAS spectra.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Drug {{resistance}} {{is widely believed}} to be an increasingly serious threat to global public health. We have previously reported that short term exposure of microorganisms to diagnostic ultrasound waves could significantly alter their sensitivity to antibiotics. In our previous studies, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed major differences in the sensitivity to antibiotics in exposed and non-exposed samples. This study was aimed at investigating the alteration of antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella pneumonia, after exposure to Wi-Fi 2. 4 GHz electromagnetic radiofrequency radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, three replicate agar plates were used for each test. The antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out using disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar plates and the inhibition zones in both control and exposed groups were measured. A common Wi-Fi router {{was used in this}} study as the <b>radiofrequency</b> exposure <b>source.</b> Irradiated samples were exposed to Wi-Fi radiofrequency radiation for 3, 4. 5 and 8 hours. RESULTS: Statistically significant variations of sensitivity to antibiotics were found for all studied antibiotics after 4. 5 hours of RF exposure, compared to non-exposed bacteria. Interestingly, the mean diameters of the inhibition zones after 3 hours of exposure were less than those exposed for 4. 5 hours. Following this rise in the sensitivity to antibiotics, a fall was observed in the bacteria exposed for 8 hours for all studied antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show a statistically significant rise in the sensitivity of Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics after 4. 5 hours of exposure to 2. 4 GHz Wi-Fi radiation, followed by a fall after 8 hours of exposure. These observations can be interpreted by the concept of non-linearity in the responses of Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics after exposure to electromagnetic radiofrequency radiation. As in this study a minimum level of effect was needed for the induction of adaptive response, these results also confirm the validity of the so-called "window theory"...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to completely destroying artwork, fires in museums and public buildings can soil a displayed artwork {{with so much}} accumulated soot that {{it can no longer}} be used for study or be enjoyed by the public. In situations where the surface has not undergone extensive charring or melting, restoration can be attempted. However, soot deposits can be very difficult to remove from some types of painted surfaces, particularly when the paint is fragile or flaking or when the top surface of the paint binder has been damaged. Restoration typically involves the use of organic solvents to clean the surface, but these solvents may cause the paint layers to swell or leach out. Also, immersion of the surface or swabbing during solvent cleaning may move or remove pigment through mechanical contact, especially if the fire damage extends into the paint binder. A noncontact technique of removing organic deposits from surfaces was developed out of NASA research on the effects of oxygen atoms on various materials. Atomic oxygen is present in the atmosphere surrounding the Earth at the altitudes where satellites typically orbit. It can react chemically with surface coatings or deposits that contain carbon. In the reaction, the carbon is converted to carbon monoxide and some carbon dioxide. Water vapor is also a byproduct of the reaction if the surface contains carbon-hydrogen bonds. To study this reaction, NASA developed Earth-based facilities to produce atomic oxygen for material exposure and testing. A vacuum facility designed and built by the Electro-Physics Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to provide atomic oxygen over a large area for studying reactions in low Earth orbit has been used to successfully clean several full-size paintings. (This facility can accommodate paintings up to 1. 5 by 2. 1 m. The atomic oxygen plasma is produced between two large parallel aluminum plates using a <b>radiofrequency</b> power <b>source</b> operating at roughly 400 W. Atomic oxygen is generated uniformly over this area at an operating pressure of 1 to 5 mtorr...|$|R
40|$|The most {{challenging}} rf source requirements for high-energy accelerators presently being studied or designed {{come from the}} various electron-positron linear collider studies. All of these studies except TESLA (the superconducting entry in the field) have specified rf sources with much higher peak powers than any existing tubes at comparable high frequencies. While circular machines do not, in general, require high peak power, the very high luminosity electron-positron rings presently being designed as B factories require prodigious total average rf power. In this age of energy conservation, this puts a high priority on high efficiency for the rf sources. Both modulating anodes and depressed collectors are being investigated {{in the quest for}} high efficiency at varying output powers. 1. L~~DUCTION Recent progress in <b>radiofrequency</b> (rf) <b>sources</b> has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary. There have been no great breakthroughs, no startling innovations, nothing comparable to the discovery of strong focusing or the invention of the FEL, that I am aware of. Rather, the period has been characterized by steady progress towards higher powers and higher efficiencies. UHF klystrons [I] for storage rings arc now available with 1. 3 MW of CW power and an efficiency of 65 %. Almost all tubes are designed with the aid of two- and/or three-dimensional PIC codes such as MASK, CONDOR, MAGIC, or FCI [2]. Klystrons intended for linear colliders have achieved peak powers on the order of 100 MW for short pulses at X-band and above. A microwave FEL has achieved 1 gigawatt at a 1 cm wavelength (quite a number of years ago). There is a lot of research activity at a number of universities and laboratories on various “gyro ” devices producing tens of megawatts at a number of frequencies above 10 GHz. I won’t discuss a number of ultra high power, high frequency rf sources like the vircator and the phase-locked relativistic magnetrons, which I view as having little or no chance of generating what I would call “accelerator grade rf. ” I hope this will not offend anyone. 2.

40|$|This article {{describes}} an optimization process specially designed for {{local and regional}} hyperthermia {{in order to achieve}} the desired specific absorption rate in the patient. It is based on a genetic algorithm coupled to a finite element formulation. The optimization method is applied to real human organs meshes assembled from computerized tomography scans. A 3 D finite element formulation is used to calculate the electromagnetic field in the patient, achieved by <b>radiofrequency</b> or microwave <b>sources.</b> Space discretization is performed using incomplete first order edge elements. The sparse complex symmetric matrix equation is solved using a conjugate gradient solver with potential projection pre-conditionning. The formulation is validated by comparison of calculated specific absorption rate distributions in a phantom to temperature measurements. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the specific absorption rate distribution to predict the phases and amplitudes of the sources leading to the best focalization. The objective function is defined as the specific absorption rate ratio in the tumour and healthy tissues. Several constraints, regarding the specific absorption rate in tumour and the total power in the patient, may be prescribed. Results obtained with two types of applicators (waveguides and annular phased array) are presented and show the faculties of the developed optimization process...|$|R
