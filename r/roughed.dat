5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site {{and it is likely}} that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be <b>roughed</b> out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.|$|E

In this paper, <b>rough</b> set symbols are simplified and standardized, which are composed of <b>rough</b> interpretation and specialized indication. <b>Rough</b> spatial entities and their topological relationships are also proposed in <b>rough</b> space. Further, a universal intersected equation is developed, and <b>rough</b> membership function is extended with the grey degree of a pixel in a case study. First, <b>rough</b> set is simply reviewed, and a set of simplified <b>rough</b> symbols is advanced on the basis of different kinds of existed <b>rough</b> symbols. It includes both <b>rough</b> interpretation and specialized indication. Second, <b>rough</b> spatial entity is put forward in <b>rough</b> vector space, <b>rough</b> raster space and <b>rough</b> threedimensional space. It is argued that GIS studies the real world as it is, without forcing uncertainties to change into crisp set. Third, <b>rough</b> topological relationships that are disjoint, touch, overlap, equal, cover, covered by, contain and contained by, are studied via <b>rough</b> matrix with their figures. They are divided into three types, CC (crisp entity and crisp entity), RC (<b>rough</b> entity and crisp entity) and RR (<b>rough</b> entity and <b>rough</b> entity).

Honduran fans were <b>roughed</b> up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. In retaliation, violence against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several Vice Consuls, increased.

The following day, Rich Hill made his Dodgers debut, three weeks after he was acquired in a trade, and pitched six shutout innings while Justin Turner's solo homer accounted for all the scoring in a 1–0 win. Kenley Jansen tied Jim Brewer's franchise record for strikeouts by a reliever with the 604th of his career. On August 25, Matt Moore came within one out of a no hitter when Corey Seager singled, but he still beat the Dodgers 4–0. Kris Bryant hit two home runs the next day as the Chicago Cubs beat the Dodgers, 6–4, in 10 innings. Seager hit his 23rd home run {{of the season in}} the following game, setting the Dodgers single-season record for home runs by a shortstop.

The Dodgers fell behind 6–1 in the series finale, but came back to send the game into extra innings, finally winning the game 7–6 on a walk-off hit by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning. The Dodgers two-year stay as National League Western Division champions came to an end on September 21 when they were officially eliminated from post-season contention when the Giants beat the Cubs. The Dodgers then proceeded to be shut out by the Padres 6–0, the first career shutout for Padres starter Clayton Richard and the 17th time the Dodgers had been shut out in 2010, the most in the league and their highest total since 1989. In the next game, Ted Lilly struck out eight in seven innings, but the Dodgers managed just three hits in a 3–1 defeat.
