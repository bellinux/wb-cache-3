40|$|The {{inversion}} and <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the isomerization of Feringa's bithioxanthenes {{existing in}} two conformations, up/up and up/down, have been calculated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) levels. The inversion mechanism that maintains the double bond {{nature of the}} central bond is a classical one but the <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that break the double bond to form a biradical needs to explore the singlet and triplet states. To do this we have removed the four fused phenyl rings of bithioxanthene and calculated at the CASSCF and CASPT 2 levels bis(4 H-thiopyran) proving that B 3 LYP calculations yield reasonable results for the rotation barriers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The ISS-RapidScat {{program was}} {{initiated}} {{in response to}} the failure of the QuikSCAT satellite's antenna <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> in November 2009. While the spacecraft continued to function, it could only gather data in one direction, significantly limiting its data collection ability. ISS-RapidScat was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from elements of QuikSCAT's SeaWinds instrument engineering model, originally used to validate that instrument's flight hardware prior to its launch in 1999. It was constructed in 18 months; re-using the QuikScat hardware had the double benefit of reducing cost and using already flight-proven hardware that functioned well in orbit.|$|E

The Hospital Survey and Construction Act responded to the first of President Truman's proposals, which called {{for the construction of}} hospitals and related health care facilities, and was designed to provide federal grants and guaranteed loans to improve the physical plant of the nation’s hospital system. Money was designated to the states to achieve 4.5 beds per 1,000 people. The states allocated the available money to their various municipalities, but the law provided for a <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> so that an area that received funding moved {{to the bottom of the}} list for further funding.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary hammer}} drill (also known as a rotary hammer, roto hammer drill or masonry drill) {{combines}} a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete. Generally, standard chucks and drills are inadequate and chucks such as SDS and carbide drills that {{have been designed to}} withstand the percussive forces are used. Some styles of this tool are intended for masonry drilling only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling. In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven rotary drill, also the first drill to be powered by steam.|$|E

He was voiced by Nathan Lane. Beginning in 2012, the Tom Morrow Audio-Animatronic was removed from display and is no longer part of the attraction. The building used the same <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> built in 1967 for the Carousel of Progress.

50|$|His {{aircraft}} was severely damaged on a raid over Düsseldorf in March 1943, with his turret's <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> rendered inoperable and a wing on fire. While the crew prepared to bail out, the pilot heard Williams calling {{him to turn}} starboard, allowing his machine guns to bear on a closing German nightfighter, which blew up. The bomber dropped its bomb load, but was attacked by a second German fighter. With bullet wounds in his stomach and legs, Williams legs were paralysed, {{but he managed to}} shoot down the second fighter. The Halifax limped back to England, where it crash-landed. Williams was cut out of his turret, and spent several months in the hospital recuperating from his injuries. He was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.

40|$|The {{authors are}} {{grateful}} to the publisher, Springer, for letting the manuscript being archived in this Open Access repository. The final publication is available at [URL] audienceUpon swelling and dissolution, native cellulose fibers such as cotton hairs or wood fibers are rotating and contracting. Regenerated cellulose fibers are only contracting, not rotating. Cotton hairs show two <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> a well known untwisting, not seen in wood fibers, due to the unwinding of the twists initially induced by the desiccation that occurs {{at the end of}} the growth, and a "microscopic rotation" that can also be slightly observed in wood fibers. In addition to these <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> cotton hairs and wood fibers show a rolling up of their primary wall that is due to the higher elongation of the external layers as compared to the internal layers arising during the elongation phase of the cell. Contraction originates from the fact that the cellulose chains are in an extended conformational state due to the spinning process for the regenerated fibers and to the bio-deposition process for native fibers. The contraction is related to the relaxation of the mean conformation of cellulose chains from an extended state to a more condensed state. Physical as well as mechanical modeling will support the experimental observations...|$|R

The turret is fitted with the 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial light machine gun. The main gun is not stabilized (neither in the BTR-80 nor the BTR-80A), so accurate fire on the move is limited (to low speeds), and the <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is manually operated. In some cases, it is fitted with a BPPU turret with a 30-mm 2A72 and a PKT. The gunner sits in a roof mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger bench. The gunner's station is basic, but uncharacteristically uncramped for a Soviet-designed armored vehicle. The gunner is equipped with daytime sight.

50|$|In 1984, the Soviets began {{production}} of a diesel-engined variant of the BTR-70, which they called the BTR-80. The Soviets have retrofitted some BTR-70s with several of the improvements incorporated into the BTR-80, including the high-angle-of-fire turret. The twin doors are designed to allow the infantry to disembark while the vehicle is in motion, and allow the infantry inside to exit from one side if the other is receiving fire. The 30mm Cannon variants are effective against most targets apart from main battle tanks, against which they can still cause significant damage to optics, weapons, and important systems. The main gun is not stabilized, so accurate fire on the move is limited to low speeds, and the turret's <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is manually operated. The gunner sits in a roof-mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger bench.

40|$|Irregular interplanetary dust {{particles}} may acquire a considerable spin rate due to two non-statistical dynamical mechanisms induced by solar radiation. These arise from variations in surface albedo discussed by Radzievskii (1954) and from irregularities in surface geometry discussed by Paddack (1969). An experiment is reported which {{will lead to}} an evaluation in space {{of the effectiveness of}} these two spin mechanisms. The technique of optical levitation in an argon laser beam provides a stable trap for particles 10 - 60 microns in diameter.

50|$|In mid-2009, {{a gradual}} {{deterioration}} in the bearings of the antenna's <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> was noticed. Friction caused by this deterioration slowed the rotation rate of the antenna, leading to gaps in data recorded by QuikSCAT. The antenna ultimately failed on November 23, 2009. Upon failing, {{it was announced that}} the satellite was likely {{at the end of its}} mission and would no longer be used. The sensor on the satellite was confirmed to have failed around 0700 UTC. The loss only affected the real-time scanning equipment; the long-term data collection remained intact and operational. According to NASA, the failure resulted from the age of the satellite. The mechanism that seized was designed to last only five years; however, it remained operational for roughly ten years, twice its expected use. On November 24, NASA managers began to assess how extensively affected the satellite was and if it was possible to restart the spinning antenna. Contigency plans for what to do in the event of QuikSCAT's failure were also reviewed.|$|E
5000|$|The two-storey {{building}} was a plastered building [...] "in simple Hellenic style" [...] as {{a link between}} the modern and antique.

50|$|Construction {{started on}} the new light in 1892, and it was first lit in 1894. Built {{at the same time}} as Heceta Head Light, it was built from the same plans and is {{virtually}} identical to its more northern sister. Unlike its predecessor, the new light had several advantages over the original light. Built 100 ft above the river, the new light was safe from flooding. This was partly due to the Light House Board's insistence that ships be able to plot a course based on visible lighthouses. The original light was not visible at sea and was only usable as an aid to ships approaching the river. The new light used a clockwork mechanism to rotate the Fresnel lens, and was eventually automated in 1966. The <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> served in the light for 89 years before it finally broke down and was removed. The Coast Guard, in charge of the light at this point, wanted to replace the mechanism with a new one. However, strong public outcry forced those plans to be aborted, and in 1985, the old mechanism was returned to its position after being fully restored.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1850s {{the light}} was emitted from a system of oil or {{kerosene}} lamps. The light was concentrated and focused with a system of Fresnel lenses. In the 1850s {{the light was}} provided from a burning wick in a whale oil lamp. Later, as kerosene became available, the light was provided by burning kerosene. They typically used an Argand lamp which featured a hollow wick in a glass chimney for better, brighter, combustion with a silvered parabolic reflector behind the lamp to direct and intensify the light output. All oil fired lamps used burning wicks to make the light—giving rise {{to one of the}} lighthouse keeper's nickname as [...] "wickies" [...] as they {{spent a great deal of}} their time trimming the wicks on their lamps in order to keep them burning brightly with minimum sooting. In the 1850s their lights were rotated using clockworks, usually powered by falling weights attached to chains. Many lighthouses had vertical shafts in them so the weights could drop the height of the tower. This provided a longer time period before the weights would have to be pulled up again by the lighthouse keepers to power the <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Some had to be rewound as often as every two hours.|$|E
5000|$|A chronological tracker {{counteracts}} the Earth's rotation {{by turning}} {{at the same}} speed as the Earth relative to the Sun. around an axis parallel to the Earth's, but in the direction opposite to the Earth's rotation. To do this, a simple <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> turning at a constant speed of one revolution per day or 15 degrees per hour, is adequate for many purposes, such as keeping a photovoltaic panel pointing within a few degrees of the Sun, but for accurate tracking, such as may be needed to keep a telescope aimed at the Sun, the equation of time must be taken into account, so the tracker moves according to apparent solar time, often called [...] "sundial time". The speed of the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky varies slightly, depending on the time of year, for reasons which are explained in the article Equation of time#Explanations for the major components of the equation of time. This causes the reading of a sundial to advance at a varying rate. The tracker contains a mechanism that takes account of the equation of time and makes the tracker move according to sundial time. For example, it turns 15 degrees in one hour as measured by a sundial, which may be slightly longer or shorter than an hour as measured by a clock. So the tracker's movement is governed by sundial time, which in turn is governed by the movement of the Sun in the sky. This makes the tracker accurately keep pace with the Sun.|$|E

After unlocking of solar panel (while in orbit), rotation bracket turns towards ready-to-work position under the action of driving spring. During deployment, once reached the required operating angle (defined by power subsystem engineer), the rotation bracket collides with the fixed bracket that is mounted on body of the satellite, to stop rotation. Due {{to the effect of}} collision force that may alter the <b>rotation</b> <b>mechanism</b> function, design of centrifugal brake is essential.

40|$|Soft X-ray {{observations}} of coronal holes are analyzed {{to determine the}} structure, temporal evolution, and rotational properties of those features as well as possible mechanisms which may account for their almost rigid rotational characteristics. It is shown that coronal holes are open features with a divergent magnetic-field configuration resulting from a particular large-scale magnetic-field topology. They are apparently formed when the successive emergence and dispersion of active-region fields produce a swath of unipolar field founded by fields of opposite polarity, and they die when large-scale field patterns emerge which significantly distort the original field configuration.
