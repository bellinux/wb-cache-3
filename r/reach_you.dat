500|$|Harrison also {{asks for}} divine {{assistance}} to [...] "cope with this heavy load", while his stated attempt to [...] "touch and <b>reach</b> <b>you</b> with heart and soul" [...] recalls the same plea for {{a direct relationship}} with his deity that he expresses in [...] "My Sweet Lord". These two lines, which complete the chorus, imply a deficiency or unfulfilment on the singer's part. According to author Ian Inglis, they serve as [...] "an acknowledgment of the trials and tribulations he was facing in a more earthly setting" [...] in the aftermath to the Concert for Bangladesh.|$|E

We are flying at 1,000 feet [...]" [...] Her 7:58am {{transmission}} said she couldn't hear the Itasca {{and asked them to}} send voice signals so she could try to take a radio bearing. This transmission was reported by the Itasca as the loudest possible signal, indicating Earhart and Noonan were in the immediate area. They couldn't send voice at the frequency she asked for, so Morse code signals were sent instead. Earhart acknowledged receiving these but said she was unable to determine their direction.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy indicted Ginzburg for distributing obscene {{literature}} {{through the}} mails, {{in violation of}} federal anti-obscenity laws. The indictment, although full of counts, really comprised three allegations of obscenity: First, publication of Volume I, No. 4, of Eros; second, publication of his newsletter Liaison; and third, that although The Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity, published by Ginzburg, was not itself obscene because of its inherent artistic value, Ginzburg has mailed advertisements for the book which accentuated the erotic content of the book {{in such a way}} as to appeal to [...] "prurient interests". The advertising emphasized their sexual imagery, and included a guarantee of a full refund [...] "if the book fails to <b>reach</b> <b>you</b> because of U.S. Post Office censorship interference." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{what can}} it mean when America {{says it will}} now protect its friends? It can only mean {{prejudice}} against Iraq.

We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.|$|E

2500|$|Susan Owen's {{letter to}} Rabindranath Tagore marked, Shrewsbury, 1 August 1920, reads: [...] "I {{have been trying}} to find courage to write to you ever since I heard that you were in London ~ but the desire to tell you {{something}} is finding its way into this letter today. The letter may never <b>reach</b> <b>you,</b> for I {{do not know how to}} address it, tho’ I feel sure your name upon the envelope will be sufficient. It is nearly two years ago, that my dear eldest son went out to the War for the last time and the day he said goodbye to me ~ we were looking together across the sun-glorified sea ~ looking towards France, with breaking hearts ~ when he, my poet son, said those wonderful words of yours ~ beginning at ‘When I go from hence, let this be my parting word’ ~ and when his pocket book came back to me ~ I found these words written in his dear writing ~ with your name beneath." ...|$|E
2500|$|As captain, he {{suffered}} a lack of support from Geoffrey Boycott, who had hoped to be appointed captain instead, and these tensions contributed to the downfall of Denness as a skipper. [...] Boycott played in the first 6 Tests with Denness as captain, including the five matches in the 1–1 drawn series in the West Indies and the first Test of a 3–0 whitewash against India, during which Denness scored his first two Test centuries, but then Boycott then refused to play under Denness and remained out of the Test team until 1977. [...] After a 0–0 drawn three-match series against Pakistan at home in 1974, his boycott left England exposed in several matches against the fast bowling of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in the Ashes series in Australia in 1974-5. [...] Denness dropped himself from the England team for the 4th Test at Sydney after scoring only 65 runs in 6 innings (6, 26, 2, 20, 8, 2) {{in the first three}} Tests, although he was selected again for the 5th Test in Adelaide after his replacement John Edrich was injured, and achieving his highest Test score of 188 at Melbourne in the 6th Test to win by an innings. [...] The victory was little consolation, as Australia had already won four of the six matches in the series. [...] Once while in Australia, Denness received an envelope that had been sent with the address [...] "Mike Denness, cricketer". The letter inside read, [...] "Should this <b>reach</b> <b>you,</b> the post office clearly thinks more of your ability than I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to <b>reach</b> <b>you</b> by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." [...] At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." ...|$|E
