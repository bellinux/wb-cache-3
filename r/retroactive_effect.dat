5|$|The {{history of}} present day gallantry awards traces {{back to the}} rule of East India Company in India. The first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834, as the Order of Merit, which was later renamed as Indian Order of Merit in 1902. During the First World War, the awards were {{classified}} based on the English traditions for senior officers, junior officers, and enlisted men. Post-independence, the British honours and awards informally came to an end. However, attempts to institute new awards for India to honour the war heroes of 1947–1948 Indo-Pakistani War failed, as India was still a dominion. Eventually, the award was established on 26 January 1950, with <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> from 15 August 1947.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1920s, it was {{accepted}} by the British government that dominions would have full legislative autonomy. This was given legislative effect in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Statute took effect in Australia in 1942 {{with the passing of}} the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, with <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> to 3 September 1939, the start of World War II. The adoption of the Statute repealed the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 in relation to federal legislation. However, the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 continued to have application in individual Australian states until the Australia Act 1986 came into effect in 1986.|$|E

On November 13, 2008, the California Supreme Court asked California Attorney General Jerry Brown for an opinion on whether the Court should accept these cases for review and whether the measure should be suspended while they decide the case. On November 19, the Court accepted three lawsuits challenging Proposition 8 but denied the requests to stay its enforcement. The Court asked for final briefs by January 5, 2009. Oral arguments were held on March 5, 2009.|$|E

40|$|Current paper {{acknowledges}} the <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> after {{the introduction of}} PAS/UEM {{in the practice of}} high school teachers of Portuguese. Data produced by a questionnaire applied to fifteen teachers from public and private high schools in the municipalities of Marialva and Maringá, Paraná State, Brazil, are analyzed. Data analysis was foregrounded on <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> (BARTHOLOMEU, 2002; CORREIA, 2003; MOTTA, 2004; OLIVEIRA, 2008; RETORTA, 2007, 2009; SCHLATTER, et al., 2004,   2005; SILVA; ARAÚJO, 2009) and revealed <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> in high school teaching. On the one hand, it represented a greater commitment by students, according to the teachers’ perceptions, and even a mild change in their teaching practices; on the other hand, it represented a narrowing in the learning program, as several teachers perceived changes in the program and followed what was requested by the PAS/UEM evaluation. Results revealed that PAS exercised a great effect on Portuguese Language Teaching in the above-mentioned high schools. However, the new form of evaluation requires further studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{responding}} {{maintained by}} a reinforcer {{depends on the}} relation of the reinforcer not merely to the response that produces it but also to other preceding responses. Early responses in a sequence that ends in a reinforcing consequence make smaller contributions to later response rates than more recent ones, by virtue of the longer delays that separate them from the reinforcer. This study shows that the relation between a response and a later reinforcer contributes to responding only if no other reinforcers intervene; in other words, each reinforcer blocks responses that precede it from the effects of later reinforcers. Pigeons' pecks were maintained by fixed-interval (FI) schedules of food reinforcement. When FI 60 -s (short) and FI 75 -s (long) schedules began simultaneously within constant 150 -s cycles, long FIs did not affect short-FI performances, but short FIs eliminated the first 60 s of long-FI performances. Removing either short-FI reinforcers or short-FI stimuli showed that short-FI reinforcers and not short-FI stimuli blocked the first 60 s of the long-FI performance from the <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> of the long-FI reinforcer. With FI 15 -s and FI 75 -s schedules, the short-FI reinforcer was followed by reduced long-FI responding, but a schedule that prevented discrimination based on time since a reinforcer eliminated this proactive effect of the short-FI reinforcer. In other words, the <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> were reinforcer effects whereas the proactive effects were discriminative effects. Quantitative descriptions of variable-interval performances, in which reinforcer effects may operate in the absence of temporal discriminative effects, can be derived from these relations...|$|R
25|$|Part IV of the Civil Code was a {{comprehensive}} intellectual property legislation. It contained the copyright law proper in chapters 70 (authors' rights) and 71 (neighbouring rights); chapter 69 contained general provisions also applicable to copyright. Other chapters dealt with patent law (chapter 72), {{the protection of}} breeders' rights (ch. 73), of integrated circuits (mask works; ch. 74), of trade secrets (know-how; ch. 75), and also of trade marks, brands, and geographical indications (ch. 76). Chapter 77 detailed rules for technological applications, in particular those developed on a federal budget. Among the novelties introduced by this new legislation {{in the area of}} copyrights were a publication right (a copyright granted to the publisher of a previously unpublished, no longer copyrighted work; with a period of 25 years from the publication), and the definition of two kinds of contracts: one for copyright transfers, and licenses for granting usage rights. The new law was given <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> by the implementation act, which also specified that the 70-year copyright term was applicable to all works on which the 50-year copyright had not expired yet on January 1, 1993, instead of on January 1, 2004, as had been the case until then.|$|E

On 1 January 1949, as ceasefire was implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, {{and as it}} was becoming too late to honour the war heroes from 1947–1948 Indo-Pak War, Prime Minister Nehru forwarded the draft to Governor General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari to [...] "institute the awards as your own". But Rajagopalachari felt {{that it would be}} inappropriate for him to institute the awards, which did not have the King's approval, and India still being a dominion.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{subset of}} patent opinions from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals functions in a wholly different manner from ordinary judicial opinions: they have strong <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> with weak prospective effects. All Federal Circuit opinions have strong <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> because issued patents and pending applications rarely can be modified. The Federal Circuit decisions apply in full to these patents and applications, {{even though they}} were prepared without the benefit of the rulings. In contrast, many of these opinions have almost no prospective effects. Patent law provides tremendous linguistic flexibility to patent drafters, which can be used to avoid the holdings of many (but not all) opinions. Patent drafters can freely choose any words to describe and claim the invention in the patent application. Patentees carefully draft new applications, aware of the decisions, to avoid their holdings. If the Federal Circuit holds that a certain phrase necessitates a bad result, patent lawyers substitute equivalent uncontaminated language in its place in future applications. The prospective effects of these opinions are muted because of the linguistic flexibility in drafting applications. Issued patents cannot be effectively modified; consequently, they are strongly affected by Federal Circuit decisions. There are substantial costs to the Federal Circuit’s actions. First, patent prosecutors are excessively cautious and spend extra time drafting claims and patent specifications to lower the risk of future changes in the law. This increases costs while still not substantially eliminating the problem. More troubling, the retroactive opinions weaken the incentive to innovate because the added uncertainty in the procurement process makes patent rights insecure. It thereby diminishes the value of patents. As their value decreases, patents cannot fully advance technological progress, as the Constitution urges. A counterintuitive solution—reducing the use of precedential opinions—can mitigate the retroactivity problem...|$|R

40|$|Retroactivity {{arises when}} the {{coupling}} of a molecular network U to a downstream network D results in signal propagation back from D to U. The phenomenon represents {{a breakdown in}} modularity of biochemical circuits and hampers the rational design of complex functional networks. Considering simple models of signal-transduction architectures, we demonstrate the strong dependence of retroactivity on {{the properties of the}} upstream system, and explore the cost and efficacy of fuel-consuming insulating motifs that can mitigate <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects.</b> We find that simple insulating motifs can suppress retroactivity at a low fuel cost by coupling only weakly to the upstream system U. However, this design approach reduces the signalling network's robustness to perturbations from leak reactions, and potentially compromises its ability to respond to rapidly-varying signals.

2500|$|The Plurality argued as follows: (1) The {{economic}} impact of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 resulted was substantial as to Petitioner in that it forced Eastern Enterprises to contribute millions of dollars to a pension fund for employees is employed in the 1950s and 1960s solely because those payments could not be allocated to other Coal Companies that were currently operating in the coal industry. [...] The Plurality said that the <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> of the statute worked a substantial economic injury on Eastern that could not have been anticipated (2) The statute interferes with distinct investment backed expectations of Eastern Enterprises for much the same reason. [...] In 1987 Eastern Enterprises sold off its remaining holdings in Coal operations and as such completely removed itself from the industry. [...] The statute's requirement that Eastern Enterprises now undertake the obligation at issue clearly interfered with expectations of Eastern when it sold off its interest in coal operations. (3) The nature of the government action was such that it retroactively applied a substantial economic burden on Eastern Enterprises and such is unusual.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of automotive fuel consumption {{is a major}} challenge of automotive OEMs and suppliers. It is expected, that {{during the next decade}} the majority of vehicles will still be driven by internal combustion engines (ICE). As a rule of thumb about 2 / 3 of the fuel energy fed to the engine is converted into heat and is used only occasionally and only partly for heating the interior.

The ABS encourages the conservation of genetic diversity {{by means of the}} fair and equitable distribution of the benefits arisen from the utilization of genetic resources. Distribution is to take place between the providing country and the user of the resources. Peru features four main weaknesses in relation to ABS: (1) Firstly; its national legislation on the topic sets a bureaucratic and complex procedure that hinders the negotiation of fructiferous ABS contracts.
