50|$|Distribution network usually covers over a {{large area}} and {{catering}} power to different customers at different voltage levels. So locating required sources and loads on a larger GIS/Operator interface is often very difficult. Panning & zooming provided with normal SCADA system GUI does not cover the exact operational requirement. Network connectivity analysis is an operator specific functionality which helps the operator to identify or locate the preferred network or component very easily. NCA does the required analyses and provides display of the feed point of various network loads. Based {{on the status of}} all the switching devices such as circuit breaker (CB), <b>Ring</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Unit</b> (RMU) and/or isolators that affect the topology of the network modeled, the prevailing network topology is determined. The NCA further assists the operator to know operating state of the distribution network indicating radial mode, loops and parallels in the network.|$|E
40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{applied to}} live cables is {{hampered by the}} absence of a clear reflection from the far end. Instead, location of partial discharge (PD) can be extracted from small structures in recorded patterns arising from any impedance variation along the signal propagation channel. This paper explores two approaches for a single-sided PD location system. The first method compares similar signal sequences occurring in PD pattern and pattern obtained from an injected signal. The second method exploits the change of impedance at a far end <b>Ring</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Unit</b> (RMU) by introducing ferrite material, whose effect can be switched on and off. Experiment on medium voltage (MV) cable with about 560 m length shows that both methods can locate the PD within 2 % uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Inductive sensors {{are widely}} used for {{detection}} of high frequency signal, e. g. from partial discharge (PD) activity. A single inductive sensor, installed in a <b>ring</b> <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> (RMU) in a medium-voltage (MV) system, {{is not able to}} judge the direction of the signal origin. A method to determine its origin with two inductive sensors, proposed in earlier literature, employs a second sensor in the same RMU to determine signal propagation direction. This method can be extended for a recorded pattern, including reflections coming from both directions. This paper discusses a method to discriminate structures in a complete recorded pattern, originating from different sides. The method is tested on a 420 m laboratory scale test set-up with two RMUs upon injected pulses. The main difficulty to extract the injected pulse from the recorded pattern, due to resonances caused by the RMU-components, could be relaxed by the use of ferrite material...|$|E

40|$|On-line Partial Discharge (PD) {{detection}} and location systems for medium-voltage cables are at present being introduced in Dutch utilities and worldwide. The technical challenges now {{move from the}} development of the diagnostic technique itself to efficient implementation on alarge scale. In this paper we discuss several implementation related challenges and will propose adequate solutions. These challenges include robust algorithms to determine time of arrivals of distorted PD waveforms, signal propagation along cable types and configurations as three-core and cross bonded cables, and effect of <b>ring</b> <b>main</b> <b>units</b> or substations on signal propagation. Algorithms based on signal energy and on phase angle in frequency domain are preferred above e. g. threshold detection to determine PD arrival times. By introducing effective dielectric properties, cable parameters for accurate fault location as characteristic impedance and propagation velocity can be estimated also if data on semiconducting layers are unavailable. Models are proposed for cross-bonded connections and for three-core cables with common earth screen.

The search for an alternative insulation gas is driven by the well known extreme global warming potential of SF 6. For this purpose, the circuit breaker gas compartment of a piece of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) was filled with a CF 3 I gas mixture and then tested using lightning impulses up to the rated withstand strength. The tested <b>ring</b> <b>main</b> <b>unit</b> was initially designed to be insulated with SF 6 gas. The unit is a three-phase switchgear containing two switches per phase; a selector interlock and a vacuum bottle circuit breaker per phase. The test programme performed in this investigation demonstrated the breakdown performance and insulation strength of the new gas mixture as well as the vacuum circuit breakers behavior when insulated with a new insulation medium. Data on the dielectric properties of the proposed gas mixture is presented, and the performance of the tested vacuum circuit breaker is discussed. Promising results are obtained which indicate the suitability of this more-environmentally friendly gas for high voltage insulation purposes...|$|E

Consequently, power cable diagnostic becomes a popular subject which involves {{the transmission line}} parameters of the power cable and the impedance variation at the defect position. In {{the first part of}} the paper, a technique is introduced for extraction of the transmission line parameters of power cable from scattering (S) -parameter measurement. The process is realized by compensating the influence of the connector between the measurement port and the power cable. It is shown that the connector should be treated as part of the transmission line instead of a simple characteristic impedance change. Furthermore, research has been conducted to quantify how the transmission line parameters depend on temperature. This phenomenon is verified by the extraction technique both for Cross-Linked Polyethylene (XLPE) cable and Paper-Insulated Lead Covered (PILC) cable. In the second part of the paper, an online defect positioning technique is proposed, based on the fact that cable defects normally cause impedance variation at the defect position. To this end, the cable impedance is monitored at a <b>Ring</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Unit</b> (RMU) with the help of online impedance measurement technique. The measurement utilizes a Bulk Current Injection Probe (BCIP) clamped around a conductor inside the RMU.

40|$|There is {{increased}} pressure on distribution network operators (DNOs) {{to maintain the}} integrity of the network. While huge investments are already being made in replacing aging infrastructure to minimize the probability of equipment failure, the chances of failure cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, when network faults occur, it is necessary for DNOs to minimize the impact by reducing the outage time and number of customers without supply. To minimize the fault outage time, the Dutch DNO Stedin has started a project to introduce automation to its distribution network.
