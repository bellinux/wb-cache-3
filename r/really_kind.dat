I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do Death of a Salesman last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, and I find that <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of exciting. But politics? I don't know. Paul Ryan is certainly not my man." ...|$|E
500|$|Anodyne was {{recorded}} from May to June 1993 at Cedar Creek studio in Austin, Texas. Uncle Tupelo liked the studio because it [...] "just seemed <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of homey and small and cheap". The album was produced, mixed, and engineered by Brian Paulson. The now-expanded lineup inspired Tweedy {{to spend more}} time with his bandmates. After Tweedy wrote each song, he would play it to Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston to get their opinions. Farrar interpreted these practice sessions as a sign of Tweedy's increasing arrogance. At live shows, during this time, tensions between Tweedy and Farrar increased and led to verbal altercations.|$|E

However, Iverson criticized the episode, noting that the scene of Peter giving his story in court went from just [...] "creepy and awkward to just plain disturbing". The episode received a final rating by Iverson of 4.5/10. 9.93 million people watched this episode in the US on its first airing ranking #2 on FOX that night behind The Simpsons, this episode was the highest rated of season five.|$|E

He said, [...] "She comes back to her apartment after being thrown out the window by Christopher Walken and she goes mental. Her apartment's all pink and beautiful, and kind of creepy and infantile, then she just smashes it all up and spray paints stuff and transforms into Catwoman. It's this <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of sexual scene; it's amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|UGO Networks' Brian Tallerico has {{defended the}} season against the criticism. He {{wrote in a}} 2007 review that {{comparing}} [...] "tenth season Simpsons episodes to the prime of the series (3-7) is just unfair and <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of self-defeating. 'Yeah, I laughed, but not as hard as {{a couple of years}} ago. So it sucks.' That's nonsense. The fact is that even the tenth season of The Simpsons was funnier than most [...] show's best years." [...] PopMatters' Hassenger commented in his review that although the show had declined in quality, [...] "this {{is not to say that}} these episodes are without their charm; many, in fact, are laugh-out-loud funny and characteristically smart." ...|$|E

500|$|The lack {{of record}} sales was {{largely due to}} the fellow punk band Sex Pistols turning people off the genre [...] "with their antisocial behavior," [...] as put by author Brian J. Bowe. Rock music {{historian}} Legs McNeil relates: [...] "Safety pins, razor blades, chopped haircuts, snarling, vomiting—everything {{that had nothing to do}} with the Ramones was suddenly in vogue, and it killed any chance Rocket to Russia had of getting any airplay." [...] Joey also insisted that the Sex Pistols were partially responsible for the low sale numbers, concluding that before 60 Minutess focused on the Sex Pistols, Rocket to Russia had decent airplay. After this, Joey asserted that [...] "everyone flipped out and then things changed radically. It <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of screwed things up for ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse. It's just different choices, the road not taken". Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was very interesting and <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use that kind of stuff without seeming somehow exploitive. But I thought they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, while website blogger io9 listed [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E

500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the episode}} a 7.5 out of 10, Eric Walters of Paste stated, that [...] "Unlike last year, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{did not feel}} like a Flash episode {{featuring}} Team Arrow." [...] He expected the 2015 crossover would be bigger than previous years' noting: [...] "It is, but it's also far from complete." [...] He felt that [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{was not so much}} a The Flash episode, but more like [...] "the first half of something much larger". In the end, he wished [...] "the show had embraced it fully". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of amazed at just how much work [...] "Legends of Today" [...] gets done without just becoming a massive mess." [...] He described it as [...] "a proper two-parter this year" [...] and concluded: [...] "Amidst all the Legends of Tomorrow hooplah and the fun of getting the teams together, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] still manages to move the main Flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple of neat ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to {{be funny}} and sarcastic as opposed to snarky. One {{occasion}} in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence. The directors did not like this because, according to Greno, Flynn [...] "did this reaction where [...] treated her like she's nuts". Although both directors agreed that Flynn's reaction was funny, Greno and Howard wanted the characters to [...] "connect" [...] emotionally during this scene. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is [...] "at his best ... when he's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them", likening him to English actor Cary Grant. Fogelman concluded, [...] "At his heart, he's <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of a lost soul who doesn't quite know what he wants and who he is." [...] Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters, like Flynn, [...] "are skilled but have a human side to them". Flynn is considered an antihero because [...] "He is quick-witted and agile, stealing to survive" [...] and [...] "he is also extremely narcissistic".|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt. I mean, it's <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes {{and we have to}} be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You feel your freedom is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor {{is it about the}} four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode this year because it <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phoebe Cates {{was cast}} as Kate, Billy's girlfriend, despite {{concerns}} {{that she was}} known for playing more risqué parts, such as Linda Barrett in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). Spielberg urged the casting of the relatively unknown Zach Galligan as Billy because he saw chemistry between Galligan and Cates during auditions. Galligan later compared himself to Billy, saying he was a [...] "geeky kid", and that being in the film [...] "was <b>really</b> <b>kind</b> of a dream" [...] given [...] "what I get to do, what my character gets to do, blow up movie theatres", adding that he [...] "got to work with great people".|$|E

[...] Porters worked 400 hours a month or 11,000 miles, sometimes as much as 20 hours at a stretch. They were expected to arrive at work several hours early to prepare their car, on their own time; they were charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. On overnight trips, they were allocated only three to four hours of sleep—and that was deducted from their pay.|$|E
