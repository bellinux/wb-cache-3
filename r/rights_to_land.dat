In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E

25|$|The present Water Law, No. 5852 {{passed in}} 1962 and {{modified}} by laws 281, 238, and 431, established the main {{aspects of the}} legal framework for water resources management in the DR, including: (i) water as a public domain (meaning that ownership of water either resides with land owners or is public), (ii) water use concessions system, (iii) priorization of municipal water use, (iv) pollution of water ban, and (v) participation of users in water resources management. The Water Law ties water <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> ownership or public service providers and establish a limited private property right of water, only for water originating in owner's land such as springs and rain water.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to give a {{comprehensive}} view of the legal regulation of compensation for withdrawal and limitation of the ownership <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> This thesis is divided into eight chapters, where the introductory part is followed by six chapters and the conclusion. The first chapter briefly explains the basic institutes {{with an emphasis on}} the uniqueness of the land. The second chapter discusses the conditions of expropriation. The third chapter focuses on compensation for land expropriation. The fourth chapter deals with the limitation of the ownership <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> The fifth chapter analyzes compensation for the limitation of the ownership <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> The sixth chapter describes selected Acts of environmental law in the perspective of fourth and fifth chapter. In conclusion, this diploma thesis summarizes the main findings. As regards compensation for expropriation, the legislation is not stable and allows unjustified differences between landowners. As for the limitation of the ownership <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> the situation regarding the provision of compensation is not always clear and there are some gaps in the legislation. However, these can be overcome by case-law...|$|R

25|$|The Akha have {{traditionally}} employed slash and burn agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, {{there is usually}} no market for land. <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture {{has contributed to the}} Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.|$|E
25|$|Payments {{made in the}} 20th {{century as}} reparations for damage to the Bikini Atoll and the islanders' way of life have {{elevated}} their income relative to other Marshall Island residents. It has caused some Bikini islanders to become economically dependent on the payments from the trust fund. This dependency has eroded individuals' interest in traditional economic pursuits like taro and copra production. The move also altered traditional patterns of social alliance and political organization. On Bikini, <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> and land ownership were the major factor in social and political organization and leadership. After relocation and settlement on Kili, a dual system of land tenure evolved. Disbursements from the trust fund were based in part to land ownership on Bikini and based on current land tenure on Kili.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, {{the area}} was still heavily {{dominated}} by indigenous people, with small settlements of mestizos and criollos. Conflicts between the indigenous groups and others began at this time over natural resources such as land, water and especially forests. The Sierra Gorda Rebellion began in 1847 by deserters from the Mexican army. The uprising spread to nearly {{all parts of the}} Sierra Gorda region from Guanajuato to San Luis Potosí to Veracruz, with the most activity in Santa María del Río, Xichú and Rioverde between 1847 and 1849. The rebels demanded free use of various lands, the abolition of levies, the division of haciendas and the termination of parish church <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> Initial efforts by authorities to subdue the uprising were only partially successful. Rebels had control of various cities such as Ciudad Fernández, Rioverde and Santa María del Río by 1849. However, the government caught the most important rebel leader by the name of Quiroz that same year and executed him. This broke the main resistance and the government was able to put much of the rebellion down by 1850.|$|E
25|$|A {{limiting}} factor in Yucatán's economy was the poorness of the limestone soil, which could only support crops {{for two to}} three years with land cleared through slash and burn (swidden) agriculture. Access to water was a {{limiting factor}} on agriculture, with the limestone escarpment giving way in water filled sinkholes (cenotes), but rivers and streams were generally absent on the peninsula. Individuals had <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> so long as they cleared and tilled them and when the soil was exhausted, they repeated the process. In general Indians lived in a dispersed pattern, which Spanish congregación or forced resettlement attempted to alter. Collective labor cultivated the confraternities' lands, which included raising the traditional maize, beans, and cotton. But confraternities also later pursued cattle ranching, as well as mule and horse breeding, depending on the local situation. There is evidence that cofradías in southern Campeche were involved in interregional trade in cacao as well as cattle ranching. Although generally the revenues from crops and animals were devoted to expenses in the spiritual sphere, cofradías' cattle were used for direct aid to community members during droughts, stabilizing the community's food supply.|$|E
25|$|John's {{relationship}} with his nobles deteriorated further following the king's disastrous campaign to reconquer Normandy and Anjou from France in 1213, with the nobles eager to ally with Prince Llywelyn. Llywelyn's aid to England's nobles, in particular Llywelyn's seizure of Shrewsbury in May 1215, {{was one of the}} major factors which persuaded John to seal the Magna Carta in June 1215. Llywelyn wrestled significant concessions from the English Crown in the Magna Carta. Land seized unjustly during the conflict would be returned to the other, and the primacy of Welsh law to apply in Pura Wallia (two-thirds of the surface area of Wales)- particularly with succession to land and title- was reaffirmed, and with Marcher Law to determine <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> held in the March. The use of the term 'Marcher Law' in the Magna Carta was the first clear reference to the hybrid of Welsh and English law used in the march. The sealing of the Magna Carta did not end the conflict between John and England's nobles sparking First Barons' War, and Llywelyn continued to press his advantages in south and mid Wales by taking many English castles between 1215 and 1216, including the important Carmarthen and Cardigan castles among them.|$|E

500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E
