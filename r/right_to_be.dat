5|$|The {{privileges}} {{have been}} lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, {{and access to the}} Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.|$|E

5|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified, {{known as}} the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included {{as a result of}} lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

5|$|Once the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{identified}} {{has been}} asserted, it applies {{for the duration}} of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. If the right is then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> infringed, the author must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Hosenball (1977) that in such situations the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified to accommodate the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership {{in the country in}} the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E

5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm that swept through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries.

Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed the monastic rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct to other forms of monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E
