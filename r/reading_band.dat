50|$|Following the Bandcamp release, two further digital EPs were {{released}} in February 2013 through Josaka Music, Demons and Ben Marwood & Quiet Quiet Band Lay Low, a split with <b>Reading</b> <b>band</b> Quiet Quiet Band which had shortened to Lay Low {{by the time}} it reached retailers, after which Rock Sound announced that the new album Back Down would be released on 13 May 2013 through Xtra Mile Recordings. A headline UK tour was subsequently announced which also featured prominent members of the underground UK acoustic scene, as well as a video for the single Under Lock and Key, before heading to the US as opening support for Frank Turner.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Sam and wife Beatrice moved to Florida, {{in part to}} expand his {{orchestra}} compositions with a <b>reading</b> <b>band</b> in Orlando. This band became the longest-running incarnation of the RivBea Orchestra. He performed regularly with his Orchestra and Trio with bassist Doug Mathews and drummer Anthony Cole (later replaced by Rion Smith.) From 1996 to 1998 he toured and recorded three projects for Nato Records in France with pianist Tony Hymas and others. In 1998, {{with the assistance of}} Steve Coleman, he recorded two Grammy-nominated big-band albums for RCA Victor with the RivBea All-Star Orchestra, Culmination and Inspiration (the title-track is an elaborate reworking of Dizzy Gillespie's [...] "Tanga": Rivers was in Gillespie's band {{near the end of the}} trumpeter's life). Other recent albums of note include Portrait, a solo recording for FMP, and Vista, a trio with drummers Adam Rudolph and Harris Eisenstadt for Meta. During the late 1990s he appeared on several albums on Postcards Records.|$|E

40|$|Track and μtrack scans {{are common}} {{techniques}} in hard disk systems for investigating side writing and side reading, and for characterizing {{the response of}} MR read heads. These methods are implemented less in tape systems, where the contact recording mode and flexible medium {{make it difficult to}} obtain a smooth relative movement between head and medium. Positioning instability generates fluctuations in track profiles (S. Fukuda et al, 2000). We optimized an experimental system, using helical scan type heads and tape wound on a rotary drum, for measuring sub-μm track profiles. Writing and reading operations are performed with the same helical scan silicon (HSS) head, fabricated with advanced thin film technology. HSS heads feature unique properties such as an integrated solenoid coil (DC resistance < 8 Ω for 40 turns), and very small pole widths. The very good alignment of the polar pieces is expected to minimize side effects. In this paper, we report μtrack profile measurements for investigation of track edge behavior of HSS heads in combination with MP and ME tapes. Heads with optical pole widths as narrow as 3. 3 μm and 0. 11 μm gap length have been studied. Narrower tracks are obtained by recording a first track and partially erasing it from one side by writing a second track at a different wavelength. The positioning accuracy achieved, better than 0. 1 μm with all precautions, allows use of this method for side erasure measurements. Using a 0. 5 μm wavelength track to partially overwrite a 0. 4 μm wavelength we find a side erasure band of 0. 3 μm (with MP tape, Hc= 135 kA/m). Results are compared with MFM observations and qualitative agreement is proved. We also describe novel profiling methods for quantifying side reading, and report experimental results. The difference between the side erasure band (SEB) and the side <b>reading</b> <b>band</b> (SRB) can be determined by writing a track in the middle of two adjacent tracks having different wavelengths. All wavelengths are read during the same scan...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} glam rock’s {{rejection of}} the humdrum, spontaneity and the ‘natural’ and its embrace of costuming, camp and artificiality. With particular reference to Roxy Music, it will examine the band’s iconography, fashion and contexts during glam’s golden years – 1972 to 1974 – {{as well as the}} implications of glam style for gender and sexuality in popular music. Though some of glam’s exponents were undoubtedly much more traditional in their performance of gender identities, we can <b>read</b> <b>bands</b> like Roxy Music, within certain limits, as ‘queering’ their more meat-and-potatoes predecessors and providing an important source of identification for later pop music gender and style dissidents. The fashion and music scenes in which Roxy Music emerged are inseparable from the milieux of experimentation and innovation associated with British art and fashion schools in the 1960 s onwards. To this extent, the band exemplifies the vital pathway of art school students into popular music outlined by Simon Frith and Howard Horne in Art into Pop (1987). Through Keir Keightley’s (2001) conception of romantic and modernist authenticity in popular music and Joanne Entwhistle’s (2001) typology of the romantic and the dandy in fashion, we will explore how glam traces a line from the dandy via New Edwardian fashion, in which questions of gender and artifice are in a process of perpetual renegotiation...|$|R
