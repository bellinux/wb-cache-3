50|$|The circuit {{had been}} altered {{for the second}} time in as many years with the back {{straight}} chicane tightened significantly. There were several new combinations. Alfa Romeo entered a second car, a replacement after Patrick Depailler's death a month earlier, for Italian veteran Vittorio Brambilla. Geoff Lees was entered in a second Ensign N180 and Jochen Mass returned from injury in an Arrows A3. Mass' return proved to be premature and he pulled out of the meeting. Tyrrell <b>Racing</b> <b>test</b> driver Mike Thackwell stepped into the car but failed in his attempt to be the youngest ever Formula One race starter.|$|E

He was competing against former Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais and Red Bull <b>Racing</b> <b>test</b> and reserve driver Sébastien Buemi {{for one of the}} two race seats. He first drove on 18 September, more than four months since Super Aguri's withdrawal, and tested for the team again for two days in November, setting the fastest time on the 17th, 3 tenths ahead of Buemi, and proceeded by setting the second-fastest time on the 18th.|$|E

50|$|DAMS was {{associated}} with the Toyota Drivers Program (TDP) from 2006 to 2009, and ran their drivers in the GP2 Series. In 2006, it was Franck Perera and then Kazuki Nakajima in 2007, who finished 5th in the GP2 championship and raced in the last Formula One Grand Prix of the season with Williams. Following this he won a full-time race seat with the team for 2008 and was retained for the 2009 season. In 2008, TDP driver Kamui Kobayashi replaced Nakajima at DAMS GP2 and became the Toyota <b>Racing</b> <b>test</b> driver. Kobayashi stayed on in 2009, and was partnered by Jérôme d'Ambrosio for these two years. Neither driver was able to put together a consistent run of form in the main GP2 Series championships, but Kobayashi did win the 2008-09 Asian championship with the team.|$|E

Atreus Homes and Communities began the season as the sponsor, but soon left. Penske sponsors AVIS and Penske Trucking, and Loan Star Title Loans shared the sponsorship duties {{for the rest of the}} season. Stremme's return to the Sprint Cup Series left the seat open, and former Truck Series driver Brendan Gaughan drove the renumbered 62 in 2009 with sponsorship from South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa, before U.S. Fidelis and 5-hour Energy came over to share sponsorship with the No. 66.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Paul Stoddart, {{former owner}} of the Minardi Formula One team, bought an {{interest}} in the team and re-christened it Minardi Team USA. For the 2007 season Stoddart and Wiggins lined up the services of Dan Clarke and Red Bull F1 <b>Racing</b> <b>test</b> driver Robert Doornbos. With Doornbos the team began competing for podium positions regularly. The team scored its first win under the Minardi Team USA banner at the 2007 Champ Car Grand Prix de Mont Tremblant. Doornbos went on to capture another win at San Jose, and his tally for 2007 was 2 wins and 6 podiums. Doornbos went on to finish 3rd in Championship standings, earn Rookie of the Year, and was the highest finishing Rookie in the Champ Car World Series since Juan Pablo Montoya in 1999. Doornbos also won the award for Hard Charger, improving the most positions during the race.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2001, Lexus {{announced}} that the first vehicle in the F marque lineup, the Lexus IS F sedan, previously known in the press as the IS 500, would premiere at the North American International Auto Show in January 2007. The vehicle subsequently premiered at Detroit along with a redesigned version of the concept LF-A sports car. At its press debut, Lexus revealed that a dedicated [...] "skunk works" [...] team designed the IS F in a manner distinct from typical Lexus engineering efforts. The chief designer of the IS F, Yukihiko Yaguchi, previously worked on the Toyota Supra. Media reports suggested that the IS F sedan would {{be followed by a}} GS F sedan and Lexus IS F coupe. However, the GS F was reportedly delayed due to the economic downturn through 2008. Further development of LFA variants were also subject to conflicting reports as to whether the vehicle would be used solely as a <b>racing</b> <b>test</b> platform, discontinue production, or emerge when more favorable economic circumstances arrive.|$|E
40|$|It is {{very common}} to rule out Bluetooth as a {{suitable}} technology for vehicular communications. The reasons behind this decision usually result from misconceptions such as accepting that Bluetooth has a short application range, or assuming its connection setup is not fast enough to allow communication which involves high speed moving nodes. This paper refutes those assertions and proposes the use of Bluetooth not only for Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I 2 V) or Road-to-Vehicle (R 2 V) communications, but also for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V 2 I) communications. This novel proposal is based on using the remote name request procedure of the standard, combined with an adjustment and optimization of the parameters present in the inquiry and page procedures. The proposed modifications reduce the information exchange delay, thus making Bluetooth a suitable technology for high-speed vehicle communications. The feasibility of the proposed scheme has been validated through experimental tests conducted in different scenarios: laboratory, a real highway and a <b>racing</b> <b>test</b> circuit. There, the communication system was installed in a vehicle circulating at speeds of up to 250 km/h, whereas autonomous devices were disseminated throughout the road path {{to communicate with the}} on board devices obtaining satisfying results.

40|$|It {{has been}} more than 45 years since the <b>race</b> <b>test</b> was created to {{describe}} and differentiate the ability of populations of the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, to reproduce on resistant soybean cultivars (Golden et al. 1970). Nearly 15 years have passed since the updated adaptation of the <b>race</b> <b>test,</b> the HG type test, was established (Niblack et al. 2002). Unfortunately, confusion still exists about the concept of SCN race and HG type. Questions from researchers and from agribusiness and extension professionals who advise farmers include: • When will there be a molecular test for HG type (or SCN race) ? • How many HG types (or races) are there in a field? • Do seed treatments work against all HG types (or races) ? These seemingly logical questions of practical significance are unanswerable if one understands the concept of HG type and SCN race. Following is a comparison drawn between the current SCN HG type test and a hypothetical test for human food sensitivities that may provide a new perspective and make HG types more easily understood and used...|$|R

40|$|Effects of pot size, {{length of}} {{seedling}} radicle {{at the time}} of inoculation with Heterodera glycines, transplanting after inoculation, type and amount of inoculum, and temperature were tested to determine the optimum procedure for the H. glycines <b>race</b> <b>test.</b> Numbers of H. glycines females extracted from plants in 7. 5 -cm-d pots tended to be higher than numbers from 10 -cm-d pots, but not significantly so. Radicle lengths from 2. 5 cm to 7. 5 cm had no effect. Transplanting after inoculation reduced the variation in the number of females extracted, but the numbers of females produced were very low. Plump females (40 per pot) or eggs (4, 000 per pot) were the best inocula. A constant temperature of 28 C appeared to be optimum. More H. glycines females were extracted from plants 28 days after inoculation than at 35 days. <b>Race</b> <b>tests</b> in which all of these factors were included were still highly variable in the number of H. glycines females extracted from different replications of the same test host.
