40|$|Introduction: <b>Traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> {{with high}} {{morbidity}} and mortality rates {{are one of the}} most important problems of the world. Several factors have been described for the occurrence of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> Two of them are <b>traffic</b> congestion and <b>road</b> density which have infrequently been reported in the Turkish literature. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> population size, and the number of motor vehicles in Turkey. Material and methods: The crude data were obtained from the web page of the Turkish Statistical Institute. They was standardized for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles, or every one thousand <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> The system of Statistical Regions was used in the classification. Results: In Turkey, the total number of inhabitants was 74, 724, 269 and the number of motor vehicles was 16, 089, 528 in 2011. As a result of 131, 845 <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> 3, 835 people died and 238, 074 people were injured. In the evaluation of  the distribution of the number of motor vehicles for every one million population, the distribution of the number of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population and every one million motor vehicles,  the distribution of the number of people died in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles and every one thousand <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> and the distribution of the number of people injured in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> for every one million population, every one million motor vehicles and every one thousand <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> were all statistically significant.

The study wanted to address the puzzle, why despite of all efforts that have been implemented to prevent <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> in Tanzania, the incidence of accident are increasing; by employing both qualitative and quantitative methodology the research gap/puzzle was addressed. This was done by raising three key research questions; first, what are the major types of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> in Temeke District? Second, what are the major causes of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> in Temeke District? And third, what are the impacts of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> to various <b>road</b> users? The study found that there are five types of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> happening in Temeke District, these are between people versus vehicles, vehicles versus motorcycle, vehicle to vehicle, public vehicle versus individual vehicle and public vehicle versus public vehicle. However, the study noted that the dominant one is the accidents involves vehicles versus motorcycles. The following were noted to be the major causes to those types of accidents. The causes are categorized in several groups such as human, technical, mechanical and political factors. However, human factors was noted to be dominant factors influence’s the occurrence of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> i. e. alcoholism, carelessness, drugs, and over speed. Furthermore, the study noted the following impacts death, injuries, disabilities and psychological problem as well as poverty and the loss of property. Finally, the study recommends that, road safety measure needs to be taught as a subject in primary school. This is because large number of people ends with that level of education, strict enforcement of road laws, and <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> injuries should be considered as a public health issue...|$|R

A structured questionnaire included information about the type of <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> (fatal vs non-fatal event), year of event, age and sex of the responsible party, reason of accident, location and time of event, {{and the type of}} vehicle involved. Multivariable-adjusted binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the predictors of fatal <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> Results Overall, there were 1578 recorded <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> in Tirana district during 2000 - 2005.

Multiple methods were applied to the extrapolated population metrics of the burden of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> in Nepal. Results: The total number of years of life lived in disability, years of life lost, and DALYs in Nepal were 38, 848 ± 194, 119, 935 ± 1464, and 158, 783 ± 1658 (95 % confidence interval) respectively. The number of years lost because of morbidity and death was similar in Kathmandu Valley. Most (75 %) of the DALYs resulted from years of life lost in Nepal. Males accounted for 73 % of DALYs.
