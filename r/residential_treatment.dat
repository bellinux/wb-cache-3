40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Residential</b> drug <b>treatment</b> {{units are}} uniquely {{situated}} to provide HIV testing and counseling to their patients. This {{article examines the}} extent to which <b>residential</b> drug <b>treatment</b> units in the United States provide HIV testing on-site, and identifies organizational and institutional characteristics that differentiate units in which on-site HIV testing is available from those in which it is not. METHODS: The analyses use data collected in telephone interviews with unit managers from a random nationwide sample (N = 138) of <b>residential</b> drug <b>treatment</b> units in 2001. RESULTS: About half (48. 6 %) of the <b>residential</b> drug <b>treatment</b> units made HIV testing available to their patients on-site. Residential units {{were significantly more likely to}} make on-site testing available if they were larger (i. e., had a greater number of patients treated each month or had a greater number of staff that provided direct patient services) and if they were publicly rather than privately owned. Provision of on-site HIV testing was significantly correlated with having a medical orientation, i. e., with being operated by a hospital, with the unit viewing itself as patients' primary medical provider, or with providing medical care to the patients either on-site or at another part of the same treatment agency. CONCLUSION: In view of the critical importance of HIV testing for individuals who use illicit drugs and the existence of a simplified testing protocol involving saliva samples (eliminating the need for phlebotomy), units that do not have a medical orientation should be encouraged to make HIV testing available on-site...|$|R
