25|$|WHSV {{originally}} planned on turning off its analog transmitter of February 17, 2009, the original deadline of the federally mandated digital conversion. The station restored the signal the following Friday however, because several translator stations in communities such as Bergton that {{are owned by}} local cooperatives and county governments were unable to convert their transmitters to reconvert the digital signal into analog form, along with viewers who could <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> 3 signal well on analog, but not at all digitally.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{position}} in a fold in the hill, TV and radio reception in Chesham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast. In the 1970s, Chesham {{was one of the}} last towns in the south east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> 5. Houses taking their TV reception from the Chesham transmitter have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in a good enough position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials– they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 & Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} that the lower 2000 ft of Lees Creek <b>receive</b> <b>channel</b> lining and restoration.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>receiving</b> <b>channel</b> announcement, Hello packets are used to inform about the channel sensing information and the <b>receiving</b> <b>channel</b> of the neighboring nodes, so a node can compute the external and internal interference for each channel. In order to do that, there is a field in each packet which contains the amount of external interference over the <b>receiving</b> <b>channel</b> estimated by the node. The number of neighbors and the <b>channels</b> of their <b>receiving</b> radio is also added {{at the end of}} each Hello packet.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common problem}} (for {{metropolitan}} areas in particular) of difficulty receiving digital 10 (on channel 11) and digital ABC (on channel 12) is because older antennas were {{not designed to}} <b>receive</b> <b>channels</b> 11 and 12. Many VHF Band III antennas were only designed to <b>receive</b> <b>channels</b> 6 to 10 for analog television transmissions.|$|R
50|$|WTAE-TV {{operates}} a 9250-watt digital broadcast translator on channel 22 to cover {{portions of the}} northern Pittsburgh area which were unable to <b>receive</b> <b>channel</b> 4's digital signal. WTAE-TV {{had to wait for}} WPMY, which had been operating in analog nightlight mode after terminating regular programming on analog UHF channel 22 on the original February 17 deadline, to leave the channel entirely on March 19 before operating it.|$|E
50|$|However, {{some parts}} of Southeast Missouri could not <b>receive</b> <b>channel</b> 3's signal clearly, presumably because WSIL had to conform it to protect co-channel WREC-TV, Channel 3 (now WREG-TV), in Memphis, Tennessee in the next market to the south. As a result, KPOB signed-on September 15, 1967 to provide service to those counties, {{although}} Jonesboro, Arkansas' KAIT (another ABC station) may have been visible {{in much of the}} area.|$|E

50|$|In 2002 Channel V International {{was bought}} over by Malaysian media company Double Vision, and Gill's {{contract}} with the channel was ending. She moved on to Singapore, where she hosted a season of their version of The Weakest Link. Due to her role as host, she was quickly given a reputation of being acidic, sarcastic and sometimes mean - a distinct contrast from her Channel V days, where she was seen as being fun, happy-go-lucky and the 'girl next door'. Singapore {{was one of the}} few Asian countries not to <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> V.|$|E
50|$|The show did {{not always}} go {{head to head with}} Channel 4s Big Brother, as Big Brother aired at 9pm on Tuesdays, Saturdays and Sundays and only clashed on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays with Love Island at 10pm. However, many {{terrestrial}} viewers in Wales could only watch Big Brother at a fixed 10.00pm slot every night on S4C which also broadcast the show due to many Welsh terrestrial televisions failing to <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> 4. Love Islands audience was about half the size of that for Big Brother.|$|E
5000|$|... 625 line UHF colour TV {{transmissions}} commenced on 5 November 1973. The {{high power}} {{output of the}} UHF transmitter and its location allowed its signal to be received clearly in parts of south Wales. From 1985 and before Freeview it became a popular transmitter from which to <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> 4 which was not broadcast on Welsh transmitters (Channel 4 launched in 1982, but wasn't available from Huntshaw Cross until the summer of 1985). Evidence of this can easily be seen in Swansea (for instance) where many Group C/D TV aerials can be seen pointing south, across the water.|$|E

Conversely, Sky viewing cards from the Republic of Ireland, which allow viewing of Irish terrestrial channels, are imported into the UK. Northern Ireland residents subscribing to Sky can watch RTÉ One and Two and TG4, although not TV3, which carries many of the same programs as ITV, a lot of the programs airing before ITV can show them.|$|E
5000|$|Channel 0 was not included, {{possibly}} because the tuner mechanism could only accommodate 12 places. As a result, in Melbourne 1964 (and later in Brisbane), service technicians {{were required to}} convert the place marker for either channel 10 or 8 to <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> 0, and indicates the significant problems that ATV0 had in its commencement. Channel 10 {{could not be used}} in Melbourne at the time because there was a regional station (GLV10) that would have experienced interference, Brisbane had a similar issue a year later with a nearby regional station in Toowoomba DDQ10. This was not a problem in Sydney or Adelaide where the channel 10 frequency was used by the 0/10 Network.|$|E
50|$|The Split-8 {{has quite}} {{advanced}} MIDI implementation for {{an instrument of}} this vintage. OMNI mode, wheel controller reception/transmission and program change can be toggled on or off. All MIDI operation (in and out) can be disabled, {{and there is the}} capability for saving and loading patches. The MIDI <b>receive</b> <b>channel</b> (1-16) can be set for each patch. Four voices can be assigned to one patch that is controlled only via MIDI, with the other four playing a patch controlled only from the keyboard.

30|$|The main {{result of}} this work is the {{derivation}} of the pdfs (37) and (49) of random M[*]×[*]M real-valued and complex-valued ML estimates (21) and (36) of persymmetric CMs (2) and (11) of multivariate Gaussian processes and fields. Such CMs arise in numerous practical applications, particularly, in the tasks of space-time adaptive signal processing in systems with central symmetry of <b>receive</b> <b>channels</b> [20 – 32, 27 – 37, 38, 16, 17]. The derived pdfs have the same form as the classical Wishart’s pdf and Wishart’s–Goodman’s pdf (20) and (35) for GCM ML estimates, but {{with the number of}} degrees of freedom being increased approximately on M/ 2. This is due to the approximately half less number of determining parameters (elements) of the PCM. That is why, in the systems with the CS <b>receive</b> <b>channels,</b> the derived distributions appeal to such importance as that of the classical Wishart and Wishart’s–Goodman’s pdfs in systems with arbitrary <b>receive</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{coverage}} area {{consists of the}} majority of Anglesey, and a wide range of other parts of the North West Wales coast. As with the service areas of other transmitters in North Wales, such as the Moel-y-Parc transmitting station, signal overspill from transmitters in North West England and Greater Manchester means that strong radio and television signals from that region (BBC North West and ITV Granada) can be received in North Wales, and strong Welsh signals can be received in North West England also. In the days of analogue TV, some people who received signals from the Llanddona transmitter, but who had no interest in S4C (a Welsh speaking channel) were known to erect a second aerial and <b>receive</b> <b>Channel</b> 4 from Winter Hill instead.|$|E
50|$|Texas American Broadcasting {{sold the}} station to Region 56 Network, a {{subsidiary}} of Lone Star Broadcasting in 1989. In September 1991, KETK signed on KLSB-TV (channel 19) as a satellite station to serve southern portions of the market that could not <b>receive</b> <b>channel</b> 56's signal (including Nacogdoches). KETK moved its operations to its current location on Richmond Road in Tyler in 1993. Lone Star then sold KETK to Max Television (later Max Media Properties) in 1996. In 1998, the Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired most of the Max Media Properties stations, including KETK. However, in early 1999, Sinclair sold the non-license assets of {{the station to}} the Communications Corporation of America, which operated the station via a time brokerage agreement. Sinclair remained the license holder of KETK until 2004 when ComCorp acquired the station outright.|$|E

5000|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} a device with sequential logic is a television set with [...] "channel up" [...] and [...] "channel down" [...] buttons. [...] Pressing the [...] "up" [...] button gives the television an input telling it to switch to the next channel above the one it is currently receiving. If the television is on channel 5, pressing [...] "up" [...] switches it to <b>receive</b> <b>channel</b> 6. However, if the television is on channel 8, pressing [...] "up" [...] switches it to channel [...] "9". In order for the channel selection to operate correctly, the television {{must be aware of}} which channel it is currently receiving, which was determined by past channel selections. [...] The television stores the current channel as part of its state.
