5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home to see if he could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|It will be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the Virginia was {{a novelty}} in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her {{officers and crew}} strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E

5|$|The tryouts in Cleveland {{were at the}} Hanna Theatre. The dress {{rehearsal}} {{the night before the}} initial performance revealed a number of problems with the show; during the first act alone, Hammerstein dictated eight pages of notes. The sandbag which falls from the light bridge near the end of Act 1 dropped off-cue, nearly striking Isabel Bigley, who played Jeanie. Pett <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the rehearsal was stopped often, as Rodgers sought to work out each problem as it arose, and the rehearsal, which began at 8p.m. lasted until 2a.m.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, it must be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E

5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E
5|$|He had {{a liberal}} {{education}} {{by the standards}} of his age and learned French, German and Latin. He showed a special interest in history and astrology. A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the basic principles of Christian faith. However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on his shoulders. His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lahan {{was born}} in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst {{attending}} Leeds University. Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier {{in order to get}} back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> during their time, John would talk to him about Maya for hours at a time. However, after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael).|$|E

5|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{states that}} King William called upon the King of Mann, Ragnald Guthredsson, {{to fight against}} Harald. Rognvald had {{possibly}} spuriously claims to Harald's lands, because people <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Harald's mother was younger daughter of earl Haakon Paulsson, whereas the elder daughter had married the king of Isle of Man (although Ragnald's father Godfrey of Man had been that lady's stepson and not her own son). Harald, however, retook Caithness at this time. In this campaign, dated to 1201, the Saga tells that Harald came to the stronghold of Bishop John of Caithness, at Scrabster. Bishop John went to meet Harald, apparently to greet him, but the Earl had him seized, tortured and mutilated. The Gesta Annalia reports that Harald tormented Bishop John in this way because he believed that John was an informant set on making trouble between Harald and King William.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E

5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not know}} his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E
5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E
