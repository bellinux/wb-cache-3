5|$|Flooding from Komen was {{worst in}} <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> where water {{distribution}} was contaminated, and entire towns were largely destroyed. Waters started to recede by August4, allowing residents to return home; by September 2015, {{most of the}} displaced residents nationwide had returned home. High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132deaths, at least 55 of whom in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State.</b> Komen was directly responsible for at least 39deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|On April26, {{the local}} Department of Meteorology and Hydrology in Myanmar {{stated that the}} Ayeyarwady, Bago Region, and Yangon regions {{were likely to be}} {{affected}} within two days and <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> within three days. Officials began broadcasting storm warning to the public over radio the following day. Evacuations of at-risk coastal areas were conducted, though specifics are unknown. Once the storm moved inland, residents across the country were advised of the likelihood of widespread heavy rain from the remnant system.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs {{considered}} the cyclone {{as the worst}} to hit Myanmar since 1968. Damage totaled over K621million kyat ($99.2million USD). Officially, there were 236deaths in the country, although there were unconfirmed reports of a death toll as high as 1,000. In the city of Myebon alone, there were 139deaths. Most of the deaths were fishermen from <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> caught at sea.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{republic}} of Burma, the title {{was used for the}} Chief ministers of the following autonomous states, from 1947/48 till the abolition of that autonomy in 1962: Arakan <b>State</b> (<b>Rakhine),</b> Chin <b>State,</b> Kayin State (Kayin), Kayah State (Karenni), Kachin State and Shan State ...|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Soe Win {{graduated}} from the Defense Services Academy (DSA) during its 22nd intake. In June 2008, he became {{the commander of the}} Northern Regional Command of the Myanmar Army in Kachin State. In August 2010, he became Chief of the Bureau of Special Operations-6 (BSO-6), which oversees military operations in Chin and <b>Rakhine</b> <b>States</b> and the Magwe Region.|$|R
25|$|The {{violence}} {{began in}} the towns of Min Bya and Mrauk Oo by the Muslims, but spread across the state. Though the majority of <b>Rakhine</b> <b>state's</b> Muslims are Rohingya, Muslims of all ethnicities were reported to be targets of the violence in retaliation. Several Muslim groups announced {{that they would not}} be celebrating Eid al-Adha because they felt the government could not protect them.|$|R
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Myanmar {{where the}} storm moved ashore, and winds of 157km/h (98mph) were reported. Widespread areas reported winds of 40km/h (25mph). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated {{that up to}} 500mm (20in) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh. There were reports of waves 15m (50ft) in height along the coast. A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> causing damage to water systems. Flooding was visible on satellite imagery {{in the days following}} the cyclone. Eight townships in the state were affected, five of them severely.|$|E
5|$|The JTWC {{estimated}} Mala to {{have been}} a stronger system, with peak winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a pressure of 922mb (hPa; 27.23inHg)— equivalent to a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Their Dvorak values peaked at T#6.5 or 235km/h (146mph). As the powerful storm approached Myanmar, the combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took their toll on Mala. At 0700UTC on April29, Mala made landfall just south of Thandwe in Myanmar's <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> as a very severe cyclonic storm. The JTWC estimated winds at this time {{to have been}} 165km/h (105mph). Rapid weakening ensued once the cyclone moved onshore. Within 12hours of landfall, Mala weakened to a deep depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on April30.|$|E
5|$|Winds {{from the}} cyclone reached 157km/h (98mph) in Myanmar, {{occurring}} {{in conjunction with}} heavy rainfall and a high storm surge. Despite the storm's ferocity, {{the government did not}} report about the cyclone for ten days, as they usually under-report on landfalling storms. The cyclone caused heavy damage throughout <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> destroying or heavily damaging 4,035homes and leaving 25,000people homeless. There was widespread crop damage, resulting in food shortages, and damaged roads disrupted subsequent relief efforts. Damage in Myanmar totaled over K621million kyat ($99.2million USD), making it the worst storm in the country since 1968, and there were 236deaths, with an unofficial death toll as high as 1,000. Although damage was heaviest in Myanmar, the cyclone's effects also spread into neighboring Bangladesh, where strong winds knocked over trees and capsized two ships.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} week of June, based on these two incidents, riots broke out in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>States</b> where rioters torched and {{destroyed}} houses, shops and guest houses and committed killings. Only 77 persons - 31 Rakhine nationals and 46 Rohingyas - lost lives in the incidents. The injured from both sides accounted for around 100. A total of 4,800 houses were burnt out by both sides in anger.|$|R
5|$|On July31, President of Myanmar Thein Sein {{declared}} disaster {{areas for}} Chin and <b>Rakhine</b> <b>states</b> and for Sagaing and Magway regions. On August4, the government issued {{an appeal to}} the international community for assistance. In response, the government of Australia provided A$3million, and the United States Agency for International Development sent US$600,000. Neighboring Bangladesh donated $800,000 worth of medicine, water kits, and other supplies. Assistance from other countries included $775,000 from the United Kingdom, $142,202 from nearby Thailand, $100,000 from the Singapore Red Cross, and $300,000 from China.|$|R
5000|$|In Myanmar, the Mandalay, Magwe, Bago, Irrawaddy, Sagaing, Kayin, Mon, Kayah, Chin and <b>Rakhine</b> <b>States</b> {{and regions}} are heavily affected. [...] " [...] there were cases of deaths {{and loss of}} homes in Kyauk Hta Yan, Htonebo, Myo Lulin and Tatkone villages in Myothit Township, Magwe Region" [...] in early October. [...] "The local {{authorities}} and parties have not provided assistance. These local authorities even harassed us by questioning us and prohibited us to give assistance.” [...] Flooding also has been affecting Shan State. In August, towards {{the beginning of the}} monsoon, central Bago city was inundated requiring boats for navigation and some deaths.|$|R
5|$|Cyclone Mala was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2006 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. In mid-April, an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern Bay of Bengal and nearby Andaman Sea. Over {{a period of several}} days, the system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on April24. Situated within a region of weak steering currents, the storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction. It attained gale-force winds and was named Mala the next day. Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April27 and Mala subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak. Early on April28, the cyclone had estimated winds of 185km/h (115mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Mala to have been slightly stronger, classifying it as a Category4-equivalent cyclone. Steady weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made landfall in Myanmar's <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> on April29. Rapid dissipation took place once onshore and Mala was last noted early the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Giri was {{classified}} a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar. Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, {{this was because}} forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen {{as quickly as it}} did. The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6m (12ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri. According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.|$|E
25|$|The Singaporean foreign {{ministry}} urged calm and restraint by all sides in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> pledging support for efforts by ASEAN to utilise existing mechanisms to provide humanitarian {{assistance to the}} affected people in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> {{in accordance with the}} principles of the ASEAN Charter. Singaporean Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin announced on 19 October 2017 that his country would pledge S$100,000 through the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance (AHA) centre to aid humanitarian efforts in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State.</b>|$|E
50|$|Those who {{identify}} as Rohingyas typically {{reside in the}} northernmost townships of Arakan bordering Bangladesh where they form 80-98% of the population. A typical Rohingya family has four or five surviving children but the numbers up to twenty eight have been recorded in rare cases. According to David Price of Harvard University, Rohingyas have 37% more children between 0 and 9 years old than Myanmar's national average. As of 2014, about 1.3 million Rohingyas live in Myanmar and an estimated 1 million overseas. They form 40% of <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State's</b> population or 60% if overseas population is included. As of December 2016, 1 in 7 stateless persons worldwide are Rohingya per United Nations figures.|$|R
5000|$|Rohingya: {{spoken in}} Arakan State, Burma, and by {{refugees}} from that region, currently living in Bangladesh's Chittagong Division. While {{it is also}} often called Arkani by native speakers, it is unrelated to the <b>Rakhine</b> of Arakan <b>State.</b>|$|R

50|$|Some <b>Rakhine</b> {{scholars}} <b>state</b> {{that the}} name Mrauk U means 'The First Accomplishment' in archaic Arakanese. This {{is based on the}} story of the Arakanese being able to crush an invasion by the Pyu in the mid 10th Century by a Mro prince, Pai Phru. The town is said to be located roughly near the region where the Pyu invaders were decimated. The prince went on to claim the throne of Wethali from his uncle who had murdered the prince's father due to a love scandal. The battle was seen as the first accomplishment of the prince, and thus, the name 'First Accomplishment' came {{to be associated with the}} place.|$|R

50|$|Between January 21, and February 14, 2000, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} participated in an expedition to central <b>Rakhine,</b> formerly Arakan, <b>State</b> {{in the western part of}} Myanmar, formerly Burma, to gain information on the Arakan forest turtle. The expedition yielded one male Arakan forest turtle, with a carapace length of 22.cm, a mass of 1.3 kg, and 18 plastral annuli. It was discovered by a hunter’s dog on 7 February about 30 m from a small stream in bamboo forest on Salu Taung, along the Arakan Yoma. The carapace was severely damaged with signs of abnormal healing.|$|R
40|$|Who are Burma’s minorities? Burma {{has over}} 100 ethnic groups, {{languages}} and dialects and {{is said to}} have the richest ethnic diversity in Asia. Such diversity is attributed to the country’s geographic location on a strategic crossroads, where historically it had acted as a buffer between the neighbouring powers of India, China and Thailand. Over 2, 000 years of cross border migration and intermixing between cultures has {{led to the development of}} diverse ethnic settlements and communities residing both in mountainous frontier zones and lowland plains areas of the country. There is no reliable census data available on Burma’s ethnic minorities, although the government claims that there are 135 ‘national races’. Kachin, Karen, Kayah (Karenni), Shan, Chin, Mon and <b>Rakhine</b> (Arakan) <b>states</b> take on the names of the seven minority groups who historically were able to negotiate state/territorial boundaries with the government. However, in themselves these states are not ethnically homogenous. Of a population of 56 million people, the majority Burman constitute around two thirds. The largest minorities are Shan (9 per cent) and Karen (7 per cent...|$|R

25|$|Insurgents of the Rohingya ethnic {{minority}} {{have been fighting}} local government forces and other insurgent groups in northern <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> since 1948, with ongoing religious violence between the predominantly Muslim Rohingyas and Buddhist Rakhines fueling the conflict. The legal and political rights of the Rohingya people have been an underlying issue in the conflict, with spontaneous bouts of violence such as the 2012 <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> riots and 2013 Myanmar anti-Muslim riots periodically occurring as a result. Despite making up {{a majority of the}} population in the three northern townships of <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> Rohingyas are often targets of religiously motivated attacks. Because the government does not recognise the Rohingya people as an official ethnic group in Myanmar, Rohingyas cannot apply for citizenship and few laws exist to protect their rights.|$|E
25|$|Insurgent {{groups of}} the Chin, Rakhine (formerly Arakanese) and Rohingya ethnic {{minorities}} have fought against the government for self-determination in <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State</b> since the early 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 June, a {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared across <b>Rakhine.</b> According to <b>state</b> TV, the order was given in response to [...] "unrest and terrorist attacks" [...] and [...] "intended to restore security and stability to the people immediately." [...] President Thein Sein added that further unrest could threaten the country's moves toward democracy. It {{was the first time that}} the current government used the provision. It instigated martial law, giving the military administrative control of the region. [...] The move was criticised by Human Rights Watch, who accused the government of handing control over to a military which had historically brutalised people in the region. Some ethnic Rakhine burned Rohingya houses in Bohmu village in retaliation. Over five thousand people were residing at refugee camps by 10 June. [...] Many of the refugees fled to Sittwe to escape the rioting, overwhelming local officials.|$|R

25|$|In May 1946, Muslim {{leaders from}} Arakan, Burma (present-day <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State,</b> Myanmar) met with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, {{the founder of}} Pakistan, and asked for the formal {{annexation}} of two townships in the Mayu region, Buthidaung and Maungdaw, by East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Two months later, the North Arakan Muslim League was founded in Akyab (present-day Sittwe, capital of <b>Rakhine</b> <b>State),</b> which also asked Jinnah to annex the region. Jinnah refused, saying he could not interfere with Burma's internal matters. After Jinnah's refusal, proposals were made by Muslims in Arakan to the newly formed post-independence government of Burma, asking for the concession of the two townships to Pakistan. The proposals were rejected by the Burmese parliament.|$|E
