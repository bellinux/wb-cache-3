To this end, we use time-lapsed confocal microscopy to investigate the interplay among cell motility, three-dimensional (3 D) matrix stiffness, matrix architecture, and transforming potential in a mammary epithelial cell (MEC) cancer progression series. We use a well characterized breast cancer progression model where human-derived MCF 10 A MECs overexpress either ErbB 2, 14 - 3 - 3 f, or both ErbB 2 and 14 - 3 - 3 f, with empty vector as a control.

This study {{assessed}} the neuropsychological {{validity of the}} modality preference measures from the Reading Style Inventory (RSI), an instrument that claims to measure left-hemisphere (analytic, sequential, auditory) and right-hemi-sphere (holistic, simultaneous, visual) reading styles. Older fluent readers (age-matched to the children with disabilities) rated their reading styles more strongly auditory and visual than nondisabled beginning readers (reading-level-matched to the children with disabilities) and children with dyslexia. Compared to both control groups, the dyslexia group was unique in failing to demonstrate {{a high incidence of}} children with strong preferences in either modality.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that prostaglandins (PGs), produced via the cyclooxygenase pathway from arachidonic acid, {{are essential to}} the ovulatory process in the pig. In support of this, ovulation is preceded by an increase in follicular fluid (FF) PG concentration, indomethacin (INDO) suppresses both the PG increase and ovulation, and ovulation can be restored by administration of exogenous PGs (Downey and Ainsworth, 1980; Prostaglandins 19 : 17 - 22). Recent studies in the rat have shown that ovulation is also preceded by a rise in ovarian concentrations of 15 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15 -HETE), a product of the lipoxygenase pathway (Tanaka et al., 1989; Endocrinology 15 : 1373 - 1377) and inhibition of this pathway suppresses ovulation (Reich et al., 1983; Prostaglandins 26 : 1011 - 1020). Furthermore, INDO, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, inhibits 15 -lipoxygenase as well as PG synthesis (Tanaka et al., 1989 Endocrinology 15 : 1373 - 1377). The PMSG/hCG prepuberal gilt model was used to investigate the involvement of 15 -HETE in the procine ovulatory process, and the effect of INDO on the 15 -lipoxygenase pathway. Follicular fluid concentrations of 15 -HETE were elevated 40 h post hCG (p $<$ 0. 01). The effects of INDO and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of lipoxygenase activity, on ovulation rate, FF 15 -HETE and FF PGF$ rm sb{ 2 a}$ were investigated by intraovarian administration of INDO or NDGA. INDO inhibited ovulation rate (p $<$ 0. 01) and PGF$ rm sb{ 2 a}$ (p $<$ 0. 01) as well as 15 -HETE (p $<$ 0. 01). NDGA also suppressed ovulation rate (p $<$ 0. 01) but did not inhibit 15 -HETE or PGF$ rm sb{ 2 a}$ production. In in vitro experiments, 15 -HETE production by both granulosa cell (GC) and theca interna cell (TIC) cultures 40 h post hCG was greater (p $<$ 0. 01) than at 0 h post hCG. INDO inhibited 15 -HETE production in 40 h post hCG TIC cultures (p $<$ 0. 01) but not GC cultures, while NDGA inhibited 15 -HETE production by both cell types (p $<$ 0. 01).

To evaluate the relationship, comparisons of the counties 2 ̆ 7 differing l evel s of tourism versus their levels of welfare are necessary. To make these comparisons, three basic steps were followed. First, a social ordering model was derived. The proposed social ordering model was based upon Maslow 2 ̆ 7 s theory of the hierarchy of human needs. By utilizing his theory, both economic and noneconomic indicators were identified, and a basis was provided upon which to judge the differing positions of well-being. Factor analysis was applied to this model in order to aggregate the indicators and derive a single quality-of-life index. Second, measurement of tourism was developed. A direct measurement {{of the level of}} tourist activity was not available. An indirect indicator of tourism was estimated by taking the proportion of total gross taxable revenue earned by eating and drinking establishments and taxable room sales. The derived indirect variable was more reflective of comparative tourism dependency levels than of the actual level of tourism. Therefore, the variable was renamed touri sm dependency. Third, the correlation between quality-of-life and tourism dependency was calculated. A Pearson correlation coefficient test was performed from which initial <b>results</b> <b>sugge</b> sted a potentially strong negative relationship between the particular qualifiers of well-being used here and tourism. It was apparent that thE two variables that could be defined by certain available indicators were not perfect measurements of the proposed variables, but aspects or components of the desired variables. Each reflected certain attributes of the proposed variables, but not the total concept. A possible explanation for the strong inverse relationship between the qualifiers of quality of life and tourism in this study may be each county 2 ̆ 7 s potential for economic diversification. Other studies have shown that areas that are dependent upon a single resource may experience higher levels of economic, demographic, and social instability as compared to those areas with a more diverse economic base. These factors, which in this model would lead to lower values for the calculated quality -of- life indicator in those counties, were estimated to be more tourist dependent...|$|R

The results presented in the preceding companion paper (1) support the contention of others (2, 3) that the therapeutic efficacy of parenterally injected rTNF, as judged by its ability to cause tumor regression, is unimpressive. It was shown with the SA 1 sarcoma that, in spite of the fact that this tumor is highly sensitive to endotoxin-induced complete regression (4, 5), it does not always undergo regression in response to treatment with TNF, even when near lethal doses are given. The companion paper presented results (1) in keeping with the view that TNFinduced tumor hemorrhagic necrosis is responsible for the rapid destruction of most of the center of the tumor, but that the subsequent regression of the surviving rim of living tumor tissue is dependent on the host being able to generate an underlying antitumor immune response.

The analysis focuses on the properties of prequeue transition flows (PQFs) and queue discharge flows (QDFs) averaged across various time intervals (30 -s, daily average, and long-run average). It is found that the proportion by which flows drop after upstream queues form at all studied bottlenecks ranges from 2 % to 11 %.

Three studies applied this bidirectional link between scarcity andvalue to themeaningofdeath, testing the prediction that death represents {{the scarcity}} of life. In Study 1, reminders of death led to enhanced evaluations of life. In Studies 2 and 3, the monetary (Study 2) and psychological (Study 3) value of life were manipulated. In both studies, when human life was highly valuable, the concept of deathwasmoreaccessible, as predicted from the association between value and scarcity. Previous theoretical treatments of the meaning of death have shared the notion that death is essentially a threat requiring psychological defenses. Thepresent <b>results</b> <b>sugges...</b>|$|E

Simultaneously, Y. enterocolitica prevented prolonged degradation of the inhibitory proteins I�B- � and I�B- � observed by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or nonvirulent, plasmid-cured yersiniae. Analysis of different Y. enterocolitica mutants revealed a striking correlation between the abilities of these strains to inhibit NF-�B and to suppress the tumor necrosis factor � (TNF-�) production {{as well as to}} trigger macrophage apoptosis. When NF-�B activation was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG- 132, nonvirulent yersiniae as well as LPS became able to trigger J 774 A. 1 cell apoptosis and inhibition of the TNF- � secretion. Y. enterocolitica also impaired the activity of NF-�B in epithelial HeLa cells. Although neither Y. enterocolitica nor TNF- � could induce HeLa cell apoptosis alone, TNF- � provoked apoptosis when activation of NF-�B was inhibited by Yersinia infection or by the proteasome inhibitor MG- 132.

40|$|Background: There is {{striking}} social {{variation in the}} timing of the onset of childbearing in contemporary England, with the mean age at first motherhood about 8 years earlier in the most deprived compared to the least deprived neighbourhoods. However, relatively little is known about how these social differences in reproductive schedule develop in childhood. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the development of differences in reproductive schedules, using a crosssectional survey over 1000 school students aged 9 – 15 in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside. Students from more deprived neighbourhoods had earlier ideal ages for parenthood than those from more affluent ones, and these differences were fully apparent by age 11. We found evidence consistent with three mechanisms playing a role in maintaining the socioeconomic gradient. These were: vertical intergenerational transmission (students whose own parents were younger at their birth wanted children younger); oblique intergenerational transmission (students in neighbourhoods where parents were younger in general wanted children earlier); and low parental investment (students who did not feel emotionally supported by their own parents wanted children at a younger age). Conclusions/Significance: Our results shed some light on the proximate factors which may be involved in maintaining early childbearing in disadvantaged communities. They help understand why educational initiatives aimed at adolescents tend to have no effect, whereas improving the well-being of poor families with young children may do so.

Another critique concerns the dependence of K on a particular universal Turing machine U for which predictions for short sequences-shorter for example than typical compiler lengths- can be arbitrary. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not provide a good approximation for short sequences. Herein is suggested an empirical approach to overcome the problem that compression approximations do not work well for short sequences.

40|$|The {{tripeptide}} glutathione is the thiol compound {{present in}} the highest concentration in cells of all organs. Glutathione has many physiological functions including its involvement in the defense against reactive oxygen species. The cells {{of the human brain}} consume about 20 % of the oxygen utilized by the body but constitute only 2 % of the body weight. Consequently, reactive oxygen species which are continuously generated during oxidative metabolism will be generated in high rates within the brain. Therefore, the detoxi®cation of reactive oxygen species is an essential task within the brain and the involvement of the antioxidant glutathione in such processes is very important. The main focus of this review article will be recent results on glutathione metabolism of di€erent brain cell types in culture. The glutathione content of brain cells depends strongly on the availability of precursors for glutathione. Di€erent types of brain cells prefer di€erent extracellular glutathione precursors. Glutathione is involved in the disposal of peroxides by brain cells and in the protection against reactive oxygen species. In coculture astroglial cells protect other neural cell types against the toxicity of various compounds. One mechanism for this interaction is the supply by astroglial cells of glutathione precursors to neighboring cells.

The search for genes involved in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) may have been hindered by the assumption that the different symptoms that define the condition {{can be attributed to the}} same causal mechanism. Instead the social and nonsocial aspects of ASC may have distinct causes at genetic, cognitive, and neural levels. It has been posited that the core features of ASC can be explained by a deficit in empathizing alongside intact or superior systemizing; the drive to understand and derive rules about a system. First-degree relatives also show some mild manifestations that parallel the defining features of ASC, termed the broader autism phenotype. Factor analyses were conducted to assess whether the latent structure of empathizing, systemizing, and autistic traits differs across samples with a high (individuals on the spectrum), medium (first-degree relatives) or low (general population controls) genetic vulnerability to autism. Results highlighted a two-factor model, confirming an empathizing and a systemizing factor.

40|$|We {{investigated}} long-lasting {{interactions that}} may occur between two forms of intercellular signaling: cholinergic synaptic transmission and gap junction-mediated coupling in the rat adrenal medulla. The junctional coupling between chromaffin cells was studied during reduced or blocked synaptic transmission in adrenal slices. First, cholinergic synaptic activity was reduced by pharmacological treatment. Bath-application of the nicotinic receptor antagonists hexamethonium, the oxystilbene derivative F 3, or �-bungarotoxin, acting at distinct neuronal-like postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), significantly increased the incidence of Lucifer yellow passage (dye coupling) between chromaffin cells (p � 0. 7 in treated slices vs p � 0. 4 in controls). Dye coupling was associated with an elevated macroscopic conductance of the junctional current measured by dual patch-clamp. Pharmacological inhibition of protein trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane by either brefeldin A or nocodazole pretreatment prevented the effects of nAChR antagonists on dye coupling. Interestingly, this upregulation of gap junction-mediated coupling in response to reduced synaptic activity is of physiological relevance, because it {{is found in the}} newborn rat, in which cholinergic synaptic transmission has not yet matured. This mechanism may also be of importance in pathological conditions, because chronic blockade of synaptic transmission after surgical denervation of the adrenal gland also resulted in increased dye coupling between chromaffin cells. In conclusion, our pharmacological, physiological, and pathological data concur to demonstrate that gap junction-mediated intercellular communication between chromaffin cells undergoes persistent adaptation in response to impairment of synaptic activity.

Results show that there was moderate to strong agreement between faculty and high school teachers in topic and category identification. Also, there was a moderate relationship between depth of knowledge ratings and item complexity and difficulty based on ratings and student performance. These <b>results</b> <b>sugges...</b>|$|E
40|$|Breat skin {{temperatures}} {{were measured}} at 30 min intervals {{for four days}} in 10 post-menopausal women, one with benign breast disease and two with clinically healthy breasts. The rhythm characteristics of breast skin temperature for the area of skin over the tumour, between 3 and 5 cm in diameter, were compared with a similar site on the contralateral breast using methods of time series analysis. <b>Results</b> <b>sugges</b> that differences exist between the thermal characteristics of left and right breasts in health subject and that these differences tend to be reinforced by a primary cancer in the left breast but reduced, or even reversed, by one in the right breast. It {{may be possible to}} exploit these effects to detect breast cancer at an early stage particularly when the device known as the "chronobra" is available for the automatic collection of breast skin temperature data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Backrest {{position}} {{is a significant}} parameter in hand-cycling that one must consider when seeking to optimize the user-to-chair interface. We studied the effects of backrest position on handcycle propulsion kinematics. Ten nondisabled partici-pants with no handcycle propulsion experience repeated an 8 s sprint with three backrest positions (backrest angle between 45 ° and 50 ° to the horizontal, backrest angle between 65 ° and 70 ° to the horizontal, and without backrest) and three gear ratios (GRs) (GR 22 / 21 = low, GR 32 / 21 = medium, and GR 44 / 21 = high). We used three-dimensional movement analysis to calculate the aver-age maximal velocity, cycle frequency, and angle parameters for the arms and trunk. Our results showed statistically higher trunk flexion/extension (p < 0. 001) and maximal velocity (p < 0. 001) when a backrest was not used. Moreover, these differences were accentuated as the GR increased (GR 44 / 21). Our <b>results</b> <b>sugges...</b>|$|E
40|$|Qa- 2 is a nonclassical class I {{molecule}} encoded by the Q 7 gene {{within the}} mouse {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC). Results from previous experiments on Qa- 2, and on a chimeric Ld molecule (LQ 3) in which the 0 domain is encoded by Q 7 b, suggested that the a 3 domain of Qa- 2 does not carry out the functions typical ofthe 0 domains in other classical and nonclassical class I antigens. Class I molecules that contain the Qa- 2 tx 3 domain are poorly recognized by primary cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and do not function normally in either positive or negative selection in vivo. By employing a cell-cell adhesion assay we demonstrate directly that the Qa- 2 0 domain {{in the context of}} the LQ 3 hybrid molecule cannot bind to human CD 8, although other mouse class 10 domains bind efficiently. In addition, CD 8 -dependent CTLmediated lysis of target cells, in a system which requires mouse CD 8 -class I a 3 domain interactions, is deficient in cells that express the Qa- 2 0 domain. When combined with our earlier work on LQ 3 transgenic mice, these results provide additional molecular support for the hypothesis that interaction with CD 8 is required for both positive and negative selection of class I restricted T cells in the thymus. As the Qa- 2 0 domain sequence does not differ from the previously defined minimal CD 8 binding sequence of other class I molecules, these <b>results</b> also <b>sugges...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vicarious {{trial-and-error}} (VTE) is {{a behavior}} observed in rat experiments {{that seems to}} suggest self-conflict. This behavior is seen mainly when the rats are uncertain about making a decision. The presence of VTE is regarded {{as an indicator of}} a deliberative decision-making process, that is, searching, predicting, and evaluating outcomes. This process is slower than automated decision-making processes, such as reflex or habituation, but it allows for flexible and ongoing control of behavior. In this study, we propose {{for the first time a}} robotic model of VTE to see if VTE can emerge just from a body-environment interaction and to show the underlying mechanism responsible for the observation of VTE and the advantages provided by it. We tried several robots with different parameters, and we have found that they showed three different types of VTE: high numbers of VTE at the beginning of learning, decreasing numbers afterward (similar VTE pattern to experiments with rats), low during the whole learning period, and high numbers all the time. Therefore, we were able to reproduce the phenomenon of VTE in a model robot using only a simple dynamical neural network with Hebbian learning, which suggests that VTE is an emergent property of a plastic and embodied neural network. From a comparison of the three types of VTE, we demonstrated that 1) VTE is associated with chaotic activity of neurons in our model and 2) VTE-showing robots were robust to environmental perturbations. We suggest that the instability of neuronal activity found in VTE allows ongoing learning to rebuild its strategy continuously, which creates robust behavior.

40|$|Abstract:Wnt genes encode a {{large family}} of {{secreted}} cysteine-rich signaling molecules involved in cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Wnt 5 a, a non-transforming member of the Wnt family behaves as a putative oncogene in many cancers including melanomas. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} Wnt 5 a expression in primary oral mucosal melanomas (OMM) and correlate it with tumor thickness. Archival tissues from 18 OMM cases were subjected to immunohistochemical detection of Wnt 5 a by the streptavidin-biotin method. These were categorized into tumors of 4 mm (thick lesions) thickness. Most OMM cases (17 / 18; 94. 4 %) stained positive for Wnt 5 a, though heterogeneously. Seven thick (7 / 11; 64 %) and one intermediate thickness (1 / 7, 14 %) OMM demonstrated strongly positive Wnt 5 a staining (P< 0. 05). The only Wnt 5 a-negative case was a thick OMM without local recurrence after treatment. Strong Wnt 5 a expression at tumor advancing sites suggests a role in local tumor spread. Identification of pleomorphic epithelioid and spindle cells as melanoma cell populations with the most pronounced Wnt 5 a staining suggests that Wnt 5 a overexpression influences cellular phenotype.
