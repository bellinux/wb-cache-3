50|$|Also a {{new form}} of {{concealment}} device, mock cans of various household chemicals or food and drinks can be purchased. A wide variety of commonly used personal care, household products and food containers with <b>removable</b> tops and <b>bottoms</b> are available. Valuables can be discreetly stored inside these lookalike containers and kept in their seemingly rightful places. Each of these diversion safes are indistinguishable from the genuine product, and can thus avoid detection, and they may even be weighted to feel full.|$|R
50|$|Various squeeze bottles for nasal {{irrigation}} {{have also}} been used. The basic design is a plastic squeeze bottle with a straw-like tube. Application of gentle pressure forces the solution through the tube {{and out of the}} tip into the nostril. Newer designs utilize valves to prevent backwash contamination. The medical literature demonstrates that most nasal wash bottles become contaminated after use, even with proper instructions for cleaning. The most advanced squeeze bottle utilizes valve technology and a <b>removable</b> top and <b>bottom</b> cap to maximize cleaning and drying to prevent bacterial and mold growth after use.|$|R

The mast is stayed, rotating, carbon fibre with a <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> section, allowing the mast to be shortened when the sail is reefed. Sail plan is a single Mylar fully battened main sail, with a zip in reef.|$|E

The top portion of its rear above the aluminum [...] "strip" [...] is made of plastic to allow radio reception, while the lower <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> portion (which conceals its MicroSD and SIM card slots) uses a plastic intended to improve grip. The Rhyme was made available in three different colors; [...] "Plum", [...] "Hourglass", and [...] "Clearwater". Only the Plum version was made available in the United States.|$|E
40|$|The molting of the {{epidermis}} {{occurs with}} great regularity in many groups of lizards. In the Amphibia, where this periodicity is less regular, the thyroid {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in the process (Adams, Richards, and Kuder, 1930). Complete cessation of molt has been reported in the common European lizard, Lacerta, fol lowing thyroidectomy (Drzewicki, 1928). Since the investigator ex perimented with only a small series of lizards and since we have observed that lizards in poor health are very irregular in their molting, it seemed highly desirable to repeat his work on a larger scale. We have selected for this purpose a lizard which molts at more frequent intervals than Lacerta. Environmental influences have been ruled out as far as possible by keeping both experimental and control series in a large incubator at a constant temperature and at a humidity which fluctuated only slightly. As already reported in a preliminary note (Noble and Bradley, 1931), we have obtained results very difl@erent from those Drzewicki reported. The present paper represents a de tailed statement of our findings. MATERIALS The lizards we found most convenient to employ in this study were geckos of the species Hemidactylus brookii. Our entire series came from SamanÃ¡, Dominican Republic, where this species, imported from Africa, is now abundant. The lizards were maintained throughout our experiment in cages measuring 50 cm. long, 35 cm. deep, and 33 cm. wide, with glass sides, a <b>removable</b> iron <b>bottom,</b> and a screen top. A layer of sand, frequently changed, covered the floor of each cage, and the lizards were given ample hiding places among strips of cork bark introduced into the cages. From 15 to 20 lizards lived in each cage and since they rarely mutilated one another they appeared to have sufficient room. The lizards were fed with mealworms (Tenebrio molilor) and wax worms (Galleria mellonella) two, or rarely, three times a week. Fresh water was supplied daily. The series of cage...|$|R

This is a cheap and cheerful technique maybe called [...] in some parts but usually, in England at least, [...] "turnin'-em-over". It is the sort of thing which used to be found in Scandinavian-built boats but even with iron nails, on the lands, they were usually properly clenched over roves. Nails fastening timbers were sometimes turned over, particularly where <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> boards were to rest on the timbers. However, it was possible to tread the bottom boards onto the clenched nails and where marks were left, gouge out recesses to accommodate the clenched nails.|$|E
40|$|This work {{illustrates}} {{the potential of}} diamond micro system technologies progressively developed {{in the last years}} for an application in the bio-chemical field. A diamond micro reactor system based on a novel integration concept is presented and the role of diamond in this generic system is described. It consists of reaction chambers with <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> and integrated micro dosage elements allowing the ejection and mixture of two different fluids onto the <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> substrate. As an example, this system is used in a novel DNA-synthesis cycle. In this application the diamond micro reactor system combined with a specifically designed chemistry for the DNA-synthesis enables the parallel production of DNA-chain-clusters with individual Ž. sequence arranged in an array DNA-Chip. 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} the 3 -D distribution of pollutants emitted from a coastal outfall {{in the presence}} of strong sea currents. The problem is solved using the nonlinear Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations in the framework of the k - ε model. The constants of the logarithmic law for the vertical velocity profile in the bottom boundary layer are obtained by processing experimental data from acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). The near-field distribution of pollutants at different distances from the diffuser is obtained in terms of the ambient flow velocity (steady or with tidal effect) and outfall discharge characteristics. It is shown that even in the case where the effluent density is substantially lower than the ambient sea water density the plume can impact the seabed, creating a risk of pollution of <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> sediments...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{problems}} with obesity that the United States is facing today, malnutrition, caused in part by severely low dietary fat consumption, remains a problem among many people living in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization, one third of people in developing countries are malnourished as well as vitamin or mineral deficient. While villagers {{do not have access}} to commercially produced vegetable oil (a common source of dietary fat), nor are industrial scale oil extraction methods appropriate for small scale production. As a result, they turn to traditional methods, such as a mortar and pestle, to extract oil from peanuts, sunflower seeds, and other oil bearing seeds and nuts. This process is both time and labor intensive, and still does not yield sufficient amounts of oil to satisfy the need for it. The need for a small scale press is clear. This thesis introduces a simple design which achieves a yield of 46. 9 mL per cup (U. S.) which matches the yield produced using industrial technologies. This corresponds to 153 % increase in yield and 38. 5 % increase in rate over using traditional methods such as a mortar and pestle. The design consists of two fixed plates connected by four rods, with a third plate which slides along the four guide rods. (cont.) A standard scissor jack is the mechanism by which the necessary pressure of 800 - 1000 psi is generated to extract the oil. A peanut container with a <b>removable</b> <b>bottom</b> holds the peanuts as they are pressed, and holes drilled into its cylindrical face allow the oil to spill out into a collection dish underneath the container. The entire design is compact, with a footprint of one square foot and a height of 22 inches. This is 12 times smaller than the Beilenberg ram press, the standard for small scale presses currently used in developing countries. Experimental results of the loading profile as function of time show that the jack does not need to be turned continuously once the oil begins to appear. This requires significantly less strength than current methods of oil extraction. Although future work is recommended to further develop and improve the press, it shows promise of alleviating the need for such a device in many impoverished parts of the world. by Neera Jain and Somin Lee.
