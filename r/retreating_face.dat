40|$|Ongoing, {{collaborative}} research between CSIRO 2 ̆ 7 s Exploration and Mining and Strata Control Technology {{has resulted in}} a better understanding of rock failure mechanisms around longwall extraction. Failure has occurred further ahead of the <b>retreating</b> <b>face</b> than predicted by conventional longwall geomechanics theory. In some cases significant failure has been detected several hundred metres ahead of the face position with demonstrated influences of minor geological discontinuities. Shear, rather than tensile failure has been the predominant failure mechanism in the environments monitored. Validating technologies of microseismic monitoring and new face monitoring techniques have assisted the development of predictive 2 D computational modelling tools. The demonstrated 3 D consequences of failure has assisted in the ongoing direction of the project to further investigate these effects...|$|E

50|$|Adults create retreats by {{shoveling}} {{sand and}} gravel with their snouts, forming a cavity beneath cover objects. Sometimes, gravel is {{picked up in the}} mouth and moved to the periphery of the retreat. Entrances to these <b>retreats</b> <b>face</b> downstream. Females, {{and to a lesser extent}} males, actively defend their retreats from intruders. Threat displays include flaring and pulsating the gills and curling the upper lip. Intruders which do not flee after this display are attacked and bitten, usually on the end of the tail.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{recent developments}} {{in the use of}} a CFD model for representing the flow of gases in the goaf of <b>retreat</b> <b>faces.</b> In France, it is of highest importance to optimize firedamp drainage in very gassy mines and nitrogen injection in faces prone to spontaneous combustion. Numerical modeling has been used to solve this problem. So the model developed has been first calibrated using a large quantity of field data and could then be used for various simulations. Though still in progress, this research has given promising results, many of them being already set into practice...|$|R

50|$|Hard-fought battles on the Japanese home {{islands of}} Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and others {{resulted}} in horrific casualties on both sides, but finally produced a Japanese <b>retreat.</b> <b>Faced</b> {{with the loss}} of most of their experienced pilots, the Japanese increased their use of kamikaze tactics in an attempt to create unacceptably high casualties for the Allies. After the turning point of the Pacific where a third of the Imperial Japanese Navy fleet was hit in the Battle of Midway, the United States Department of the Navy recommended various positions for and against an invasion of Japan in 1945. Some staff proposed to force a Japanese surrender through a total naval blockade or air raids.|$|R

40|$|The {{past two}} years mark an {{historical}} {{turning point in the}} public policy debate on human-driven climate change. Arguments that the evidence is either inconclusive or that bold action is economically unjustified are now clearly in <b>retreat,</b> <b>faced</b> with an increasingly mature science of climate change and mounting evidence of adverse impacts. Even so, our societies have not yet gotten the full measure of the risks posed by climate change—particularly the risks to health. Nor is it well understood that many risks will be compounded by the actions of coexistent stressors, such as land degradation, water shortages, disruptions to the global cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus, accelerating biodiversity losses, and ocean acidification. Indeed, popu-lation health researchers have been slow to engage in this (admittedly complex) arena—and the formal health secto...|$|R

40|$|In <b>retreating</b> <b>faces,</b> {{dilution}} of firedamp flowing {{out of the}} goaf area at {{the junction}} of face and retum roadway is problematic. Despite important flowrates and high CH 4 drainage efficiencies, {{it has been observed}} that 2 / 3 of firedamp evacuated by the air stream concentrate in this particular place. So äs to progress in preventing such difficulties, it is necessary to better understand the repartition of gas fluxes in the goaf. This has obviously a benefit on firedamp drainage efficiency, but also on the choice of nitrogen injection points and flowrates in case of spontaneous combustion in the goaf. The use of a CFD code, PHOENICS, has allowed Simulation of circulation of three gases : air, CH 4, and N 2. Influence of the face dip on the repartition of CH 4 patterns in the goaf area has been qualitatively demonstrated...|$|R
