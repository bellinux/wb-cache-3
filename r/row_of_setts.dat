Research was based on questionnaire data from various hunting grounds {{of the study area}} and data questions were subsequently checked and updated. 3, 366 badgers were counted in the area of southern Moravia. The average density was 2. 24 individuals per 1, 000 ha of total studied area and 7. 63 individuals per 1, 000 ha of wooded area. Compared to the previous studies it shows, that the population of this area had increased 2. 5 × over the year of 1983. Badgers preffered mixed wood habitats, often in hedgerows and slopes. The majority <b>of</b> <b>setts</b> were situated within the range of altitude 200 – 400 m a. s. l. on the slopes oriented to the south and south – east.

40|$|The badger’s {{population}} density {{has shown a}} general increase in Hungary since the 1980 s. The data show that the species has occurred in wide range in areas (like lowland areas) which are not known as traditional distribution area of badgers. The traditional habitats of badgers in Hungary are the hilly deciduous forests. But in the lowland rea around Debrecen we recognized increasing distribution and {{population density}} of the species. In this study we show the present status of the species in the semi-natural and planted forests and deforested areas around Debrecen and the habitat selection and the morphology <b>of</b> inhabited <b>setts</b> <b>of</b> the badgers living in these forests in a sample area. We recorded data on general distribution by questionnaires sent to hunting companies. The population density and habitat selection of the ample area was measured by recording <b>of</b> locality <b>of</b> <b>setts</b> <b>of</b> badgers. We used the method of line transect and analysis of habitat type through satellite pictures and GPS coordinates. To have data on morphology <b>of</b> <b>setts</b> we recorded the number of entrances, the exposure, overing, macro- and microrelief, occurrence of latrines. Our data show that the badgers are widely distributed {{in this area and}} heir population density reached the density of the species traditional habitats (2, 44 setts/hectare). The habitat selection shows a small preference (Ivlev-index = 30 %) to the forested areas. This small preference to the forests shows that the covering of the habitat is not the single crucial factor of their habitat selection. The level of preference to the several forest types shows that the badgers of the sample areas prefer (Ivlev-index = 58 %) the planted pine forests (Pinus sylvestris). This result is similar to other research results made in other part of Hungary but out of accordance to the results of researches made in England...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} diurnal resting dens (setts) used by Eurasian badgers Meles meles L. in Coto del Rey, Don ana National Park, south-western Spain, and analyse {{the factors}} that determine sett location and selection in relation to territory outlines, soil type and vegetation structure. Setts were located by tracking radio-tagged badgers daily. Badger setts were mainly underground burrow systems with, on average, 2. 6 badger entrances. Frequently, badgers constructed setts by enlarging existing rabbit warrens. Setts were located almost everywhere, but badgers preferred easily dug, well-drained soils with good vegetation cover within foraging habitats. A logistic regression model showed that badgers select sites with high surrounding shrub density, large shrubs covering the burrow {{and close to the}} centre of the territory (in Mediterranean scrubland habitat). The small size <b>of</b> badger <b>setts</b> in Coto del Rey is common to other low density areas, and probably relates to the extent of use (i. e. age of the burrows and number of badgers using them) of the burrow system. The number <b>of</b> <b>setts</b> per badger territory is related positively to territory size. The similarity of sett densities between this low density population and high density populations, points to a minimum number <b>of</b> <b>setts</b> being required to maximize territory use, and to offer easily-available protection. The preservation and improvement of Mediterranean scrubland vegetation, as well as of large and old shrubs, are important for the future conservation of the badger in Mediterranean landscapes. In these areas, and given the impossibility <b>of</b> distinguishing main <b>setts,</b> the estimation <b>of</b> absolute densities in population surveys using main sett numbers should be avoided in favour of relative indices of abundancePeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Are <b>setts</b> {{significant}} determinants <b>of</b> badger socio-spatial organisation, and do suitable sett sites {{represent a}} limited resource, potentially affecting badger distributions? The factors determining diurnal resting den, or sett, location and selection by Eurasian badgers Meles meles L. were investigated in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. 279 sett sites were located. The habitat parameters that {{were associated with}} the siting <b>of</b> these <b>setts</b> were analysed and associations were sought between sett location and character and the body condition and body weight of resident badgers Habitat characteristics in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>setts</b> were significantly different from randomly selected points. Badgers preferentially selected sites with sandy, well-drained soils, situated on NW-facing, convex and moderately inclined slopes at moderate altitude. There was no evidence that sett morphology (number of entrances, sett area, number of hinterland latrines) was affected by the surrounding sett site habitat characteristics. Mean body weight was significantly higher for badgers occupying territories with setts in sandy soils, situated on NW-facing slopes, than in territories with less optimal sett characteristics. Contrary to the hypothesis that the availability of sett sites was limiting, and therefore that sett dispersion dictates the spatial and social organisation of their populations, the badgers were clearly able to excavate new setts. On our measures, these new setts were not inferior to old established ones, despite occupying subsequently exploited sites; the badgers utilising these new setts had neither lighter body weights nor poorer body condition scores. During the period of our study badgers have manifestly been able to dig numerous new setts; as satisfactory sites still remain available, this indicates that suitable sett sites have not yet become a limiting resource. There was no relationship between sett age and the characteristics of the site in which it was dug, as suitable sites were not limiting. Significantly, population expansion during the decade 1987 - 1997 was not constrained by lack <b>of</b> <b>setts,</b> rather the main proliferation in setts occurred after the population size had peaked in 1996.

40|$|Natural England {{receives}} {{an increasing number}} of complaints about problems caused by badgers Meles meles in urban and suburban environments, most of which concern problems caused by the digging <b>of</b> burrows (<b>setts).</b> The aim <b>of</b> our study was to identify factors related to the presence <b>of</b> badger <b>setts</b> in urban and suburban areas, in order to provide information relevant to the development of an urban badger management strategy. We identified habitat factors (including human population density) associated with the presence <b>of</b> badger <b>setts</b> in four extensively surveyed towns or cities in England, in a GIS-based approach using binary logistic regression analysis. Badger sett densities in urban areas were comparable to sett densities in most rural parts of the UK. Thus, badgers can achieve relatively high population densities in urban environments, despite the potential for human-badger conflict. The single most important factor predicting sett location was the type of habitat in which the sett in question was located, followed by the slope of the ground at that location. Sett presence was also predicted by the proximity <b>of</b> other <b>setts,</b> and badgers preferred areas with intermediate human population densities. The population density of badgers in urban and suburban environments appears to be mainly related to the availability of suitable places for locating setts, rather than to factors that would be expected to reflect food availability. This information will help to predict potential sites of badger-related problems and may be relevant to understanding the ecological requirements of other carnivore species that inhabit urban environments, such as red fox Vulpes vulpes, stone marten Martes foina and racoon Procyon lotor...|$|R
