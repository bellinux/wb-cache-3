5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> not precisely known, although the <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{straightforward}} to show that, if the <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> an integral domain, {{the set of}} the fractions form a field.|$|E
5|$|The γ <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3km. The normal optical depth of the γ <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical depth of the γ ring show significant azimuthal variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> not known, {{but it has been}} noticed that the sharp inner edge of the γ <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.|$|E
25|$|Secondary and {{tertiary}} phosphines {{occur in}} cyclic forms. Three-membered <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> phosphiranes (unsaturated: phosphirenes), five-membered <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> phospholanes (unsaturated: phosphole), and six-membered <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> phosphinanes.|$|R
50|$|Muffin <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> metal {{cookware}} {{used for}} oven-baking or griddle-cooking muffins or English muffins. Muffin <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> circle-shaped objects made of thin metal. The <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> about one inch high. Batter is {{poured into the}} <b>rings,</b> which <b>are</b> placed on a griddle. The griddle is then baked in an oven. The muffins and the <b>ring</b> <b>are</b> turned over midway through the baking to bake {{the other side of}} the muffin.|$|R
5000|$|One sided {{primitive}} <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> both semiprimitive <b>rings</b> {{and prime}} rings. Since the ring product {{of two or}} more nonzero <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> not prime, {{it is clear that the}} product of primitive <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> never primitive.|$|R
5|$|The ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> {{known to}} have {{interior}} and exterior shepherd moons—Cordelia and Ophelia, respectively. The inner edge of the <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> in 24:25 resonance with Cordelia, and the outer edge is in 14:13 resonance with Ophelia. The masses of the moons need {{to be at least}} three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively. The mass of the ε <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be about 1016kg.|$|E
5|$|A. c. rajputanae Zukowsky, 1927 : Known as {{the northwestern}} blackbuck. Occurs in northwestern India. Males have a grey sheen {{to the dark}} parts during the {{breeding}} season. The white eye <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> broad all around the eye with the leg-stripe going only down to the shanks.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> bare skin ringing the eye. In some species, such as little ringed plover, the orbital ring {{may be quite}} conspicuous.|$|E
50|$|On February 24, 2016, his Hall of Fame <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> {{shown on}} Pawn Stars; the seller stated his <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> {{given to him}} by his family. Moody's son Daniel later stated that the <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> a fake.|$|R
5000|$|Rings {{with local}} units are in {{particular}} s-unital; s-unital <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> firm and firm <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> idempotent.|$|R
50|$|Some {{confusion}} {{exists between}} Fleischer rings and Kayser-Fleischer <b>rings.</b> Kayser-Fleischer <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> caused by copper deposits, and {{are indicative of}} Wilson's disease, whereas Fleischer <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> caused by iron deposits. One example of a medical condition that can present with Fleischer <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> Keratoconus.|$|R
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Kingston Russell <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> the largest of those in Dorset, measuring 24 by 27 metres (79 feet by 89 feet) in diameter and containing eighteen sarsen stones arranged in an oval shape. The site has not been excavated or been subject to in-depth archaeological investigation.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forge nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, {{and three}} for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord Sauron makes the One Ring, and {{uses it to}} attempt to conquer Middle-earth. Following the Last Alliance of Elves and Men's fall, the <b>Ring</b> <b>is</b> seized by Prince Isildur; and after Isildur was killed by orcs, the Ring lies {{at the bottom of}} the river Anduin for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and {{transforms}} their owners into the Ringwraiths. The One <b>Ring</b> <b>is</b> discovered by Déagol, whose friend, Sméagol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe). Hundreds of years later, Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) finds the Ring in Gollum's cave and takes it back to the Shire.|$|E
40|$|A 27 -year-old Saudi {{man with}} {{dysphagia}} due to multiple esophageal <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> reported and the literature reviewed. Dysphagia due to multiple esophageal <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> very rare. Only 15 {{cases have been}} reported. The patient is usually male and has had dysphagia for many years when presenting. The cause of the <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Theories to explain dysphagia <b>are</b> that the <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> either congenital or an unusual manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux...|$|R
5000|$|... 23 June 1936 - The keel of the airship {{was laid}} {{and the main}} <b>rings</b> <b>were</b> {{fastened}} onto {{the roof of the}} hangar. Although the first few <b>rings</b> <b>were</b> assembled within the hangar, a separate <b>ring</b> assembly shed <b>was</b> completed soon after, and <b>rings</b> <b>were</b> constructed and transported from the shed to the hangar using tracks on the field.|$|R
40|$|Let n be an {{arbitrary}} natural number. The class of (strongly) n-torsion clean <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> introduced and investigated. Abelian n-torsion clean <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> somewhat characterized {{and a complete}} characterization of strongly n-torsion clean <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> given in the case when n is odd. Some open questions are posed at the end...|$|R
5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} benign and {{typically}} develop after {{a person has}} had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{structured}} {{the library}} in three concentric square rings. The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E
5|$|Mathematical models {{show that}} the E <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> unstable, with a {{lifespan}} between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years; therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring, at its narrowest but highest density point. In the 1980s some suspected that Enceladus is {{the main source of}} particles for the ring. This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Regular local <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> {{complete}} intersection <b>rings,</b> but {{the converse}} is not true: the <b>ring</b> [...] <b>is</b> a 0-dimensional complete intersection <b>ring</b> that <b>is</b> not regular.|$|R
5|$|On {{one side}} of the <b>Ring</b> <b>is</b> a large star, {{borrowed}} from the seal of the state of Texas. The oak leaves symbolize strength. On {{the other side of the}} Ring are a cannon, a saber, and a rifle, symbolizing Aggies' preparedness and valor in defending their land. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas symbolize allegiance to both nation and state.|$|E
5|$|Plumes from Enceladus, {{which are}} similar in {{composition}} to comets, {{have been shown to}} be the source of the material in Saturn's E ring. The E <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> the widest and outermost ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.|$|E
5|$|Sparrow's {{weapons are}} genuine 18th century pieces: his sword {{dates to the}} 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived {{production}} of the first film. Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East. Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.|$|E
40|$|A {{generalization}} of injectivity is studied and several properties are developed. Von Neumann regular <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> characterized. Sufficient conditions are given for a ring to admit a strongly regular classical left quotient ring. A nice characterization of strongly regular <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> given. Special direct summands of left self-injective regular and left continuous regular <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> considered...|$|R

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The Lassell ring, {{also known}} as the plateau, is the {{broadest}} ring in the Neptunian system. It is the namesake of William Lassell, the English astronomer who discovered Neptune's largest moon, Triton. This <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a faint sheet of material occupying the space between the Le Verrier ring at about 53,200km and the Arago ring at 57,200km. Its average normal optical depth is around 10−4, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.4km. The ring's dust fraction is in the range from 20% to 40%.|$|E
5|$|The {{detection}} of the Amalthea gossamer ring from the ground, in Galileo images and the direct dust measurements {{have allowed the}} determination of the particle size distribution, which appears to follow the same power law as the dust in the main ring with q=2 ± 0.5. The optical depth of this <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> about 10−7, which is an order of magnitude lower than that of the main ring, but the total mass of the dust (107–109 kg) is comparable.|$|E
