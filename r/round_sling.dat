40|$|The diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the methods of {{mechanical}} stress of standing trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and finding out the insufficiency associated with this method to facilitate the work for next measurements in the subsequent years. There were found wind damages that occurred in the last 15 years. Damages were determined from reports of state of forestry management and from reports of agency forest protection. The method was tested in two locations (in Kostelec and in Bělčice). During testing was wire rope changed for fabric rope, which has better qualities and it is safer. Round slings were placed near to the centre of tree crown, then was tied fabric rope, strain gauge with data logger and hook from the winch rope. The winch was secured by <b>round</b> <b>sling</b> to the anchoring tree. Overall there were tested 10 trees, the applied load was from 320 to 1, 060 kg. In the case, when the tree become broken, there was noted the height of the break point...|$|E
50|$|A {{primary use}} of this knot is to form high {{strength}} (<b>round)</b> <b>slings</b> of cord for connecting pieces of a climber's protection system.|$|R
25|$|The sling, the {{material}} used to wrap {{around the tree}} as the anchor, is generally a simple piece of webbing for basic slacklines. More advanced slacklines are commonly rigged using industrial <b>round</b> <b>slings</b> to wrap the trees for increased strength and durability.|$|R
6000|$|... “I got the box out of {{the hold}} before I was beat; the next man shouldn’t have much trouble in {{hitching}} a <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> it,” he said, and glanced out to sea as he added significantly: “He’d better get through mighty quick.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] {{returned}} the bar-keeper deliberately. [...] "Ez far ez I know Rand,--that ar brother o' yours,--he's one of yer high-toned chaps ez doesn't drink, thinks bar-rooms is pizen, and ain't the sort to come <b>round</b> yer, and <b>sling</b> yarns with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{books and}} papers have all gone in," [...] the Doctor said; [...] "that {{portmanteau}} may as well go. I will carry these two rifles myself; the ammunition is all there except that bag in the corner, which I will <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> my shoulder." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was silence}} and {{the rustle of}} shuffled cards; then once more the voices went up. [...] "Against him! Better let up before he takes your farm. Oh, let him face it and show his grit--the man who <b>slings</b> <b>round</b> his {{hundreds}} can afford to lose!" ...|$|R
60|$|John had {{advanced}} sufficiently near {{to see the}} Roman workmen before he gave the signal. Jonas was a little in advance of him and, as the horn sounded, he saw him step {{out from behind a}} tree, whirl his <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> his head and discharge a stone and, almost simultaneously, a Roman sentinel, some forty paces away, fell with a crash upon the ground.|$|R
60|$|One day Joe Baldwin, {{assisted}} by his old friend, Rooney Machowl, was busily engaged {{down at the}} bottom of the sea, off the Irish coast, slinging a box of gold specie. He had given the signal to haul up, and Rooney had moved away to put <b>slings</b> <b>round</b> another box, when the chain to which the gold was suspended snapt, and the box descended on Joe. If it had hit him on the back in its descent it would certainly have killed him, but it only hit his collar-bone and broke it.|$|R
60|$|As fast as {{he could}} carry the kegs up the banks she slipped <b>slings</b> <b>round</b> them, two at a time, hooked them to a milkmaid's yoke, and went off with them to a shed which served as a stable and {{cowhouse}} in the winter. Against this was a rick of hay. Putting the kegs down she returned for more, and by the time that they were all in the stable her husband had finished his share of the work and had carried the heavy bales of tobacco to the shed. The three horses were already there.|$|R
6000|$|Without {{turning his}} head the gambler replied, [...] "Looking at the boat; she's booming along, just chawing up and {{spitting}} out the river, ain't she? Look at that sweep of water going under her paddle-wheels," [...] he continued, unbolting the rail and lifting it to allow the two men to peer curiously over the guards as {{he pointed to the}} murderous incline beneath them; [...] "a man wouldn't stand much show who got dropped into it. How these paddles would just snatch him bald-headed, pick him up and slosh him round and <b>round,</b> and then <b>sling</b> him out down there in such a shape that his own father wouldn't know him." ...|$|R
60|$|Ascending to {{the deck}} again, he slackened out the {{headrope}} attached to a heavy stone that served as an anchor; then he hauled on the rope ashore until he felt the stern touch the sand. Making fast the rope, he lowered himself down and waded to shore. Then he brought off the muskets and ammunition, pork and melons on his head, and lastly got the barrel of water alongside, put a <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> it, fastened the main halliards to it, and hoisted it on board. He was {{now in a position}} to make off, but still altogether inadequately provisioned for such a voyage as he meditated, and after some thought he determined to return on shore.|$|R
60|$|The mist had {{dissolved}} under {{a rising}} sun when Duane {{made his first}} halt some {{miles north of the}} scene where he had waited for the hounds. A barrier to further progress, in shape of a precipitous rocky bluff, rose sheer from the willow brake. He skirted the base of the cliff, where walking was comparatively easy, around {{in the direction of the}} river. He reached the end finally to see there was absolutely no chance to escape from the brake at that corner. It took extreme labor, attended by some hazard and considerable pain to his arm, to get down where he could fill his sombrero with water. After quenching his thirst he had a look at his wound. It was caked over with blood and dirt. When washed off the arm was seen to be inflamed and swollen around the bullet-hole. He bathed it, experiencing a soothing relief in the cool water. Then he bandaged it as best he could and arranged a <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> his neck. This mitigated the pain of the injured member and held it in a quiet and restful position, where it had a chance to begin mending.|$|R
60|$|Austin, however, {{discovered}} that he had very little time to think of Jefferson. The Spaniards were on results, too, and when the chain sling came rattling down the strenuous toil began. The hold was dim and shadowy, as well as insufferably hot, and filled with nauseating smells. The tiers of barrels slanted so that one could scarcely stand on them, but when somebody gave Austin a handspike he took his place with the rest, and set about prizing loose the puncheons {{so that they could}} get a <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> them or the hoisting-crabs on the stave-ends. Now and then the crabs slipped, or tore through the oil-soaked wood when the great barrel swung up into the sunlight, and it came crashing down; while each time they made an opening, the rest slipped down, grinding upon each other, and squeezed it up again. Those on the lower side were water-borne, but the others were only held in place by those beneath them on the incline, and the men could not keep the untouched tiers intact as they would have done had the Cumbria been floating level.|$|R
6000|$|... "I put {{a letter}} from that person I have {{mentioned}} {{into one of the}} stoppered bottles of my dressing-case, along with the mate's warning, in case I lived to see him again. I hung this, and a flask of whisky, in a <b>sling</b> <b>round</b> my neck; and, after first dressing myself in my confusion, thought better of it, and stripped, again, for swimming, to my shirt and drawers. By the time I had done that the hammering was over and there was such a silence that I could hear the water bubbling into the scuttled vessel amidships. The next noise was the noise of the boat and the villains in her (always excepting my friend, the mate) shoving off from the starboard side. I waited for the splash of the oars in the water, and then got my back under the hatch. The mate had kept his promise. I lifted it easily--crept across the deck, under cover of the bulwarks, on all fours--and slipped into the sea on the port side. Lots of things were floating about. I took the first thing I came to--a hen-coop--and swam away with it about a couple of hundred yards, keeping the yacht between me and the boat. Having got that distance, I was seized with a shivering fit, and I stopped (fearing the cramp next) to take a pull at my flask. When I had closed the flask again, I turned for a moment to look back, and saw the yacht in the act of sinking. In a minute more there was nothing between me and the boat but the pieces of wreck that had been purposely thrown out to float. The moon was shining; and, if they had had a glass in the boat, I believe they might have seen my head, though I carefully kept the hen-coop between me and them.|$|R
