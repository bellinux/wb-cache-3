5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} {{to the scene of}} an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly <b>random</b> <b>series</b> of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly <b>random</b> <b>series</b> of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E

[...] Daft Punk felt that while current technology allows for an unlimited capacity to store recorded material, the content produced by contemporary artists had diminished in quality. Their goal was therefore to maximize the potential of infinite storage by recording a sprawling amount of elements. The duo pointed to the process as being further inspiration for the album's title, as they sought to make connections out of the <b>random</b> <b>series</b> of ideas.|$|E

The second characterization ties the modulus to the field’s <b>random</b> Fourier <b>series</b> representation. As an application, it is shown that the fractional stochastic heat equation has, up to a non-random constant, a given spatial modulus of continuity if and only if the same property holds for a fractional antiderivative of the equation’s additive noise; a <b>random</b> Fourier <b>series</b> characterization is also given.
