40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Studies {{towards the}} total {{synthesis}} of (+) -Phomactin A (1), D (6), and G (9), fungal metabolites with unique molecular architecture and pronounced biological activity, are described. These studies {{resulted in the}} synthesis of advanced intermediates 354 and 356, which contain all of the carbon atoms of 1, 6 and 9. A Horner-Wadsworth Emmons olefination of aldehyde 186 and β-keto ester 289 was utilized to construct enone 311. A novel Stryker conjugate reduction / aldol cyclization sequence provided alcohol 312, constituting the B ring of 1, 6 and 9. A subsequent elimination of the alcohol in 312 provided a divergence point towards 6 and 9. Attempts to close the 12 -membered macrocycle of 6 and 9 from 303 and 316 / 317 via ring closing metathesis solely provided intermolecular metathesis products 318 and 319. A second generation approach to close the 12 -membered macrocycle exploited {{the use of a}} <b>relay</b> <b>ring</b> closing metathesis. This method exploited the use of a relaying tether to orchestrate catalyst movement to close the macrocycle of 354 and 356...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} methodologies {{developed}} in our research group have inspired the three separate projects reported. First, the total synthesis of (±) -quebrachamine {{was performed in}} 13 steps and 17. 8 % overall yield. Highlights of the synthesis include an efficient preparation of a functionalized indole core via a [3 + 2] annulation cycloaddition reaction between a functionalized nitrile and donor-acceptor cyclopropane and a photo induced 9 -membered ring closure. Secondly, we have reported the most efficent and highest yielding route to several tetrahydroisoquinocarbazoles, where the core was prepared in six steps from tryptophol in 51 % overall yield. This work highlights {{for the first time}} the synthetic utility of the dipolar C- 2 alkylation of 3 -substituted indoles with 2 -alkoxycyclopropanoate esters. The synthesis also features a selective SmBr 2 -HMPA promoted ring closure of an aldehyde onto a sterically congested trisubstituted alkene. Lastly, we have developed efficient syntheses towards several fragments of biselide A, which could be used to explore both ring closing metathesis and <b>relay</b> <b>ring</b> closing metathesis to construct the 14 -membered macrolactone. The trans-THF ring was furnished by using our second generation Co(nmp) 2 catalyst in a Mukaiyama oxidative cyclization, while the chloroalkene moiety was introduced with a chloropalladation reaction. Key steps in the synthesis of the southern fragment included a Sharpless asymmetric kinetic resolution, or a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Significant synthetic efforts toward biselide E have also been reported. We have designed an efficient method to access the western fragment, which also employed our second generation Co(nmp) 2 catalyst in a Mukaiyama oxidative cyclization to furnish the trans-THF ring. A proficient method towards the eastern fragment was also designed, using a Suzuki coupling reaction as the key step...|$|E
40|$|Hypoestoxide {{is a novel}} diterpenoid {{isolated}} from a tropical shrub, hypoestes rosea. It {{has been shown to}} exhibit promising anti - cancer, malarial, and inflammatory activity. In particular, the in vivo anti-angiogenic activity that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) make it especially interesting. Along with this biological profile, the challenging macrocyclic structure of hypoestoxide makes it a target of great interest to the synthetic community. The synthesis of this molecule's complex macrocyclic core was accomplished by using <b>relay</b> <b>ring</b> closing metathesis, and post-cyclization modifications were controlled by the shape of the molecule. Platensimycin is a recently isolated natural product produced by Streptomyces platensis. It was discovered in a novel antibiotic assay by screening a large number of South African soil samples. Platensimycin has been shown to have a unique mechanism of action by inhibiting Fab F, an enzyme responsible for bacterial fatty acid synthesis. In addition to the exciting biological activity, platensimycin has an intriguing molecular structure consisting of a hydrophobic and structurally compact core, and a hydrophilic aromatic head group. The synthesis of this molecule relied on a novel vinyl oxirane ring expansion to access the oxa-bicyclic moiety and an alkylative dearomatization to complete the carbocyclic core. Guttiferone G belongs to the family of [3. 3. 1] bicyclic polyprenylated phloroglucinol derived natural products, which have been {{isolated from}} various plant species found primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions. Their biological profiles have been shown to rival any known natural product class in terms of diversity and activity. It is this vast biological activity and structural similarity that make the development of a general approach to this family of particular interest. The common bicyclic core of these compounds was accessed by using an intramolecular bis-radical cyclization into a dienone that was itself made by oxidative dearomatization...|$|E
50|$|These exchanges used a relay {{to detect}} a drop in line voltage (usually to less than -10V off-hook, {{compared}} to -48V when on-hook) to begin billing for a call; a separate <b>relay</b> controlled <b>ringing</b> on the line. The black box placed a resistor in series with the line, so that the off-hook voltage was closer to -36V: just enough to stop the ringing, {{but not enough to}} trigger billing. A bypass capacitor was often added to prevent the device from attenuating AC signals such as transmitted voice.|$|R
50|$|When the {{subscriber}} line is called, a relay on the subscriber {{line card}} connects the ringing generator to the subscriber line. The exchange also sends a ringback tone to the calling party. When the called party answers {{by taking the}} telephone handset off the switchhook, the subscriber's telephone draws direct current from the central office battery. This current is sensed by the line card and the <b>ringing</b> <b>relay</b> is de-energized.|$|R
40|$|Power system {{includes}} many variety of equipment. A lot {{more amount of}} circuit breakers and relays are necessary to protect the system. The relays in the power system should be coordinated correctly so as to prevent mal-operation and therefore to avoid the unneeded outage of healthy section of the system. The overcurrent relays are usually the foremost protection product in a distribution system. Overcurrent relay is typically used as backup protection. But {{in a number of}} situations it may become the only protection supplied. A relay should get sufficient possibility to protect the area under its main protection. Just if the main protection does not clean the fault, the actual back-up Protection must start tripping, and as a result, overcurrent relay coordination in power distribution system is a important issue of protection engineer. The overcurrent <b>relay</b> coordination in <b>ring</b> fed distribution systems is a very constrained optimization trouble. The purpose is usually to discover an optimum relay setting to minimize the time of interruption of the power source and {{to stay away from the}} mal-operation of relay. This research talks about linear programming technique for optimum coordination of overcurrent <b>relays</b> in a <b>ring</b> fed distribution system...|$|R
40|$|ATM {{is based}} on the efforts of the ITU-T Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) standard. It was {{originally}} conceived as a high-speed transfer technology for voice, video, and data over public networks. The ATM Forum has broadened the ITU-T's vision of ATM for extended use over public and private networks, multi-protocol support and mobile ATM. There are also some ATM applications in High Performance Computing (HPC). ATM is a packet switching technique based on a virtual circuit mechanism. Data flows are statistically multiplexed and communication resources are dynamically shared. Therefore the high performance ATM switch is essential for quality of services (QoS). This thesis introduces typical ATM switch architecture design and analyses design problems. The research objective is to propose a switch architecture design that can solve or improve those existing problems to achieve a superior performance. The research goal is an integrated ATM switch architecture that will handle both unicast and multicast packets. Unlike the usual design for the multicast ATM switch which concentrates on a cell copy network with a unicast switching network, the proposed switch architecture processes the network packets in a single switching block, and allows unicast and multicast packets to co-exist without competing. The switch design has a simple topology and operation principle and is easy to implement. Furthermore, no copy network is required. Three major components are proposed to form the core of the new switch architecture: the parallel buffering strategy for improved buffer performance, the fast table lookup algorithm for packet duplication and routing, and the <b>relay</b> <b>ring</b> controller for solving the contention problem associated with multiple packets destined for the same output port. A mathematical model is presented and its numerical results are analysed. In addition, the simulation algorithms for the proposed switching design are presented and compared against the switching design with input and output buffering strategies. The simulation results are also compared and analysed against the numerical results. A multicast traffic model is also presented. Its performance calculation for the proposed switch is achieved through simulation. Performance analysis is compared against the output buffering switch under the same multicast traffic model. The performance analysis shows that the proposed switch architecture achieves high throughput with low cell loss rate and low time delay. Its performance can be as good as the output buffering strategy or better. Therefore the proposed switch design has solved the problems associated with input and output buffering. This thesis also analyses the complexity of the proposed switch architecture and suggests a topology to build a large scale ATM switch. The suitability and feasibility for production implementation are also addressed...|$|E
5000|$|The first radio {{receivers}} invented by Marconi, Oliver Lodge and Alexander Popov in 1894-5 used a primitive radio wave detector called a coherer, invented in 1890 by Edouard Branly and improved by Lodge and Marconi. [...] The coherer was a glass tube with metal electrodes at each end, with loose metal powder between the electrodes. [...] It initially {{had a high}} resistance. When a radio frequency voltage {{was applied to the}} electrodes, its resistance dropped and it conducted electricity. In the receiver the coherer was connected directly between the antenna and ground. In addition to the antenna, the coherer was connected in a DC circuit with a battery and relay. When the incoming radio wave reduced the resistance of the coherer, the current from the battery flowed through it, turning on the <b>relay</b> to <b>ring</b> a bell or make a mark on a paper tape in a siphon recorder. In order to restore the coherer to its previous nonconducting state to receive the next pulse of radio waves, it had to be tapped mechanically to disturb the metal particles. [...] This was done by a [...] "decoherer", a clapper which struck the tube, operated by an electromagnet powered by the relay.|$|R

Hal and Ace shoot their way into The Centre's core but a hallucinogenic attack disorients them; a thick red fluid jams their weapons and almost suffocates them.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{high-speed}} Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) applications has motivated the use of millimetre waves operation in Ka band, point-to-multipoint fixed cellular with a large bandwidth of 0. 5 – 1. 55 GHz. This service {{is also known as}} Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS). It has the advantages of rapid installation, scalability, high capacity, ease of deployment and low initial infrastructure costs; and could be an attractive alternative to other broadband access technologies. However, the service is limited up to 8 km of coverage area due to line of sight constraints. Co-channel interference and rain attenuation are major limitation factors to system performance. This study is conducted to analyse LMDS performance based on local rain cell profile. The long-term cumulative rainfall rate was obtained from weather radar data. This data is compared with ITU-R recommendation and data from rain gauge network. The influence of rain length distribution probability to different rain rate thresholds had been studied from the database for an area size of 25 km 2. The target is to design LMDS that reaches up to 5 km of cell size service with good availability. Four architectures of fixed BWA were investigated in terms of a carrier to interference ratio (C/I) using three types of modulations which are QPSK, 16 -QAM and 64 -QAM. The rain cell profile results shows that higher rain rates experience shorter rain length. The rain rates at 0. 01 percentage of time for radar data in UTM is 106. 25 mm/hr and rain length was less than 0. 46 km. Besides, during low rain rate events, the LMDS service coverage has better performance than clear sky. This is due to fact that the low rain rates present low attenuation to the desired signal but causes high attenuation to interfering base station signals, resulting in better C/I performance. During heavy precipitation, the effective service coverage area will reach to less than 2 km using QPSK in conventional architecture at 99. 99 % availability. In addition, the co-channel interference can be reduced by using certain design-rule for various architectures. Moreover, it was observed that by decreasing LMDS cell size, the service coverage performance would improve. Two methods had been proposed to improve the performance. One is to use different architectures namely conventional with 4 frequency reuse, simplex <b>ring</b> <b>relaying</b> and dual <b>ring</b> <b>relaying.</b> The second method is to reduce the LMDS service size, i. e. to determine appropriate cell size which offers 99. 99 % availability. It showed that, for conventional architecture, 3 km cell size was sufficient to reach the required availability based on local climate. In addition, 5 km service cell size for 99. 98 % availability can be achieved by using dual ring architecture. All the information are important to present BWA network architectures for Malaysian environment based on rain intensity distribution extracted from radar data...|$|R
