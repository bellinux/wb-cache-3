To take these limits, {{it is necessary to}} know what parameters T depends upon. There is only one dependent source in this circuit, so as a starting point the <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> related to this source is determined as outlined in the article on <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

The results showed that under low temperature, 52. 5 % dosage, 20 % <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> to the anaerobic tank and 75 % <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> to the aerobic tank, the process could not only realize the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal, but also could reduce the operational cost...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The air return value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the returned air. This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio,</b> three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The return air in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography. Hereby, carbon dioxide is added to the return air. This induces a larger amount of radiationbeing given off in the infrared region. This radiation from the return air is visualized using an infrared camera...|$|R

40|$|The air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> is a {{key factor}} for the overall {{efficiency}} of the open volumetric receiver concept. Although first measurements of the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> exist for smaller setups of the open volumetric receiver concept, so far no measurement of the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> has been presented for the Solar Thermal Test and Demonstration Power Plant Jülich (1. 5 MW, 10 (kg air) /s; 700 °C). This paper describes {{the application of a}} tracer gas method at the Solar Tower Jülich to determine this substantial ARR. As tracer gas the environmentally friendly helium has been chosen. The helium is injected dynamically into the circular air flow of the system and the helium mole fraction is measured using a mass spectrometer. The dynamic concentration response of the system is used to determine the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> This dynamic method only requires one location of measurement. First measurements with this dynamic method were conducted at the Solar Tower Jülich. The ARR of STJ was measured with and without irradiation of the main receiver with high accuracy. Under low-wind conditions and without irradiation of the main receiver the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> was measured to be (67. 7 ± 0. 5) ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access restricted, at author's request, from March 26, 2017 - March 26, 2018 Nonprofit {{organizations}} are feeling increased pressure {{to demonstrate their}} service’s impacts to their investors. Social return on investment is a tool that measures the social efficiency, or social return, of services by calculating a social <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> While social <b>return</b> on investment has seen increasing use by nonprofit organizations, a lack of standards in the social <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> calculation leads to resource intensive analyses and results that cannot be effectively compared. In practice, this limits social return on investment analysis to nonprofit organizations with high available resources and limits its usefulness as a benchmark for service impacts. The objective {{of this research was}} to create a tool that calculates a social <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> for services supporting anti-poverty welfare programs for Oregon nonprofit organizations receiving government funding. This research categorized nonprofit organizations by service impacts using Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as a framework. A standardized social return on investment reporting tool was created which calculates a social <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> for nonprofit organizations within service categories that support anti-poverty welfare programs. Findings from this research support the hypothesis that the social return on investment reporting tool reduces resource requirements for nonprofit organizations. The findings also indicate the social return on investment reporting tool supports future benchmarking efforts by providing a consistent calculation and comparison framework for nonprofit service impacts. However, nonprofit organizations will likely need to develop a system for collecting client outcome data before this tool can be used for full benchmarking...|$|R
