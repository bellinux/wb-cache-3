5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a <b>rotorcraft</b> in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of <b>rotorcraft</b> using the concept.|$|E
5|$|In February 2002, the US Marine Corps {{commenced}} a {{study to}} identify potential replacement <b>rotorcraft</b> for the aging Sikorsky VH-3D presidential transport helicopters. On 18 December 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the supply of 23 helicopters {{to be used as}} a replacement for the 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns of the Marine Corps' HMX-1 squadron, which performs the role of Presidential helicopter transportation; this requirement was given the designation of VXX, or the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. Two companies, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky Aircraft responded to the VXX RFP; additionally, that had been interest in a potential Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey-based bid, however the <b>rotorcraft</b> was deemed to be non-transportable by military airlift and thus unsuitable to qualify.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{had shown}} {{interest}} in the V-22. In 2009, Israel reportedly favored the Sikorsky CH-53K over the V-22. In 2011, Israel was interested in using the V-22 to support special operations and search and rescue missions. In 2013, Israel was interested in a possible lease of six to eight aircraft for special operations missions; the type is not {{to act as a}} replacement for existing <b>rotorcraft.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{are being}} {{expected to be}} used for the vegetational observation and the information collection of disaster sites. Especially, <b>rotorcrafts</b> typified by helicopters are attractive, because they are able to hover and achieve vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). However, <b>rotorcrafts</b> have a disadvantage that it cannot have a long-distance flight, because they fly by the thrust of upward direction. Aircrafts with tilt rotors are developed in order to overcome such disadvantages. Such aircrafts can be hovering and take a VTOL and also a long-distance flight by changing the angle of the rotor. In this research, it is aimed at proposing a VTOL-type UAV with a fixed-wing and four tiltable rotors and controlling it. </p...|$|R

5|$|Subsequently, the Army {{decided to}} pursue {{development}} of another battlefield scout helicopter under the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program; this resulted in another <b>rotorcraft,</b> designated as the Bell ARH-70, being selected and developed with the intention to replace the OH-58D {{in place of the}} Comanche. However, during October 2008, it was announced that the ARH-70 also met with cancellation, reportedly due to cost overruns on its development.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the <b>rotorcraft</b> was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from its}} method of propulsion, the Djinn was a {{relatively}} conventional helicopter, featuring a two-seat side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cabin. The cockpit is provided {{with an array of}} plexiglas panels, which provide the occupants {{with a high level of}} all-round visibility. Directly to the rear of the cockpit was the <b>rotorcraft's</b> single Palouste engine. The engine lacked any electronics and had to be hand-started via a crank handle located on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Djinn possessed the ability to fly at high overload weights for around 5 sec by correctly harnessing the accumulated kinetic energy of the rotor; this 'jump' technique was successfully used to achieve certification for it to be operated to carry heavy payloads, some of which could represent up to 54 per cent of the <b>rotorcraft's</b> overall gross weight.|$|R
40|$|The rotor {{noise level}} {{is one of}} the main design {{parameters}} for future <b>rotorcrafts.</b> This fact requires accurate aeroacoustic prediction tools.

5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 <b>rotorcraft.</b> At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes. As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was to have all of the planned capabilities included.|$|E
5|$|During November1993, {{assembly}} of the first prototype commenced at two separate locations, these being Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later on, all of the rotorcraft's sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In the following year, the number of prototypes to be produced was reduced from four to two <b>rotorcraft.</b> On 25May1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4January1996, the prototype, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The first flight had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed {{by a number of}} structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its first flight, before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Time Magazine ran {{an article}} condemning the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and {{completely}} inadequate; the Marine Corps responded {{by arguing that}} parts of the article's data were dated, obsolete, inaccurate, and reflected expectations too high for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, it was reported by the controversial defense industry supported Lexington Institute that the average V-22 mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was {{approximately half of the}} average accident rate for the USMC fleet; the V-22's accident rate was the lowest of any Marine <b>rotorcraft.</b> In 2011 Wired Magazine reported that the safety record was achieved by excluding ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting was to the same standards as other aircraft in the Department of the Navy.|$|E
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the <b>rotorcraft's</b> engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the engine area could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the <b>rotorcraft's</b> relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{advanced}} <b>rotorcrafts</b> requires {{the ability to}} analyse sophisticated, interdisciplinar systems to a degree of re#nement that only recently has become achievable at a low price, thanks to the improvements in computer power. Multi-body analysis allows the detailed modeling of the kinematics {{as well as of}} the structural properties of rather sophisticated mechanical systems, such as helicopter rotors. When integrated with aeroservoelastic analysis, it represents a powerful tool for both the analysis and the design of aircrafts, with particular regard to <b>rotorcrafts.</b> An original multi-body formulation is presented, based on the direct writing of a system of di#erential-algebraic equations #DAE# that describe the equilibrium and the kinematic constraints of a structural system.

5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing <b>rotorcraft,</b> including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeingâ€“Sikorsky and Bellâ€“McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeingâ€“Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, <b>rotorcraft,</b> piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E
