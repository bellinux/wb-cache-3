5000|$|PaR Systems {{was awarded}} the {{subcontract}} for the Main Crane System (MCS) for the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement. the system consists of two overhead bridge cranes, which support two 50-ton trolley hoists, and a Mobile Tool Platform (MTP). The MTP is suspended from a third trolley using a wire rope tensile truss with three paired winches, giving the platform six degrees of freedom. the MTP {{is equipped with a}} wide variety of tools, including a manipulator arm, that will be needed to dismantle the Sarcaphagus and reactor building so that the radioactive material can be moved to more stable containment. The bridges are 96 m long, and run on a 150 m long <b>runway</b> <b>track</b> with six rails. There are shielded garages along the track to allow tools to be exchanged to and from the bridges for maintenance and different operations.Engineering was done by PaR Systems, and manufactured by PaR Systems and PaR Marine.|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that visual {{perception}} of the take-off board and the subsequent regulation of the approach run occur 4 - 5 strides prior to take-off. Contrast in visual perception {{is determined by the}} difference in colour and occurs when a surface of one colour induces its antagonist colour in an adjoining surface. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if colour contrast between the track surface and the board affects the stride regulation pattern at the long jump approach run. Four long jumpers performed long jumps in two different occasions: 6 from a <b>runway</b> <b>track</b> coloured blue, with a white take-off board and 6 from a modified yellow board. The runway was marked and the approach runs were recorded with a panning camera. Toe- board distance (TBD) for each support phase in every run-up and the percentage distribution of adjustment of the regulated strides was calculated. With the white take-off board, the average TBD variability reached its peak value (21. 74 cm) on the 5 th stride from the board and at a distance of 9. 77 m from take-off point. With the yellow take-off board the average TBD variability culminated (24. 80 cm) on the 7 th stride from the board and at a distance of 13. 40 m from take-off point. With the white board, 80 % of the adjustment was distributed during the last two strides as opposed to 61 % with the yellow board. When a take-off board of a colour complementary to the runway’s blue track surface is used, athletes initiated their regulation 2 strides earlier. This may be attributed to an enhanced visual perception of the approaching target allowing a more uniform distribution of adjustments during the last two strides of the approach...|$|E
5000|$|At 5:09 AM {{a report}} {{came into the}} tower that an {{aircraft}} had crashed on Stukel Mountain.

50|$|During March 1944 RAF Marham {{closed for}} the {{construction}} of new concrete <b>runways,</b> perimeter <b>track,</b> and dispersal areas, marking the end of its wartime operations. The three new runways were of the familiar wartime triangular pattern, but Marham was one of only two sites built as a heavy bomber airfield (the other was nearby RAF Sculthorpe) with the runways 50% longer than a standard wartime layout (9,000ft/6,000ft/6,000ft rather than 6,000ft/4,000ft/4,000ft) and also being 200 feet wide rather than the standard 150 feet.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} track {{layout of}} Lulsgate Aerodrome {{was used in}} 1949. This layout was 1.9 miles (3.0 km) long. The circuit used the main <b>runway</b> and perimeter <b>track</b> of the airfield. The start/finish straight was located after the kink after North Corner on the runway.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} {{military}} control Snetterton Heath was privately purchased in 1952 {{with a view to}} using the <b>runways</b> and perimeter <b>tracks</b> as a motor racing circuit. The first motor cycle meeting was held in 1953 and the first motor races the following year.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{consisted of}} two Sommerfeld <b>Tracking</b> <b>runways,</b> a concrete perimeter track, 1 T1 building and 8 Blister Hangars. Most of this infrastructure was added in 1942. Some of the original buildings remain in situ though the site has been returned to agricultural use. The control tower has been preserved.|$|R
50|$|Spilsby {{remained}} on RAF maps as a designated emergency landing {{site for the}} Vulcan bombers based at RAF Scampton.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential to code message criticality into a pilot’s datalink display while taxiing with an electronic moving map (EMM). Five coding conditions were tested: non-expedite text, expedite text, expedite color, expedite icon, and expedite reverse video. datalink text messages appeared as pilots taxied toward a designated <b>runway.</b> Eye <b>tracking,</b> magnitude of response, and mean taxi speed data was collected to measure pilot’s reactions to the events. Subjective participant preference data was also collected via a post-experiment survey. The {{results from this study}} suggest a beneficial trend for using some form of salience coding (color, icon and reverse video) for conveying urgency in a datalink message, and confirm the need to further study how urgency levels should be coded into datalink messages...|$|R
2500|$|With {{the end of}} {{military}} control, the airfield was largely returned to agricultural use {{with most of the}} perimeter <b>track,</b> <b>runways</b> and hardstands removed. A small airstrip was built on a part of the former perimeter track which is used for light aircraft. [...] The control tower was restored in 1977 and was turned into the 100th Bomb Group Memorial Museum. Several World War II era buildings remain in various states of decay.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, RAF Spilsby, a bomber {{airfield}} {{designed for}} Lancaster bombers, was built at Great Steeping. It opened for operations on 20 September 1943. Later {{used by the}} United States Air Force as a strategic bomber base until 1958, the airfield was finally demolished in the late 1970s. The <b>runways</b> and perimeter <b>track</b> were torn up, {{with most of the}} crushed aggregate being used {{in the construction of the}} new Humber Bridge.|$|R
50|$|It {{was used}} as a {{practice}} landing ground by nearby RAF Hullavington, home of No. 9 Service Flying Training School RAF. Flying training expanded considerably and the facilities were upgraded. Waterlogging was a frequent problem for the grass surface, so two <b>runways</b> of Sommerfeld <b>Tracking</b> were laid and a tarmac perimeter track constructed around the field. There were five hangars on the eastern and south-eastern side of the site; the control tower is still extant.|$|R
