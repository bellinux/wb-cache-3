25|$|An {{influential}} cognitive-behavioral {{approach to}} addiction recovery and therapy has been Alan Marlatt's (1985) <b>Relapse</b> <b>Prevention</b> approach. Marlatt describes four psychosocial processes {{relevant to the}} addiction and relapse processes: self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attributions of causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one's ability to deal competently and effectively with high-risk, relapse-provoking situations. Outcome expectancies refer to an individual's expectations about the psychoactive effects of an addictive substance. Attributions of causality refer to an individual's pattern of beliefs that relapse to drug use {{is a result of}} internal, or rather external, transient causes (e.g., allowing oneself to make exceptions when faced with what are judged to be unusual circumstances). Finally, decision-making processes are implicated in the relapse process as well. Substance use is the result of multiple decisions whose collective effects result in consumption of the intoxicant. Furthermore, Marlatt stresses some decisions—referred to as apparently irrelevant decisions—may seem inconsequential to relapse, but may actually have downstream implications that place the user in a high-risk situation.|$|E
500|$|Various {{forms of}} group therapy or {{psychotherapy}} {{can be used}} to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide <b>relapse</b> <b>prevention</b> skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach {{is one of the most}} common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety. Alcoholics Anonymous was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include LifeRing Secular Recovery, SMART Recovery, Women For Sobriety, and Secular Organizations for Sobriety. Rationing and moderation programs such as Moderation Management and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency. A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005. The study found abstinence from alcohol was the most stable form of remission for recovering alcoholics. A long-term (60 year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men concluded that [...] "return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence." ...|$|E
40|$|The common mental disorders, mainly {{anxiety and}} depression, {{constitute}} {{a major public}} health problem, incurring considerable costs in terms of use of health services and time lost from work. Risk factors include low socioeconomic status, poverty and poor housing, as well as stressful life events and difficulties such as demanding child care, separation or divorce, bereavement, loss of employment and caring for a dependant relative. Population approaches are probably necessary to reduce significantly the burden of such mental health problems, but health care measures are far from negligible. Primary care professionals have regular opportunities to identify people at risk of mental health problems and refer them to welfare and social support services (primary prevention). A number of interventions among high-risk groups {{have been shown to}} be effective, including problem-solving training and cognitive-behavioural approaches. The most important tasks in primary care are to identify people with depression, alcohol and drug misuse and eating disorders as early as possible in the course of their illness and to institute effective treatment (secondary prevention).

40|$|Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a {{persistent}} condition characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry and tension, mainly comorbid with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment of GAD. However, some patients may {{not respond to}} the treatment or discontinue due to adverse effects. Vortioxetine (VRX) is a multimodal antidepressant with a unique mechanism of action, by acting as 5 -HT 3 A, 5 -HT 1 D and 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist, partial agonist at the 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors and inhibitor at the 5 -HT transporter. Preliminary clinical trials showed contrasting findings in terms of improvement of the anxiety symptomatology and/or cognitive impairment. Here, we aim to systematically review the evidence currently available on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VRX in the treatment of GAD. The generalizability of results on the efficacy of VRX in patients with anxiety symptomatology and GAD is limited due to few and contrasting RCTs so far available.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) is {{the seventh}} {{leading cause of}} disability per year of life among all diseases in the population aged 15 to 44. It {{is a group of}} heterogeneous diseases, with frequent comorbid psychiatric or somatic disorders, variable treatment response and frequent residual symptoms between episodes. The major impairment associated with this disorder is related to the high relapse and recurrence rates, the functional impact of comorbidities and cognitive impairment between episodes. The prognosis of the disease relies on the efficacy of <b>relapse</b> and recurrence <b>prevention</b> interventions. Given the heterogeneity of the disorder, <b>relapse</b> and recurrence <b>prevention</b> needs to develop a personalized care plan {{from the start of the}} acute phase. In such a complex situation, guideline-driven algorithms of decision are known to improve overall care of patients with bipolar disorder, compared to standard treatment decisions. Although guidelines do not account for all the situations encountered with patients, this systematic approach contributes to the development of personalized medicine. METHODS: We present a critical review of recent international recommendations for the management of manic phases. We summarize treatment options that reach consensus (monotherapy and combination therapy) and comment on options that differ across guidelines. RESULTS: The synthesis of recent international guidelines shows a consensus for the initial treatment for manic phases. For acute and long-term management, the anti-manic drugs proposed are traditional mood stabilizers (lithium or valproate) and atypical antipsychotics (APA - olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole and quetiapine). All guidelines indicate stopping antidepressant drugs during manic phases. International guidelines also present with some differences. First, as monotherapy is often non sufficient in clinical practice, combination therapy with a traditional mood stabilizer and an APA are disputed either in first line treatment for severe cases or in second line. Second, mixed episodes treatment is not consensual either and some guidelines propose in first line valproate, carbamazepine and some APA, and advice not to use lithium. On the other hand, some guidelines do not propose specific treatment for mixed episodes and group them with manic episodes management. Duration of treatment is unclear. CONCLUSION: Guidelines utilization has shown that the systemic use by clinicians of decision algorithms in comparison to "treatment as usual" modality improves the overall care of patients with BD. Future data from cohorts of patients seem necessary to complement the existing data from clinical trials. These cohort studies will help to take into account the different individual profiles of BD and thus may help to propose a more personalized medicine...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} argued that {{cost-effectiveness}} {{should play a}} role in health care priority setting. In this report, ten preventive interventions are identified, with a favourable cost-benefit ratio. These interventions are not yet systematically provided in the Netherlands. It is expected that these intervention will be cost-effective within 5 years (defined as cost per life year saved < 20, 000 euro). These interventions are: (1) opportunistic screening for chlamydia among young women in urban settings (2) screening for retinopathy among diabetes type 2 patients, (3) prevention of head injuries through use of bicycle helmets in children (4) cardiac rehabilitation programs, (5) screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in elderly men (6) <b>prevention</b> <b>relapse</b> of depression, (7) prevention cardiac arrest by automatic external defibrillators, (8) prevention of cervical cancer by screening on human papilloma virus in combination with cervical smear, (9) prevention of chronic diseases by treatment of obesity and finally (10) prevention of hip fracture by external hip protectors.

40|$|International audiencePrevention of {{the risk}} of {{recurrence}} of depressive episodes is a dynamic process that begins early in the management. Although complete remission is obtained for almost half of the treated depressive episodes, a heuristic conceptual thinking apprehends depression as a potentially chronic disorder when considering <b>relapse</b> and recurrence <b>prevention.</b> Multiple actions of care have to be initiated. They are formalised, but also adjustable to the needs of a critical management period throughout the follow-up. These actions include the prescription of an antidepressant at an effective dosage. They also consider the preventative and therapeutic impact of psychotherapy. The search for residual symptoms of depression is the rule, and addition of other medication should be considered if needed. These recommendations are evidence-based in the context of recurrence prevention. Nevertheless, many other initiatives are equally important recommendations in terms of therapeutic impact. Thus, rigorous evaluation of the initial symptomatology, promotion of information on disease, health-care advices, as well as implementation of family and other networks are good-practices. Such actions should be conducted in a relationship based on a therapeutic alliance. These elements need to be adjusted and contextualised in line with the Health System, mode of medical practice and unique style of the therapist. Proactive and sustainable implementations of these guidelines are required {{in the context of a}} unique and open therapeutic relationship for both therapist and patient...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{management of}} bipolar disorder encompasses the acute treatment of mood episodes, the continuation phase after initial response, {{and the longer}} term prevention of recurrences. Lithium salts {{have been the first}} treatment in the modern era in this field, and still represent the gold standard for the various phases of bipolar disorder 60 years after their introduction in the treatment of mania. Alternatives to lithium have been investigated, often following serendipitous observations. Classical neuroleptics and antidepressants have long been used for the treatment of mania and bipolar depression, respectively, even if relevant controlled trials have been rare. Treatment of acute episodes with antidepressants or neuroleptics has been associated with switch into the opposite phase and with cycle acceleration. After the first description of the effects of valproate in the 1960 s, several other anticonvulsants have demonstrated antimanic, antidepressant and mood stabilizing properties in bipolar patients. Several second-generation antipsychotics have already been approved by regulatory authorities from different countries for the acute treatment of mania. On the other hand, acute treatment of bipolar depression has long represented a difficult task, even though current trials of various agents are promising. Controlled trials of prophylactic efficacy of bipolar recurrences are difficult and expensive. The duration of a drug in the market has markedly influenced this field. Discrepancies in the definitions of treatment phases reflect the difficulties of long-term studies. Current trials are designed to investigate maintenance effect of treatments after initial response without a clear separation between <b>prevention</b> of <b>relapse</b> and <b>prevention</b> of recurrence. Long-term outcome can perhaps be investigated by naturalistic studies alone, as effectiveness and efficiency are not addressed by controlled trials. Moreover, bipolar disorder often requires combined treatments. Additional issues can be addressed by naturalistic studies alone, including the potential development of resistance after prolonged treatment or after discontinuation of prophylaxis, and the potential poorer outcome when there is a delay in starting prophylaxis or in the presence of atypical features. Observations from specialized facilities support a potential effect of lithium against the otherwise increased mortality of bipolar patients, especially due to suicide. No similar evidence is available regarding currently prescribed alternatives to lithium...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} etiology, {{therapeutic}} effects,risk of relapse and prognosis of acute anterior uveitis. MEHTODS: Medical history of 215 patients with acute anterior uveitis who underwent treatment in Department of Ophthalmology, People's Hospital of Fenghua was collected, together with results of clinical examinations and auxiliary examinations. The data were studied {{in terms of}} therapeutic effects, etiological factors, prognosis and relapse rate. RESULTS: In 85 cases(39. 5 %), the cause was identified, and among the among the most frequent causes were traumatic or surgical injury, viral infection and glaucomatocyclitic crisis. After treatment, the best corrected visual acuity was no less than 1. 0 in 153 cases(71. 2 %), between 0. 5 and 1. 0 in 55 cases(25. 6 %), between 0. 3 and 0. 5 in 4 cases(1. 9 %), between 0. 05 and 0. 3 in 2 cases(0. 9 %), and less than 0. 05 in 1 case(0. 5 %). During the follow-up of more than 6 months, relapse occurred in 4 cases(1. 9 %) during 4 - 6 months, in 7 cases(3. 2 %) during 7 - 12 months, in 10 cases(4. 7 %) during 13 - 24 months, and in 3 cases(1. 4 %) during 25 - 60 months.

40|$|Barbara Kornek Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Abstract: In {{the context}} of an {{increasing}} repertoire of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutics, choosing the appropriate treatment for an individual patient is becoming increasingly challenging. Natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against alpha 4 beta 1 integrin, has proven short-term and long-term efficacies in terms of <b>relapse</b> rate reduction, <b>prevention</b> of disability progression, and reduction of magnetic resonance imaging-detectable activity. It is well tolerated and has further been shown to improve patients’ quality of life. Its use is limited by the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which occurs at an overall incidence of 3. 78 cases per 1, 000 patients. Three major risk factors for the occurrence of natalizumab-associated PML have been identified: John Cunningham virus (JCV) seropositivity, prior use of immunosuppressants, and treatment duration ≥ 2  years. Therefore, in patients considered for natalizumab therapy, as well as in patients receiving natalizumab, effective control of MS activity has to be balanced against the risk of an opportunistic central nervous system infection associated with a high risk of significant morbidity or death. Discontinuation of natalizumab is an issue in daily clinical practice, since it is an option to reduce the PML risk. However, after cessation of natalizumab therapy, currently, there is no approved strategy for avoiding postnatalizumab disease reactivation available. In this paper, short-term and long-term safety and efficacy data are reviewed. Issues in daily clinical practice, such as selection of patients, monitoring of patients, and natalizumab discontinuation, are discussed.

In the Netherlands, a prevention program with a stepwise approach is developed in general practice, based on the guideline ‘Cardiometabolic prevention consultation’. This program is aimed at detecting individuals at risk for cardiometabolic diseases, followed by tailored lifestyle advices and/or treatment. The effectiveness of such a program is largely determined by participation rates.

Lifelong treatment is needed to prevent <b>relapses,</b> and primary <b>prevention</b> is desirable in high-risk patients, but the available drugs are often poorly tolerated. Azithromycin (AZM) has been considered a drug candidate because of its efficacy in the animal model and its kinetic properties, which would allow intermittent administration. The tolerability and kinetics of AZM and its effect on the disposition of zidovudine (ZVD) were therefore evaluated in a preliminary open study in nine human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. AZM was administered once weekly for 5 weeks 2 h before the usual morning ZVD dose. The day before and on the first and fifth AZM dosings, blood samples were drawn every 30 min during 5 h for determination of the concentrations of ZVD and its glucuronide metabolite. Blood samples were drawn for AZM measurement over 72 and 360 h on the first and fifth AZM administrations, respectively, as well as before and 3 h after dosing on the second, third, and fourth AZM dosings. After the first and fifth administrations, maximum AZM concentrations in serum were 0. 6 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 8 +/- 0. 2 microM (mean +/- standard error of the mean), respectively; times to peak concentration in serum were 3. 7 +/- 0. 2 and 2. 9 +/- 0. 4 h, respectively; areas under the plasma concentration-time curves were 9. 2 +/- 1. 6 and 9. 3 +/- 2. 0 micrograms. h/ml, respectively; and half-lives were 61. 0 +/- 5. 4 and 63. 8 +/- 6. 7 h, respectively. On days - 1, 1, and 29, ZVD kinetic parameters were as follows: maximum concentrations in serum, 3. 1 +/- 0. 6, 4. 3 +/- 0. 6, and 4. 2 +/- 0. 9 microM, respectively; times to maximum concentrations in serum, 1. 1 +/- 0. 4, 0. 8 +/- 0. 2, and 1. 2 +/- 0. 3 h, respectively: areas under the plasma concentration-time curves, 5. 3 +/- 0. 9, 5. 9 +/- 0. 6, and 5. 7 +/- 0. 8 microgram. h/ml, respectively; and half-lives, 1. 3 +/- 0. 08, 1. 4 +/- 0. 04, and 1. 3 +/- 0. 04 h, respectively. Except for transient mild abdominal cramps that occurred at 2 to 3 h postdose (6 of 45 exposures) and nausea (4 of 45 exposures), neither subjective nor objective side effects were observed. The kinetics of AZM were similar after the first and repeated administrations, and the disposition of ZVD was not altered by this treatment. The efficacy of AZM in preventing cerebral toxoplasmosis can therefore be safely tested in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients concomitantly treated with zidovudine...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression {{in older}} adults is common and is {{associated}} with poor quality of life, increased morbidity and early mortality, and increased health and social care use. Collaborative care, a low-intensity intervention for depression that is shown {{to be effective in}} working-age adults, has not yet been evaluated in older people with depression who are managed in UK primary care. The CollAborative care for Screen-Positive EldeRs (CASPER) plus trial fills the evidence gap identified by the most recent guidelines on depression management. OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of collaborative care for older adults with major depressive disorder in primary care. DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentred, two-arm, parallel, individually randomised controlled trial with embedded qualitative study. Participants were automatically randomised by computer, by the York Trials Unit Randomisation Service, on a 1 [*]:[*] 1 basis using simple unstratified randomisation after informed consent and baseline measures were collected. Blinding was not possible. SETTING: Sixty-nine general practices in the north of England. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 485 participants aged ≥[*] 65 years with major depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: A low-intensity intervention of collaborative care, including behavioural activation, delivered by a case manager for an average of six sessions over 7 - 8 weeks, alongside usual general practitioner (GP) care. The control arm received only usual GP care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 items score at 4 months post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures included depression severity and caseness at 12 and 18 months, the EuroQol- 5 Dimensions, Short Form questionnaire- 12 items, Patient Health Questionnaire- 15 items, Generalised Anxiety Disorder- 7 items, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale- 2 items, a medication questionnaire, objective data and adverse events. Participants were followed up at 12 and 18 months. RESULTS: In total, 485 participants were randomised (collaborative care, n[*]=[*] 249; usual care, n[*]=[*] 236), with 390 participants (80 %: collaborative care, 75 %; usual care, 86 %) followed up at 4 months, 358 participants (74 %: collaborative care, 70 %; usual care, 78 %) followed up at 12 months and 344 participants (71 %: collaborative care, 67 %; usual care, 75 %) followed up at 18 months. A total of 415 participants were included in primary analysis (collaborative care, n[*]=[*] 198; usual care, n[*]=[*] 217), which revealed a statistically significant effect in favour of collaborative care at the primary end point at 4 months [8. 98 vs. 10. 90 score points, mean difference 1. 92 score points, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 85 to 2. 99 score points; p[*] <[*] 0. 001], equivalent to a standard effect size of 0. 34. However, treatment differences were not maintained in the longer term (at 12 months: 0. 19 score points, 95 % CI - 0. 92 to 1. 29 score points; p[*]=[*] 0. 741; at 18 months: <[*] 0. 01 score points, 95 % CI - 1. 12 to 1. 12 score points; p[*]=[*] 0. 997). The study recorded details of all serious adverse events (SAEs), which consisted of 'unscheduled hospitalisation', 'other medically important condition' and 'death'. No SAEs were related to the intervention. Collaborative care showed a small but non-significant increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the 18 -month period, with a higher cost. Overall, the mean cost per incremental QALY for collaborative care compared with usual care was £ 26, 016; however, for participants attending six or more sessions, collaborative care appears to represent better value for money (£ 9876 /QALY). LIMITATIONS: Study limitations are identified at different stages: design (blinding unfeasible, potential contamination), process (relatively low overall consent rate, differential attrition/retention rates) and analysis (no baseline health-care resource cost or secondary/social care data). CONCLUSION: Collaborative care was effective for older people with case-level depression across a range of outcomes in the short term though the reduction in depression severity was not maintained over the longer term of 12 or 18 months. Participants who received six or more sessions of collaborative care did benefit substantially more than those who received fewer treatment sessions but this difference was not statistically significant. FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations for future research include investigating the longer-term effect of the intervention. Depression is a recurrent disorder and {{it would be useful to}} assess its impact on <b>relapse</b> and the <b>prevention</b> of future case-level depression.
