40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{reactivation}} is {{well documented}} in individuals with cancer who receive certain cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapies including rituximab treatment. As a general rule, the risk is greatest upon withdrawal of chemotherapy. The risk ranges from approximately 20 to 50 % among HBsAg-positive carriers. A 67 -year-old man was diagnosed with inoperable multiple hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied {{by an increase in}} alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II level. Eighteen weeks after starting on the oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor TSU- 68, laboratory investigations showed a substantial increase in serum transaminase levels (AST: 302 IU/l; ALT: 324 IU/l) and an elevation of the HBV-DNA level (6. 9 log copies/ml). The diagnosis was that the cause of the acute hepatitis was HBV reactivation and we immediately administered entecavir. Two months after the initiation of daily entecavir treatment, laboratory findings showed that the serum levels of transaminases and ALP had improved (AST: 18 IU/l; ALT: 10 IU/l; ALP: 197 U/l). When the HBV markers were examined 4 months later, they were altered: HBeAg was negative and HBeAb was positive. Entecavir treatment was discontinued after 6 months. Although <b>reactivation</b> <b>with</b> rituximab has been reported, <b>reactivation</b> <b>with</b> a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is extremely unusual in a patient who is HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive. This is the first report describing HBV <b>reactivation</b> <b>with</b> an increasing HBV-DNA level in a HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive/HBsAb-positive patient who was treated with TSU- 68 for hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a patient with}} refractory cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (CPAN) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier status who was successfully treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) blockade, using etanercept, and we review 5 similar cases. We administered etanercept because of the occurrence of repeated flares despite aggressive therapy. C-reactive protein normalization; prednisolone dose-sparing; and absence of any adverse events, including HBV <b>reactivation</b> <b>with</b> nucleotide analogue administration, or renal dysfunction, have been achieved for 8 months.

40|$|Lamivudine is a {{nucleoside}} analogue with a potent antiviral activity used as prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus <b>reactivation</b> in patients <b>with</b> chronic HBV infection receiving chemotherapy. No standard guidelines exist, however, {{for the duration}} of lamivudine treatment. We report a clinical case of a 56 -year-old patient with HBeAg-negative cirrhosis who developed a multiple myeloma. He was treated with lamivudine for 1 year while receiving chemotherapy and a subsequent bone marrow transplant. Complete remission from multiple myeloma was achieved. Four months after lamivudine was withdrawn, he experienced HBV <b>reactivation</b> <b>with</b> jaundice, though no YMDD mutations were detected. The patient rapidly developed fatal decompensation with septicemia and renal failure. In conclusion, this case shows that physicians should avoid discontinuing nucleoside therapy in patients with HBV infection who undergo immunosuppression for concomitant neoplastic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Backgrounds/AimsHepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>reactivation</b> {{following}} treatment <b>with</b> rituximab {{has been}} reported in patients with either HBsAg-positive, or HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc positive infection. Patients <b>with</b> severe <b>reactivation</b> often have a fatal outcome despite treatment with lamivudine.

A review of the literature and underlying HBV associated mutations are discussed. ResultsEntecavir produced a rapid and sustained suppression of HBV that was associated with rapid clinical improvement without any side effects.
