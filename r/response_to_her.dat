5|$|Visual effects at Kroma were {{supervised}} by Bert Yukich and produced by Amy Yukich. A {{key part of}} the video is a 24-second visual effects sequence in which Rihanna is surrounded by silvery strands of liquid that crisscross the frame in graceful arcs in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> movements. Water elements were recorded on a special effects stage using a high-speed 35mm camera. Bert Yukich then composited them into the scene with the singer. He then added lighting effects to the practical water elements to give them the mirror-like texture of mercury.|$|E

5|$|Following Sévérine's first {{appearances}} in promotional materials for Skyfall, film critics {{noted that the}} character was {{a return to the}} classic elements of the James Bond films, specifically Bond meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Critics had a mixed response to Sévérine, comparing her to previous Bond girls. The response to Bond's treatment of Sévérine was largely negative; commentators panned Bond's seduction of the character after discovering that she was a sex slave, and his cold <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death. However, some critics defended Sévérine's story arc as appropriate for Bond's character development. The character has also been a topic of racial criticism, receiving comparisons to previous Bond girls Aki, Kissy Suzuki, and Wai Lin.|$|E

The Nation published her speech, excluding the passage comparing the magazine with Reader's Digest. <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> statement were varied.

25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who could barely leave his own house.

50|$|In their reply 'Refining the Numbers: A <b>Response</b> <b>to</b> Reber and Kleinpenning' Whigham and Potthast {{attacked}} Reber's {{paper in}} great detail. Here we summarise their <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> two main points, viz. that a census {{carried out by}} defeated Paraguayans on the orders of a provisional government upheld by the occupying Allies was unlikely to be reliable, and that its count implied an unfeasible population increase in the ensuing sixteen years.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the pastoral {{aspects of the}} modernist poet H. D. ’s work, while weaving in reference {{to some of the}} key tropes of environmentalism. It re-visits Greek epigram through the filter of H. D. and includes poetic, as well as critical, <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> work. Tarlo reads and re-writes H.

Gandhi was due to be interviewed by British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television.

25|$|February Shadows (German: Februarschatten) is a 1984 {{historical}} novel by award-winning Austrian author Elisabeth Reichart. She wrote it as a <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{discovery of the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd ("rabbit hunt of the Mühlviertel region"), a massacre on 2 February 1945 at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Upper Austria. In the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd, the civilian inhabitants of the Mühlviertel hunted down and killed almost 500 prisoners, including men, women and children, who escaped from Special Barracks Number 20.|$|E
25|$|In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> letter, Helgelien {{rushed to}} her side in January 1908. He had with him a check for $2,900, his savings, which he had drawn from his local bank. A few days after Helgelien arrived, he and Gunness {{appeared}} at the Savings Bank in La Porte and deposited the check. Helgelien vanished a few days later, but Gunness appeared at the Savings Bank to make a $500 deposit and another deposit of $700 in the State Bank.

50|$|On February 27, 2004, in {{the context}} of the {{sponsorship}} scandal that came to light soon after Prime Minister Jean Chrétien left office, Bédard asserted that she had been forced <b>to</b> resign from <b>her</b> marketing department job at Via Rail in 2002 shortly after raising concerns about the company's dealings with advertiser Groupaction. <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> allegations led <b>to</b> the firings a few days later of Via Rail chair Jean Pelletier and president Marc LeFrançois.|$|R
5000|$|Isa {{performed}} modern {{renditions of}} traditional Jewish folk songs for audiences around the world, refusing <b>to</b> conceal <b>her</b> Jewish culture {{even during the}} Holocaust. The film explores {{the life of a}} woman who brought Jewish music to international audiences. Isa Kremer reconstructs the singer's life through archival footage of her performances, family interviews, and the critic’s <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> shows. [...] She had a beautiful, well-trained voice but, it was her alluring presence that enthralled audiences.|$|R
25|$|McCartney’s <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{wide variety}} of {{subjects}} are as spontaneous as they are studied, as shown by her first solo exhibition Off Pointe – A Photographic Study of The Royal Ballet After Hours in October 2004. A series of powerful images that reveals the chaos of life {{behind the scenes of}} the elite Royal Ballet and the contrast between the sometimes grueling, painful lifestyle of the dancers and their fairy tale performances.|$|R
25|$|After Levy's {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} appoint a Nobel laureate, Valerie J. Reidy, Assistant Principal of the Biology Department, was appointed principal in September 2001; {{she was the first}} female principal in the school's history. Reidy has been a controversial figure, and several teachers left the school in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> becoming principal. Some teachers have openly criticized her to newspapers and some students staged protests in 2005 and 2008. There was also a substantial exodus of social studies teachers {{at the end of the}} 2010–2011 term, reportedly due to problems with the administration. Reidy announced her resignation in June 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} work that Jonson wrote about Boulstred was his “Epitaph on Cecilia Bulstrode,” written in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death. This poem paints a very {{different}} picture of Boulstred than that of his epigram. In fact, it seems to retract each of the charges made in the first point by point. Jonson calls her a virgin, teacher to Pallas and Cynthia, conscientious, and good, vastly different from his epigram. The reason behind Jonson’s supposed change of heart is unknown. The likely reason is {{that he wanted to}} gain the favor of Lucy Russell, which he had been attempting to do for years. However, another explanation could be that he experienced true regret for his slanderous words after hearing of her painful death.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties {{during which he}} banged his head against those of other men, Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends’ accounts, made no <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband’s aggression except {{to try to persuade}} him to go home. Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage’s painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her. The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy’s death. “Yves was my only friend who understood everything,” she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy’s, about a month after Tanguy’s fatal stroke.|$|E
50|$|Philip Kennedy {{considers}} Ms. Ranke-Heinemann's work {{a comprehensive}} overview of historical Christian teaching on sexuality, but also {{states that it}} was <b>her</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> losing <b>her</b> theology chair.|$|R
60|$|Anne's spirit {{burned at}} the injustice, and warmed the more towards the Queen and little Prince, whose pretty <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> caresses could not but win her love. Moreover, Pauline's example {{continued}} <b>to</b> attract <b>her,</b> and Father Crump was a better controversialist, or perhaps a better judge of character, than Pere Giverlai, and took her on sides where she was more vulnerable, so as <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> begin <b>to</b> feel unsettled, and wonder whether she were not making a vain sacrifice, and holding out after all against the better way.|$|R
5000|$|Knight's work {{focused on}} {{narrative}} paintings depicting the life, culture, {{and history of}} African Americans, through still life, portraits, and urban scenes. The majority of her career produced oil portraits of friends, figure studies of dancers, and watercolor and gouache landscapes. However, <b>her</b> work began <b>to</b> shift in the 1990's incorporating lyrical depictions of animals through etchings and monoprints. Her inspiration came from spontaneous <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> surroundings, as well as African dance, sculpture, and theater.|$|R
25|$|On {{the third}} spacewalk, Williams {{was outside the}} station for 6 hours and 40 minutes to {{complete}} three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by Kathryn C. Thornton for most spacewalk time by a woman. On December 18, 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16, Peggy Whitson surpassed Williams, with a cumulative EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes. In early March 2007, she received a tube of wasabi in a Progress spacecraft resupply mission in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free-fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain.|$|E
500|$|Classification, school? Barbara Howard's work defies {{specific}} slotting, {{although we}} sense her {{recognition of the}} heritage left by great masters, Turner being the most obvious. But she draws and paints in direct <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own muse and as such cannot be aligned to any particular art movement ..... for [...] in common with other maverick artists throughout art history, her work, although bound to no age, is relevant to all.|$|E
