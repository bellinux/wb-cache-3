5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> syphilis, <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> delirium).|$|E

5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E

5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E

5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy.

Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{struggled}} to regain fluency {{in the second}} half, as their opponents dominated play.

United fashioned further chances through Burke and Rowley, but for large periods {{of the second half}} the Arsenal defence stood firm. Jones' headed goal was <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> for offside, after which the match descended into a contest between United's attack and Arsenal's defence.
