5000|$|Aside {{from his}} private drive, Apthorp laid out cross-lanes on his farm, long known as Stryker's Lane and Jauncey's Lane. Jauncey's Lane gained {{its name from}} the rich Englishman, William Jauncey, who {{purchased}} Apthorp's [...] "Elmwood". Also called [...] "Apthorp's Lane" [...] or simply the [...] "Crossroad to Harlem, it extended eastwards to Harlem Commons later taken into Central Park. The Crossroad to Harlem had a part to play in the Battle of Harlem Heights, 16 September 1776, for it was the route the British General Clinton took after marching up from the city along the Boston Post <b>Road,</b> <b>in</b> <b>cutting</b> across the island; they failed to intercept Silliman's brigade of militia, toiling up the Bloomingdale Road to rejoin the American troops at twilight. The picturesque and leafy lanes marked property boundaries when he left his estate of some 200 acre among his ten children, but they were abolished, on paper at least, by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 that laid out the present grid plan of Manhattan, which, it was assumed, would take more than a century to build upon. Early suits over the property were brought as early as 1799, and final litigation among the Apthorp heirs, and their assigns who had purchased parcels of the Apthorp property, for building rights over the former route of the Bloomingdale Road and lanes abandoned by the city, in order to close them once and for all, dragged on for five years, 1905-1911.|$|E

25|$|This road {{building}} programme {{continued into the}} start of the premiership of John Major. In the early-1990s, the government decided to complete the M3 motorway by building a six-lane <b>road</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cutting</b> through Twyford Down. This attracted the first direct action protests against a major <b>road</b> <b>in</b> the country. Building work was delayed considerably, and anti-roads protesters gained large amounts of publicity. The Newbury bypass saw some of the largest protests against a <b>road</b> <b>in</b> the UK. Proposed originally in the 1980s, the bypass was subject to strong support and opposition. Also in this time frame, the M11 link road protest saw protracted disturbance during the upgrading of a section of the A12 through East London. Costs increased rapidly, the Newbury bypass being 50% over budget and many other schemes showed increases of 100%.|$|R

50|$|The {{portion of}} the Borman Expressway that was {{completed}} from Gary westward and the Kingery Expressway were originally designated as I-80, I-90, and I-294 from shortly after the Interstate Highway program was enacted until about 1965, when {{the connection between the}} Borman and the Indiana Toll Road was completed, and I-90 was swapped with I-94 west of that junction (and east of where those routes share the same <b>road</b> <b>in</b> Chicago), <b>cutting</b> back I-294 to its current south terminus (eliminating the Indiana part of I-294). Indiana later proposed to extend I-294 east on the current Borman Expressway to Indiana State Route 912, before having it turn north at that point, west at U.S. Route 12, and then back to I-94, most likely somewhere on the Bishop Ford Freeway near 130th Street. The request was denied.|$|R
5000|$|The Chalk Group, {{composed}} {{almost entirely}} of chalk, a kind of soft fine-grained limestone. It is formed of three parts, the Upper Chalk, which has many flints, the Middle Chalk, with fewer flints, and the Lower Chalk or Coombe Rock, greyish, with few flints. The chalk is most commonly exposed on slopes or as cliffs, where the overlying acidic strata have been quarried or washed away. The buried upper surface of the chalk beneath the acidic strata is often eroded into pipes, gulleys and pinnacles, sometimes visible <b>in</b> <b>road</b> <b>cuttings</b> and quarries.|$|R

40|$|GPR {{investigations}} {{were used}} to study degraded <b>road</b> pavements built <b>in</b> <b>cutting</b> sections. <b>Road</b> integrity was assessed via quantitative analysis of power curves. 1600 [*]MHz and 600 [*]MHz radar sections were collected in 40 damaged and undamaged road pavement sites. The collected data were processed as follows: (i) linearisation with regression analysis of power curves; (ii) assessment of absorption angle α′ which is directly proportional to absorption coefficient α (this was obtained by setting the e. m. propagation velocity to 10 [*]cm/ns); (iii) comparison of absorption coefficients in both damaged and undamaged zones with respect to road pavement degradation. If the absorption coefficients of damaged and undamaged road sections have nearly the same value, then the likely cause of degradation is the fatigue or the thermal shrinkage; if they are not, then road degradation {{is due to the}} different compactness of the soil caused by vehicular traffic load. In a considerable number of sites, the statistical comparison of damaged and undamaged zones through the absorption coefficient analysis shows that surface observations of road pavements are quite consistent with power curve analyses...|$|R
