40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the market}} for {{composite}} materials is dominated by small and medium series production and prototyping [1]. And the VaRTM (Vacuum assisted <b>Resin</b> Transfer <b>Moldings)</b> process {{is thought to be}} low cost composite fabrication technique [2]. The preforms in VaRTM are placed on one–side mold and they are sealed by a flexible vacuum bag [3]. The resin is infused into dry fabric formed on a mold near product shape under vacuum pressure and cured in an oven. In general, part defects often arise during the mold filling stage of the process, where a resin is drawn into performs through the use of vacuum. Uniform fill of resin and complete fiber saturation are required for fabricating high quality products [5]. So the resin flow control is extremely required. To solve these problems and short time fabrication, this article investigates the new molding process of C-FRP plate with using the combination of induction heating for quick heating and vacuuming method. To control of the volume fraction easily and to achieve homogeneous impregnation, thermoplastic resin sheet was chosen instead of liquid type. And the C-FRP in a size of 120 mm∗ 120 mm and the thickness is 6. 6 mm was able to fabricate by this method...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to develop high temperature/high {{performance}} structural resins for aerospace applications, the chemistry and properties of a novel class of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) were investigated. These IPNs consist of a simple diacetylenic compound (aspartimide) blended with an acetylene terminated arylene ether oligomer. Various compositional blends were prepared and thermally cured to evaluate the effect of crosslink density on resin properties. The cured IPNs exhibited glass transition temperatures ranging from 197 to 254 C depending upon the composition and cure temperature. The solvent resistance, fracture toughness and {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the cured blends were related to the crosslink density.

40|$|As {{part of a}} NASA {{program to}} develop new high temperature/high {{performance}} structural materials, the chemistry and properties of acetylene-containing materials and their cured resins are under investigation. The objective of this work is to develop materials that are readily processable (i. e., 200 - 300 C and about 1. 4 MPa or less) and possess usable mechanical properties at temperatures as high as 177 C. An acetylene-terminated aspartimide (ATA) was blended with an equal weight of an acetylene-terminated arylene ether (ATAE) oligomer.

40|$|Organic {{polymeric}} materials {{are currently being}} considered for long term use (more than 10 years) in structural (adhesives and composite matrices) and functional (films and coatings) applications on spacecraft. Although organic polymers have been utilized successfully in short term missions, the long term durability of these materials in space is of concern. As part of a NASA effort on high performance polymers for potential space applications, various experimental {{polymeric materials}} recently synthesized at NASA Langley Research Center were evaluated under simulated space environmental conditions. Experimental resins from blends of acetylene terminated materials, poly(arylene ether) s and low color polyimides were exposed to high energy electron and ultraviolet radiation {{in an attempt to}} simulate space environmental effects.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to identify matrix resins which have potential for use at 371 C (700 F). Utilizing PMR methodology, neat <b>resin</b> <b>moldings</b> were prepared with various monomer reactants and screened for thermo-oxidative stability at 371 C (700 F) under both ambient and a four-atmosphere air pressure. The results of the resin screening studies indicate that high molecular weight (HMW) formulated resins of first (PMR- 15) and second (PMR-II) generation PMR materials exhibit lower levels of weight loss at 371 C (700 F) than PMR- 15 and PMR-II resins. The resin systems which exhibited the best overall balance of processability, Tg and thermo-oxidative stability at 371 C were used to prepare unidirectional Celion 6000 and T- 40 R graphite fiber laminates. Laminates were evaluated for thermo-oxidative stability and 371 C mechanical properties. Results of the laminate evaluation studies indicate {{that two of the}} resin compositions have potential for use in 371 C applications. The most promising resin composition provided laminates which exhibited no drop in 371 C mechanical properties and only 11 percent weight loss after 200 hr exposure to 4 atmospheres of air at 371 C...|$|E
40|$|Novel p-ethynyl-substituted rigid rod {{monomers}} {{were studied}} by pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), ThermoGravimetric Analysis (TGA), IsothermoGravimetric Analysis (IGA), and TGA-IR. These monomers, 4, 4 '-bis(((4 -ethynylphenyl) carbonyl) oxy) biphenyl, designated 1, 1, 5 -bis-(((4 -ethynylphenyl) carbonyl) oxy) naphthalene, designated 2, and bis(4 -ethynylphenyl) pyromellitimide, designated 3, were polymerized in the solid state. Thermal polymerization in N 2 or air produced highly cross-linked resins with polymerization exotherms centered between 212 and 276 C. The (delta) H's of polymerization of these resins in air {{were found to}} be double those in N 2. When monomers 1 and 2 were heated in air from 23 to 750 C at 10 C/min, the main decomposition product was carbon dioxide, evolving at a maximum rate between 500 and 600 C; water was also detected as a decomposition product. Void-free neat <b>resin</b> <b>moldings,</b> designated lp to 3 p, were made by compression molding the monomers and then heating them. The resulting polymers were highly cross-linked, and their glass transition temperatures (T(sub g)) were much higher than their polymerization temperatures. Using ThermoMechanical Analysis (TMA), we found that polymers lp to 3 p had T(sub g) 's of 422, 329, and 380 C, respectively. The thermal and thermooxidative stabilities improved when lp to 3 p were postcured in N 2 (the postcured polymers were designated 1 pp to 3 pp). The Linear Thermal Expansions (LTE) for lp and 3 p were 1 % between 23 and 420 C. Using rheological analysis, we could not clearly detect the T(sub g) 's of lp to 3 p because their moduli dropped only slightly between 23 and 490 C and the changes in tan beta were very low. Because of high cross-link density, their moduli changed little as the resins went from a glassy to a rubbery state. Their shear storage moduli in air ranged from 0. 82 (3 p, 3 pp) to 1. 6 GPa (lpp) at 23 C, from 0. 16 (2 p) to 0. 7 GPa(lpp) at 380 C, and from 0. 18 (lpp) to 0. 6 GPa(2 p) at 490 C. Finally, these novel-p-ethynyl polymers exhibited an excellent combination of high T(sub g), low LTE, and high thermooxidative stability. Most notably, 3 pp lost only 3 % of its initial weight when it was aged for 500 h at 288 C in air...|$|E
