40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} machinery. Due to the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> being connected to the tank, the pressure drop of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is frequently equal to the inlet pressure. Accordingly, the energy loss of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is very high in some cases and this will worsen {{with an increase in}} the rated pressure of the hydraulic system. In order to overcome the disadvantage of overflow energy loss in a <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> a hydraulic energy regeneration unit (HERU) is connected to the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> to decrease the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The overflow loss, which is characterized by the pressure drop, can be reduced accordingly. The approach is to convert the overflow energy loss in hydraulic form and allow for release when needed. The configuration and working principle of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU is introduced in this present study. The mathematical model is established to obtain the factors influencing the stability of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The working pressure of the hydraulic accumulator (HA) is explored. Furthermore, the control process of the operating state of the HA is scheduled to decide whether to regenerate the energy via the HERU. The software AMESim is utilized to analyze the performance and characteristics of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU. Following this, the test rig is built and used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU. The experimental results show that the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with the HERU connected to its outlet can still achieve better pressure-regulating characteristics. The energy regeneration efficiency saved by the HA is up to 83. 6 %, with a higher pre-charge pressure of the HA. This indicates that the proposed structure of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU can achieve a better performance and higher regeneration efficiency...|$|R

As the power of hydraulic system becomes higher, the flow and pressure of water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> are also higher, and the flow may reach 2000 L/min. However, there is no relevant test-bed which could provide instantaneous high-pressure and high-flow to support the experiment for high-flow relief valve; consequently, this impact test-bed for high-flow water medium <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is designed to satisfy fast loading demand.

5000|$|In {{high-pressure}} gas systems, it {{is recommended}} that the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is in the open air. In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> will give a pressure build up in the piping system downstream of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> This often means that the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so called [...] "differential" [...] <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the openings area of the valve. If the valve is opened the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in exhaust pipe system increases.
