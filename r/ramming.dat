5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were <b>ramming</b> (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then <b>ramming</b> them in the side.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} <b>ramming</b> had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to <b>ramming,</b> and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E
5|$|The station {{also has}} a plaque commemorating mariner Charles Fryatt who was {{executed}} in 1916 for <b>ramming</b> a German U-boat with the GER steamer SS Brussels.|$|E

5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras <b>ramming</b> or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} <b>ramming</b> as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.|$|E
5|$|In March 1862, a {{contract}} was placed with Laird & Son Co. by Captain James D.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during <b>ramming.</b> However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
5|$|Japan's air {{defenses}} {{were unable to}} stop the Allied air attacks. Owing to the short range of the country's land-based radar, and Allied attacks on IJN picket ships, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese signals intelligence units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by eavesdropping on the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict {{the target of the}} attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to scramble and reach the bombers' cruising altitude before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters. Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due to the difficulty of intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their efforts as being futile. From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide <b>ramming</b> attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; {{by the end of the}} war, <b>ramming</b> tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.|$|E

She spent most of her career {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Squadron (escadre de la Méditerranée) and usually was chosen to serve as a flagship. The ship was involved in two accidental <b>ramming</b> incidents with two other French warships in her career, one of which sank a submarine.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} <b>ram</b> BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal <b>ram</b> cavity (<b>ram</b> guide chamber). Opposing <b>rams</b> (plungers) in the <b>ram</b> cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded <b>ram</b> shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the <b>ram</b> shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the <b>rams,</b> coupled to the inner ends of the <b>ram</b> shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for <b>rams</b> to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|R

5|$|The Austrians {{believed}} their ships {{to have less}} effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the melée which followed both sides were frustrated {{by the lack of}} damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming—nonetheless, the effective <b>ramming</b> attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.|$|E
5|$|While both gun turrets were rotated by steam power, the new forward {{guns were}} loaded by {{hydraulic}} power, unlike the original guns which were hand worked. Thunderer {{was the first}} ship to have hydraulic loading gear. From 1874, the forward turret alone was converted to hydraulic power operation for training (turret traverse), elevation and <b>ramming.</b> This allowed the turret crew to be reduced from 48 to 28; the aft turret remaining hand-worked as a comparison. Power operation was considered successful, although it was later implicated in the 1879 explosion.|$|E

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{mutations}} {{in either of}} two unlinked genes, <b>RAM</b> 1 or <b>RAM</b> 2, abolish the farnesyltransferase activity responsible for prenylation of Ras proteins and the a-factor mating pheromone. Here we report that the function of <b>RAM</b> 1 and <b>RAM</b> 2 genes {{is required for the}} membrane localization of Ras proteins and a-factor. The <b>RAM</b> 2 gene was sequenced and can encode a 38 -kDa protein. We examined the functional interaction of <b>RAM</b> 2 and <b>RAM</b> 1 by expressing the genes in Escherichia coli. Extracts derived from an E. coli strain that coexpressed <b>RAM</b> 1 and <b>RAM</b> 2 efficiently farnesylated a-factor peptide and Ras protein substrates. In contrast, extracts derived from E. coli strains that expressed either <b>RAM</b> gene alone were devoid of activity; however, when the latter extracts were mixed, protein farnesyltransferase activity was reconstituted. These results indicate that the yeast farnesyl-protein transferase is comprised of <b>Ram</b> 1 and <b>Ram</b> 2 polypeptides. Although <b>Ram</b> 1 is a component of the enzyme, disruption of the <b>RAM</b> 1 gene in yeast was not lethal, indicating that the <b>Ram</b> 1 -Ram 2 farnesyltransferase is not essential for viability. In contrast, disruption of <b>RAM</b> 2 was lethal, suggesting that <b>Ram</b> 2 has an essential function in addition to its role with <b>Ram</b> 1 in protein farnesylation...|$|R
