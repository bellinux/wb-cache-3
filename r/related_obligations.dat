40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the content of}} the right to development in the light of human rights as recognized in international law and interprets it in an operational manner. The right to development is the right to a development where all rights can be progressively realized. Both the process of development and the outcomes of the process can be regarded as human rights claimed by the people of a country for the benefit of all individuals. The right is exercised collectively but enjoyed individually. The <b>related</b> <b>obligation</b> is appropriate development policy by the state (the primary duty-bearer) and co-operation by other states and international institutions. The international community that recognizes this right has to support its implementation by co-operating in trade, debt, finance, technology transfer and development assistance. This paper provides illustrative mechanisms for implementing the right, complemented by programmes of international co-operation...|$|R

40|$|Adding to {{the field}} of {{knowledge}} on the content of the psychological work contract, structured interviews with 35 frontline police officers generated 662 responses relating to the content of the psychological work contract for this employment sector. Analysis of these responses resulted in the development of an initial two-component measure of the contract. One component (17 items) reflected the obligations arising from the promises officers believed the organisation had made to them. The other component (19 items) reflected the obligations arising from the promises officers believed they had made to the organisation. The measure was included in a survey completed by 84 frontline police officers. Factor analysis revealed two factors in each component. For the organisation's obligations component, one factor reflected <b>obligations</b> <b>related</b> more to the organisational environment, whereas the other factor reflected <b>obligations</b> <b>related</b> more to the job environment. For the employee's obligations component, one factor reflected <b>obligations</b> <b>related</b> more to behaviours on the job, whereas the other factor reflected <b>obligations</b> <b>related</b> more to the pursuit of development opportunities. The nature of the relationships that emerged between the psychological contract and the nomological network variables included in the study provide strong support for the validity of this measure of the psychological contract...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concentrated}} in determining how higher education institutions, particularly the case of entrepreneurial universities in a developing nation, address {{the social and economic}} expectations of the society based on a regional setting. To understand this context, a public university in the Philippines was chosen as a case study to represent the higher education institutions in the Northern Mindanao region. The term “entrepreneurial university” was used all throughout this research to emphasize the commerce-related undertakings executed by the case.   Data collection was done through questionnaire dissemination and analysis of the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997. Representatives from the University’s central administration, faculty and local government shared their insights on the issues related to the scope of entrepreneurial obligations, the mechanisms in promoting higher education institutions’ involvement in the region and how the case study’s institutional environment depict the elements of entrepreneurialism as obligations to regional development.   In the theoretical framework for this study, the institutional theory attempted to explain how the demands of the people and society confront higher education institutions by means of academic <b>related</b> <b>obligations,</b> community <b>related</b> <b>obligations,</b> and most importantly, the expected response to regional development obligations. Findings were able to prove that choosing the entrepreneurial path is not only an issue of institutional survival but also going towards the direction of extending better higher education services to the community and the region.  Asiasanat:Entrepreneurial universities, regional development, obligations, developing nations, university entrepreneurialis...|$|E

40|$|In November of 2006, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Norway {{launched}} a bond {{in the international}} capital markets {{for the purpose of}} funding immunization programs in the developing world. This was the first financial instrument launched under a structure designed to access donor country aid pledges through 2026 up front. US$ 1 billion of approximately US$ 5 billion in total pledges was monetized in order to be administered by an entity formerly know as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (currently known as the GAVI Alliance). Over the next several years, additional bonds may be launched under this structure, making available almost the full amount of pledges in large amounts early on, rather than in much smaller amounts {{over the course of the}} next 20 years. With these “frontloaded” large pools of funds, GAVI immunization programs, in theory and in likelihood, can be more comprehensive and have a far deeper impact on the health and development of the world’s poor, particularly children. Such a capital markets based approach to development financing is both strikingly innovative in its conception and bold in its execution. All parties involved, particularly the United Kingdom as the driving force behind this endeavor, deserve substantial recognition for their pioneering efforts. However, there is an element of International Monetary Fund (IMF) -related conditionality within the structure of the instrument that potentially undermines the intended purpose of this instrument and may be in conflict with the human rights obligations of the UK and the other donor countries involved. Essentially, because of the conditions within the financing structure, nations that are not part of the IMF (such as, currently, Cuba and North Korea) and those in Protracted Arrears to the IMF (such as, currently, Somalia, Sudan and Zimbabwe and, until recently, Liberia) are precluded from accessing IFFIm “frontloaded” pledges to fund GAVI immunization programs in their countries. The populations of these nations comprise up to 100 million of the world’s poorest and most destitute, including, and perhaps especially, children. As a result of this conditionality structure, these populations are essentially being locked out of the 20 years’ worth of immunization aid which this structure frontloads. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the nascent nexus between the international capital markets and the human rights obligations of developed nations and other actors. Only sovereign nations can and have formally undertaken human rights <b>related</b> <b>obligations</b> vis-à-vis their own citizens/inhabitants and certain other extraterritorial impacts of their actions. In the context of globalization (particularly given the breadth and depth of reach of financial globalization), the informal or baseline obligations of non-sovereign actors is also explored. This thesis reviews the intent and obligations of the parties involved in the structuring and execution of this financial instrument based on available documentation as well as independent inquiry. The thesis further explores whether and to what extent the structural elements of this financing mechanism undermine any human rights <b>related</b> <b>obligations</b> of the involved parties. Further, the paper suggests practical recommendations (both short and long term) as potential remedies and/or improvements upon the current structure. In addition, this thesis seeks to highlight certain trends that may require further consideration, and that are likely to surface with increasing frequency, as nations with human rights <b>related</b> <b>obligations</b> act in concert with and through agents, instruments and markets that are simultaneously of crucial importance to the individual, but are also largely devoid of the responsibility to respect, protect or fulfill that individual’s human rights...|$|E

I assume that everyone has an experience with an employment and in consequence with employment termination so this theme is relevant for everyone, but not everyone knows the effective legal regulation. The aim of the thesis is to explain and summarize effective legal regulation of the labour law and also focus on controversial points. I made an effort at the conclusion to point out couple of disputed issues and to propose several amendments. The thesis is composed of six parts, introductory and conclusion. Most of them dealing with different types of employment termination, and the others look at <b>related</b> <b>obligations</b> and claims in case of invalidity of employment termination. In introductory of my thesis I explain why I choose exactly the theme about employment termination, mention how the thesis is systematically divided and what the parts are about. In part One I {{try to focus on}} employment termination generally and explain its basic terminology. Part Two is divided into several subparts.
