40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic {{effect of the}} Romanian exchange rate indices on bilateral trade of Romanian forest products namely fibreboard, particle board and pulp for paper. Special attention is given to investigate the J-curve hypothesis: whether the trade balance for Romanian forest products benefits from {{a decline in the}} value of <b>Romanian</b> <b>Leu</b> (<b>RON).</b> We adopted the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration to estimate the annual bilateral trade data of Romanian forest products from 1991 to 2013 with various countries in the world. We found no evidence of the J-curve phenomenon for the trade in Romanian forest products. The long-run analysis showed the exchange rate to be insignificant in influencing the trade balance of Romanian forest products. This implies that there are no changes in the trade balance for fibreboard, particle board and pulp for paper trade, regardless of whether the Romanian exchange rate depreciates or appreciates. However, income variables were found to be important factors in determining Romanian trade, only in pulp for paper products...|$|E
40|$|Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) {{represents}} a fundamental concept in exchange rate modeling. The main idea {{is given by}} equality between prices in two different countries when expressing in the same currency. This paper aims to analyze the behavior of real exchange rate between EURO and <b>Romanian</b> new <b>leu</b> (<b>RON)</b> under PPP paradigm. We use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron stationarity tests in order to check real exchange deviations from PPP. Also, we investigate {{the existence of a}} connection between long-term between nominal exchange rate and industrial producer price indices from Romania and euro area. The main conclusions of this research highlight that PPP doesn’t holds; real exchange rate stationarity tests doest not confirm the stationarity, thus between the aforementioned three variables it doesn’t exists any equilibrium relation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} some of {{the economic}} issues related to Romania's ability to meet the Maastricht exchange rate criterion. Based {{on the experience of}} the countries which had already joined Euro zone, we identified that, beyond the standard fluctuation band of ± 15 % officially required by ERMII, there is a strong preference for maintaining the exchange rate within a narrow band, with an upper margin of maximum + 10 percent over the central rate. On this background, a hypothetical participation of <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> in ERM-II over two-year period is assessed using the framework developed by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Simulations performed on daily data series for the last 24 months indicate that the nominal exchange rate of RON was relatively stable within the standard fluctuation band. Nevertheless, it significantly deviated from the pattern exhibited by the currencies that had fulfilled this criterion. Downwards pressures that characterized the developments of <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> as well as the spikes in volatility of the exchange rate could signal an intensity of tensions inconsistent with the above mentioned criterion...|$|R

5000|$|Quod Erat Demonstrandum is a 2013 Romanian drama film {{directed}} by Andrei Gruzsniczki, starring Sorin Leoveanu and Ofelia Popii. It {{tells the story}} of two Romanian academics who are persecuted by Securitate, the secret police, in 1984. The title is a Latin phrase with the meaning [...] "which had to be proven". The film is in black and white. It had a budget corresponding to 700,000 euro, of which 1.59 million <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> came from the National Center for Cinema.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2016, {{only the}} Danish krone participates in ERM II.

5000|$|The leu (pronounced [...] ), plural: lei (...) ISO 4217 code RON; {{numeric code}} 946) is the {{currency}} of Romania. It is subdivided into 100 bani (singular: ban). On 1 July 2005, Romania underwent a currency reform, switching from the previous leu (ROL) to a new <b>leu</b> (<b>RON).</b> 1 RON is equal to 10,000 ROL. Romania joined the European Union on 1 January 2007 and initially hoped to adopt the euro in 2014, but with the deepening of the Euro crisis and with its own problems, such as a low workforce productivity, postponed its adoption plans indefinitely.|$|R
5000|$|As {{noted by}} Georges Oudard, the PC never stood {{a chance to}} regain power, but became noted for advocating [...] "the sanity of {{economic}} and financial orthodoxy against the temptations of a coming world". The party criticized all attempts at furthering the land reform, and, through Periețeanu, proposed abandoning {{the gold standard for}} the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu,</b> favoring fiat money as the [...] "best economic policy"—although, as Filipescu had argued in 1931, this measure was seen by the PC as tragic. Periețeanu also wanted the state to withdraw from any regulation of foreign trade.|$|R
