So is visual algorithms to program visual worlds as {{the contents of}} information super highways. This research presents a drastic approach in designing visual algorithms to construct visual worlds. The address is on the most critical phase of conceptual design that has been conducted ad hoc in designers ’ mind. Conceptual visual algorithms make mental design processes and design results explicitly represented in a computer executable form after interactive machine translation. Hence, they are explicitly validatable against the design requirements. Taking a popular case of human performance design including dramas, music performance and sporting, recreational skiing algorithm design in particular {{as an example of}} visual world design, we show a requirement-driven approach to conceptual visual human algorithm design produces a truly effective skiing method to meet wide varieties of <b>recreational</b> <b>requirements.</b> 1...|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1980s, Morris Warren, a Prince George's County trail {{advocated}} began {{pushing the}} county to turn the railroad right-of-way into a trail, founding the Prince George's WB & A Trail Club prior to 1991. In July 1991, Prince George's County Executive Parris N. Glendening announced definitive plans to open that county's section of trail, and later that year, the entire ROW from Baltimore to Lanham {{was included in the}} Baltimore-Washington Grenway. Around the same time Anne Arundel County began planning what was originally known as the West County Trail (WCT) along a piece of the right-of-way there. It showed up in Maryland planning material as early as 1992. In 1994, 4.1 miles of the railroad right-of-way in Anne Arundal County was given to the county for the WCT by Constellation Real Estate to meet open space and <b>recreational</b> space <b>requirements</b> as part of their development of Piney Orchard. The right-of-way in Prince George's county, parts of which were owned by Amtrak, the state of Maryland and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission was purchased in 1995, clearing the way for construction. In the same year, Anne Arundel County finished the West County Trail Master Plan.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} benefits of a forest, which can be considered over the revenue yielded from timber and other wood based products, is the recreational benefits for visitors. Considering the novelty and necessity of evaluating bio-environmental economics of forest parks in developing countries such as Iran, the present study will focus on the evaluation of the Willingness to Pay (WTP) for a northern Iranian Forest park (Abbas Abad-Behshahr as a case study) utilizing one of the worldwide common methods of evaluation (Travel Cost Method). Based on the method, the park was considered as the centre of the fivefold region as concentric circles. The number of visitors was determined using questionnaires and the park&# 8217;s value was determined by estimation of the visitors access cost using Travel Cost Method. Furthermore, the economic value extracted timber products of the neighbouring forestry plan was reckoned. The calculated factor was then compared to the economic value of the park. As a result, the park&# 8217;s recreational value was judged to be much more than produced timber values. Therefore, it is concluded that the unparalleled natural, historical and bio-environmental values of the park would be preserved by planning an appropriate and well- programmed management system, considering the unique conditions of the Park. Thus, it can fulfil the <b>recreational</b> <b>requirements</b> {{of the people in the}} local/national scale...|$|E
40|$|Barring {{love and}} war, few {{enterprises}} are undertaken with such abandon, or by such diverse individuals, or with so paradoxical {{a mixture of}} appetite and altruism, as that group of avocations known as outdoor recreation. It is by common consent, {{a good thing for}} people to get back to nature. But wherein lies the goodness, {{and what can be done}} to encourage its pursuit? (Leopold 1949). In 1949 Aldo Leopold asked this question. It is the basic and essential question which must be answered in order to serve the recreational needs of people. The question remains unanswered. The "goodness" lies hidden somewhere in a variety of needs which people have, needs which, when fulfilled, help make life rich and satisfying. In our report we have not attempted to answer Leopold's question. We have attempted to show just how close we are today in identifying "wherein lies the goodness and what can be done to encourage its pursuit" for people seeking recreation in New Zealand's mountain lands. -	More specifically, this report sets out to present the following: -	What is known and what information is available in New Zealand. -	A critical review of selected aspects of the information and how it is being used. -	What information is not available. -	The implications for planners, management and the public recreationist of having or not having the information available. -	What needs to be known. -	The present trend toward obtaining the information. -	Some tested and suggested methods of obtaining the more critically needed information. In general we have found the task of identifying what is known about New Zealand mountain land recreationists far too easy, because little such knowledge is available. While this was a relatively easy; albeit time consuming, task for us, the implication is that those who must plan and manage for New Zealand’s mountain land recreationists are faced with a very difficult task. For the less one knows about the <b>recreational</b> <b>requirements</b> of the people for whom one is planning and managing, the greater are the chances for mistakes. A fuller knowledge of the recreationist and his requirements also fits into the broad scale of land-use planning. We can then balance what needs to be provided to meet the recreationists’ requirements (which may be simple rather than extravagant) and what can be provided. Some recreational activities may be damaging to a fragile mountain environment, even destructive of the very experience sought. Thus the physical resource itself is a real constraint. Again, recreation may compete or conflict with other valued land uses such as nature preservation, soil and water conservation practices, forestry and farming. However, individual recreation activities may be co-ordinated and integrated to some degree with these uses in multiple-use practices. Other very real limitations are the money and manpower available. This report is presented to clarify what is known and what needs to be known about mountain land recreationists in an attempt to help planners and managers at all levels in their task of helping people enjoy life. If any part of this report contributes to this endeavour we consider ourselves truly lucky. For we too are in love with the New Zealand mountain lands and seek them for our recreation...|$|E
40|$|Research {{done by the}} IPCC {{working groups}} and other {{organizations}} has sparked global concern over the possible impacts of climate change and corresponding sea level rise upon coastal communities. In reaction global studies were done (Nicholls et al., 2008, Hanson et al., 2011) to assess the vulnerability of coastal regions. However, most of these publications {{did not address the}} development of climate adaptation designs to protect the coastline. In this study it is demonstrated how a localized coastal vulnerability assessment could guide the development of conceptual designs in an African context. The overall aim of this thesis is the appraisal of climate adaptation measures and coastal management strategies for Durban, South Africa. The main focus is on an illustrative case study, for a coastal section along Durban´s central beaches. The case study {{is an example of how}} the vulnerability to coastal hazards could be assessed, for different SLR scenarios, to provide guidance for developing conceptual coastal protection designs. The March 2007 storm event (estimated to have a one in 50 year return period) indicated that significant damage can be sustained from coastal hazards in Durban at the current conditions. A one in 100 year storm is shown to already affect the operations of critical infrastructure in current conditions such as the beach road in the vulnerability assessment. The vulnerability increases significantly for future SLR scenarios. Softer, sediment based protection solutions were preferred for the case study due to the environmental, <b>recreational</b> and touristic <b>requirements</b> of the beachfront. Protection solutions developed for the two SLR scenarios give an idea of the footprint of different options and how easily the can be adapted to higher water levels. The vulnerability assessment and proposed protection solutions could be used as a basic tool for budgeting and long term spatial planning as it gives indicative costs and an idea about the areas that could potentially be at risk to coastal hazards. Developing a generic vulnerability assessment methodology could be beneficial for local municipalities. Completing similar vulnerability assessment studies (or more detailed studies) at other vulnerable coastal locations is a recommended starting point for the climate adaptation process and to inform global vulnerability and adaptation studies. Local governments are recommended to gather local data, assess vulnerability, propose a strategy to deal with future SLR scenarios and develop protection solutions for critical areas.

40|$|Master project report. In {{the year}} 2004 {{there was a}} {{flooding}} in an area between Da'an River and Dajia River in Taichung County, Taiwan. The flooding was caused by outlets which were clogged up, thus lacking the capacity to discharge the amount of rainwater that the typhoon caused into the sea. A {{survey conducted by the}} project group, showed that the coastal protection is deteriorating, aging and inconsistent. Therefore the safety of the coastal protection is doubtful when extremely high water tables occur. The survey also showed that most of the outlets did not function properly, either they were clogged up, or the outlets were forced open by local inhabitants, using stones or tree-trunks. The main purpose of this project is to design a new coastal protection and drainage system, which will suffice in their main purpose, but are also sound with the ecological, <b>recreational</b> and spatial <b>requirements.</b> The alternative solutions consist out of three elements. These elements are the possibility of land reclamation, the possible methods of coastal protection and methods of drainage. There exists a strong relation between the elements. After the feasibility of land reclamation was considered, four categories of solutions concerning the coastal protection were treated: "do nothing", improvement or replacement of the current dike, offshore constructions and soft solutions. Concerning the drainage system the following categories are treated: allowing flooding (do-noting alternative), decrease of the peak discharge or structural enhancement of the capacity. It was concluded that land reclamation is a feasible option and has to be further elaborated because of the favorable conditions of the foreshore and opportunities for land use. By using a multi-criteria analysis a choice has been made out of the generated alternatives. This analysis has shown that dike improvement and/or the application of soft solutions are preferred for coastal protection. The use of detention and the removal of bottlenecks are the solutions selected for improvement of the drainage of the area. These alternatives are elaborated further. For land reclamation an area of 500 meters width and 2 km's length is selected at the south of the project area. The coastal stretch has been divided in four coastal protection zones. For each of these zones a design of the coastal protection has been made. The dimensions of the coastal protection of each zone are shown in table 1. The first zone is the land reclamation zone; because the shoreline at this zone is moved seaward the designed dike for this zone is considerably larger than the other dikes. The second zone is a zone with considerable foreshore vegetation. At this zone an ecologically sound dike has been designed with less steep slopes than the current dike and a grass revetment. Development of foreshore in this zone should be aimed at conservation by restricted use and natural development, but recreational opportunities for extensive recreation are available here. The third zone is a recreational zone, here a promenade is designed which is protected by a vertical front seawall. The fourth zone is a zone without foreshore vegetation, the dike designed for this zone is similar to the dike for the zone with foreshore vegetation only the revetment consists partly of placed blocks because the wave attenuating effect of the foreshore vegetation is not present.
