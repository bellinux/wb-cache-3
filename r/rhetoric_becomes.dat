Rhetoric can be emphasized on its art and message effectiveness.

Through the Renaissance, in-dustrial civilization, {{and the high}} techno-logical era, the ocular-centric (eye-center) wave grew rapidly (Jay, 1994). Carter Dickinson (1941) says, “Seeing is believing”. These words reflect the impor-tance of visual object to make people believe in something. The visual artifacts, visual images, visual performances and other activities to “see”, “observe”, “look”, and “watch ” have conquered the US society (Olson, 2008). Images provide human with considerable influence. Public images often function to disseminate message, or work in rhetorical ways.

40|$|As {{political}} elites become more polarized, and political <b>rhetoric</b> <b>becomes</b> increasingly conflictual, normative concerns have emerged {{about the state}} of citizen opinion. Do citizens weigh information even-handedly, or is their focus more myopic? Are citizens driven to extremes by exposure to one-sided rhetoric from elites? Using a novel experimental design, I assess the extent to which individuals ’ attitudes toward marijuana legalization are influenced by targeted arguments in favor or opposition. Exposure to targeted argumentation leads to biased information processing on the part of subjects, with normatively concerning implications for opinion. Results suggest that biased processing leads to polarized opinion not only on the targeted issue, but also spreads to unrelated issues. These effects are moderated only by accessibility of prior beliefs. These findings suggest a point of concern for the objectivity of citizens when faced with one-sided political debate. Citizen attention to politics and how they respond to political debate remains issue of great scholarly concern.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} shift within the humanities: may from text, may from objects, away from monuments, and from this the process of reading {{cultural}} objects as representations of cultural production. What has been highlighted instead is the dynamic processes of culture - the performative. This shift in emphasis is also shaping the discipline of architecture. Central to this shift in perspective is the focus on the body as a site and medium for understanding processual relations, which augments representational thinking, where architecture is framed, contemplated and mastered by man-as-subject through distance and objectivity. The analysis in this thesis investigates {{the ways in which the}} body is thought about in the explicitly theoretical works of both Judith Butler and Deleuze and Guattari, which emphasise a performative understanding of the space of the body. In turn, this thesis then looks at how the 'spacing of the body' is physically and conceptually realised through the performative spatial practices of Arakawa and Gins, Bernard Tschumi and Grundei Kaindl Teckert. Chapter Seven integrates theoretical and practical investigations through Learning-by-Making as a representative case study. The crucial point of this project is to suggest that the constraints and the restrictions that are imposed on the body are not just symbolic and discursive but also impact on the 'lived body. ' This thesis also focuses on how the spacing of the body, through a performative <b>rhetoric,</b> <b>becomes</b> a site of utopian possibilities and dissolution, where neither mind, body nor space is privileged. In this framework the agency of the material is understood as an affective force in the construction of meaning. Thus the 'spacing of the body' is explored in this thesis as a composition of the two terms performance and performativity as a way to understand how the spacing of the body is both constrained by normative relations and also produced through bodily experience which privileges the concept of affect.

40|$|The {{stories we}} tell give meaning and {{coherence}} to our political situation; they reproduce, interrogate, and, at times, challenge {{the discourse of}} authority. Thus, when the political situation changes so do our narratives. In the thirteenth century, responding to a majestic rhetoric of vis et voluntas (force and will), the barons strengthened {{the community of the}} realm by turning it into a powerful collective identity that fostered political alliances with the gentry. By The Will of the King demonstrates how Ricardian poetry was shaped by and responded to the conflict between majestic and political rhetoric that crystallized in the politically turbulent years culminating in the Second Barons’ War (1258 - 1265). By placing Gower’s Confessio Amantis and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales in dialogue with this political tradition, I demonstrate how narrative became a site of conflict between vertical, cosmic descriptions of power and horizontal realities of power, a conflict from which the contours of a civic habit of mind began to emerge. Over the past twenty years, scholars have begun to investigate the evolution of this habit of mind in the late Middle Ages. By looking at the narrative practice of Gower and Chaucer through the lens of thirteenth-century political innovation, I extend and fill in this depiction of a nascent political imaginary. Each poet responds to the new political circumstances in their own way. Gower, placing the political community at the center of Book VII of the Confessio, rigorously reworks the mirror for princes genre into a schematic analysis of political power. For Chaucer, political <b>rhetoric</b> <b>becomes</b> visible at the moment that the traditional majestic rhetoric of kingship collapses. The Canterbury Tales, as such, restages the conflict of the thirteenth century in aesthetic terms—giving form to the crisis of authority. Ultimately, Ricardian poetry exposes and works through an anxiety of sovereignty; it registers the limits of a majestic paradigm of kingship; and reshaping narrative, aesthetic, and hermeneutic practice, it conjures a new political imaginary capable of speaking to and for a community which had emerged during the reign of Henry III...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the problem of {{representation}} of the Lithuanian national identity in the novel Pragiedruliai (Bright Spaces) by Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas (1869 – 1933). The classical novel, which was planned to become an epos of the Lithuanian national revival, was published in three parts during 1918 – 1920 in Vilnius, at the height of political and military conflict between Lithuania and Poland over the possession of this multinational city. The author himself {{was one of the main}} Lithuanian combatants in the field of nationalist ideology and press as he edited the main Lithuanian dailies (Lietuvos Aidas, Nepriklausomoji Lietuva) in Vilnius in that period. In his numerous press articles, Vaižgantas discussed Lithuanian identity as a phenomenon born from the local spirit of nature, formed by the primeval forces of biosphere, and organically evolving into the modern state of national consciousness. By suggesting this model of “organically modern” and “naturally democratic” Lithuanian identity, Vaižgantas was creating an antithesis against the image of Lithuanians as uncivilized barbarians propagated by the Polish nationalist side. However, the novel Pragiedruliai reveals much more diverse and complicated process of conversion of the “natural” or “pantheist” Lithuanian consciousness into the modern national selfimage. While trying to elaborate the symbolic literary narrative of this identity transformation, Vaižgantas included intertextual references to Pan Tadeusz, a 19 th century Polish epos about the Lithuanian Grand Duchy noblemen by Adam Mickiewicz, as well as symbols indicating the intricate link between the Lithuanian identity and the cultural history of the Grand Duchy. The original opening chapters of Vaduvų kraštas (The Land of Vaduvos), the second volume of the novel, presented an acute criticism of the Lithuanian “natural” consciousness from the perspective modern cultural liberalism. Thus the clear construction of identity used by Vaižgantas in his political <b>rhetoric</b> <b>becomes</b> complicated and in some cases is even undermined in the polysemantic literary texture of his novel...|$|E
40|$|This MA thesis {{focuses on}} the work {{of one of the most}} {{influential}} and authoritative theologians of the early Church: St Gregory of Nyssa († 396). My topic of research consists in the relationship between language and theology, as it shaped in Gregory’s polemical works against the radical Arians, in particular against Eunomius of Cyzicus († 395). The first chapter tackles the historical side of the controversy and provides the chronology of the dogmatic disputes on the dogma of Trinity following the Council of Nicaea (325). The second chapters illustrate the conflict being at stake between two theological methodologies: Gregory's grammar of thought is scriptural, whereas Eunomius' theology is much more philosophical and inflexible in its terms. Eunomius claimed that one can know God by his essence in the concept of 'ingenerate'. On the contrary, for Gregory of Nyssa, God 'is above all names'. For him, language and sexuality are realitites of the post-lapsarian world, which made human mind opaque and the exercise of interpretation indispensable. Gregory included also the episode of Babel in the genealogy of our linguistic finitude. The third and the fourth chapters focus on the relationship between language and theological knowledge in St Gregory's third book Contra Eunomium. All words used in human language - including Eunomius' concept of agennetos – have complementary meanings, since no one can describe the essence of an object or of any part of reality. On this basis, Gregory develops his 'theory of relativity' of names, which can never befit God's majesty and glory. In the last chapter, under the heading 'Pragmatics of Language', I investigate the immediate consequences of Gregory's 'theory of relativity'. Speech is treated as a sphere, which resembles the creative power of the hypostatic Word. Therefore, <b>rhetoric</b> <b>becomes</b> the perfect tool for his pastoral concern in doing theology. By choosing rhetoric, Gregory is free to start his theological argument from anywhere, since theology is a discourse about God's redemptive economy. In conclusion, I try to emphasise the actuality of Gregory's theory of names and its importance for the contemporary debates in the Church on thorny issues as Trinitarian theology or gender. I also evaluate Gregory of Nyssa's self-consistency in positive terms...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the view of writing. One of {{the intentions of the}} study is to analyse different notions of writing that become manifest in media debates about student writing. Another intention is to analyse conceptions of writing in curricula and course plans for upper secondary school in Sweden from 1970 to 2011. Drawing from theories of critical discourse analysis, the study aims at answering what is said about student writing, describing the language tools the debaters use, and discussing and explaining how and why the discursive struggle about the view of writing evolves and develops. The source material consists of newspaper articles and periodicals from the 70 ’s, the 90 ’s and our time in mostly Swedish, and some American, publications and the curricula and course plans of Lgy 70, Lpf 94 and Gy 2011. The results show that there is and has been a popular discourse of writing in Sweden about the students’ lacking writing abilities. The articles are often structured in a similar fashion and share elements. There is, thus, a specific writing crisis genre, which is consistent over time and can also be identified in articles from the U. S. The articles are overly dramatic with an extensive use of paratextual elements, and the authors often use the language manipulatively, for instance by presupposing that the students’ skills are deficient, without any evidence to support the statements. The authors repeatedly draw on a number of discourses and myths about writing. The curricula and course plans have mostly focused on skills and academic preparation, even though the general parts of the curricula have been progressive. In Lgy 70, writing in vocational programmes is skills-oriented; in the theoretical programmes writing is mostly skills- and academically oriented, but there are progressive ideals as well. In Lpf 94, the general view of writing is socially oriented, even though the skills orientation is also evident. In Gy 2011, the vocational programmes are skills-oriented, whereas writing is more varied in the theoretical programmes, but the more advanced, the more instrumental the course becomes, a tendency that is manifest in the view of academic writing. The curricula are, at least to some extent, shaped by the popular discourse of writing. The crisis rhetoric has been overwhelming over the years. Conflicting voices have efficiently been silenced. When the crisis <b>rhetoric</b> <b>becomes</b> hegemonic, {{it is almost impossible to}} voice alternative thoughts about writing in school and higher education...|$|E
