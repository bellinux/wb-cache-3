[...] He clarified the band's future succinctly: [...] "There {{are a lot of}} emotions between Mark and I and that's why there’s never going to be another Box Car Racer album. It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important." ...|$|E

[...] Paramount executives went as far to prepare graphs displaying how much more money a PG-13-rated South Park feature would perhaps accumulate. The William Morris Agency, which represented Parker and Stone, pushed for movie production to begin as soon as possible, while public interest was still high, instead of several years into its run, as was done with Beavis and Butt-head Do America, possibly because Beavis and Butt-head and South Park were owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom after Doug Herzog left Viacom Media Networks on January 12, 2017.|$|E

[...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a mother.

[...] The episode also featured {{a message to the}} troops from U.S. Senator John McCain with a friendly reminder to [...] "always remember to clean your muskets", a lesson he claimed to have learned at Valley Forge, as a reference to old age jokes that he faced during the 2008 Presidential Election.

[...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show.

500|$|Jasmine {{appears in}} the Broadway musical {{adaptation}} of Aladdin, which premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre in March 2014. The role was originated by actress Courtney Reed, becoming her first time originating a Broadway character after appearing in minor roles in Broadway productions such as In the Heights and Mama Mia!. Reed had grown up a long-time fan of Disney films and princesses, and, being of mixed ethnicity, cites Jasmine as her favorite princess because [...] "she was my first experience seeing a Disney princess who looked like me ... So I thought, 'Wow, I can be like her'", while the others tend to have blond hair and blue eyes.

Despite having already been associated with the project since its early beginnings and initial readings in 2010, Reed auditioned for the role for director Casey Nicholaw in Seattle before the production finally relocated to Broadway, selected out of only a few actresses who were invited to audition. Unlike co-stars Adam Jacobs and Jonathan Freeman, who portray Aladdin and Jafar, respectively, Reed was the only main cast member required to audition.|$|E

The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in every aspect of it."

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if he <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with her {{or if it was}} just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E

500|$|Director and screenwriter Steve Kloves {{spent six}} months writing The Fabulous Baker Boys from the {{perspective}} of its three main characters, exploring their relationship with each other. Kloves eventually decided to write the film {{in the form of a}} character study, developing Susie into a [...] "feisty wild card looking for something more from her life." [...] Susie is portrayed by American actress Michelle Pfeiffer, who claims to have first been offered the role five years before production began, only to decline it on several occasions. Despite being one of the most sought-after actresses at the time due to her recent Academy Award-nominated performance in Dangerous Liaisons (1988), some studio executives feared that Pfeiffer was still too obscure to attract a large audience on her own. Having already known her personally, Pfeiffer became the first actor Kloves expressed interest in casting in The Fabulous Baker Boys; he eventually focused on casting real-life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Fabulous Baker Boys once establishing contact with Pfeiffer proved difficult. However, the script continued to struggle without an actress playing Susie. During this time, actress Debra Winger and singer Madonna were both considered for the role, the latter of whom turned it down because she felt the script was [...] "too mushy". Actresses Jodie Foster and Jennifer Jason Leigh had also expressed interest in the part, but Kloves was eventually able to contact Pfeiffer, maintaining that she is the only actress he himself had ever considered for the role. Although the actress enjoyed both the script and character, with whom she identified emotionally, she was hesitant to commit to another role so soon after having just recently completed several film projects in a row, initially intending to go on hiatus after filming Dangerous Liaisons due to exhaustion. Thus, Kloves spent one week visiting Pfeiffer at her home until she finally relented. Prior to The Fabulous Baker Boys, most of Pfeiffer's roles had been rather unglamorous; Pfeiffer claims that she typically avoided playing glamorous characters because she found most of them uninteresting until she discovered Susie. Pfeiffer accepted the role because she [...] "thought [...] was a great woman... someone I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like." [...] Film critic Mike D'Angelo, writing for The Dissolve, believes that Pfeiffer decided to accept the role of Susie because she was still embarrassed by her performance in the unsuccessful musical Grease 2 (1982), and wanted to prove that she was in fact capable of playing a character who was a combination of both Sandy Olsson and Betty Rizzo from Grease (1978) at the same time.|$|E
