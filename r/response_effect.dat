One major drawback of this method is that it cannot {{take into account the}} instrument <b>response</b> <b>effect</b> and for this reason {{the early part of the}} measured decay curves should be ignored in the analyses. This means that part of the signal is discarded and the accuracy for estimating short lifetimes goes down.|$|E
40|$|Ideomotor {{approaches}} to motor control {{focus on the}} cognitive mechanisms underlying voluntary action selection. Ideomotor theory states that actions are cognitively represented {{in terms of their}} anticipated sensory consequences (<b>response</b> <b>effects)</b> and that there are bidirectional associations between movements and ensuing <b>response</b> <b>effects.</b> Accordingly, the anticipation of <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> may serve as a mental cue to activate the corresponding movement. The aim of the present paper is to describe the general principles of ideomotor theory and to review recent empirical work that supports this theory. Specifically, we describe studies on the role of <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> for the selection and initiation of simple actions and for learning and performing action sequences. Finally, we discuss potential implications of these results for sport psychology, in particular with reference to the role of motor imagery in mental practice...|$|R

50|$|Survey <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> are {{variations}} in survey responses {{that result from}} seemingly inconsequential aspects of survey design and administration. Susceptibility to these effects varies depending on the stability of one’s beliefs. Those without a strong attitude on an issue, for instance, would more be more prone to survey <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> than those strongly for or against the issue. These effects can be broadly grouped as consistency or contrast effects. Consistency effects are effects that lead to survey responses that agree, {{not to be confused}} with the identically-named term used to refer to the phenomenon in which respondents intentionally try to get their survey responses to agree one another. Contrast effects on the other hand, lead to opposing responses.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether a}} voluntary response becomes {{associated with the}} (affective) meaning of intended <b>response</b> <b>effects.</b> Four experiments revealed that coupling a keypress with positive or negative consequences produces affective compatibility effects when the keypress has to be executed in response to positively or negatively evaluated stimulus categories. In Experiment 1, positive words were evaluated faster with a keypress that turned the words ON (versus OFF), whereas negative words were evaluated faster with a keypress that turned the words OFF (versus ON). Experiment 2 showed that this compatibility effect is reversed if an aversive tone is turned ON and OFF with keypresses. Experiment 3 revealed that keypresses acquire an affective meaning even when the association between the <b>responses</b> and their <b>effects</b> is variable and intentionally reconfigured before each trial. Experiment 4 used affective <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> to assess implicit in-group favoritism, showing that the measure is sensitive to the valence of categories {{and not to the}} valence of exemplars.

40|$|<b>Response</b> order <b>effects</b> are a {{well-known}} phenomenon {{that can occur}} when answering survey questions with multiple response categories. Although various theoretical explanations exist, the empirical evidence is contradictory. Moreover, different scale types produce different effect sizes. In the current study, we investigate the occurrence and causes of <b>response</b> order <b>effects</b> in horizontal and vertical rating scales by means of eye tracking. We conducted an experiment (n = 84) with two groups and varied the scale direction so that the response scales either ran from agree to disagree or vice versa. The results indicate that <b>response</b> order <b>effects</b> in rating scales are relatively small {{and are more likely}} to occur in vertical than in horizontal rating scales. Moreover, our eye-tracking data reveal that respondents do not read all categories, nor do they pay equal attention to all categories; these data support the survey satisficing theory of <b>response</b> order <b>effects</b> (Krosnick, 1991) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>response</b> set <b>effect</b> {{refers to}} the finding that an {{irrelevant}} incongruent colour-word produces greater interference when {{it is one of}} the response options (referred to as a response set trial), compared to when it is not (a non-response set trial). Despite being a key effect for models of selective attention, the magnitude of the effect varies considerably across studies. We report two within-subjects experiments that tested the hypothesis that presentation format modulates the magnitude of the <b>response</b> set <b>effect.</b> Trial types (e. g. response set, non-response set, neutral) were either presented in separate blocks (pure) or in blocks containing trials from all conditions presented randomly (mixed). In the first experiment we show that the <b>response</b> set <b>effect</b> is substantially reduced in the mixed block context as a result of a decrease in RTs to response set trials. By demonstrating the modulation of the <b>response</b> set <b>effect</b> under conditions of trial type mixing we present evidence that is difficult for models of the effect based on strategic, top-down biasing of attention to explain. In a second experiment we tested a stimulus-driven account of the <b>response</b> set <b>effect</b> by manipulating the number of colour-words that make up the non-response set of distractors.

40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> suggests that different survey modes may influence how {{people respond to}} surveys. In particular, questions about sensitive topics may be more susceptible to being influenced in telephone and face-to-face surveys, than in mail and Internet surveys. However, studies of <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> of survey mode are generally confounded by differential nonresponse errors for different survey modes. We were interested in controlling nonresponse errors in a study that examined <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> of survey mode. To do this, {{we designed an experiment}} on a sensitive topic (unethical behavior), which involved randomly assigning business students to one of four survey mode conditions: telephone, face-to-face, mail, and Internet. Students in each condition completed a brief questionnaire about their behavior and opinions of a variety of ethical situations. Students completed each questionnaire individually by the assigned survey mode. In the telephone and face-to-face mode, a member of the research staff asked the questions by telephone, or face-to-face. After completing the survey, students were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire about how their ideal of the most ethical person in the world would complete the same questionnaire. Over 150 students have participated in this experiment. The results to date, show clear differences on the most sensitive questions by survey mode, in the expected directions. Students are significantly less likely to admit to violations of ethical behavior in the telephone and face-to-face survey modes, and more likely to admit such behavior in the mail and Internet survey modes...|$|R

Format choice did not significantly affect survey completions, number of nonsubstantial answers, or time to completion. However, drop downs led to higher item nonresponse and longer response times.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine if there is a dose <b>response</b> <b>effect</b> of pomegranate juice supplementation after eccentric exercise isometric strength recovery. Forty-five nonresistance trained, recreationally active men were assigned once-daily pomegranate juice, twice-daily pomegranate juice, or placebo supplementation. On day four of supplementation, 20 [*]min of downhill running and 40 maximal eccentric elbow flexion repetitions were performed. Isometric knee extensor and elbow flexor strength, muscular soreness, and serum myoglobin concentrations were measured prior to exercise and 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 [*]h after exercise. Throughout the postexercise time period, while isometric knee extensor and elbow flexor strength were similar between once-daily and twice-daily pomegranate juice supplementation groups, isometric strength was significantly higher in pomegranate juice groups than placebo. Knee extensor soreness, elbow flexor soreness, and myoglobin increased in response to exercise but were similar between groups. It is apparent that pomegranate juice supplementation improves strength recovery in leg and arm muscles following eccentric exercise; however, no dose <b>response</b> <b>effect</b> was present. We conclude that once-daily pomegranate juice supplementation is not different from twice-daily supplementation in regards to strength recovery after eccentric exercise...|$|E

Building on earlier literature that tries to assess the fiscal <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> of HIPC debt relief, we extend this assessment by explicitly including the fiscal <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> of MDRI debt relief, and by using an extended dataset and alternative econometric techniques, {{in order to have}} sufficient hindsight and better tackle methodological issues such as country specific effects. We confirm earlier findings that debt relief, and especially the enhanced HIPC initiative, has had a positive impact on recipient country total domestic revenue and public investment (as percentage of GDP).

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{tests the}} widespread assumption that <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> due to variations in question form, wording, or context will be greatest among respondents who are least in-volved with an issue. A meta-analysis of results from 15 split-ballot experiments conducted {{over a five-year}} period indicates that the <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> of using counterarguments or middle alternatives in survey questions are significantly larger, as would be expected, among respondents who are less involved with a given issue than among those who are highly involved with it. But the effects of question order and response order appear to be largely unrelated to how involved a respondent is with a particu-lar issue. Issue involvement, then, appears to specify some re-sponse effects, but not others. Public opinion researchers have long assumed that the respondents who are most susceptible to being influenced by the way in which a question is worded, the form in which it is presented, or the order or context in which it is asked are those who are least involved with an issue and whose views on the subject are therefore not well crystallized or held with much conviction (see, e. g., Cantril, 1944; Converse, 1974; Payne, 1951). But a recent investigation by Krosnick and Schuman (1988), based on nearly thirty experiments conducted over a ten-year period in various national surveys, indicates that this widespread as-sumption about who it is that is most susceptible to <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> may very well be wrong (cf. Stember and Hyman, 1949 - 50; Sudman and Bradburn, 1974; Sudman and Swensen, 1985, cited in Krosnick and Schuman, for previous evidence on the hypothesis).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the psychological {{processes involved in}} responding to survey questions. Minor variations in questions {{have been shown to}} lead to variation in responses. These findings are inconsistent with the assumption that survey questions are tapping stable responses. Recently, psychological theories have been used to provide an explanation for these <b>response</b> <b>effects.</b> Research applying psychological theory to survey response is reviewed, covering research on both behavioural and attitudinal questions. These reviews illustrate a reconceptualisation of the basis of the survey response. The need for more detailed data on the response process is identified. Verbal reports are identified as a potential method for producing process data, yet, uncertainty over their validity is noted. The use of verbal reports as data is then reviewed, covering both their historical and more recent use. In the present research verbal report techniques are first experimentally examined to find an appropriate technique for obtaining process data in surveys. Think-aloud techniques are then used to examine the processes involved in responding to questions. A split-ballot questionnaire was administered, varying a number of questionnaire features where <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> have been hypothesised or shown to occur. Generally, the verbal protocols showed processing differences between the different question forms, and provided information about general types of cognitive processing during response. The next study moved on to look at context effects for attitudinal questions. An experiment was carried out in which a number of factors hypothesised to be influential in producing context effects were examined. A questionnaire was administered via computer and response latencies were measured. The results provide further information about the nature of context effects at attitude questions. The findings from this study are then discussed in terms of the methodologies used, the specific <b>response</b> <b>effects</b> addressed, and the survey response process generally...|$|R
