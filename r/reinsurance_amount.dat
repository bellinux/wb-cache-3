40|$|The Life {{insurance}} {{industry has been}} heavily regulated by the authorities because it plays {{a very important role}} in society and because insurance contracts are not easy to understand for general customers. Heavy regulation results in less discretion for managers to decide. However, most regulations emphasize the solvency test and pay less attention to the manager compensation issue. Also, the close regulation and the alleged less managerial discretion do not solve the agency problem between managers and owners. ^ This study is an evaluation of managerial compensation as it relates to reinsurance activity. The approach taken is to empirically test the following proposition: is managerial compensation a determinant of the reinsurance activity; if so, it should be significantly related to reinsurance activity. ^ Reinsurance is a contract to shift part or all of the insurance originally written by one insurer, the ceding company, to another insurer, the reinsurer. The reinsurance activity, most importantly determining the amount of insurance retained by the ceding company for its own account, is subject to considerable management discretion. The setting of an appropriate <b>reinsurance</b> <b>amount</b> is a non-trivial decision for an insurer. It ultimately affects both the risk exposure and the profitability of the ceding company. Also, it impacts annual income of the insurer significantly. As a result, reinsurance activity represents a potentially significant area for insurance company managers to attempt to manage earnings. Theoretically, reinsurance activity should represent underlying economic reality. Many variables influence reinsurance activity and many considerations can be involved in determining an accurate reinsurance activity. ^ The first finding provides some preliminary evidence that managers manage the income but they do not manage the income for compensation purposes but rather for income smoothing. The results from extended research give only limited support to the theory that managers may in restricted case manage earnings to affect their bonus income. ^ The mixed results may be attributable to the following reasons. First, some companies do not change reinsurance activity yearly, especially when the reinsurance contract is an automatic basis. Second, due to recapture provisions, the impact on annual income by the change of legal reserve caused by different reinsurance for new policies is limited. ...|$|E

It assumes part of {{the risk}} covered by these insurance companies, {{as well as providing}} comprehensive advice on insurance business. In addition to its Munich head office, Munich Re has more than 50 Business Units around the world. Munich Re provides reinsurance cover for life, health, casualty, transport, aviation, space, fire and engineering business.

30|$|The minimum {{reinsurance}} fund value L is computed at 10  % of {{the claims}} cap k, which provides a reasonable estimate based on experience from other types of casualty insurance (e.g., vehicle insurance). The shadow price λ computed for the <b>reinsurance</b> fund <b>amount</b> {{can be used to}} assess the robustness of this assumption. The declining balance rate mimics the declining commission payments on most insurance products, and assumes that these are reflected in other selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G & A) for the product. The transaction time to failure is based on Media Metrix Core Reports statistics.|$|R

40|$|In this note, we {{consider}} {{an extension of}} the largest claims reinsurance treaty (LCR) with random upper thresholds for the claim sizes, that we call retention levels. The Laplace transform order for insurer's aggregate claims is obtained assuming dependence among the random retention levels. Different results about the influence of dependence on the insurer total claim amount are also given including the connections with LCR and the case of combination with quota-share. Algebraic bounds for the insurer aggregate claims are obtained when a common fixed threshold is considered.

5000|$|Facultative Reinsurance, {{which is}} {{negotiated}} separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their <b>reinsurance</b> treaties, for <b>amounts</b> {{in excess of}} the monetary limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} theoretical aspects of determination of financial stability of insurance companies of Ukraine. It was found the main {{factors that influence}} the financial stability of insurance companies. Influencing factors are classified into internal and external {{and the effects of}} these factors on insurers' activities are presented. The main criteria of financial stability of insurance companies were deeply analysed and the most significant were chosen: sufficient amount of equity capital, the optimal tariff policy, balanced insurance portfolio, secure and effective <b>reinsurance</b> program, sufficient <b>amount</b> of insurance reserves for future payments, optimal investment management of insurance reserves and high solvency of an insurance company. Basic directions of provision and maintenance of financial stability of insurance companies in post-crisis period were presented. The main problems of provision and maintenance of financial stability of insurance companies were outlined and recommendations for its strengthening were provided...|$|R
