5|$|Until the mid-19thcentury {{duck rearing}} was {{concentrated}} on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham.

Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.|$|E
