50|$|Ryōan-ji (extra=The Temple of the Dragon at Peace) is a Zen temple {{located in}} {{northwest}} Kyoto, Japan. It {{belongs to the}} Myōshin-ji school of the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism. The Ryōan-ji garden {{is considered one of}} the finest surviving examples of kare-sansui ("dry landscape"), a refined type of Japanese Zen temple garden design generally featuring distinctive larger rock formations arranged amidst a sweep of smooth pebbles (small, carefully selected polished river <b>rocks)</b> <b>raked</b> into linear patterns that facilitate meditation. The temple and its gardens are listed as one of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto, and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|R
40|$|AbstRAct Forest stand {{diversification}} {{in terms}} of plant species and spacing of plantings is critical to restoring components of native forests, reducing risks of insect and disease outbreaks, and providing a variety of habitats for native birds and other forest animals. We share the results of experimentation with reforestation practices to achieve more diverse upland forests in northeastern Minnesota. We also share {{the results of a}} study to determine the impact of site preparation (<b>rock</b> <b>raking)</b> and seedling “release ” (removing competing surrounding vegetation after two years) on survival and height of 19 native trees and shrubs. After five years, seedling survival across the 19 species ranged from 31 % to 94 %, with mean of 72 %. Survival was higher for sites receiving the preparation treatment (76 %) than for those not receiving the treatment (68 %). Site preparation significantly increased seedling height for eight species. In year three of the study we removed nearby competing vegetation (release treatment), which resulted in significantly greater seedling height for two species and less height growth for three species after two years. We discuss the value of increases in survival and height in the context of overall forest management objectives and other management strategies to diversify forest species and structure...|$|R

50|$|It is a tsubo-niwa, a small {{enclosed}} garden, {{composed of}} <b>rocks</b> placed on <b>raked</b> sand. Concentric gravel circles around stones placed towards {{each end of}} the garden are connected by parallel ridges and furrows. The garden is briefly illuminated by the sun at around noon each day, and it is occasionally covered by snow in the winter. The garden symbolises a Zen saying, that the harder a stone is thrown in, the bigger the ripples.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Corliss of TIME admired Orlandi's {{costumes and}} Laws' design for their [...] "giddily precise exaggeration" [...] and {{wrote that the}} script [...] "has a gentle heart to humanize its sharp sitcom wit" [...] advising his readers to [...] "stay for the movie's denouement: a two-minute speech that wraps up the plot like Christmas ribbons around a time bomb." [...] But he found the film to be [...] "miscast at the top" [...] and [...] "conflicted about its subject -- it both derides and adores {{what it means to}} parody" [...] and that {{director}} [...] "Reed often uses a gong where chimes would do". Corliss concludes [...] "As you see, we too are conflicted about this film. We want to love it, but like a <b>Rock</b> Hudson <b>rake,</b> we keep finding fault in its allure. We want to hate it, but like Doris Day, we finally can't say no." ...|$|R

The album was preceded by the first single [...] "1989" [...] on March 16. The Rakes recorded the album with Chris Zane in Berlin, Germany, a decision that lead singer Alan Donohoe explained is because [...] "The London music scene is so dull--it's like wading through a swamp of shit. We just wanted to be somewhere more inspiring." [...] Hence the name of the album which is the German word for 'sound'.|$|R
50|$|This {{embankment}} {{supports a}} pedestrian walkway {{from the bridge}} {{to the corner of}} Bristol Street. In an unusual arrangement, the stair at the bottom of this walkway passes below the awning of {{what appears to be a}} former corner shop. The path, supported on a stonework retaining wall, then ramps up to a dog-leg. Here the retaining wall rakes down to form a low wall in front of a vegetated <b>rock</b> face, before <b>raking</b> up again to meet the bridge. The dog-leg in the path takes it behind this overgrown embankment and connects it with the footpath on Dornoch Terrace. A simple painted timber handrail follows the top of the retaining wall.|$|R
40|$|The {{strategy}} of <b>raking</b> <b>rock</b> fragments from the lunar regolith {{as a means}} of acquiring representative samples has wide support due to science return, spacecraft simplicity (reliability) and economy [3, 4, 5]. While there exists widespread agreement that raking or sieving the bulk regolith is good strategy, there is lively discussion about the minimum sample size. Advocates of consor-tium studies desire fragments large enough to support petrologic and isotopic studies. Fragments from 5 to 10 mm are thought adequate [4, 5]. Yet, Jolliff et al. [6] demonstrated use of 2 - 4 mm fragments as repre-sentative of larger rocks. Here we make use of cura-torial records and sample catalogs to give a different perspective on minimum sample size for a robotic sample collector...|$|R
50|$|A formal {{garden in}} the Persian garden and European garden design traditions is {{rectilinear}} and axial in design. The equally formal garden, without axial symmetry (asymmetrical) or other geometries, is the garden design tradition of Chinese gardens and Japanese gardens. The Zen garden of <b>rocks,</b> moss and <b>raked</b> gravel is an example. The Western model is an ordered garden laid out in carefully planned geometric and often symmetrical lines. Lawns and hedges in a formal garden need to be kept neatly clipped for maximum effect. Trees, shrubs, subshrubs and other foliage are carefully arranged, shaped and continually maintained. A French garden or Garden à la française, is a specific kind of formal garden, {{laid out in the}} manner of André Le Nôtre; it is centered on the façade of a building, with radiating avenues and paths of gravel, lawns, parterres and pools (bassins) of reflective water enclosed in geometric shapes by stone coping, with fountains and sculpture.|$|R

In 2007, Groove Armada recorded a cover with Alan Donohoe of art <b>rock</b> band The <b>Rakes</b> on vocals for the compilation Radio 1 Established 1967. New Found Glory recorded a pop punk {{cover of the}} song with Max Bemis for their 2007 album From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II. A cover of the song by Lion of Panjshir was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness. Melissa Totten did a Hi-NRG cover for her 2008 dance album, Forever Madonna. An instrumental version was played in the Full House episode 13 Candles when Kimmy dares D.J. to kiss Kevin at her party. The original Madonna recording was also featured in the 2004 film 13 Going on 30, starring Jennifer Garner. At {{the end of the}} film, the song is played again, but to signify Jenna Rink's life staying on the [...] "good path" [...] 17 years later, and a bigger, modern rock/string orchestration by the film's composer Theodore Shapiro is added. Chris Griffin performed the song during the [...] "Long John Peter" [...] episode of Family Guy. Kelly Clarkson covered the song during her 2012 Stronger Tour per fan request in Bossier City, Louisiana. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was also featured in the 2016 web film The Do-Over by Adam Sandler.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted as a preliminary {{effort to develop}} a methodology to predict pore pressure in a rock formation during drilling, {{for all types of}} rocks and situations. Specifically, it was investigated whether or not the virgin pore pressure (the pore pressure of the undisturbed rock) can be determined at the drill bit from drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. Several drilling situations were analyzed to develop models relating pore pressure to drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. Three approaches to the modeling of such drilling situations were considered, which were used to predict pore pressure and compare the predictions to actual drilling data. The first approach used the concept of the effective stress in conjunction to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The second approach used the concept of the mechanical specific energy. The third approach made use of basic principles to relating virgin pore pressure to drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. This third approach resulted in the proposal of a more fundamental way of viewing mechanical specific energy (MSE) and the use of Biot's poroelasticity theory to describe the cutting process of rock. The first approach did not provide an adequate prediction of virgin pore pressure for all types of rocks and situations. The second approach showed promising results with limited actual drilling data. A sensitivity analysis of the model resulting from the third approach indicated that pore pressure, type of <b>rock,</b> and back <b>rake</b> angle of the cutter are the most significant factors affecting the energy required to break the rock. Moreover, rate of cutting stress, depth of cut, and type of pore fluid become significant factors of the cutting process only when a low-porosity, low-permeability rock is considered. It was concluded that there exists a relationship among pore pressure, drilling and environmental parameters, as well as solid and pore fluid properties. Therefore, it is possible in principle to determine the virgin pore pressure at the drill bit from drilling parameters, environmental parameters, and material properties. However, further work is required to establish a quantitative relationship among the significant parameters before a methodology to predict virgin pore pressure for all types of rocks and situations can be developed...|$|R
