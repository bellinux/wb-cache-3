The proposed filter has one {{voltage input}} and two current outputs and can simultaneously realize low-pass (LP) and band-pass (BP) responses without {{any changes in}} the circuit topology. Additionally, trans-admittance <b>type</b> second-order universal <b>filter</b> that has low-pass, band-pass, high-pass (HP), all-pass (AP) and notch (N) outputs is realized by adding a circuitry. The transfer admittance parameter g 0, natural frequency f 0 and quality factor Q of the trans-admittance <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> can be electronically tuned by changing DC control current sources. Some time and frequency domain simulations are performed using PSPICE program for the proposed trans-admittance <b>type</b> <b>filters.</b> Bu çakışmada, kare-kök-ortamlı, elektronik olarak ayarlanabilen, girişi gerilim çıkışı akım olan ikinci dereceden bir geçiş-iletkenliği tür...|$|R

For entity search and browsing systems, filter-ing is very useful for users to find entities {{that they are}} interested in.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the head losses in several type metal body disc filters manufactured by domestic companies. In order to meet the objective, three different filter designs (L, LT and Y type), each at four different inlet and outlet pipe diameters, were used to measure the head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. A total of sixteen filters manufactured by three domestic companies (A, B and C) and two different disc elements (linear and curly) were taken into consideration in this study. A comparison of the different filter designs in terms of measured the head losses indicated that in all cases while the L <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> gave the highest head loss, the other two designs provided less head losses at the same flow rate. Furthermore, the head losses in C−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with curly groove shape discs were less than B−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with linear groove shape discs in comparing with the LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> produced by two different manufacturers even though the design and the size of the filter body were similar. The differences in the head loss can be clarified with the help of the results obtained from the structural characteristic of filtering elements. As a result, in drip irrigation systems, the use of Y and LT <b>type</b> disc <b>filters</b> with curly groove shaped discs are recommended in order to obtain less head losses and low energy requirements when compared with filters used in this study.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} terminology integration {{characteristics of}} local specialty specific and general vocabularies {{in order to}} facilitate the appropriate inclusion and mapping of these terms into a large-scale terminology. METHODS: We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratios for Automated Term Composition to correctly map 9050 local specialty specific (dermatology) terms and 4994 local general terms to UMLS using Metaphrase. Results were systematically combined among exact matches, semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtered</b> matches, and non-filtered matches. For the general set, an analysis of semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtering</b> was performed. RESULTS: Dermatology exact matches defined a sensitivity of 51 % (57 % for general terms) and a specificity of 86 % (92 % general terms). Including semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtered</b> matches increased sensitivity (75 % dermatology; 88 % general); as did inclusion of non-filtered matches (98 % and 99 %). These inclusions correspondingly decreased specificity (filtered: 82 % and 74 %; non-filtered: 52 % and 32 %). Positive predictive values for exact matches (93. 0 % dermatology, 97. 6 % general) were improved by small but significant (p < 0. 001) margins by including filtered matches (95. 1 % dermatology, 98. 4 % general) but decreased with non-filtered matches (89. 2 % dermatology, 87. 8 % general). Adding additional semantic <b>types</b> to the <b>filtering</b> algorithm failed to improve the positive predictive value or the positive likelihood ratio of term mapping, in spite of a 2. 3 % improvement in sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Automated methods for mapping local "colloquial" terminologies to large-scale controlled health vocabulary systems are practical (ppv 95 % dermatology, 98 % general).
