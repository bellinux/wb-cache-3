40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{population}} aging and the demographic crisis throughout Europe and the developed world, the public pension systems will become increasingly strained as the proportion of pensioners to the working population will continue to increase. Empirical evidence shows that individuals fail to save enough for retirement to compensate for the less than optimal level of public pensions, and thus are facing the risk of a decrease in the standard of living in their post-retirement years. This larger context makes the study of <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> behavior an important matter. The objective {{of this paper is to}} document current trends in <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> behavior from the data collected through an online survey of Romanian households.

40|$|In the UK, new Government pension reforms {{aimed at}} {{preventing}} {{a future of}} poorer pensioners represent a continuing policy emphasis on individual responsibility. Two main elements of the reforms are the introduction of Personal Accounts and a gradual increase {{in the age of}} eligibility for state pensions, from 65 to 68. These reforms will affect young people in particular. The success of the reforms in preventing a future of poorer pensioners will require young people to save more in Personal Accounts or alternative <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> vehicles. Young people wishing to retire before the state pension age will need to save even greater amounts. Despite the implications of these reforms for young people, <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> amongst young people is an under-researched topic. This research aims to help fill the gap. The research examines <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> behaviour and attitudes amongst young people under the age of 35, using secondary data analysis of the 2005 / 6 Family Resources Survey and semi-structured interviews. The findings are analysed within a framework of structure versus agency. The results suggest that although the majority of young people have positive attitudes towards <b>retirement</b> <b>saving,</b> actual pension saving activity depends more on labour market position than on saving intentions. In terms of access to pensions, young people are structurally disadvantaged when compared with other age groups, yet the blame for failure to save falls firmly upon the individual. The policy implications are that Personal Accounts will increase the level of <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> amongst young people, but considerable numbers of young people with limited access to the new scheme will remain disadvantaged. Furthermore, very few young {{people will be able to}} reach the level of saving required to retire before the new state pension age.

25|$|Corporations are {{chartered}} {{under state}} law, the larger mostly in Delaware, but leave investors free to organize voting rights and board representation as they choose. Because of unequal bargaining power, but also historic caution of labor unions, shareholders monopolize voting rights in American corporations. From the 1970s employees and unions sought representation on company boards. This could happen through collective agreements, as it historically occurred in Germany or other countries, or through employees demanding further representation through employee stock ownership plans, but they aimed for voice independent from capital risks {{that could not}} be diversified. By 1980, workers had attempted to secure board representation at corporations including United Airlines, the General Tire and Rubber Company, and the Providence and Worcester Railroad. However, in 1974 the Securities and Exchange Commission, run by appointees of Richard Nixon, had rejected that employees who held shares in AT were entitled to make shareholder proposals to include employee representatives on the board of directors. This position was eventually reversed expressly by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 §971, which subject to rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission entitles shareholders to put forward nominations for the board. Instead of pursuing board seats through shareholder resolutions the United Auto Workers, for example, successfully sought board representation by collective agreement at Chrysler in 1980. The United Steel Workers secured board representation in five corporations in 1993. Some representation plans were linked to employee stock ownership plans, and were open to abuse. At the energy company, Enron, workers were encouraged by management to invest an average of 62.5 per cent of their <b>retirement</b> <b>savings</b> from 401(k) plans in Enron stock against basic principles of prudent, diversified investment, and had no board representation. When Enron collapsed in 2003, employees lost a majority of their pension savings. For this reason, employees and unions have sought representation because they invest their labor in the firm, and do not want undiversifiable capital risk. Empirical research suggests by 1999 there were at least 35 major employee representation plans with worker directors, though often linked to corporate stock.|$|E

40|$|<b>Retirement</b> <b>saving</b> {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} {{over the last two}} decades. There has been a shift from employer-managed defined benefit pensions to defined contribution <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> plans that are largely controlled by employees. In 1980, 92 percent of private <b>retirement</b> <b>saving</b> contributions were to employer-based plans and 64 percent of these contributions were to defined benefit plans. Today, about 85 percent of private contributions are to plans in which individuals decide how much to contribute to the plan, how to invest plan assets and how and when to withdraw money from the plan. In this paper we use both macro and micro data to describe the change in retirement assets and in <b>retirement</b> <b>saving.</b> We give particular attention to the possible substitution of pension assets in one plan for assets in another plan such as the substitution of 401 (k) assets for defined benefit plan assets. Aggregate data show that between 1975 and 1999 assets to support retirement increased about five-fold relative to wage and salary income. This increase suggests large increases in the wealth of future retirees. The enormous increase in defined contribution plan assets dwarfed any potential displacement of defined benefit plan assets. In addition, in recent years the annual 'retirement plan contribution rate,' defined as retirement plan contributions as a percentage of NIPA personal income, has been over 5 percent. This is much higher than the NIPA total personal saving rate, which has been close to zero. <b>Retirement</b> <b>saving</b> as a share of personal income today would likely be at least one percentage point greater {{had it not been for}} legislation in the 1980 s that limited employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans, and the reduction in defined benefit plan contributions associated with the rising stock market of the 1990 s. It is also likely that the 'retirement plan contribution rate' would be much higher today if it were not for the 1986 retrenchment of the IRA program. Rising retirement plan contributions, as well as favorable rates of return on retirement plan assets in the 1990 s, explain the large increase in these assets relative to income.
