5|$|The Burys {{travelled}} {{north as}} second-class {{passengers on the}} steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee {{on the evening of}} 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was <b>re-painting</b> the public house frequented by William.|$|E

Two of Vueling's A320 {{aircraft}} (EC-KDG and EC-KDH) were <b>re-painted</b> into MTV liveries with some MTV styling on-board too. The designs of both liveries were created by Custo Dalmau and both liveries were removed at the end of 2009. In the summer season of 2010, EC-KDG had again been <b>re-painted</b> into an MTV livery, and in 2011 it was <b>re-painted</b> into a livery based on the DJ and producer David Guetta; the livery has since been removed and co-operation with MTV has since ended.|$|R

25|$|During the {{restoration}} in 2014, {{a course of}} red sandstone blocks was discovered on the Colmore Row and Church Street façades above the windows across the first four floors. The building is predominantly painted limestone and the specification of works required <b>re-painting</b> of all stonework. However the aesthetic impact of the red sandstone courses was deemed positive enough to be left exposed.|$|E
25|$|Almost 60 years later, in 1937, the iconostasis was renovated again {{although}} but the <b>re-painting</b> {{work was}} considered to be of really low artistic quality. This time the icons were not removed from the frame, and only a thick layer of varnish was applied to them. This layer made the icons lose their original colors and become even darker. The wooden structure of the iconostasis was painted with light green oil paint.|$|E

Coates, who was nominated for an Emmy Award {{for his work on}} the Stephen King television miniseries The Stand, arrived 11 weeks {{prior to the start of}} filming to do prep work. While most of the filming took place on the natural Tybee Island beach or on pre-constructed private property, Coates oversaw the <b>re-painting</b> of the pier and the construction of the carnival and church.|$|E

25|$|Although Les Demoiselles had an {{enormous}} and profound influence on modern art, its impact was not immediate, and the painting stayed in Picasso's studio for many years. At first, only Picasso's intimate circle of artists, dealers, collectors and friends {{were aware of the}} work. While many were shocked and some outraged, influential people such as Georges Braque and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler were supportive. Soon after the late summer of 1907, Picasso and his long-time lover Fernande Olivier (1881–1966) had a parting of the ways. The <b>re-painting</b> of the two heads on the far right of Les Demoiselles fueled speculation that it was an indication of the split between Picasso and Olivier. Although they later reunited for a period, the relationship ended in 1912.|$|E
25|$|The road {{across the}} span was {{originally}} two-way, plus {{there was a}} sidewalk along the south side. On January 25, 1914, the span unexpectedly opened during a windstorm, and trapped a young man on the open swing span section until the bridge operators could row out to the center span and use the turn-key to put the span back into proper position. The state took over ownership of the span in 1938. In June 1952, the span was opened {{for the first time}} in 25 years to allow an Army Corp of Engineers vessel to pass, and the span opened for the final time in October 1960. In the 1980s the swivel became inoperable. The bridge was nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places about 2006. In March 2007, planned maintenance and <b>re-painting</b> began on the bridge, closing the bridge to traffic at times. The $2.5 million project was completed in October 2007.|$|E
500|$|Since completion, PA378 has {{undergone}} little major change, but the highway {{has undergone}} several rehabilitations. The Hill to Hill Bridge received a minor fire during {{reconstruction of the}} bridge, when {{a piece of equipment}} had its motor catch fire on April 13, 2009, when the bridge was undergoing <b>re-painting.</b> The bridge repainting was completed on May 15, 2009, after the closing of a bridge and was re-opened later due to rainfall in the area.|$|E

500|$|There {{was some}} {{discussion}} of demolishing {{the hall in}} the 1980s after the structure had become dilapidated. One proposal called for building a replica on the same site as the original, but school administrators opted to renovate Waller Hall. From November 1987 to November 1989 the [...] building went through a $2.26 million renovation. This renovation addressed interior issues with the building including seismic upgrades {{in the event of}} a large magnitude earthquake. These renovations also turned the attic into an office suite for the school’s president. After renovations in 1988 the building was used for university administration offices. Further renovations were completed in 2005 at a cost of $1.3 million for upgrading the 100-year-old windows to newer energy efficient models, repairing the brick, fixing leaks, installing skylights, <b>re-painting,</b> and slightly lightening the exterior red-brick coloring.|$|E

He was a collector of antique French fashion dolls and Kamkins cloth dolls but also Barbie dolls and other vintage post-war fashion dolls since the early 1970s. He started to re-design dolls for his own amusement, <b>re-painting</b> and re-dressing Barbies but also other commercial dolls from the 1960s and 1970s as a teenager.

He also at this date had a large collection of fashion dolls, mostly Barbie dolls dressed by major fashion designers {{from all over the world}} made for him personally by the designers he befriended or knew. In 1983 he was contacted by Mattel, France after an article in French Elle magazine appeared [...] By early 1984 [...] he created for Mattel the “Nouveau Théatre de la Mode Barbie”, which was the first Barbie doll bearing a designer’s name on its box, also well as his follow-up Barbie doll for Mattel, USA, called [...] "Feelin' Groovy Barbie" [...] in 1986.

These Professors in the Nameless lived with ease, with safety, by a mere Reputation, constructed in past times, and then too with no great effort, by quite another class of persons. Which Reputation, like a strong brisk-going undershot wheel, sunk into the general current, bade fair, with only a little annual <b>re-painting</b> on their part, to hold long together, and {{of its own accord}} assiduously grind for them.
