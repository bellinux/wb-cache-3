40|$|The Microsoft-based <b>mobile</b> <b>sales</b> {{management}} {{application is}} a sales force management application that currently running on Windows Mobile 6. 5. It handles sales-related activity and cuts down the administrative task of sales representative. Then, Windows {{launch a new}} mobile operating system, Windows Phone and stop providing support to Windows Mobile. This has become an obstacle for Windows Mobile development. From time to time, Windows Mobile will be eliminated from the market due to no support provided by Microsoft. Besides that, Windows Mobile application cannot run on Windows Phone mobile operating system {{due to lack of}} compatibility. Therefore, applications those run on Windows Mobile need to find a solution addressing this problem. The rise of cloud computing technology in delivering software as a service becomes a solution. The Microsoft-based <b>mobile</b> <b>sales</b> management application delivers a service to run in a web browser, rather than limited by certain type of mobile that run the Windows Mobile operating system. However, there are some security issues need to concern in order to deliver the Microsoft-based mobile application as a service in private cloud computing. Therefore, security model is needed to answer the security issues in private cloud computing. This research is to propose a security model for the Microsoft-based <b>mobile</b> <b>sales</b> management application in private cloud computing. Lastly, a User Acceptance Test (UAT) is carried out to test the compatibility between proposed security model of Microsoft-based <b>mobile</b> <b>sales</b> management application in a private cloud and tablet computers. </span...|$|R

40|$|Micro-sized {{commercial}} agencies face a poor {{electronic and}} <b>mobile</b> <b>sales</b> support. Most {{of the sales}} information systems are built for the usage within larger-sized companies. Problems particularly appear when processes of multiple suppliers have to {{be integrated into the}} sales processes of the commercial agencies. The paper addresses the issue of process optimization in form of a <b>mobile</b> multi-supplier <b>sales</b> information system for micro-sized commercial agencies. Two major areas of improvements can be realized: Firstly, by an optimized business process integration of multiple SME suppliers and their sales representatives in micro-sized commercial agencies (internal supplier oriented sales processes), and secondly, by an increased mobility in connection with an optimization of sales processes outside of the office infrastructure (external customer sales processes). The paper examines the common processes in commercial agencies and derives relevant processes as well as the appropriate IT-support in form of use cases. The relevant processes and the use cases depend strongly on certain key parameters of a commercial agency's business relationships with its suppliers. Therefore, the paper introduces a branch independent concept for the sales cockpit with the focus on selected sales scenarios, relevant business processes, and derived use cases depending on selected key parameters. By funding the research project M 3 V, the German Ministry of Economies and Technology aims to create a secure, <b>mobile,</b> multi-supplier <b>sales</b> information system as a service for micro-sized commercial agencies...|$|R
