40|$|Gene co-expression {{networks}} (GCNs) are graphic <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> depict <b>the</b> coordinated <b>transcription</b> {{of genes}} {{in response to}} certain stimuli. GCNs provide functional annotations of genes whose function is unknown and are further used in studies of translational functional genomics among species. In this work, a methodology for the reconstruction and comparison of GCNs is presented. This approach was applied using gene expression data that were obtained from immunity experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, soybean, tomato and cassava. After the evaluation of diverse similarity metrics for the GCN reconstruction, we recommended the mutual information coefficient measurement and a clustering coefficient-based method for similarity threshold selection. To compare GCNs, we proposed a multivariate approach based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Branches of plant immunity that were exemplified by each experiment were analyzed {{in conjunction with the}} PCA results, suggesting both the robustness and the dynamic nature of the cellular responses. The dynamic of molecular plant responses produced networks with different characteristics that are differentiable using our methodology. The comparison of GCNs from plant pathosystems, showed that in response to similar pathogens plants could activate conserved signaling pathways. <b>The</b> results confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> closeness of GCNs projected on the principal component space is an indicative of similarity among GCNs. This also can be used to understand global patterns of events triggered during plant immune responses...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{experiments}} indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> {{of genes}} into ncRNA can positively or negatively interfere with transcription into mRNA.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} in the yeast retrotransposon Ty 2 is regulated at transcriptional and translational levels. In this study, we have shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of Ty 2 is partially dependent on the membrane-bound glucose sensors Gpr 1 p and Mth 1 p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of Ty 2 decreased approx. 3 -fold in the gpr 1, mth 1 yeast mutant. Moreover, our results revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of Ty 2 fl uctuates during the growth stages of S. cerevisae. Both <b>transcription</b> and <b>the</b> frameshift rate of Ty 2 rapidly dropped when the stationary stage yeast cells were inoculated into fresh medium. There was an instant activation of Ty 2 transcription and a high level expression during the entire logarithmic stage of yeast growth. However, <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of Ty 2 decreased 2 -fold when the yeast cultures entered the stationary stage. The frameshift rate in Ty 2 also varied depending on the growth conditions. The highest frameshift level was observed during the mid-logarithmic stage. It decreased up to 2 -fold during the stationary stage. Furthermore, we have found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> frameshift rate of Ty 2 diminished at least 5 -fold in slowly growing yeasts. These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> and <b>the</b> frameshift effi ciency are coordinately regulated in the retrotransposon Ty 2 depending on the growth conditions of S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|Operationally, alpha {{genes of}} {{herpes simplex virus}} 1 were defined {{on the basis of}} <b>the</b> {{observations}} <b>that</b> they are <b>the</b> earliest genes expressed in the infected cell and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription,</b> processing, accumulation of the mRNA's in the infected cell cytoplasm can take place in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as cycloheximide.

Inasmuch as all the major alpha proteins (no. 0, 4, 22, and 27) were translated, we conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of all previously defined alpha genes is independent of the stringency of inhibition of protein synthesis and that pre-alpha genes cannot be detected in such experiments...|$|R

40|$|Genome-wide {{measurements}} of transcriptional activity in bacteria indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of successive genes is strongly correlated beyond {{the scale of}} operons. Here, we analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes to identify supra-operonic segments of genes that are proximal in {{a large number of}} genomes. We show that these synteny segments correspond to genomic units of strong transcriptional co-expression. Structurally, the segments contain operons with specific relative orientations (co-directional or divergent) and nucleoid-associated proteins are found to bind at their boundaries. Functionally, operons inside a same segment are highly co-expressed even in the apparent absence of regulatory factors at their promoter regions. Remote operons along DNA can also be co-expressed if their corresponding segments share a transcriptional or sigma factor, without requiring these factors to bind directly to the promoters of the operons. As evidence that these results apply across the bacterial kingdom, we demonstrate them both in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. <b>The</b> underlying process <b>that</b> we propose involves only RNA-polymerases and DNA: it implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of an operon mechanically enhances <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of adjacent operons. In support of a primary role of this regulation by facilitated co-transcription, we show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> en bloc of successive operons as a result of transcriptional read-through is strongly and specifically enhanced in synteny segments. Finally, our analysis indicates that facilitated co-transcription may be evolutionary primitive and may apply beyond bacteria...|$|R
