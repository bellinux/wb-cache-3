The hospice is <b>required</b> <b>by</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare.

Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

5|$|Sea vessels were <b>required</b> <b>by</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> {{register}} at the Castellania {{to operate}} in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size}} of the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer. The Castellania imposed a charge for those not having health assurance and having to lodge at the Lazzaretto.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are <b>required</b> <b>by</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case {{they are ready to}} be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

The agreed-upon rules were then approved by the Surgeon General and published in the Federal Register. The committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered, but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps.|$|E

5|$|During the Principate, {{it appears}} that most recruits, both legionary and auxiliary, were volunteers (voluntarii). Compulsory {{conscription}} (dilectus) was never wholly abandoned, but was generally only used in emergencies or before major campaigns when large numbers of additional troops were required. In marked contrast, the late army relied mainly on compulsion for its recruitment of Roman citizens. Firstly, the sons of serving soldiers or veterans were <b>required</b> <b>by</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> enlist. Secondly, a regular annual levy was held based on the indictio (land tax assessment). Depending {{on the amount of}} land tax due on his estates, a landowner (or group of landowners) would be required to provide a commensurate number of recruits to the army. Naturally, landowners had a strong incentive to keep their best young men to work on their estates, sending the less fit or reliable for military service. There is also evidence that they tried to cheat the draft by offering the sons of soldiers (who were liable to serve anyway) and vagrants (vagi) to fulfil their quota.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are <b>required</b> <b>by</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
