5000|$|The {{control system}} for a <b>recloser</b> allows a {{selected}} number of attempts to restore service after adjustable time delays. For example a <b>recloser</b> may have 2 or 3 [...] "fast" [...] <b>reclose</b> operations with a few seconds delay, then a longer delay and one reclose; if the last attempt is not successful, the <b>recloser</b> will lock out and require human intervention to reset. If the fault is a permanent fault (downed wires, tree limbs lying on the wires, etc.) the autorecloser will exhaust its pre-programmed attempts to re-energize the line and remain tripped off until manually commanded to try again. About 80-90% of faults on overhead power lines are transient and can be cured by autoreclosing. The result is increased availability of supply.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{placement}} of reclosers on overhead lines {{in a medium}} voltage distribution network is known to improve the reliability of a power system. Traditionally, <b>recloser</b> placement studies have not considered the effect of greater numbers of reclosers on network damage during faults or the effect of positioning on protection settings. <b>Recloser</b> positions that enhance {{the reliability of the}} system may not necessarily improve other problematic operational aspects, such as the damage to equipment and the risk of incorrect tripping due to the sudden increase in loading. This research seeks to prove the hypothesis that: <b>Recloser</b> placement studies with the additional consideration of protection-related factors such as equipment damage and the risk of false tripping will result in different <b>recloser</b> positions compared to when the priority is only on improving reliability indices and cost. A tool is developed to assess the reliability indices, cost, damage and the risk of false tripping and it determines the best <b>recloser</b> positioning based on the priority given to each factor considered. Using this tool, observations are made on the effect of the added factors of damage and the risk of false tripping on <b>recloser</b> positioning. The addition of the protection-related factors to the objective function is unique in its ability to realise the value of <b>recloser</b> positions that cater for minimizing the damage factor and the possibility of tripping on load. In the absence of these factors, the value of certain <b>recloser</b> positions would not be identified as they would not improve reliability or cost factors. The importance of reliability and cost are not overruled by the addition of the protection-related factors. The consideration of protection-related factors in the planning process of optimising <b>recloser</b> placement ensures that the protection of the overhead line is optimal and is not compromised in any way. This would inherently {{have a positive effect on}} the lifespan of the equipment on the feeder and the reliability of the feeder in the long-term.

50|$|Reclosers may {{cooperate}} with down-stream protective devices called sectionalizers, usually a disconnector or cutouts {{equipped with a}} tripping mechanism triggered by a counter or a timer. A sectionalizer is generally not rated to interrupt fault current and is therefore cheaper than a <b>recloser.</b> Each sectionalizer detects and counts fault current interruptions by the <b>recloser</b> (or circuit breaker). After a pre-determined number of interruptions, the sectionalizer will open, thereby isolating the faulty section of the circuit, allowing the <b>recloser</b> to restore supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|R

50|$|As {{the utility}} can be {{reasonably}} assured {{that they will}} always have a method for discovering a fault, whether that be automated or simply looking at the <b>recloser,</b> {{it is possible for}} the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line.
