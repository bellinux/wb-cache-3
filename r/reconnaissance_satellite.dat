5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with ground based detection of satellites.|$|E

25|$|USA 193, {{also known}} as NRO launch 21 (NROL-21 or simply L-21), was an American {{military}} <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> launched on December 14, 2006. The USA-193 was owned by the NRO and its precise function and purpose are classified. However, several websites speculate that the satellite was probably a high resolution radar satellite intended to produce images for the NRO. This argument is additionally supported {{by the fact that}} the satellite used a similar inclination to that of a Lacrosse Radar Satellite. Lacrosse is a terrestrial radar imaging <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> operated by the NRO. It utilizes a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to acquire high resolution images regardless of cloud cover.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellites</b> and {{their role in the}} present arms race. While volumes of material have been written on the arms race in general, or the weapons race in particular, very little has been written on the role of satellites in this conflict and almost nothing has been written on the role of <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellites.</b> There is a need for much greater debate on the role of <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellites</b> in outer space. <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>satellites</b> have, in part, rewritten the meaning of the arms race and they have contributed significantly to arms reductions talks between the two superpowers. This thesis examines <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellites</b> both in an historical and a modern context. Their legal status is examined. The political and military implications of <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellites</b> is discussed as well. In sum, this paper is a pioneering effort. It will explore a little-known topic in the hope that it will stimulate further discussion...|$|R

25|$|In August 1987, the Israeli {{government}} cancelled the IAI Lavi project, {{an attempt}} to develop an independent Israeli fighter aircraft. The Israelis found themselves unable to sustain the huge development costs, and faced U.S. opposition to a project that threatened U.S. influence in Israel and U.S. global military ascendancy. In September 1988, Israel launched an Ofeq <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> into orbit, using a Shavit rocket, thus becoming one of only eight countries possessing a capacity to independently launch satellites into space (two more have since developed this ability). The Alignment and Likud remained neck and neck in the 1988 elections (39:40 seats). Shamir successfully formed a national unity coalition with the Labour Alignment. In March 1990, Alignment leader Shimon Peres engineered a defeat {{of the government in}} a non-confidence vote and then tried to form a new government.

500|$|The {{project was}} created after the Central Intelligence Agency's 1957 National Intelligence Estimate 11-5-57, named [...] "Soviet Capabilities and Probable Programs in the Guided Missile Field", {{estimated}} that the Soviet Union {{would be capable of}} having a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> in space by 1963. The United States Air Force issued General Operational Requirement-170 on 19 June 1958 ordering the development of a system that was capable of destroying a satellite. Then the United States Air Force and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) commissioned studies by the Space Technology Laboratories and the Radio Corporation of America. The plan for development of the system formulated by the Air Force was shown to the National Security Council on 5 February 1960. On 17 March 1961, the Radio Corporation of America received a grant to develop Project SAINT.|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 1955, the U.S. Air Force {{had ordered}} the {{development}} of an advanced <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> to provide continuous surveillance of “preselected areas of the Earth” in order “to determine the status of a potential enemy’s war-making capability.” The result of this order was the creation of a then-secret USAF program known as WS-117L, which controlled the development of the first generation of American reconnaissance satellites. These included the Corona series of observation satellites and the [...] SAMOS satellite. The company that was to become the Lockheed-Martin Corporation which had been hired to design, develop, and manufacture the two series of satellites, suggested several other satellite programs to fill supporting roles, including a satellite that would use infrared sensors and a telescope to detect the heat produced by heavy bombers and ICBMs. In response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik and the appearance of the ICBM threat, Subsystem G was added to WS-117L before the end of 1957. With the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), Subsystem G was taken over by that organization and given the codename MiDAS in November 1958.|$|E

2500|$|By {{late summer}} of 1967, the {{modification}} work {{to both the}} D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now resume. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was [...] "quite a sight from the ground". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, {{the fact is that}} the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the SR-71 was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>satellite</b> technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.|$|E
