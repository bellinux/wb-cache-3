40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is said to}} be a major health threat which leads to {{disability}} in high and low-income countries. Nurses have been singled out amongst professional workers as one of those that are most prone to suffer from occupation-related low back pain. Physical activity has been recommended for the health and well-being of individuals, as well as in the management of low back pain. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between low back pain and physical activity levels among nurses in Kanombe Hospital, Kigali, as well as other confounding factors that lead to low back pain. This study adopted a cross-sectional and descriptive design. A total of 133 nurses participated in this study. Three self- administered questionnaires were used: socio-demographic data questionnaire, international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire (NMQ). More than three-quarters of the participants had low back pain (78 %) and female nurses were more affected than their male counterparts (84 %). Low back pain was significantly associated with gender (P= 0. 001) and marital status (P= 0. 020). Higher job-related physical activity (84 %) and lower leisure-time physical activity (5 %) were reported among nurses. Age (P= 0. 033), marital status (P= 0. 001) and working experience (P= 0. 026) of nurses were significantly associated with physical activity, but not with low back pain.

40|$|Background. The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to examine the prevalence of back injuries in competitive squash players. Methods. Experimental design: a retrospective analysis was made using a cross-section of current competitive squash players (survivor population). Setting/participants: an attempt was made to distribute a questionnaire on back injuries to all competitive squash players registered in the Otago provincial area, New Zealand, (n= 1047), of which 495 questionnaires were returned (47. 3 % compliance). Interventions: variables were cross-tabulated and analysed via descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, χ-analyses of trend and χ 2 tests of significance. Measures: the questionnaire obtained information on demographics, the level of play (ability), overall volume of play (average frequency and duration of all exposures), plus the occurrence and severity of back injury. Results. Nearly 52 % of the sample reported they had suffered back injury. Of these, 33. 5 % claimed squash initiated their injury, 20. 6 % claimed squash exacerbated a previous back injury and the remaining 45. 9 % felt that squash had no detrimental effect on their back injury. Significantly higher frequencies of back injury were observed in males (56. 5 % compared to 46. 4 % in females, p= 0. 033), in players of higher grade (p= 0. 006), and with increased frequency (p= 0. 01), but not duration of play (p= 1. 0). Conclusions. These results suggest that the greater activity and possible over-reaching for the ball associated with higher levels of play may increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> and provides tentative support for the notion that back injuries in squash players might be related to periods of relative over- use. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Firefighting {{is a very}} {{hazardous}} profession. Firefighters {{experience an}} injury rate that is three times higher than other physically demanding professions and the death rate in the fire service is also much higher compared to typical. Throughout the literature, data suggest the physical nature of firefighting contributes to {{the high incidence of}} injury and death among firefighters. As such, special interest groups and firefighting organizations advocate for firefighters to exercise and stay fit in order to safeguard their physical health. Yet, despite these efforts, firefighters still experience a very high incidence of back injuries and heart attacks which can lead to early retirement from disability or death. In the first aim of this dissertation, we examined the relationships between specific back fitness tests and history of back injuries in 113 firefighters in an effort to understand which fitness tests may aid in screening firefighters for <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>injury.</b> We found that a test of lumbar extension flexibility was associated with a higher incidence of back injuries among our sample (p< 0. 01). In the second aim of the study, we investigated whether perceived fitness was related to history of back injuries since firefighters’ perceptions of their fitness level may direct how they choose to perform job tasks that pose high risk for injury. Within the same sample of firefighters, we found that perceived fitness was not related to history of back injuries nor was the relationship between actual fitness and history of back injuries mediated by perceived fitness. However, perceived fitness correlated with scores on our back strength (r= 0. 28; p= 0. 003) and hamstring strength (r= 0. 21; p= 0. 03) tests.

Number of lifts and amount of weight (whole pound weight of the student with disability) were recorded. Results revealed a large variance in both lifting frequency and total weight lifted among subjects in each setting. In early intervention, total weight lifted ranged from 30 - 125 pounds (lbs.) with a lifting frequency range of 1 - 11. Total weight range of elementary school subjects was 40 - 926 lbs. with a lift frequency of 1 - 21.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has classified {{the occupation of}} sheep shearing as heavy work where shearers flex their spine and hips {{for long periods of}} time, handle awkward loads and expend high amounts of energy. The aim of this research was to investigate the magnitude of spinal forces produced during the shearing phase of the work and to determine whether the use of a commercially available back support harness would reduce these forces. Following discussion on task complexity and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> with senior shearing instructors, three component tasks of the shearing phase were identified as posing high risk of injury and were prioritized for primary analysis. Although the dragging out of a sheep in preparation for shearing and an unexpected loss of animal control were also identified as being of high risk, technological and instrumentation difficulties precluded their analysis. Twelve experienced shearers were videotaped while shearing with and without the use of a back harness. Surface mounted retro-reflective markers placed on the trunk defined three linked segments: Pelvis, Lumbar and Head, Arms, and Upper Trunk (HAUT). A 3 D, link segment, top down, inverse dynamics approach was used to describe the motion and to estimate forces involved during the identified tasks of shearing. The spinal force/time profiles of this sample of shearers demonstrated large compressive and shear forces for all three tasks that are close to the NIOSH and University of Waterloo action limits for compressive and shear forces respectively (McGill 1997, Yingling and McGill 1999, Marras 2000). The use of the back support harness reduced these forces by substantial and statistically significant amounts. This effect was consistent across all three tasks. The results of this study demonstrate the production of high levels of compressive and shear forces within the spine of shearers during the three shearing tasks studied and that the use of a back support harness can substantially reduce these forces. Therefore the use of a back harness may reduce the cumulative load on the spine during shearing thereby moderating damage to the articular structures. However it is not known whether the harness would protect the spine from a sudden or unexpected force. No Full Tex...|$|E

A total of eight male graduate students (mean age, height and weight were 29. 4 years, 176. 8 cm and 81. 0 kg respectively) participated in a digging task using a hand hoe. The digging task was performed within three minutes in a 2 m * 1. 5 m metal box full of moist sand. 3 video cameras were installed to record the working posture. At the last minute, during interval of 15 seconds, heart rates (HR) along with rate of perceived exertion (RPE) 6 - 20 were measured to assess the physical load. Awkward postures while the hoe lifted up as well as stroke the soil were frozen and different joint angles were measured to provide input for 3 - dimesional static strength prediction programme (3 D SSPP). The data analyses included linear regression for HR as a function of RPE: 3 D SSPP software calculated the percentage of population capable of performing the task and low-back compressive forces. Compression force on L 5 /S 1 was plotted as a function of HR and RPE. The results revealed that the correlation coefficient (r) for HR and RPE (p< 0. 05) was 0. 59 : the measured and perceived physical load range from light to heavy. the output obtained from the software showed that low-back compressive forces were below the niosh recommended safe limit (3400 n) when the hoe lifted up. however, when the hoe stroke the soil, compression force on l 5 /s 1 for 25 % from the subjects exceeded the niosh safe limit and therefore they were at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>injury.</b> when the force on l 5 /s 1 plotted as a function of hr and rpe, the results showed that there was no linear relationship between these variables. in conclusion, hr a long with rpe proved to be used in the laboratory as well as in the field. 3 d sspp could be used in the laboratory, nevertheless, in the field, one video camera would be appropriate.

40|$|Remote area staff {{performing}} manual {{patient handling}} tasks {{in the absence}} of patient lifting hoists available in most health care settings are at an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injuries. The objective of this project was to identify the patient handling methods that have the lowest risk of injury. The patient handling task of lifting a patient from floor to a chair or wheelchair is a common task performed in a remote health care setting. The task was performed utilising three methods, these being: (1) heads/tails lift, (2) use of two Blue MEDesign® slings and (3) use of a drawsheet. The task of the heads/tails lift was broken down into two distinctly separate subtasks: lifting from the (1) head and (2) tail ends of the patient load. These techniques were selected based on criteria including current practice, durability, portability, accessibility, ease of storage and cost to supply. Postural data were obtained using a Vicon 370 three - dimensional motion measurement and analysis system in the Biomechanics & Gait laboratory at the University of New South Wales. Forty reflective markers were placed on the subject to obtain the following joint angles: ankle, knee, hip, torso, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The raw data were converted into the respective joint angles (Y, X, Z) for further analysis. The postural data was analysed using the University of Michigan’s Three-Dimensional Static Strength Prediction Program (3 D SSPP) and the relative risk of injury was based on the following three values: (1) a threshold value of 3, 400 N for compression force, (2) a threshold value of 500 N for shear force, and (3) population strength capability data. The effects on changes to the anthropometric data was estimated and analysed using the in-built anthropometric data contained within the 3 D SSPP program for 6 separate lifter scenarios, these being male and female 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentiles. Changes to the patient load were estimated and analysed using the same computer software. Estimated compressive and shear forces were found to be lower with the drawsheet and tail component of the heads/tails lift in comparison {{to the use of the}} Blue MEDesign® straps and head component of the heads/tails lift. The results obtained for the strength capability aspect of each of the lifts indicated a higher percentage of the population capable of both the drawsheet and tail end of the heads/tails lift. The relative <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> for the lifters is distributed more evenly with the drawsheet lift as opposed to the heads/tails (tail) lift where risk is disproportionate with the heavier end being lifted. The use of lifter anthropometrics does not appear to be a realistic variable to base assumptions on which group of the population are capable of safely performing this task in a remote setting. This study advocates the use of the drawsheet lift in a remote setting based on the author’s experience and the biomechanical results obtained in this study. The drawsheet lift is both more accessible and provides a more acceptable risk when more than two patient handlers are involved, in comparison to the other lifts utilised lifting patients from floor to a chair...|$|E

Self reports and {{functional}} capacity evaluations are commonly used to determine a worker 2 ̆ 7 s lifting capacity, however, amongst uninjured individuals, conflicting views exist regarding how perceived physical functioning matches actual functioning {{in the absence of}} fear of pain and/or re-injury. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare self-reports and actual lifting performance in a group of healthy young men aged 18 – 25 years. Method/participants: A correlational prospective design compared perceived lifting capacity, using self-report and the Spinal Function Sort, and actual lifting capacity, using the EPIC Lift Capacity test in 31 subjects. Results: Subjects 2 ̆ 7 self-reported lifting capacity varied more widely than their actual scores, indicating that they were less accurate at predicting their lifting performance using the self-report measure. One third of subjects were able to accurately self-report their lifting performance, approximately one-third underestimated, and the remaining third overestimated their lifting ability. Only two significant relationships were identified between self-reported and actual lifting performance for frequent knuckle-shoulder and floor-shoulder lifts. These correlations were weak and well below the 0. 75 level considered necessary to be clinically significant. Conclusions: This study found that self-report measures are not suitable when used in isolation. It is therefore recommended that self-report measures are used in conjunction with functional capacity evaluations to determine lifting capacity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The {{golf swing}} exposes the spine to complex torsional, compressive, and {{shearing}} loads that increase a player's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> injury. The crunch factor (CF) {{has been described}} as a measure to evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> low <b>back</b> <b>injuries</b> in golfers and is based on the notion that lateral flexion and axial trunk rotation jointly contribute to spinal degeneration. However, few studies have evaluated the appropriateness of this measure in golfers with low back pain (LBP). PURPOSE: To objectively examine the usefulness of the CF as a measure for assessing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> low <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> in golfers. STUDY DESIGN: Field-based research using a cross-sectional design. METHODS: This research used three-dimensional motion analysis to assess the golf swings of 12 golfers with LBP and 15 asymptomatic controls. Three-dimensional kinematics were derived using Vicon Motus, and the CF was calculated as the instantaneous product of axial trunk rotation velocity and lateral trunk flexion angle. RESULTS: Maximum CFs and their timings were not significantly different between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Furthermore, for those golfers who produced higher CFs (irrespective of the group), the increased magnitude could not be attributed to an increased axial angular trunk velocity or lateral flexion angle, but rather to a concomitant increase in both of these variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that although the fundamental concepts that underpin the CF seem sensible, this measure does not appear to be sensitive enough to distinguish golfers with LBP from the asymptomatic players.

This study analysed injury incidence among residential care workers and determined perceived stress and exertion, hand forces, postures, and task frequencies encountered in routine work tasks. Biomechanical analysis determined joint forces at the low back to be in the range of 467 N to 381 1 N compression and 66 N to 471 N A-P shear over all tasks. Task frequencies, joint compression forces, population low <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> data and material fatigue characteristics were used to model <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> low <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> as a function of occupational exposure. The fatigue model predicts that 50 % of residential care workers will experience a low <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> by their eighth year of work experience, and 95 % by their fifteenth year of work...|$|R
40|$|Lumbosacral {{supports}} (LSSs) {{have been}} used to minimize the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>back</b> <b>injuries.</b> Theoretically, an LSS will raise intra-abdominal pressure (lAP) and re-duce loads in the lower back region. This investigation compared three different LSSs with an unsupported condition. Nine males lifted a weighted box four times, once per condition, at 90 % of their one-repetition maximum. Conditions were compared in terms of effects on IAP and its relieving force on L 5 -S 1 kinetics. A multivariate analysis of covariance revealed no statistically significant differences among the three LSSs and the nonsupport conditions on the aforementioned de-pendent variables. This suggests that there is no difference among LSSs in terms of their biomechanical effects on the lower back region and that the use of any LSS does not necessarily afford more protection than a proper lift without one...|$|R
40|$|Kneeling in a {{restricted}} posture during manual materials handling {{has been associated}} with increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> low <b>back</b> pain. Little is known about the effect of kneeling posture on spinal loads. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare differences in spinal loading between kneeling and standing postures for lifting tasks. Twelve subjects asymmetrically lifted luggage of three weights to three heights from floor while kneeling. Three subjects also performed the same tasks from waist height while standing. An adapted free-dynamic EMG-assisted biomechanical model was used to calculate spinal loads. Statistical analysis showed that there was no difference in compression between kneeling and standing (p= 0. 9605), but kneeling resulted in increased anterior-posterior and lateral shear forces on the lumbar spine (p = 0. 0002 and p< 0. 0001, respectively). Spinal loading changes while kneeling in {{a restricted}} posture may increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> low <b>back</b> <b>injury</b> and must be considered in ergonomic job design...|$|R
40|$|For {{better or}} worse, {{more people are}} {{spending}} their days in front of computers. With this increase in computer use, more people are complaining <b>of</b> <b>back</b> and neck pain. The simple act of changing your posture, however, can dramatically reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> or neck <b>injury</b> from prolonged computer use. RoCo, the robotic computer, can encourage computer users to change posture by moving its screen to different positions. Having introduced motion, RoCo can now also begin to build a social relationship with the user and affect his affective state.

40|$|Vehicle {{vibration}} exposure {{has been linked}} to chronic back pain and low back symptoms among agricultural tractor drivers. The objectives of this study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) were to assess driver whole body vibration (WBV) exposures and recommend interventions to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> related <b>injuries,</b> particularly relative to vehicle jarring/jolting (the transient mechanical shock components of WBV). The methodology included collecting, from two independent samples, ?eld data and health and work history data of farm equipment operators. Data were collected during mowing, raking, baling, chiseling, tilling, and road travel for different model tractors. Spraying using a sprayer and shrub removal with a skid steer loader were also included. Based on ISO 2631 (1985), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, threshold limit values, presents 0. 5 m/s 2 as the action level recommended by the Commission of European Communities for overall weighted total RMS acceleration (vector sum for axes x, y, and z) [ACGIH, 2006. Threshold limit values and biological exposure indices. Cincinnati, OH]. WBV measured at the operator/seat interface exceeded this action level. The roughest rides and highest vector sum accelerations occurred with small utility tractor mowers (3. 3 and 2. 8 m/s 2) and a skid steer loader (1. 7 m/s 2). Major ?ndings from health and work history data showed 96...|$|R

This paper presents a study on a combination lift and lower manual handling task and was designed to simulate the loading of grocery bags into a car trunk. Twelve male subjects performed an externally paced task of lifting grocery bags loaded with weights from 15 cm above the floor and over a wooden sill. There were two different sill heights of 70 cm and 90 cm, and for each of these heights there were two frequencies of 3 and 6 lifts per cycle. The dependent variables were maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWOL). A unique lifting sequence and {{a modified version of the}} psychophysical methodology were used to determine MAWOL. There was a significant difference in the MAWOL across the two sill heights as well as the MAWOL at the two different frequencies. Plastic bags were determined to increase the average load lifted by 27 % as compared to paper bags. At normal grocery bag weights, the increased load carrying capacity represents an increase in the safety factor. Not only can the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>back</b> <b>injuries</b> be decreased by using plastic bags with handles but the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing a cumulative trauma disorder could also be decreased. peer reviewe...|$|R
