40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two {{new methods to}} analyze the {{statistical}} properties of nonlinear outputs of a point reactor to stochastic non-white reactivity inputs. They are Bourret's approximation and logarithmic linearization. The results have been compared with the exact results, previously obtained {{in the case of}} Gaussian white reactivity input. It was found that when the <b>reactivity</b> <b>noise</b> has short correlation time, Bourret's approximation should be recommended because it yields results superior to those yielded by logarithmic linearization. When the correlation time is long, Bourret's approximation is not valid, but in that case, if one can assume the <b>reactivity</b> <b>noise</b> to be Gaussian, one may use the logarithmic linearization...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This paper investigates whether mindfulness-based {{interventions}} might ameliorate the detrimental {{health effects}} of aircraft noise on residential communities. Review: Numerous empirical studies over the past 50 years have demonstrated the increasing negative impact of aircraft noise on residents worldwide. However, extensive database searches have revealed no published studies on psychological interventions that reduce residents’ <b>reactivity</b> to environmental <b>noise.</b> By contrast, there has been extensive research over several decades confirming the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction training in lowering people’s stress from work and life. Considering that stress is {{a major component of}} aircraft noise reaction, it would seem worth assessing whether mindfulness-based interventions might be effective in reducing the {{health effects of}} aircraft noise. It appears that no existing conceptualization of mindfulness specifically accounts for noise as a stressor. Conceptual Analysis: A new conceptual model is presented here which explains how mindfulness can reduce <b>noise</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Two types of mindfulness are distinguished: an active form (meta-mindfulness) and a passive form (supra-mindfulness). It is posited that meta-mindfulness can facilitate “cognitive defusion” which research has confirmed as enabling people to disconnect from their own dysfunctional thoughts. In the case of aircraft noise, negative thinking associated with residents’ reactive experiences can exacerbate the health effects they suffer. The present model further proposes that supra-mindfulness can enable an individual to disengage their own sense of identity from the often overwhelming negative thoughts which can define their existence when they are consumed by extreme noise annoyance. Conclusion: The mindfulness processes of defusion and disidentification are postulated to be the key efficacy mechanisms potentially responsible for reducing <b>reactivity</b> to aircraft <b>noise.</b> This approach can be evaluated by extending previous research on the health benefits of mindfulness training...|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity to {{unwanted}} sounds {{is common}} in general and clinical populations. Noise sensitivity refers to physiological and psychological internal states of an individual that increase the degree of <b>reactivity</b> to <b>noise</b> in general. The current study investigated {{the relationship between the}} Big Five personality dimensions and noise sensitivity using the 240 -item NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) and 35 -item The Noise-Sensitivity-Questionnaire (NoiSeQ) scales, respectively. Overall, the Big Five accounted for 33 % of the variance in noise sensitivity, with the Introversion-Extroversion dimension explaining the most variability. Furthermore, the Big Five personality dimensions (neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) had an independent effect on noise sensitivity, which were linear. However, additional analyses indicated that the influence of gender and age must be considered when examining the relationship between personality and noise sensitivity. The findings caution against pooling data across genders, not controlling for age, and using personality dimensions in isolation...|$|R
40|$|A boiling {{simulator}} {{was constructed}} {{to model the}} void and pressure effects of local boiling in an LMFBR. By forcing superheated steam into subcooled water the boiling simulator produced aseries of single bubbles separated by waiting times. The bubbles ranged from one to four centimeters in diameter and had lifetimes {{on the order of}} 60 milliseconds, and waiting times of 90 milliseconds. The boiling simulator was placed in the core of a zero power reactor (GfK, ARK), and the neutron and pressure signals were recorded and cross correlated. The neutron-pressure cross correlation exhibited an almost perfect correlation at the bubble repetition frequency (7 Hz). If (as expected) the normal pressure and <b>reactivity</b> background <b>noises</b> in apower reactor are uncorrelated, then this strong correlation will improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a boiling detection scheme. Other advantages of the cross cor-relation technique are that only simple linear transfer functions are necessary to relate the neutronic noise to the pressure noise and that the zone of the reactor (positive or negative void coefficient zone) can easily be determined. Because of these advantages, the neutron-pressure cross correlation technique is considered a serious alternative for the detection of local boiling in sodium cooled reactors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Noise {{sensitivity}} (NS) {{is a key}} construct in {{the fields}} of hygiene, planning and occupational medicine. It refers to a personality trait representing the <b>reactivity</b> to <b>noise</b> and is associated with various psycho-physiological health outcomes. AIM: This study aimed to develop a shorter version of the original Noise Sensitivity Questionnaire (NoiSeQ), retaining its dimensions and assess its validity and reliability. METHODS: A test-retest study was carried out in a convenience sample of 56 participants. A short 15 -item form of the original NoiSeQ (NoiSeQSF) questionnaire was developed and then administered. All major analyses were based on the coeffi cient of equivalence and stability, the generalizability theory and linear regression. RESULTS: Relative (ρ = 0. 83) and absolute (ρ = 0. 80) G coefficients for global NS exceeded the lower reliability limit according to G- and D-studies. Sleep subscale can readily be used to assess sleep-related NS (ρ = 0. 76 /θ = 0. 75). Moreover, NoiSeQSF predicted some cardiac symptoms (with age of participants as a moderator factor), which demonstrated nomological validity. CONCLUSION: NoiSeQSF is a reliable estimate for global NS and NS related to sleep quality. It might prove useful to experts in environmental hygiene, urban planning and occupational diseases when dealing with noise-impaired occupational, social or psycho-physiological functioning...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} {{we are going}} to address the issues of speech {{synthesis}} in changing noise conditions. We will investigate the potential improvements that can be introduced by using a speech synthesiser in these conditions that is able to modulate between a normal speech style and a speech style produced under noise. When we were faced with the selection of a research topic for this dissertation, the main initial idea was to find an interesting application related to reactive speech synthesis after being presented with a couple of reactive prototypes developed at the Centre for Speech Technology Research here in Edinburgh. The choice of <b>reactivity</b> to <b>noise</b> was motivated by the fertile bibliography on speech in noise and the latest technological improvements on parametric speech synthesis and intelligibility in noise. This report will contain a review of the related academic literature on this topic to contextualise our investigation and give a better understanding of our goals and the different methods that were used. Then we will present the main research goals of this investigation and two experiments that we devised to accomplish them: i) a production experiment of speech in changing noise conditions that focuses on the acoustic transformations that are generated to achieve the modulated speech styles, and ii) a listening evaluation with participants that compares the performance of an oracle speech synthesis system reactive to noise with two non-reactive systems. Finally, we will make a proposal for further work to implement a reactive system to noise, and some necessary precautions and potential features that could be interesting to include...|$|R
40|$|The term "noise sensitivity" is {{frequently}} {{used in many}} areas of noise research. However, {{it can be used to}} describe several different effects and it can be measured in different ways. In noise surveys, noise sensitivity refers to the fact that individuals differ in the annoyance produced by different sources of noise. Noise sensitivity can be viewed as an independent variable, which may be directly related to outcomes such as health status, or it can be conceptualized as a factor that modifies or mediates the effects of noise exposure on the outcome measure. Noise sensitivity is highly correlated with the general trait negative affectivity, a measure of the extent to which individuals perceive or report negative features of their environment or self. Indeed, few studies have demonstrated effects of noise sensitivity that are independent of negative affectivity. This implies that it is most appropriate to examine general indicators of reported sensitivity rather than a noise-specific measure. Noise sensitivity can also be considered in terms of physiological <b>reactivity</b> to <b>noise</b> sources. Such effects are often only weakly associated with self-reports of noise sensitivity. Habituation to noise is also an important topic to consider and again this appears to be largely independent of self-reported noise sensitivity. Overall, it would appear that it is important to distinguish between subjective reports of noise sensitivity and objective indicators. Different factors will modify these two aspects of noise sensitivity and this implies that different strategies are needed to influence them. Such effects must be taken into consideration when one considers whether control should be targeted at the community in general, or whether it should also cover the most sensitive individuals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the moderator temperature coefficient of <b>reactivity</b> (MTC) by <b>noise</b> analysis. The current noise analysis-based MTC measurement, relying on the cross correlation between the neutron noise measured by a single in-core neutron detector and the local temperature noise given by a single core-exit thermocouple located {{at the top of}} the same fuel assembly, or of a neighboring fuel assembly, is not accurate. The MTC is systematically underestimated by a factor of 2 to 5 compared to its design-predicted value. A theoretical study shows that, in case of nonhomogeneous moderator temperature noise, the core-averaged moderator temperature noise should be used for the MTC estimation. The new estimation method can reach up to 3 % accuracy as compared with the results of core calculations for the Swedish Ringhals- 2 pressurized water reactor (PWR). We show via noise measurements performed at the Ringhals- 2 PWR that the moderator temperature noise is actually radially strongly heterogeneous and loosely coupled. The new MTC noise estimator is demonstrated to provide an accurate MTC evaluation, with the core-averaged moderator temperature noise estimated via the use of many radial in-core gamma-thermometers. More important, different forms of weighting functions are suggested to calculate the core-averaged moderator temperature noise. This new MTC noise estimator, which is nonintrusive and free of calibration, can therefore be applied to monitor the MTC throughout the cycle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the Moderator Temperature Coefficient of <b>reactivity</b> (MTC) by <b>noise</b> analysis. Previous experimental investigations showed that the MTC was systematically underestimated {{by a factor of}} two to five compared to its design-predicted value. In these measurements, the MTC was always determined by cross-correlating the neutron noise provided by a single in-core neutron detector with the local temperature noise given by a single core-exit thermocouple located {{at the top of the}} same fuel assembly, or of a neighbouring fuel assembly. It is shown in this paper via a noise measurement performed at the Swedish Ringhals- 2 Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) that the moderator temperature noise is radially strongly heterogeneous. Such a non-homogeneous temperature noise is proven theoretically to explain why the MTC was always underestimated in the previous experimental work when only the local temperature was used. A new MTC noise estimator, relying on the core-averaged moderator temperature noise, is thus proposed. This new estimator is demonstrated to provide an accurate MTC evaluation, as long as the radial structure of the moderator temperature noise can be measured. In the case of Ringhals- 2, such in-core temperature measurements are carried out by Gamma-Thermometers (GTs), which in the frequency range of interest for the MTC investigation by noise analysis are working as ordinary thermocouples. This method, which is non-intrusive and free of calibration, can therefore be applied to monitor the MTC throughout the cycle...|$|R
40|$|Murgese horses can be {{used for}} many purposes: dressage, {{therapeutic}} and educational aids, equine tourism, mounted police, etc [...] This study aims to assess the hereditability of morphological and temperamental traits to be included in future genetic selection programmes. A database concerning 711 males and females Murgese subjects, born from 1927 to 2013, and their morphological traits (height at withers, chest girth, and cannon bone circumference) assessed at 3 years of age was used. In addition, for 103 out of 711 animals, a questionnaire on temperament with 15 items was submitted to 11 caretakers and owners. The respondents rated each item on a 9 -point scale labeled at the left end with “attribute absent” (score= 1), at the right end with “attribute very strong” (score= 9). Data were analysed using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood methodology applied to a multiple-traits animal model. A VCE software was used. The fixed effects were: sex, year of birth and caretaker; the inbreeding coefficient was estimated with SAS proc inbreed and used as covariate (SAS, 2007); random effects were the animal and the residual error. The mean inbreeding coefficient of our sample (animals born from 2010 to 2013) was 6. 3 ± 2. 42 % and 7. 51 ± 1. 13 % for males and females, respectively. Hereditability ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 38, and was highest for concentration (0. 35), trainability (0. 36) and consistent emotionality (0. 38). Morphological traits were not significantly correlated with temperamental traits. However, significant and positive correlations were found between chest girth vs cannon bone circumference (0. 60; P< 0. 001), and between height at withers vs chest girth and cannon bone circumference (0. 54 and 0. 48, respectively; P< 0. 001). Genetic correlations between temperamental traits were all positive although they were moderate (with value under 0. 42). In particular, friendliness towards people, low <b>reactivity</b> to <b>noise,</b> responsiveness to commands, ease of gate entrance were positively correlated with learning ability (0. 27, 0. 25, 0. 35, 0. 30, respectively). Concentration was positively correlated with responsiveness to commands (0. 36), friendliness towards people (0. 28), trainability (0. 29), learning ability (0. 42) and consistent emotionality (0. 40). The high heritability values observed in this study suggest that temperamental traits could be used as selection targets to specialize the animals according to different breeding purposes...|$|R
40|$|In alpine regions, {{cows are}} often {{equipped}} with bells during pasture season {{to ensure that}} farmers can locate them. Constant exposure to the chime of a bell may affect cows’ acoustic perception in general. The {{aim of this study}} is to test whether routine bell exposure affects the <b>reactivity</b> to a <b>noise</b> stimulus and might be associated with hearing impairment in cows. For the assessment, behavioral and cardiac indicators were used as indirect measures of hearing capacity. Cows that were either used to wearing a bell or not were exposed to a playback of low and high amplitude (=varying loudness). In addition, we tested whether wearing earplugs, mimicking hearing impairment, reduced the cows’ reactivity toward the playback. On 24 farms, half of them routinely using cowbells, 96 Brown Swiss cows were tested in a 2 [*]×[*] 2 factorial cross-over design (65 or 85 [*]dB, without or with earplugs) in a balanced order. The effects of bell experience, amplitude, and earplugs on the latency to the first behavioral and cardiac response to a 5 -s playback were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, considering dependencies within the data set. Cows reacted faster without earplugs and when they were exposed to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. The proportion of cows leaving the feeding rack after onset of the playback was reduced by bell experience and earplugs and was increased when exposed to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. Exposure without earplugs to 85 [*]dB but not to 65 [*]dB increased heart rate. Heart rate and heart rate variability indicated increased sympathetic activation during the exposure to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. In general, behavioral and cardiac indicators did not indicate severe hearing impairment due to routine bell exposure. The 85 -dB stimulus increased arousal and avoidance compared with the 65 -dB stimulus, with bell experience and earplugs leading to a general decrease in avoidance of the stimulus. This may reflect an altered acoustic perception of the playback stimulus in dairy cows that are routinely exposed to bells...|$|R
40|$|Standardised {{behaviour}} {{tests have}} the potential to improve equine welfare by enabling the selection of horses suitable for a particular role. A range of tests are found in scientific literature which make such claims. However, with notable exceptions, authors have failed to establish the reliability of their tests or the validity of their claims. This study aimed to determine a set of reliable behaviour tests based on those reported in literature; and to test the validity of these as predictors of horses’ suitability as police horses. Reliability of response to a novel object, social isolation and handling tests was established by tests repeated at three week intervals on 33 horses. Behavioural responses were recorded post hoc to enable the full range of responses to be measured. There was some evidence that the horses habituated to static stimuli used in the tests, and the majority of the tests were at best moderately reliable, with only reactivity tests showing good or better reliability. Tests with moderately reliable results or results which could be explained by habituation, were included in the validity testing. This compared the horses’ responses to the behavioural tests with handlers’ ratings of key aspects of police horse performance. These subjective scales of suitability of police horses were developed from interviews with instructors and yard managers. The items were combined to develop a set of specific indices of police horse roles. Spearman’s rank order correlations were used to explore whether any relationships existed between the horses’ behavioural responses to the tests and subjective ratings of their suitability for their use. The results revealed eight moderate associations which were on the whole between horses’ responses to the <b>reactivity</b> tests (unexpected <b>noise</b> and sudden moving object) and the suitability scores. These findings suggest that standardised behavioural tests are not strongly reliable. The validity analysis indicated that either the tests used in this study did not serve as predictors of suitability for use, or that behavioural responses to standardised tests cannot be generalised to the wider challenges faced by these horses in their roles. However the reactivity tests did reveal stronger reliability and they were the only measures to show any association with the suitability scores, suggesting that reactivity tests may have some validity in measuring a horse’s suitability. Overall, {{the findings of this study}} cannot support claims made for these (or similar) tests to be valid predictors of a horse’s suitability for use...|$|R
