Two types of annealing have been performed: a conventional heat treatment at 550 degrees C for 1. 5 h {{is used for}} comparison with <b>rapid</b> <b>annealing</b> for maximum 3 min at 700, 750 or 800 degrees C. It is found that these <b>rapid</b> <b>annealing</b> are much more efficient to promote the recrystallisation of the hard phase with a limited grain growth of the soft magnetic phase thus leading to better magnetic properties. Indeed, the best coercive field of 0. 55 T was obtained for samples annealed at 700, 750 and 800 degrees C for 2. 5, 1. 5 and 1 min respectively. This behaviour is explained by both, a good recovery of crystallinity for the hard phase and relatively small size Fe nanocrystallites. The different heat treatments do not result in significant changes for remanent magnetization, which is between 93 and 107 A m(2) /kg.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a classic process-structure-properties approach for optimizing the magnetic properties of electrical steels. Cold-rolled non-oriented electrical steel (Fe; 0. 001 wt % C; 0. 2 wt. % Mn; 1. 3 wt % Si) {{was subjected to}} extremely short 3 - 30 seconds annealing cycles in a range from 880 °C to 980 °C with a heating rate varying from 15 °C to 300 °C/sec. The resulting microstructure was studied by means of optical microscopy and X-ray orientation distribution function analysis. Recrystallized grains were refined with increased heating rate, caused by the nucleation rate increase, which is faster than the growth rate due to rapid heating. The optimal grain size of 60 to 80 mm in terms of magnetic properties was obtained by increasing the annealing temperature range to 920 °C to 940 °C with a higher heating rate of 300 °C/sec and an annealing time of 6 to 9 seconds.
