In general, testing involves sending samples of blood, stool, and urine to a <b>reference</b> <b>laboratory.</b> All samples to detect porphyrins must be handled properly. Samples should be taken during an acute attack; otherwise a false negative result may occur. Samples must be protected from light and either refrigerated or preserved.|$|E

40|$|Clin Microbiol InfectAbstract The {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{diagnostic}} performance of different European <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> in diagnosing helminths and intestinal protozoa, using an ether-concentration method applied to sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF) -preserved faecal samples. In total, 102 stool specimens were analysed during a cross-sectional parasitological survey in urban farming communities in Cote d'Ivoire. Five SAF-preserved faecal samples were prepared from each specimen and forwarded to the participating <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories,</b> processed and examined under a microscope adhering to a standard operating procedure (SOP). Schistosoma mansoni (cumulative prevalence: 51. 0 %) and hookworm (cumulative prevalence: 39. 2 %) were the predominant helminths. There was excellent agreement (kappa 0. 001) among the <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> for the diagnosis of S. mansoni, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides. Moderate agreement (kappa = 0. 54) was found for Hymenolepis nana, and lesser agreement was observed for other, less prevalent helminths. The predominant intestinal protozoa were Entamoeba coli (median prevalence: 67. 6 %), Blastocystis hominis (median prevalence: 55. 9 %) and Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (median prevalence: 47. 1 %). Substantial agreement among <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> was found for E. coli (kappa = 0. 69), but only fair or moderate agreement was found for other Entamoeba species, Giardia intestinalis and Chilomastix mesnili. There was only poor agreement for B. hominis, Isospora belli and Trichomonas intestinalis. In conclusion, although common helminths were reliably diagnosed by European <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories,</b> there was only moderate agreement between centres for pathogenic intestinal protozoa. Continued external quality assessment {{and the establishment of}} a formal network of <b>reference</b> <b>laboratories</b> is necessary to further enhance both accuracy and uniformity in parasite diagnosi...|$|R
