Non-preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are used for all other purposes, including enforcement of product- and country-specific trade restrictions that increase the cost of, or restrict or prevent, market entry. Preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> differ from non-preferential ones because they are designed to minimize trade deflection. With rapid increase of bilateral and regional trade agreements, the role <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> has become more evident. In the context of bilateral and regional trade agreements, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> prevent free-riders from enjoying the benefits negotiated between the countries concerned. In other words, once the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> a product is known, a country can extend the benefit of its free trade agreement to its trading partners thus excluding non-partners.

In any customs union or free trade agreement, one of the critical issues concerns "rules of origin.

The criterion for duty-free treatment is important in determining the economic effects of the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> It is shown that rules of origin in fact extend the protection accorded by each country to producers in other free trade agreement member countries.

40|$|This study surveys {{preferential}} <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{applied by}} 192 regional trade agreements (RTAs) covering {{trade in goods}} notified to the GATT/WTO up to 1 November 2010. It {{takes into account the}} preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> that were notified to the WTO; whenever known and available, modifications to the original <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> have been updated. This study contains two basic features: a description of some key elements <b>of</b> preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in RTAs, followed by an attempt to provide a reality-check <b>of</b> how these <b>rules</b> affect actual trade. That is done by an ex-post examination of data on the use of RTAs' preferences and, in their absence, of their margins of preference (MOPs). While the raison d' <b>of</b> preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is the avoidance of trade deflection, the practice in RTAs has diluted this objective and it would seem that preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are increasingly becoming an economic, political and trade instrument. In its descriptive part, the study identifies {{what seems to be a}} tendency to design stricter <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> while detecting concomitantly the inclusion in modern preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> flexibilities that provide, through the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> themselves, a preference beyond the lower tariff rate resulting from the preferential treatment and mechanisms that allow the integration of third-parties into preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> regimes. The reality-check part of the study points to the fact that much beyond the coverage of RTAs, it is their effective implementation that poses a challenge to economic operators. Though data on the use of preferences is either not disclosed or inexistent, they are nevertheless available for some economies. On the basis of existing data of preference utilization, the analysis of the effects <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on preferential trade flows appears to give rise to a dual reality - namely a relatively high use of preferences in certain instances coexisting with preferences failing to attain their potential in other cases. As regards RTAs for which utilization rate is not available, the paper analysis preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> from a MOPS perspective, assuming that MOPs of at least 5 percentage points would offset compliance costs and thus provide a stimulus to comply with <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in order to benefit from preferences. The analysis, made for 68 out of 192 RTAs, do not allow any conclusion regarding that generally presented hypothesis.

40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} an emerging economy and has various trade {{agreements with the}} United States of America and the United Kingdom according to which South Africa enjoys different preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> In some respects, current customs and excise legislation relating to <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> places South Africa at a disadvantage in the global arena.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis {{addresses}} the effect of rules of origin regulations on the use of domestic factors of production in the country of origin. In the case of a firm that is a perfect competitor in the final product market these regulations have two effects: first there is a direct substitution effect due to the regulation that will increase the use of the domestic factor and second, there is an indirect output effect due to the increased cost that will reduce the demand for the domestic factor. In the case of a firm that has a monopoly power in the final product market, the declining marginal revenue curve faced by the firm causes the reallocation of output between domestic and foreign plants. This reallocation may further decrease the demand for the domestic factor of production. The second part of the thesis addresses the problem of a government trying to maximize welfare through use of rules of origin regulations when there is conflict among various domestic interests.

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{services}} is increasingly relevant {{against the backdrop}} of technological innovation and global value chains. Rules of origin for trade in services are especially important in Economic Integration Agreements, which are proliferating in response to the changes in global trade and production. The Southern African Development Community commenced the Protocol on Trade in Services negotiations in April 2012 with the objective of creating an integrated regional market for services. This study examines the current and dominant approaches to the formulation of rules of origin for trade in services in twenty five (25) Economic Integration Agreements with the purpose of making recommendations, to develop further, the definition of "substantial business operations" for the SADC Protocol on Trade in Services. It concludes, first, that the type best suited for SADC is a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> designed to address broader socio-economic goals in the region.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (ROO) {{requirements}} accompanied by free trade agreements (FTAs), which specify the minimum portion of supplies that should satisfy the origin requirement, on a multinational firm’s production decisions. We consider a multinational firm who exports its product to multiple countries and analyze its production decision in the presence of multiple free trading agreements (FTAs). The ROO requirements in FTAs not only refer to the origin of supplies but are also involved with an environmental regulation of a country of the supplies. As such, meeting multiple ROO requirements can be costly since it may be involved with an adjustment of production facility and suppliers according to different environmental standards. We investigate a multinational firm’s choice of the ROO level in its production decision under multiple FTAs. It is well known that, in the presence of overlapping FTAs, the firm may strategically choose not to comply with the minimum ROO requirements in the FTAs. Instead, the firm may choose to comply with an ROO level that is higher than required, or pay the tariff instead without enjoying tariff exemption by the FTA in the new country. Such unintended outcomes in the FTAs are called the Spaghetti Bowl Effect. We characterize and quantify two types of such Spaghetti Bowl Effects with the optimal production decisions of a multinational firm under multiple ROO requirements and derive policy implications...|$|E

The thesis aims therefore at analysing diversification and harmonisation patterns and their interaction with the systemic problems identified. The final objective of the thesis is to analyse the possible methods for regulating <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in light <b>of</b> these systemic issues. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand rationales for and systemic problems derived from preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The methodology, adopted to understand patterns of diversification and harmonisation, combines instead comparative analysis and case study approach with the {{analysis of}} WCO and WTO law. While it is impossible to find a solution that could solve all the systemic problems (beside the complete abolition <b>of</b> the <b>rules),</b> this thesis argues that the first objective of the WTO should be to achieve a greater level <b>of</b> correspondence between <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and MFN concessions and address fairness concerns.

The analysis of the relationship between preferential Moroccan exports to the United States of America, on one hand, and the presence of tariff preferences and the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin,</b> on the other hand, suggest that if the tariff preferences have indeed the effect of encouraging exports, the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> have the reverse effect...|$|R
30|$|Export {{growth of}} {{textiles}} and apparel in Malaysia {{and particularly in}} Vietnam is significantly high. Since the Vietnamese Government introduced the policies of innovation, international economic integration and deployed the strategy of industrialization and modernization of the country, there have been outstanding developments in the textile industry, which has developed as  a key economic sector (Viet 2015). However, the export growth of these two economies in textiles could have been larger if the USA {{continued to be a}} member of the TPP, since it is a major export destination for Malaysian and Vietnamese textiles. Vietnam is the second largest apparel supplier in the US market, accounted for almost 13 % of total US import of textiles and apparel. In the absence of the USA in TPP, Vietnam and Malaysia could boost their export of textiles and apparel and also that of Leather products with greater market access in Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico and Chile, as these two TPP-ASEAN countries are already the important suppliers of these products to those countries. The yarn-forward <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> under the TPP agreement, which requires TPP countries to use yarn produced from a TPP country only in textiles to qualify for duty-free access, could increase the export competitiveness of textile industries of Malaysia and Vietnam. These countries could take the advantage of high demand for yarn in the TPP countries by investing and expanding their operations in upstream production, which have higher value-added than the downstream garment production (Final Report, PWC 2015).|$|E
40|$|Regional trading {{agreements}} are treaties entered into by states. States enter into regional trading agreements {{for different reasons}} {{some of which are}} economic, political and security reasons. Regional trading agreements (herein after RTAs) have been successful in achieving trade liberalization at a much faster speed than the World Trade Organization (herein after WTO). The most notable example of RTAs is the European Communities that has been successful to liberalize both trade in goods and services. Members of those Regional Trading Agreements create rules of origin. Rules of origin are important in allocating the appropriate duty for imported goods. They tell the customs officer where those goods come from. If they come from a country which has a trading agreement with the importing state then the product will receive preferential treatment. The problem at the moment is that there are over four hundred Regional Trading Agreements in the world today. This proliferation of Regional Trading Agreements resulted into a lot of crisscrossing and very complicated <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the different possible solutions for the proliferation of Regional Trading Agreements and to propose the most realistic solution to the problem. To perform this task the paper will be divided into three parts. The paper relied both on direct and indirect research methodologies to answer the questions posed by the research paper. The first part deals with the legal and historical background of RTAs. It answers question of why states enter into RTAs and what is the legal basis for the formation of RTAs. The second part deals with proliferation of RTAs. It answers question like are RTAs stumbling blocks or building blocks to the multilateral trading system. It also describes the causes of proliferation of RTAs and the possible solutions. The third part deals with the conclusions and recommendations. It tells the reader the overall conclusion of the paper and the best solution proposed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are {{legitimate}} policy instruments to prevent trade deflection in a {{preferential trade agreement}} short of a customs union. Trade deflection takes place when a product imported into the preferential trade agreement through the member with the lowest external tariff is transhipped to a higher-tariff member, while yielding {{a benefit for the}} re-exporter. Yet, when captured by special interest groups, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> can restrict trade beyond what is needed to prevent trade deflection. By how much do political economy factors account for the stringency <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin?</b> This study quantifies the impact of both determinants - those considered"justifiable"because they prevent trade deflection and those deemed to arise from"political economy"forces - on the restrictiveness <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> under the North American Free Trade Agreement, approximated by a restrictiveness index. The main finding is that political economy forces, especially from the United States, raised significantly the restrictiveness <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Indeed, in industries where political-economy forces were strong prior to the North American Free Trade Agreement, as when the U. S. Most Favored Nation tariff was high or the revealed comparative advantage of Mexico (the United States) was strong (weak), more stringent <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> were introduced. Thus, stricter <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are associated with higher production costs reducing the potential benefits of enhanced market access that is initially pursued by this type of agreement.

40|$|Customs valuation, {{commodity}} classification system, and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{are the three}} basic customs laws. Rules to determine a country <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> or "nationality" <b>of</b> a country of production of goods, are called "rules <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> " They are widely used in international trade {{in the application of}} different tariffs, trade remedy measures, tariff quotas, and trade statistics. With the globalization of economic activities resulting in outsourcing of materials as well as the global proliferation of free trade agreements, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> have become one of the major trade issues among both public and private sectors. <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> often result in the so-called "spaghetti-bowl" effect. Since there is no agreement on product-specific harmonized <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> international trade - both preferential and nonpreferential - is governed by different national laws.

Two interesting outcomes are derived. First, an FTA that lowered joint welfare of the union and was voted down in the absence <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> may become feasible in the presence <b>of</b> these <b>rules.</b> Second, an FTA that increased joint welfare of the union but was voted down in the absence <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> may become acceptable in the presence <b>of</b> these <b>rules</b> {{but it may also}} turn welfare inferior to status quo. ...|$|R
