50|$|One {{of the key}} {{engineers}} {{in the development of}} the Quadruplex video recorder for Ampex was Ray Dolby, who worked under Charlie Ginsburg and went on to form Dolby Laboratories, a pioneer in audio noise reduction systems. Dolby's contribution to the Videotape system was limited to the mathematics behind the <b>reactance</b> <b>tube</b> FM modulator, as Videotape then used FM modulation for the video portion. Another contributor designed the FM modulator itself. Dolby left Ampex to seek a PhD in physics in England, which is where Dolby Labs was later founded, before Dolby moved back to San Francisco. Dolby's brother Dale was also an engineer at Ampex.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedPresent {{trends indicate that}} the microwave frequency range will be used extensively for communiaiton systems. Few such systems except those of the radio relay type are employed today, but as crowding continues in the UHF region, {{and the desire for}} greater security increases, it is believed that much of the traffic for nearby locations will be shifted to "point to point" systems in the microwave range. Further, it is believed that the frequency modulation technique allows utilization of most of the advantages found in this range withour introducing undue complexity to the system. The one operation for a communication system at microwave frequencies that is different from those encountered either in low frequency communications systems or in radar systems is the frequency modulated signal generation. Because of this difference, consideration of such signal generationi is of interest. Therefore, this paper presents descripitions and analyses of the more promising devices and methods for producing frequency modulated signals at microwave frequencies. By comparing the results shown herein, the device or method most suitable for a given system may be selected. Where applicable, specific information may be substituted into the equation given for freqency, modulation sensitivity, and distrotion to obtain an estimate of these factors for a partcular situation. One exception to the above statement must be made. The <b>reactance</b> <b>tube</b> method is not considered a practical or promising system at the present stage of development. Its inclusion is for comparison purposes with the other systems in order to form a bridge between the frequency modulation metrhods employed at low frequencies and those encountered at microwaves. For eaxmple, by such comparision, it may be seen that the microwave devices tend to introduce {{only a small percentage of}} the distortion that is inherent in the <b>reactance</b> <b>tube</b> modulator.
