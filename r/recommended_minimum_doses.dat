40|$|Web-based {{parenting}} interventions {{have the}} potential to increase the currently low reach of parenting programs, but few evidence-based online programs are available, and little is known about who benefits from this delivery format. This study investigated if improvements in child behavior and parenting, following participation in a brief online parenting program (Triple P Online Brief), can be predicted by family and program-related factors. Participants were 100 parents of 2 - 9 -year-old children displaying disruptive behavior problems. Regression analyses showed that higher baseline levels of child behavior problems, older parental age and more intense conflict over parenting pre-intervention predicted greater improvement in child behavior at 9 -month follow-up. Improvement in parenting was predicted by higher pre-intervention levels of ineffective parenting. Family demographics, parental adjustment and program related factors did not predict treatment outcomes.

40|$|Natugrain® TS is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} that contains endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase, produced by two genetically modified strains of Aspergillus niger. This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} piglets (weaned), poultry species and ornamental birds as a zootechnical additive under the functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant is now seeking for the extension of its use as a zootechnical additive for pigs for fattening at a dose range of 560 to 840  TXU (thermostable xylanase units) and 250 to 375  TGU (thermostable glucanase units) per kg feed. Since the product has been demonstrated to be  safe in piglets at the maximum recommended dose, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) considers that this conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening, provided that the same maximum dose applies. In two long-term trials, Natugrain® TS significantly improved {{the performance of the}} pigs for fattening at the <b>minimum</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>dose</b> (560  TXU and 250  TGU/kg feed).

This {{study investigated the}} effectiveness of ICMT on cognitive functions associated with falls in older adults. Methods A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in community-dwelling older adults (N = 90, mean age 81. 5 ± 7) without major cognitive impairment. Participants in the intervention group (IG) played four stepping games that required them to divide attention, inhibit irrelevant stimuli, switch between tasks, rotate objects and make rapid decisions. The <b>recommended</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> was three 20 -minute sessions per week {{over a period of}} 16 weeks unsupervised at home. Participants in the control group (CG) received an evidence-based brochure on fall prevention. Measures of processing speed, attention/executive function (EF), visuo-spatial ability, concerns about falling and depression were assessed before and after the intervention. Results Eighty-one participants (90 %) attended re-assessment. There were no improvements with respect to the Stroop Stepping Test (primary outcome) in the intervention group. Compared to the CG, the IG improved significantly in measures of processing speed, visuo-spatial ability and concern about falling. Significant interactions were observed for measures of EF and divided attention, indicating group differences varied for different levels of the covariate with larger improvements in IG participants with poorer baseline performance. The interaction or depression showed no change for the IG but an increase in the CG for those with low depressive symptoms at baseline. Additionally, low and high-adherer groups differed in their baseline performance and responded differently to the intervention. Compared to high adherers, low adherers improved more in processing speed and visual scanning while highadherers improved more in tasks related to EF. Conclusions This study shows that unsupervised stepping ICMT led to improvements in specific cognitive functions associated with falls in older people.

A field study was undertaken to validate pre-clinical results. Methods Dogs were enrolled at 10 veterinary clinics across the United States. Qualifying households containing up to three dogs and one primary dog with at least 10 fleas were randomized 2 : 1 to receive lotilaner (Credelio™, Elanco) at the <b>recommended</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> of 20  mg/kg, or afoxolaner (Nexgard®, Merial), administered per label, to give a <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> of 2. 5  mg/kg. Treatments were dispensed on Days 0, 30 and 60 for administration by owners; all household dogs received the same treatment as the primary dog. Post-enrollment flea and tick counts were made on primary dogs on Days 30, 60 and 90, and all dogs were assessed for tablet palatability and safety. Results For efficacy assessments, data were used from 111 lotilaner-treated dogs and 50 afoxolaner-treated dogs; for safety, 197 and 86 dogs, respectively. Percent reductions from baseline in geometric mean flea counts for the lotilaner group were 99. 3, 99. 9 and 100 % on Days 30, 60 and 90, respectively, and for afoxolaner 98. 3, 99. 8 and 99. 8 % (P[*]<[*] 0. 001, both groups, all days). On Day 90, 100 % of lotilaner-treated dogs and 93 % of afoxolaner-treated dogs were flea-free. Too few ticks were present to allow assessment. There were no differences in palatability between products (P[*]=[*] 0. 2132), with, respectively, 94 % and 96 % of lotilaner and afoxolaner treatments accepted when offered by hand, in an empty food bowl or with food. Both treatments were well tolerated, alleviating clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) in dogs affected at enrollment. Conclusion A single owner-administered lotilaner treatment was greater than 99 % effective in reducing mean flea counts within 30  days. Three consecutive monthly lotilaner treatments resulted in a 100 % reduction in flea infestations, and a substantial reduction in signs of FAD. Lotilaner flavored tablets were readily accepted under field conditions. The absence of treatment-related adverse events confirms the safety of lotilaner in dogs...|$|R

40|$|Background:   Whether calcium supplementation {{can reduce}} {{osteoporotic}} fractures is uncertain. We did a meta-analysis {{to include all}} the randomised trials in which calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D, was used to prevent fracture and osteoporotic bone loss. Methods:   We identified 29 randomised trials (n= 63 897) using electronic databases, supplemented by a hand-search of reference lists, review articles, and conference abstracts. All randomised trials that recruited people aged 50 years or older were eligible. The main outcomes were fractures of all types and percentage change of bone-mineral density from baseline. Data were pooled by use of a random-effect model. Findings:   In trials that reported fracture as an outcome (17 trials, n= 52 625), treatment {{was associated with a}} 12 % risk reduction in fractures of all types (risk ratio 0 · 88, 95 % CI 0 · 83 – 0 · 95; p= 0 · 0004). In trials that reported bone-mineral density as an outcome (23 trials, n= 41 419), the treatment was associated with a reduced rate of bone loss of 0 · 54 % (0 · 35 – 0 · 73; p< 0 · 0001) at the hip and 1 · 19 % (0 · 76 – 1 · 61 %; p< 0 · 0001) in the spine. The fracture risk reduction was significantly greater (24 %) in trials in which the compliance rate was high (p< 0 · 0001). The treatment effect was better with calcium doses of 1200 mg or more than with doses less than 1200 mg (0 · 80 vs 0 · 94; p= 0 · 006), and with vitamin D doses of 800 IU or more than with doses less than 800 IU (0 · 84 vs 0 · 87; p= 0 · 03).

Gov'tBACKGROUND: Scale-up {{of malaria}} {{interventions}} {{seems to have}} contributed {{to a decline in}} the disease but other factors may also have had some role. Understanding changes in transmission and determinant factors will help to adapt control strategies accordingly. METHODS: Four sites in Ethiopia and Uganda were set up to monitor epidemiological changes and effectiveness of interventions over time. Here, results of a survey during the peak transmission season of 2012 are reported, which will be used as baseline for subsequent surveys and may support adaptation of control strategies. Data on malariometric and entomological variables, socio-economic status (SES) and control coverage were collected. RESULTS: Malaria prevalence varied from 1. 4  % in Guba (Ethiopia) to 9. 9  % in Butemba (Uganda). The most dominant species was Plasmodium vivax in Ethiopia and Plasmodium falciparum in Uganda. The majority of human-vector contact occurred indoors in Uganda, ranging from 83  % (Anopheles funestus sensu lato) to 93  % (Anopheles gambiae s. l.), which is an important factor for the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS). High kdr-L 1014 S (resistance genotype) frequency was observed in A. gambiae sensu stricto in Uganda. Too few mosquitoes were collected in Ethiopia, so {{it was not possible to}} assess vector habits and insecticide resistance levels. ITN ownership did not vary by SES and 56 - 98  % and 68 - 78  % of households owned at least one ITN in Ethiopia and Uganda, respectively. In Uganda, 7  % of nets were purchased by households, but the nets were untreated. In three of the four sites, 69 - 76  % of people with access to ITNs used them. IRS coverage ranged from 84 to 96  % in the three sprayed sites. Half of febrile children in Uganda and three-quarters in Ethiopia for whom treatment was sought received diagnostic tests. High levels of child undernutrition were detected in both countries carrying important implications on child development. In Uganda, 7 - 8  % of pregnant women took the <b>recommended</b> <b>minimum</b> three <b>doses</b> of intermittent preventive treatment. CONCLUSION: Malaria epidemiology seems to be changing compared to earlier published data, and it is essential to have more data to understand how much of the changes are attributable to interventions and other factors. Regular monitoring will help to better interpret changes, identify determinants, modify strategies and improve targeting to address transmission heterogeneity. UK aid (PPA...|$|R

Methods Stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients who were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy between 2005 and 2009 at our hospital were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was local control rate. Survival estimates were calculated from the completion date of radiotherapy using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic factors including patients’ characteristics and dose-volume histogram parameters were evaluated using Cox’s proportional hazard regression model. Results Eighty patients (81 lesions) treated with 3 dose levels, 48 Gy/ 4 fractions, 60 Gy/ 8 fractions and 60 Gy/ 15 fractions, were enrolled in this study. Median follow-up was 30. 4 months (range, 0. 3 – 78. 5 months). A Cox regression model showed T factor (p = 0. 013), biological effective dose calculated from prescribed dose (BED 10) (p = 0. 048), and <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> for PTV (p = 0. 013) to be prognostic factors for local control. Three-year overall survival rate and local control rate were 89. 9 % (T 1 : 86. 8 %, T 2 : 100 %) and 89. 0 % (T 1 : 97. 9 %; T 2 : 64. 8 %), respectively. When the 3 -year local control rates were examined by prescribed doses, they were 100 % for the dose per fraction of 48 Gy / 4 fractions (105. 6 Gy BED 10), 82. 1 % for 60 Gy/ 8 fractions (105 Gy BED 10), and 57. 1 % for 60 Gy/ 15 fractions (84 Gy BED 10). The median value of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> for PTV (%) was 89. 88 (%), and the 3 -year local control rates were 100 % in those with the <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> for PTV (%) ≥ 89. 88 % and 79. 2 % in those with the <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> for PTV (%) Conclusions Our results suggest that T factor, BED 10, and <b>minimum</b> <b>dose</b> for PTV influence the local control rate.

40|$|AbstractA randomized, blinded, {{negative}} controlled {{study was}} conducted to determine whether treatment with afoxolaner (NexGard®, Merial, Inc.) would prevent the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi to dogs by wild caught Ixodes scapularis ticks. Twenty healthy dogs were randomly assigned to two groups of ten dogs each. Ten dogs were treated orally on Day 0 at a <b>dose</b> near the <b>minimum</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>dose</b> of afoxolaner of 2. 5 mg/kg (actual doses 2. 5 – 3. 1 mg/kg) and ten control dogs were not treated. On Day 28, each dog was infested with approximately 50 adult unfed wild caught I. scapularis that had a 67 % B. burgdorferi infection rate (determined by polymerase chain reaction). On Day 33, live ticks were counted and removed. No ticks were found on treated dogs while control dogs had an average of 21. 4 ticks. To detect infection, the B. burgdorferi-specific C 6 antibody SNAP® 4 Dx® test (IDEXX) was performed on serum collected before infestation (all dogs seronegative on Days - 6 and 27) and on Days 48, 63, 77 and 92. The ten treated dogs remained seronegative {{through the end of the}} study (Day 92), while nine out of the ten control dogs were infected, as demonstrated by their seroconversion to being positive for the presence of the B. burgdorferi-specific C 6 antibody starting on Day 48. In this study, all dogs treated with NexGard® 28 days prior to challenge with wild caught I. scapularis ticks were protected from B. burgdorferi infection, while nine out of the ten untreated control dogs were infected...|$|R
