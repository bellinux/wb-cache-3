5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E

The impact of obesity on {{the risk of}} Barrett’s esophagus is unclear. This is addressed by a systematic review {{in this issue of}} the American Journal of Gastroenterology using additional data given by the authors of individual observational studies. The review suggests that although obesity is a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> Barrett’s esophagus, it is probably not a direct effect and is likely to be due to the association with GERD. As obesity is a strong <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> esophageal adenocarcinoma, more data are needed in this area.

Methods Allele-specific and a multiplex PCR were employed to identify the genotypes {{of them in a}} case-control study of 210 lung cancer patients and 210 matched controls. Results The CYP 1 A 1 (Val/Val) and GSTM 1 (-) were the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer, the OR was 2. 56 and 1. 89 respectively. The relative risk increased to 2. 6 – fold when the patients carried with two valine alleles in cases of SCC. GSTM 1 (-) was the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> SCC (OR= 2. 39) and AC(OR= 2. 16).

25|$|Tubal {{pregnancy}} {{is when the}} egg is implanted in the Fallopian tubes. Hair-like cilia located on the internal surface of the Fallopian tubes carry the fertilized egg to the uterus.

This study was done to evaluate the role of opium as a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> TCC. A case-control study was performed on 255 individuals diagnosed with TCC of the urinary bladder by pathologic light microscopic examination of the tumor biopsies.
