40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} some of {{my recent}} work on consumer protection. I present three theoretical models which illustrate the merits and drawbacks {{of a number of}} common consumer protection policies, namely: <b>policies</b> which <b>prevent</b> 8 ̆ 5 rms from setting unduly high prices; <b>policies</b> which <b>prevent</b> 8 ̆ 5 rms requiring on-the-spot decision making by prospective customers, and <b>policies</b> which <b>prevent</b> suppliers from paying commission payments to sales intermediaries. ...|$|R

While Gheorghiu-Dej was exercising a looser control of the society, he {{was not ready to}} question most of the Stalinist measures, as these had served to enforce his own rule during the previous decade.|$|R

25|$|Membership in the Eurozone {{established}} a single monetary <b>policy,</b> <b>preventing</b> individual member states from acting independently. In particular they cannot create Euros {{in order to}} pay creditors and eliminate their risk of default. Since they share the same currency as their (eurozone) trading partners, they cannot devalue their currency to make their exports cheaper, which in principle would lead to an improved balance of trade, increased GDP and higher tax revenues in nominal terms.|$|R

Money {{that had to be}} paid to the King of Denmark was then {{calculated}} depending on the value of the cargo. The king had the right to buy the cargo for the price the ship's captain stated. This <b>policy</b> <b>prevented</b> captains from stating prices that were too low. The Sound Dues were abolished in 1857.|$|R
