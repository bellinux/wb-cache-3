A <b>repeat</b> of the 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E

40|$|Mouse DNA {{contains}} two equally abundant, homologous subfamilies of MspI 3. 6 and 5 kb <b>repeated</b> fragments. The first subfamily {{corresponds to the}} previously described (1) Bam 4 kb <b>repeats,</b> the second one to Bam <b>repeated</b> fragments of higher molecular weight. These subfamilies account {{for the vast majority}} of long Bam <b>repeats</b> and are linked with contiguous short Bam 0. 5 kb <b>repeats.</b> A minority of these composite Bam <b>repeats</b> extend, on the 0. 5 kb side, into R <b>repeats.</b> In turn, a fraction of the composite Bam/R <b>repeats</b> extend further, for at least 3 kb, into other <b>repeated</b> sequences contiguous to the R <b>repeats.</b> The long Bam <b>repeats</b> belong, therefore, in at least three superfamilies of <b>repeats,</b> the longest one being over 9 kb in size. Some general properties of these superfamilies are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The AR gene {{contains}} CAG <b>repeats</b> which affect receptor function, where fewer <b>repeats</b> {{leads to}} increased receptor sensitivity to circulating androgens and more <b>repeats</b> leads to decreased receptor sensitivity.

The racial trends in CAG <b>repeats</b> parallels the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in these groups.|$|R

5|$|The {{length of}} the trinucleotide <b>repeat</b> {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the variation in}} the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer <b>repeat</b> results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E

Using dynamic programming method, we can find all <b>repeating</b> groups of a string and determine whether a string is a complete <b>repeating</b> group string. ...|$|R
25|$|In mammals, 20% to 40% of {{proteins}} contain <b>repeating</b> sequences of amino acids encoded by short sequence <b>repeats.</b> Most {{of the short}} sequence <b>repeats</b> within protein-coding portions of the genome have a <b>repeating</b> unit of three nucleotides, since that length will not cause frame-shifts when mutating. Each trinucleotide <b>repeating</b> sequence is transcribed into a <b>repeating</b> series of the same amino acid. In yeasts, the most common <b>repeated</b> amino acids are glutamine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid and serine.|$|R
50|$|Tandem <b>repeats</b> {{occur in}} DNA when {{a pattern of}} one or more {{nucleotides}} is <b>repeated</b> and the repetitions are directly adjacent to each other.

40|$|Abstract. The genomes of {{organism}} {{are being}} published {{in an enormous}} speed. The genomes {{has a lot of}} intronic regions, and <b>repeats</b> constitute a substantial part of that. <b>Repeats</b> {{play a crucial role in}} DNA finger-printing, and detecting certain genomic diseases, such as Huntington disease, which has a high number of CAG <b>repeats.</b> Also, they throw important clues about the evolutionary history. <b>Repeats</b> are in two types, Tandem <b>Repeats</b> and Interspersed <b>Repeats.</b> In this paper we address ourselves to the problem of detecting Primary Tandem <b>Repeats,</b> which are tandem <b>repeats</b> that are not contained in any tandem <b>repeats.</b> We show that our algorithm takes O(n log n) time, where n is the length of genome. 1...|$|R

5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide <b>repeat,</b> which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the <b>repeat</b> is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the <b>repeat</b> count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{has also}} {{consistently}} {{been shown to}} play a role in reward learning, in all animal groups.

25|$|If the two {{terminal}} <b>repeats</b> in a solenoid do {{not physically}} interact, {{it leads to}} an open or linear structure. Members of this group are frequently rod- or crescent-shaped. The number of individual <b>repeats</b> can range from 2 to over 50. A clear advantage of this topology is that both the N- and C-terminal ends are free to add new <b>repeats</b> and folds, or even remove existing ones during evolution without any gross impact on the structural stability of the entire domain. This type of domain is extremely common among extracellular segments of receptors or cell adhesion molecules. A non-exhaustive list of examples include: EGF <b>repeats,</b> cadherin <b>repeats,</b> leucine-rich <b>repeats,</b> HEAT <b>repeats,</b> ankyrin <b>repeats,</b> armadillo <b>repeats,</b> tetratricopeptide <b>repeats,</b> etc. Whenever a linear solenoid domain structure participates in protein-protein interactions, frequently at least 3 or more repetitive subunits form the ligand-binding sites. Thus - while individual <b>repeats</b> might have a (limited) ability to fold on their own – they usually cannot perform {{the functions of the}} entire domain alone.|$|R

5|$|HD is one {{of several}} trinucleotide <b>repeat</b> {{disorders}} which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The HTT gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. HTT contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.... CAGCAGCAG...), known as a trinucleotide <b>repeat.</b> CAG is the 3-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the PolyQ region.|$|E
