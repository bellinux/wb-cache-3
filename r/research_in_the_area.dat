5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which {{suggested}} they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

25|$|Haury's <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> {{allowed him}} {{to be one of}} the first archaeologists to {{definitively}} give the Mogollon a chronological sequence. The sequences Haury established were: Early Pit House Period (200 C.E- 550 C.E.), Late Pit House Period (550 C.E.- 1000 C.E.), and Classic Mimbres Period (1000 C.E.- 1130 C.E.). Haury's research and findings were paramount when establishing a larger understanding the Mogollon that happened in the 1970s, as well as understanding the role of Casas Grandes in the Mogollon sequence.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Montagna della Majella {{anticline}} were previously studied by some scientific research groups, partly also in collaboration with oil companies such as Exxon, Lasmo and British Gas. A huge data base is present in literature regarding its sedimentary evolution, in studies by French and Swiss research groups. Previous to the TFM Project, in Italy, Torino and Pisa Universities have conducted ten years of geological <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> during the nineties of the twentieth century, focussing mainly on sedimentary and stratigraphic {{aspects of the}} area.|$|E

25|$|Arguably Haury's most {{important}} contribution to the archaeology of the American Southwest was his work in establishing a timeline and refining {{the definition of the}} Mogollon Culture. Much of Haury's work was conducted in the most famous Mogollon area, the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico. Early <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> focused on the ceramics that made the valley famous, while ignoring the underlying structures and pottery types. It was Haury who, starting in the 1930s with Gila Pueblo, began to identify and understand the timeline and uniqueness of the Mogollon from their Anasazi and Hohokam neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Pedophilia {{was first}} {{formally}} recognized and {{named in the}} late 19th century. A significant amount of <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can {{reduce the incidence of}} a person committing child sexual abuse. The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established. Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies. In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks, sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders, particularly pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite civil commitment.|$|E
