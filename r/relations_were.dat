5|$|Finnish–Estonian <b>{{relations}}</b> <b>were</b> closest diplomatically {{after the}} Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close. From the Finnish point of view, the close relations with Estonia did not exclude the Scandinavian neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the military <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> top secret, and the countries held joint military exercises. The central {{aim was to}} prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the Gulf of Finland against either country. Estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald and his {{government}} faced immediate problems upon formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening {{to withdraw from the}} union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> in a poor state, and Canadian foreign <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation—in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the Hudson's Bay Company. American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.|$|E

5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were still largely governed by age-old social customs. Many ways in which family <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> conducted during the Han were already stipulated in the ancient Confucian canon, especially in the Book of Rites. This became accepted as the mainstream guide to ethics and custom. In terms of private commercial contracts, they usually entailed information on the goods transferred, the amount paid, {{the names of the}} buyer and seller, the date of transfer and the signatures of witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> not always friendly. The most serious {{conflict}} between the two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', {{such as the one}} concluded {{at the end of the}} war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave an indication of their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Relations</b> <b>are</b> very {{important}} mathematical objects in different fields {{of theory and}} applications. In many real applications, for which gradation of <b>relations</b> <b>is</b> immanent, the classical <b>relations</b> <b>are</b> not adequate. Interpolative relations (I-relations) (as fuzzy <b>relations)</b> <b>are</b> the generalization of classical relations so that the value (intensity) of a <b>relation</b> <b>is</b> an element from a real interval [0, 1] and not only from { 0, 1 } as in the classical case. The theory of I-relations is crucially different from the theory of fuzzy <b>relations.</b> I-relations <b>are</b> consistent generalizations of classical relations and, contrary to fuzzy relations, all laws of classical <b>relations</b> (set-theoretical laws) <b>are</b> preserved in general case. In this paper, the main characteristics of I-relations are illustrated on the interpolative preference structures (Ipreference structures) as consistent generalization of classical preference structures...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Olga, her eldest son, King Constantine I of Greece, {{was determined to}} follow a policy of neutrality. His maternal <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> Russian, and his wife was the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. His policy brought him into conflict with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who favored the Allies. Constantine was soon {{accused of being a}} Germanophile and the Athenian government was regarded with suspicion in London and Paris. In {{what became known as the}} National Schism, Venizelos established a parallel government in Thessaloniki in opposition to Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{obtained}} IRO {{membership in}} secrecy: the initiation ritual involved a formal {{oath of allegiance}} over the Gospel or a Christian cross, a gun and a knife; treason was punishable by death, and secret police monitored each member's activities. Through clandestine channels of reliable people, <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> maintained with the revolutionary diasporic community. The internal correspondence employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names. Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania, preferring {{peace to}} war, {{accepted}} the ultimatum on March 19. Although diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>were</b> {{established as a}} result of the ultimatum, Lithuania did not agree to recognize the loss of Vilnius de jure. The government of Poland made a similar move against the Czechoslovak government in Prague on September 30, 1938, when it took advantage of the Sudeten Crisis to demand a portion of Zaolzie. On both occasions, Poland used the international crises to address long-standing border disputes.|$|E
