Dedicated printed circuit boards have been designed with different geometrical configurations (plating thickness, drilled hole diameter and PCB thickness). The PCB is made of hundreds of vias or holes which are wired by copper path to create a daisy chain. The PCB is subject to cyclic thermal loading (- 55 degrees C, + 125 degrees C). Electrical connectivity is recorded during tests. Cross sectioning is performed finally to characterize the loss of electrical connectivity.

In addition to environmental tests, finite element model is developed to analyze the deformation of PCBs during thermal cycling. Areas of strain concentration determined by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are consistent with locations where cracks were observed in experiments.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high-speed}} signal transmission circuits triggers {{the use of}} polymer substrates having the superiorly mechanical and electrical reliability properties. Foremost among them, <b>rigid-flex</b> polymer substrates are {{being used in the}} printed circuit board (PCB) of electronic packaging technologies by utilizing their property compatible with device miniaturization and packaging integration. Modifying the polymer interfacial property further before subsequent processing, plasma treatment is employed to adjust the physical and chemical changes of the surface and subsurface. One special issue of plasma-induced change is the surface roughness (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) depending on every detail of process cycle conditions. Thus, it is difficult to be precisely controlled so as to deliver the desirable outcome. This study employs Taguchi experimental method to find the parameter critical to plasma etching particularly on rigid flex substrate. In contrast to the traditional use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and/or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize the surface roughness morphology and thus deduce the optimal process conditions. It adopts a set of standard orthogonal arrays to determine parameters configuration and analysis results. These kinds of arrays use a small number of experimental runs but obtain maximum information and have high reproducibility and reliability.

Especially mobile phones have driven that trend to today's ultra-small cameras embedded into the handset. While the image capture IC features ever-decreasing pixel geometries and surging megapixel numbers, the readout circuitry and optical systems are now challenged to follow-up with this trend. This paper describes a miniaturization approach using advanced packaging techniques for the electronic system (bare die assembly in stack-wirebond and flip-chip) onto a high density circuit board and leveraging a MEMS based optical system providing the possibility for variable focus lens an aperture concept.

40|$|New {{interconnect}} technologies {{continue to}} shrink feature size, increase routing complexity and component density in multilayer rigid and <b>rigid-flex</b> printed circuits. Printed circuit fabricators have choices on the technology required {{to build the}} multilayer circuits based {{on the level of}} the technology required. One innovative technology is sequential lamination where multilayer boards are formed by laminating together plated double-sided or multilayers with blind and buried via interconnections. The sequential lamination manufacturing technique can yield even more significant benefits in performance and circuit processing when combined with embedded resistor features within the printed board. Embedded passive technology allows the resistors to be placed on the same layer as the routed traces reducing the need for microvias. This technology also enables resistors to be placed at an optimum location to reduce the inductance impact of pads, stubs, and coupling. The sequential lamination process in combination with thin film embedded resistors requires a different processing sequence than conventional multilayer manufacturing with thin film embedded resistors. Materials for embedded resistor can be either stand-alone resistor foil or a resistor laminate. For sequential lamination applications copper foil with a resistive alloy is preferred rather than a resistor laminate material. The copper/resistor foil has very low profile, and small circuit features can be achieved. Consequently, resistors can be fabricated in signal or power ground layers with multiple resistor values and good finished tolerances. The resistor alloys are robust and have low thermal coefficient of resistivity. The resistors maintain their initial values and reliability through the multiple lamination steps and subsequent thermal excursions required by the sequential lamination process...|$|E
40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{technology}} {{are moving to}} increased use of wireless communication with rapidly increasing data transmission rates and higher frequencies. Miniaturization is essential to allow electronics of increasing complexity to fit into smaller devices. Adaptive technologies allow a single system to operate across multiple wireless protocols, adjusting to changing conditions to minimize interference and enhance performance. Flexibility is essential {{as the use of}} wireless technology increases and spreads to new industries. The objective of this research is twofold: to develop novel reconfigurable electromagnetic structures and a novel process to fabricate microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices on flexible substrates. The novel electromagnetic structures are passive frequency-switchable parasitic antennas, conformal MEMS-tunable frequency selective surfaces (FSS) and MEMS-tunable electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures. Fabricating the reconfigurable conformal FSS and EBG structures requires {{the development of a new}} fabrication process to produce MEMS devices monolithically integrated onto a flexible substrate. Novel frequency-switchable parasitic antenna arrays are developed, fabricated and measured. The structure radiates efficiently when placed over metal and absorbing material, improving the range of conventional RFID systems, as well as minimizing blind spots to provide continuous coverage in a hemisphere. A novel analysis method is developed to characterize frequency-switchable parasitic patch arrays. The purpose of the analysis is to provide an approximation of the input impedance and variation of the radiation pattern with frequency. The analysis combines models based on electromagnetic theory and circuit theory to provide a fast and yet reasonable approximation of the parasitic array characteristics. The analysis also provides a good deal of physical insight into the operation of multi-mode parasitic patch arrays. The end result is an initial array design which provides a good starting point for full EM simulation and optimization. The new analysis method is validated alongside measured and simulated results, with good correlation for both impedance characteristics and far-field radiation patterns. A MEMS-based switched parasitic antenna array is designed, fabricated and measured with good correlation between simulated and measured results. The structure is a direct-coupled parasitic patch array which is capable of frequency steering and has additional MEMS-enabled beam-steering capabilities at each frequency. An EBG-based multi-mode radiating structure design is presented, which is capable of frequency-switchable beam steering. The antenna area is significantly reduced compared to the parasitic patch array structure, but at a considerable cost in terms of gain and efficiency. A novel MEMS process is developed to fabricate large numbers of high-performance MEMS devices monolithically integrated onto a <b>rigid-flex</b> organic substrate using low-temperature processes. The <b>rigid-flex</b> substrate is all dielectric, which is amenable to low-loss electromagnetic structures. The substrate provides mechanical support to the MEMS devices while maintaining overall flexibility. The adaptation of each fabrication process step to handle flexible substrates is analyzed and documented in detail.

A practical bias network is incorporated into the structure design to ensure that all devices are actuated simultaneously.

40|$|The current {{construction}} technology for PCB assembled power converters {{is based on}} the assembly of pre-manufactured discrete components. Fundamental limits of this construction method are steadily being reached as power converters tend to exploit higher processing speeds to gain advantages in both magnetic component size and overall power density. This thesis investigates a new design approach encompassing thermal management, geometrical packaging and electromagnetic integration (focussing on the PCB in particular) to push the limits further. In the research, a quantitative means to deal with component layout and the effect it has on the temperature characteristic of the converter is introduced as design tool. It incorporates the ability to define a design objective, such as high power density or increased reliability, and to weigh the respective trade-offs encountered during thermal design of a converter. Examples are provided. Furthermore, the inherent limitation of 2 D component layout (rigid PCB) often limits the freedom to arrange components with compatible shapes tightly together. A geometrical packaging approach is investigated to alleviate this limitation and thereby improve power density. Compatible components can be arranged tightly together in 3 D by implementing flexible PCB to fold the circuit, to accommodate the components. Electromagnetic integration has been identified as the enabling factor to realise structures that combine the functionality of several, otherwise discrete, components into a single structure, and combined with <b>rigid-flex</b> PCB technology these structures can be seamlessly embedded within the geometrically packaged converter system. The implementation of such multi-functional structures decreases the number of production and assembly steps during manufacturing and provides cost savings in material and assembly of the converter.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility, safety and efficacy of elective and urgent deployment of the new intravascular <b>rigid-flex</b> (NIR) stent in patients with coronary artery disease. Background. Stent implantation has been shown to be effective in the treatment of focal, new coronary stenoses and in restoring coronary flow after coronary dissection and abrupt vessel closure. However, currently available stents either lack flexibility, hindering navigation through tortuous arteries, or lack axial strength, resulting in suboptimal scaffolding of the vessel. The unique transforming multicellular design of the NIR stent appears to provide both longitudinal flexibility and radial strength. Methods. NIR stent implantation was attempted in 255 patients (341 lesions) enrolled prospectively in a multicenter international registry from December 1995 through March 1996. Nine-, 16 - and 32 -mm long NIR stents were manually crimped onto coronary balloons and deployed in native coronary (94 %) and saphenous vein graft (6 %) lesions. Seventy-four percent of patients underwent elective stenting for primary or restenotic lesions, 21 % for a suboptimal angioplasty result and 5 % for threatened or abrupt vessel closure. Fifty-two percent of patients presented with unstable angina, 48 % had a previous myocardial infarction, and 45 % had multivessel disease. Coronary lesions were frequently complex, occurring in relatively small arteries (mean [Â±SD] reference diameter 2. 8 Â± 0. 6 mm). Patients were followed up for 6 months for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Results. Stent deployment was accomplished in 98 % of lesions. Mean minimal lumen diameter increased by 1. 51 Â± 0. 51 mm (from 1. 09 Â± 0. 43 mm before to 2. 60 Â± 0. 50 mm after the procedure). Mean percent diameter stenosis decreased from 61 Â± 13 % before to 17 Â± 7 % after intervention. A successful interventional procedure with < 50 % diameter stenosis of all treatment site lesions and no major adverse cardiac events within 30 days occurred in 95 % of patients. Event-free survival at 6 months was 82 %. Ninety-four percent of surviving patients were either asymptomatic or had mild stable angina at 6 month follow-up. Conclusions. Despite unfavorable clinical and angiographic characteristics of the majority of patients enrolled, the acute angiographic results and early clinical outcome after NIR stent deployment were very promising. A prospective, randomized trial comparing the NIR stent with other currently available stents appears warranted...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{was born}} {{in the context of a}} {{research}} activity conducted by Thales Alenia Space Italia, and called Integrated Multifunctional Systems. The name is quite self-explanatory: the research is devoted to the study of Multifunctional Systems (MFSs). The work hereafter described addresses MFSs combining thermal, structural, electronic, and control functionalities. The rationale behind this activity comes from a careful evaluation of mission drivers and constraints for space systems. In the last 30 years, studies have shown that the largest contributors of total spacecraft dry mass are two technology areas: structure and packaged electronics. This information indicates a potentially fruitful area of technology development that would provide significant spacecraft dry mass reduction. Possible interesting areas to be addressed are bus architectures, novel electronic packaging and layout, electronic chassis that also function as structural members, minimization of harness. Moreover, there is increasing interest in the unnoticeable distribution of thermal control and monitoring hardware throughout the system. The challenge is to meet mission requirements taking into account an integrated design that addresses all areas of structural, electrical, component packages, and thermal elements. In particular, for this thesis the aim was to identify different ways of combining electrical and thermal control functions with mechanical structures in order to create a multifunctional system able to save mass and volumes, and simplify integration. The goal of the work was to screen materials and technologies to be used for structural elements, thermal solutions, and integrated electronics, to conceive, design, manufacture, and test suitable prototypes, and to evaluate the application of multidisciplinary design and optimization techniques to this field. The work has been conducted in close collaboration with Thales Alenia Space Italia S. p. A. (TAS-I), and with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) /California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Over a three year timespan, four different demonstrators have been considered: three of them have been developed with TAS-I, and one with JPL. In chronological order, the first prototype is the Advanced Bread Board (ABB), which is a thermostructural panel built in Carbon/Carbon and equipped with distributed electronics and sensors. The second prototype was implemented into three different demonstrators, SDA, SDB, and SDC (respectively, STEPS Demonstrator A, B, and C). They consist of an intelligent, modular, flat, and flexible motherboard which has been mounted on an aluminium sandwich panel, a curved aluminium plate, and a layer of Kevlar fabric. The third prototype is the ROV-E smart skin demonstrator, which is a development of the STEPS motherboard concept, and the fourth prototype is the JPL Î¼Rover, which consists of a small 4 -wheeled robot made of thermostructural Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). The four prototypes represent subsequent steps toward the realization of a multifunctional system where electronics in flex and <b>rigid-flex</b> form is bounded with structure. The goal is to achieve a more distributed architecture equipped with enough intelligence to handle communication, thermal/environmental control, and actuation. ABB is the first example, where small flat and flex boards with limited intelligence are mounted on a structural substrate with high thermomechanical performances. After the results obtained from ABB, the design flow is ideally split in two branches. The first research branch keeps on the development of flex electronics as a mean to integrate communication capabilities, health monitoring, signal and power harness on many different support materials: the STEPS demonstrators and the ROV-E smart skin concept are products coming from this approach. The STEPS demonstrators show increased dimensions, expanded capabilities, and higher level of on-board intelligence. The ROV-E smart skin brings these characteristics to their maximum extent: the design is focused on an extremely flexible board, able to monitor the surrounding structure and environment, able to actuate loads and to take care of signal and power distribution. On the other hand, the second research branch explores the possibility of using the electronic boards themselves (in <b>rigid-flex</b> configuration) as structural elements: the JPL Î¼Rover is the product of this approach. The micro rover is supposed to show the viability of eliminating electronic boxes by transferring all the components on the primary structure, which is therefore made of Printed Circuit Boards based on particular thermostructural materials. This thesis describes the work conducted for the development of integrated multifunctional systems from 2010 to 2012, and is divided in five main chapters, introduced by a preface. The preface itself presents the topic and scope of the work, and describes the research methodology used during activities. It also describes the structure of the thesis and acknowledges relevant contributions. The first chapter is dedicated to the literature review. Its goal is to explore the state of the art, to gather and summarize information on activities that have been performed up to now in the field of Multifunctional Systems. These activities are the foundations on which the work described in this thesis has been conceived, and represent the benchmark for the evaluation of achieved results. Therefore, a section is also included which contains a critical analysis of the activities most strictly related to this thesis. The second chapter presents how the research has been actually conducted, the activities regarding technology study and design, the factual implementation of concepts, the technical description of all different prototypes, and a first glance on results obtained. The third chapter describes in more detail all the findings, including test results and interpretation of data. The fourth chapter focuses on analysis and discussion of results and findings, with particular attention to their position in the context of the initial literature review and possible comparison with closest rivals. The fifth chapter draws conclusions and explains where further work is needed and which activities are going on to bring the multifunctional systems approach from the laboratory to the space vehicle. To broaden the discussion on given topics, or to give additional information on specific technologies, an appendix has been adde...|$|E
40|$|This {{version of}} the SpaceCube will be a full-fledged, onboard space {{processing}} system capable of 2500 + MIPS, and featuring a number of plug-andplay gigabit and standard interfaces, all in a condensed 3 x 3 x 3 form factor [less than 10 watts and less than 3 lb (approximately equal to 1. 4 kg) ]. The main processing engine is the Xilinx SIRF radiation- hardened-by-design Virtex- 5 FX- 130 T field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Even as the SpaceCube 2. 0 version (currently under test) is being targeted as the platform of choice {{for a number of}} the upcoming Earth Science Decadal Survey missions, GSFC has been contacted by customers who wish to see a system that incorporates key features of the version 2. 0 architecture in an even smaller form factor. In order to fulfill that need, the SpaceCube Mini is being designed, and will be a very compact and low-power system. A similar flight system with this combination of small size, low power, low cost, adaptability, and extremely high processing power does not otherwise exist, and the SpaceCube Mini will be of tremendous benefit to GSFC and its partners. The SpaceCube Mini will utilize space-grade components. The primary processing engine of the Mini is the Xilinx Virtex- 5 SIRF FX- 130 T radiation-hardened-by-design FPGA for critical flight applications in high-radiation environments. The Mini can also be equipped with a commercial Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA with integrated PowerPCs for a low-cost, high-power computing platform for use in the relatively radiation- benign LEOs (low-Earth orbits). In either case, this {{version of the}} Space-Cube will weigh less than 3 pounds (. 1. 4 kg), conform to the CubeSat form-factor (10 x 10 x 10 cm), and will be low power (less than 10 watts for typical applications). The SpaceCube Mini will have a radiation-hardened Aeroflex FPGA for configuring and scrubbing the Xilinx FPGA by utilizing the onboard FLASH memory to store the configuration files. The FLASH memory will also be used for storing algorithm and application code for the PowerPCs and the Xilinx FPGA. In addition, it will feature highspeed DDR SDRAM (double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory) to store the instructions and data of active applications. This version will also feature SATA-II and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. Furthermore, there will also be general-purpose, multi-gigabit interfaces. In addition, the system will have dozens of transceivers that can support LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling), RS- 422, or SpaceWire. The SpaceCube Mini includes an I/O card that can be customized {{to meet the needs of}} each mission. This version of the SpaceCube will be designed so that multiple Minis can be networked together using SpaceWire, Ethernet, or even a custom protocol. Scalability can be provided by networking multiple SpaceCube Minis together. <b>Rigid-Flex</b> technology is being targeted for the construction of the SpaceCube Mini, which will make the extremely compact and low-weight design feasible. The SpaceCube Mini is designed to fit in the compact CubeSat form factor, thus allowing deployment in a new class of missions that the previous SpaceCube versions were not suited for. At the time of this reporting, engineering units should be available in the summer 2012...|$|E
