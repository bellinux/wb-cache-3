2500|$|House at 2811–2813 South Menlo Avenue — This two-story {{residence}} {{was built}} in 1898 and has clapboard walls at the first floor and shingle at the second floor. [...] It has an irregular plan designed in the shingle style. [...] It has a two-story overhanging Dutch gambrel gable that projects from the main plane of the facade and a truncated pyramidal roof. [...] There is a patterned shingle design around the oval <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> in the gable wall. [...] The house was converted into a duplex in 1912.|$|E
50|$|The ornate <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> {{was removed}} in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Holy Trinity Parish Hall is a substantial, {{single-storeyed}} {{brick building}} with a multi-gabled roof. It is a plain but well-resolved design, incorporating motifs common to Gothic-styled ecclesiastical building in the cruciform plan, spire (<b>roof</b> <b>ventilator),</b> lancet windows and joinery detailing.|$|E
50|$|To {{the rear}} of the convent is a simple timber building, with gabled roof and large <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> used as a laundry.|$|R
50|$|The hall, {{across the}} rear of the library, is much more intact and {{features}} a fibrous plaster ceiling with coffered timber beams. Two large <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> are built into the hall roof.|$|R
50|$|The miners wash {{house is}} a common-bond brick building, {{approximately}} 50 feet x 30 feet, with a lower extension to the west. The building rests on a concrete slab foundation and is topped by a side-gable roof with three round metal <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of the}} [...] "hollow wall" [...] {{construction}} technique, the extendable casement {{window and}} pot-bellied <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator,</b> as patented designs, are important in demonstrating {{a high degree of}} technical achievement by the architect, Harry J Marks, in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{third stage}} (1902), at the rear, {{is a long}} {{rectangular}} building with light coloured horizontal strings and window arches. The corrugated iron hipped roof has a continuous raised <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator.</b> The interior walls has timber panelled dados, plaster raked ceilings and an unadorned proscenium stage. French doors open onto a verandah.|$|E
50|$|Equipment in the Paris body included: leather upholstery, five lamps, two {{electric}} horns, eight-day clock, automatic screen wiper, <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> and lamp, companions, rear blind controllable {{from the}} driver’s seat, folding luggage grid etc. The Riviera model {{had the same}} fittings but in addition the roof was flexible. It folded back like an ordinary hood over about two-thirds of its length.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the climate inside a {{greenhouse}} subject to various vent configurations is investigated. The greenhouse considered is a four span glass greenhouse, containing a plastic partition separating the greenhouse into two compartments. The temperature and velocity distribution at plant level is numerically analyzed with computational fluid dynamics. Six cases were considered. The first three cases have the roof vents {{open to the}} leeward side, while the side ventilators are opened at 30 ° and 45 ° respectively, after which a second row of side ventilators opened at 45 ° {{were added to the}} geometry. The last three cases have the roof vents open towards the windward side, with the same side ventilator configuration as mentioned for the first three simulations. Contour plots for both temperature and velocity are discussed and analyzed. Results seem to indicate that the temperature and velocity at plant level are significantly influenced by the arrangement and number of vents. The presence of a plastic partition also has an effect on the climate. The temperature in the east span of the greenhouse is slightly higher for the leeward ventilators compared to the windward <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators,</b> and the temperature distribution is also less homogeneous if the <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> are opened leeward. The velocity distribution in the west span for leeward <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> are higher compared to windward ventilators, and also less homogeneous. Comparing the velocity distribution in the east span for both leeward and windward <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators,</b> the results show an increase in air movement for the east span of the greenhouse. It is also shown that CFD can be a useful tool in development and design of greenhouses...|$|R
50|$|The timber {{buildings}} {{from the}} 1910-1920 period, {{such as the}} Dining Rooms and Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office are of the simple Federation Bungalow type. The Timekeeper's Office at the entry to the Workshops is a two storey timber structure with outsized <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators,</b> which makes a self- conscious architectural statement.|$|R
40|$|Plumbing and gasfitting workshop, built 1910. J. H. Boyne {{undertook}} the erection of {{the workshop}} {{at a cost of}} £ 300. The <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> sitting on the steps await installation. The building in the background (not obvious in the photo) is a Motor Garage, and was converted in 1913 to become the Engineering school...|$|R
50|$|Rush House {{has been}} more {{recently}} refurbished and includes the removal of <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> fleches and chimneys, {{the replacement of the}} roof sheeting in COLORBOND sheeting and the painting of the brickwork. Changes to the interior include the addition of partitions to dormitory areas, the replacement of joinery, lining of floors and the addition of suspended ceilings and air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{outbuildings}} {{immediately to}} the south of the Station. The first is a small brick building, formerly a toilet block, with a hipped corrugated iron roof and <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator.</b> The second is a smaller timber building with a gabled roof. In front of the Station in the island formed by the driveway is a flower garden with shrubs and small trees.|$|E
50|$|Aldborough {{stands on}} a large and highly visible corner block of land close to the main {{business}} street of Charters Towers. It is highly intact. Of note are the timber lattices, timber slat blinds and hedge plantings that provide shade in a sub tropical climate. The impressive entrance porch, decorative iron balustrading, <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator,</b> and acroterions also enhance the visual impact of the residence.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is rectangular in plan with an encircling verandah, built {{in on the}} north-western side. It is raised on low stumps, those at the perimeter being timber and the remainder, steel. The hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron and has two <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> on the ridge and new ogee gutters and acroteria.|$|R
50|$|Some of the joinery {{was made}} in {{government}} workshops in Brisbane and shipped to Cairns, but {{the remainder of the}} timber used in the construction was secured from the Cairns hinterland. Particularly impressive were the silky oak fittings in the court room. The roof was of fibrous-cement tiles with terracotta ridge capping. This roof was replaced with corrugated fibrous-cement roof sheeting in 1953, at which time the <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> were removed.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{reference}} available {{as to why}} Perseverance was slightly taller and heavier, but the 1904 diagram shows the Inspection Car as 13 ft; the post-1921 diagram for Norman shows slightly over 12 ft, and State Car No.1 is marked as 13 ft; {{it is possible that}} the height of the car changed with different bogie types or mounting methods, or the <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> might have been changed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} has a fanciful steep pitch terracotta tiled roof with sprocketted eaves and projecting gables {{to the east}} and west. Three turrets, to the centre, and the north and south bays, have been formed by the ridge being deleted between them and a curved capping piece inserted. The centre turret has a [...] "pot bellied", sheet metal <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator,</b> the other two have rounded finials.|$|E
50|$|The post-war years {{also saw}} the {{reconstruction}} of the British manufacturing industry and the erection of new factory buildings across the country. At this time, Colt designed the Sloping <b>Roof</b> <b>ventilator,</b> which lay along the roof slope, reducing installation and maintenance costs. Colt also designed the Clear Opening ventilator for industrial buildings such as foundries. This ventilator design ensured cooler working conditions and natural daylighting inside the factories.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the [...] "Tinies" [...] over their lives. Sanding arrangements were altered to improve the adhesion of the engines, and one engine, No. 129, received a small porthole window in the cabside. All engines received a cab <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator.</b> During the First World War, the boiler pressure was dropped from 200 lb/sq.in to 175 lb/sq.in. No other modifications were made until the merger with the North Eastern Railway.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} years of use, the court house proved to be draughty and have poor acoustics, these {{problems}} being attributed to the [...] "over-ventilation" [...] of the court house through [...] "superfluous" [...] openings in the ceiling. Various measures were undertaken to overcome these problems, including capping the <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators.</b> A false ceiling was eventually added to the court room to reduce the volume of the space.|$|R
50|$|The {{main roof}} is hipped {{and covered with}} painted {{corrugated}} iron. This has been continued over the masonry extension to the south. There are four <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> conspicuously ranged {{along the line of}} the ridge. The verandahs are bull nose. Where the courtyard has been enclosed the roof is in separate sections linked together with box gutters. At the rear the veranda roof, although enclosed is still legible and consists of convex curved corrugated iron.|$|R
50|$|It is the 1900 {{reconfiguration}} of {{the court}} house which survives today with the 1900 court room still in use as the Magistrate's Court and the 1897 building used for associated administration. Recent works include the insertion of air-conditioning services {{and the addition of}} a ramp entry for disabled access (1995). Other changes include the removal of <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> and a decorative white picket fence (shown in a 1908 photo; replaced by a chain wire fence).|$|R
50|$|This {{small one}} {{storeyed}} reinforced concrete building {{is still in}} use as the hospital morgue. The building contains two adjoining sections, forming a T-shaped plan, with corrugated iron hipped roof and a centrally located <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator.</b> The building is rendered with rough cast stucco and, originally on the now closed North Street boundary of the site, is centrally located east of the maternity wing. The building comprises a viewing room, mortuary, post-mortem room and small waiting room.|$|E
50|$|While it {{is known}} that similar {{ventilation}} techniques were incorporated into other public buildings such as schools and post offices or other court houses during this period and earlier, the system within the second Innisfail court house now at Yorkeys Knob is rare in its survival in North Queensland. In all, the building has seven ceiling ventilation spaces attached to the ducting system and <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> via metal hoods in the ceiling above them. This configuration is preserved intact and remains in the ceiling space.|$|E
5000|$|House at 2811-2813 South Menlo Avenue — This two-story {{residence}} {{was built}} in 1898 and has clapboard walls at the first floor and shingle at the second floor. It has an irregular plan designed in the shingle style. It has a two-story overhanging Dutch gambrel gable that projects from the main plane of the facade and a truncated pyramidal roof. There is a patterned shingle design around the oval <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> in the gable wall. The house was converted into a duplex in 1912.|$|E
5000|$|Harry Marks was {{described}} as being [...] "gifted with inventive genius". He was particularly interested in providing good ventilation and natural lighting and these are features of buildings designed by him. He devised and patented a number of architectural elements, including <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators,</b> a reversible casement window which provides optimum directional ventilation and a method of stucco wall construction using a hollow wall to {{give the appearance of}} a solid wall, but cheaper to construct than brickwork.|$|R
50|$|A {{weatherboard}} meathouse with a {{corrugated iron}} pyramid <b>roof</b> and <b>ventilator</b> is located to northwest. It has a separate, internal, timber frame and gauze structure with meat hooks and a concrete floor. A stained timber post-and-beam summerhouse with a corrugated iron pyramid <b>roof</b> and <b>ventilator</b> is located {{to the southwest}} near the tennis court. It has a boarded ceiling above the rafters, and single- skin vertically jointed infill boards, with fixed glazing above to the rear, and a solid balustrade with timber gates to the front.|$|R
50|$|The rolled {{galvanised}} iron roof has five tall chimneys and seven <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> of varied size. The court room roof is raised above both {{the roof of}} the rear and front sections. The separate flat arcade roofing at the half elevation maintains access for light and ventilation through the clerestory windows. The roof is a gable hipped, with ventilator louvres in the gablets and corresponding smaller gablets cap the east and west wings. A small forward projecting gablet proclaims the arched entrance to the rear verandah.|$|R
50|$|Caboonbah Homestead makes a {{significant}} contribution to the Queensland estate, illustrating the principal characteristics of a substantial, late 19th century timber homestead with early 20th century additions. The design, with its wide, low verandahs onto which every room opens, high ceilings, opening fanlights above French doors, <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> and low timber stumps, illustrates the adaptation of traditional British architectural taste to Queensland climatic conditions. A lack of refurbishment in a more pretentious style to accompany the increasing status of its owners reflects the aesthetic and cultural values of our nation builders.|$|E
50|$|In {{the grounds}} {{at the rear}} of the {{building}} behind Bay 3 is a detached rendered masonry strong room with a heavy metal door and a curved concrete roof clad in corrugated sheet metal surmounted by a <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator.</b> Later additions sheeted in asbestos cement planking and metal cladding with skillion roofs abut the north-western and north-eastern walls of the strong room. To the west of the strong room, a toilet block constructed of concrete blocks with skillion roof is located behind Bay 1. The additions to the strong room and the toilet block are not of cultural significance.|$|E
50|$|Incorporated in {{the later}} wing, and {{disguised}} on the south western face with subsequent arcading, is an early two storeyed building housing music practice rooms. These are located centrally, and are apparent on the north eastern facade. The building is of rendered brick and has an ornamental <b>roof</b> <b>ventilator</b> centrally located on the steeply pitched hipped roof. Small rectangular window openings line the north eastern face. The floor levels of this building are not aligned with the floor levels of the surrounding buildings, therefore small internal staircases provide access to the rooms. The music practice rooms, themselves, are evident {{on the ground floor}} of this building.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is of brick construction rendered and scored to resemble ashlar coursing. It has a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a timber verandah with twin steel posts and decorative cast iron balustrade that wraps around the north-east, north-west, and south-west sides on both levels. The building, sitting within an established garden of lawns, trees, and garden beds, is in a Neo- Georgian {{style and the}} principal elevations are symmetrically composed. The house roof has three large, cement-rendered chimneys with mouldings and conical metal <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{showroom}} on the {{top floor}} has the customary sawtooth roof aligned from east to west for optimum lighting. This expanse is distinguished by the <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> and tongue and groove lining and is supported by steel posts which had 1 metre timber cowls around their base. The top floor also retains its panelled refreshment and dressing rooms. Other unusual features of this wool store are the use of twin bearers to which the posts were bolted, rather than the usual capitals, and the several sets of stairs that include turned newel posts.|$|R
50|$|From the school's opening, the Suter {{building}} was overcrowded and had other problems, including poor lighting and ventilation. From 1893 the Department of Public Works became responsible for school design and worked to greatly improve its standard designs {{to address the}} natural ventilation and lighting of classroom interiors. The department's architects experimented with different combinations of <b>roof</b> <b>ventilators,</b> ceiling and wall vents, larger windows, dormer windows and ducting. <b>Roof</b> <b>ventilators</b> became fleches which grew larger as the experimentation continued. Prior to the widespread adoption of electricity and artificial lighting, achieving an ideal or even adequate level of natural light in classrooms, without glare, was of critical importance to educators and consequently it became a primary determinant of the design concept and layout of all school buildings. From around 1909 windows were rearranged and enlarged to provide a greater amount of gentle, southern light {{into the room and}} desks were rearranged to have the light falling onto the students' left hand side. This reduced glare, and, since students were forcibly right-handed, did not throw a shadow onto the page. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing buildings. Windows were larger and sills were lowered to let in more light generally. Smaller classrooms were preferred as they were easier to light correctly. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists.|$|R
