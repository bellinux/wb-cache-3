This paper examines {{the flip side of}} {{political correctness}} as analyzed in Morris (2001) to shed some light on the elusive notion of political incorrectness and elucidate its equilibrium and welfare properties. We show that there are circumstances in which unbiased experts deliberately take a politically incorrect stance out of reputational concerns and identify key elements which give rise to this perverse <b>reputational</b> <b>incentive.</b> The results suggest that political incorrectness cannot necessarily be viewed as a sign of blunt honesty when informed experts have long-term reputational concerns.

40|$|Self {{regulation}} is a mechanism of quality vigilance that is frequently used in credence good industries. The providers in these markets generally form a Self Regulated Organization (SRO), composed by {{some members of}} the industry, whose main job is to convince consumers through an active surveillance of her members that they will receive goods or services with high standards of quality. The SRO main objective is to create confidence among consumers about the quality they are receiving from the market. Hence, consumers expects that an SRO: a) effectively watch her members, controlling their quality provision; and b) punish and publicly denounce those members found providing a bad quality service, as a credible signal of her level of surveillance and the quality the consumers may expect from other members. However, self regulation imply by definition a situation of regulatory capture, hence the following questions naturally appear: Â¿Does the SRO has the correct incentives to do her job?, and Â¿where do those incentives may come from?. The main objective of this work is to analyse in the lab how consumers interpret or learn to interpret the exposure that receive from an SRO, and given this interpretation if the SRO behaviour is consistent with {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>reputational</b> <b>incentive</b> to denounce.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> in markets characterised by moral hazard problems. Social {{preferences}} {{have been shown to}} enhance contract enforcement in these markets, {{while at the same time}} generating considerable wage and price rigidity. Reputation powerfully amplifies the positive effects of social preferences on contract enforcement by increasing contract efficiency substantially. This effect is, however, associated with a considerable bilateralisation of market interactions, suggesting that it may aggravate price rigidities. Surprisingly, reputation in fact weakens the wage and price rigidities arising from social preferences. Thus, in markets characterised by moral hazard, <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> unambiguously increase mutually beneficial exchanges, reduce rents, and render markets more responsive to supply and demand shocks.

30|$|However, since {{auditors}} {{are responsible}} for a clean financial statement, it is not unlikely that their decisions about corporate tax burdens will contrast with pure tax consultants’ advice even when auditors have the formal tax consultant qualification. Auditors with tax certification could, therefore, require adjustments that limit the associated financial statement benefits of low effective tax rates (McGuire et al. 2012). This reduction is especially important if the audit firm {{was not involved in}} designing the tax plan in question (see Cook and Omer 2013; Donohoe and Knechel 2014; Maydew and Shackelford 2007). Fears with regard to possible reputational damage 5 induced by media in case of detected clients’ tax sheltering could result in a tax certified individual auditor determining low reported effective tax rates and refusing to approve previously set tax arrangements by the client. Because Germany is a low litigation risk country, settling audit failures with compensation is reduced. This legal environment creates a setting where auditor reputation is even more important (Weber et al. 2008). Consequently, the German audit market provides an opportunity to test the <b>reputational</b> <b>incentive</b> of individual auditors that are also chartered tax consultants. Given by assumption that auditors with tax certification may be more familiar with the tax code than auditors that are no tax consultants, tax certified individual auditors may be, in this context, better able to judge the risk of aggressive reporting being detected by tax authorities. Individual auditors that are also tax consultants may, therefore, restrict the clients’ level of reported effective tax rates to maximize clients’ after-tax income given the risk taking and potential penalties upon detection (Kittl 2015; Klepper et al. 1991; Klepper and Nagin 1989).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} {{question}} how much authority a principal should delegate to a manager with conflicting interests and uncertain ability in {{a context in which}} the manager has both compensation based and <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives.</b> The optimal level of authority balances the value of the manager's decision-making expertise against the cost of ensuring that the manager uses his discretion productively. <b>Reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> reduce the necessary monetary incentives to discourage purely opportunistic behavior, but may cause the manager to pursue conservative courses of action to preserve his reputation. This undermines the benefits of delegating control, leading to decreased managerial authority and stronger monetary incentives.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of {{competition}} in settings where agents are motivated primarily by reputational concerns. This is typically the case when explicit contracts are difficult to write {{due to the lack}} of verifiability of the task performed by the agent, or of output quality. Such situations are widespread in the case of expert advice or professional services. Competition can generate interesting effects when interacting with <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives.</b> The first chapter contains a selective review of the literature on <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> and on the market for expert advice. The second chapter analyses how competition affects the incentives to report truthful information of experts competing to influence a decision maker. The complex interaction between <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> and competition provides important implications for organisational design, and there are situations when delegating decision powers, or adopting forms of favouritism improve upon letting experts communicate their information and compete to influence the decision maker. The third chapter contains an analysis of the effect of competition on the incentives of an important class of experts, financial analysts. A theoretical model is developed to highlight how the behaviour of sell side analysts is affected by the presence of non-sell-side analysts. The predictions of the model are then tested on a dataset of financial analysts recommendations. The main result is that stronger competition decreases the degree of optimism of sell side analysts. Finally, the fourth chapter investigates the effect of entry in a market for experts where customers have different valuation for the service and there is positive sorting, so that higher valuation clients prefer to be served by more reputable experts. The main result is that entry decreases effort incentives for more reputable agents, unless the type of customers also affects the likelihood of successful provision of the service...|$|R

25|$|Explicit {{extrinsic}} {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives,</b> motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.|$|R

40|$|Reputation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} solutions to the so-called «puzzle of cooperation», but it is usually studied in contexts in which information is not ambiguous and there are no incentives towards strategically using it. In this study, we test wheter the possibility of being evaluated (with a like or a dislike) when giving suggestions about a deal in a competitive game has an effect on truthfulness of suggestions. We designed a computer-mediated experiment and we tested adolescents in a high-school in Italy, with the aim of understanding the development of reputational dynamics and how adolescents deal with competing incentives. Our results show that when reputations introduced, adolescents become more cooperative, both in terms of donations to partners and of suggestions offered. We also observe that reputations, both positive and negative, behave as attractors, thus those of ill-repute receive negative reviews even when they cooperate, and individuals with positive reputations keep on receiving positive evaluations even when misbehaving. Our study adds to the literature on reputation and cooperation by showing how adolescents behave with <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> in a competitive game, but also by investigating the interplay between <b>reputational</b> and material <b>incentives...</b>|$|R

We analyze how investment incentives depend on the firm’s reputation and derive implications for <b>reputational</b> dynamics. <b>Reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> depend on the specification of market learning. When consumers learn about quality through good news events, incentives decrease in reputation and there is a unique work-shirk equilibrium with convergent dynamics. When learning is through bad news events, incentives increase in reputation and there is a continuum of shirk-work equilibria with divergent dynamics. Across all imperfect learning processes with Brownian and Poisson signals, we show that when costs are low there exists a work-shirk equilibrium with convergent dynamics. This equilibrium is essentially unique if market learning contains a good news or Brownian component. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and {{illustrate}} a prototype incentive system for promoting rapid reduction of forest clearing in tropical countries. Our proposed Tropical Forest Protection Fund (TFPF) is a cash-on-delivery system that rewards independently monitored performance without formal contracts. The system responds to forest tenure problems {{in many countries}} by dividing incentive payments between national governments, which command {{the greatest number of}} instruments that affect forest clearing, and indigenous communities, which often have tenure rights in forested lands. The TFPF incorporates both monetary and <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives,</b> which are calculated quarterly. The monetary incentives are unconditional cash transfers based on measured performance, while the <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> are publicly disclosed, color-coded performance ratings for each country. The incentives include rewards for: (1) exceeding long-run expectations, given a country’s forest clearing history and development status; (2) meeting or exceeding global REDD+ goals; and (3) achieving an immediate reduction in forest clearing. Drawing on monthly forest clearing indicators from the new FORMA (Forest Monitoring for Action) database, we illustrate a prototype TFPF for eight East Asian countries: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. A system with identical design principles could be implemented by single or multiple donors for individual or multiple forest proprietors within one or more countries, as well as national or local governments in individual countries, tropical regions, or the global pan-tropics. Our results demonstrate the importance of financial flexibility {{in the design of the}} proposed TFPF. Its incentives are calculated to induce a massive, rapid reduction of tropical forest clearing. If that occurs, a TFPF for East Asia will need standby authority for disbursements that may total $ 10 – 14 billion annually for the next two decades. This financial burden will not persist, however, because the TFPF is designed to self-liquidate once all recipient countries have achieved clearly specified benchmarks. We estimate that the TFPF can be closed by 2070, with its major financial responsibility discharged by 2040. ...|$|R

Does it pay to be even nicer? Four experiments assess reputational inferences across {{the entire range of}} prosocial outcomes in zero-sum interactions, from completely selfish to completely selfless actions. We observed consistent nonlinear evaluations: Participants evaluated selfish actions more negatively than equitable actions, but they did not evaluate selfless actions markedly more favorably than equitable actions. This asymptotic pattern reflected monotonic evaluations for increasingly selfish actions and insensitivity to increasingly selfless actions. It pays to be nice but not to be really nice. Additional experiments suggest that this pattern stems partly from failing to make spontaneous comparisons between varying degrees of selflessness. We suggest that these <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives</b> could guide social norms, encouraging equitable actions but discouraging extremely selfless actions...|$|R

As in Holmström (1999), a worker’s productive abilities are revealed over time through output, and wages are based on expected output, and so on assessed ability. Specifically, work increases the probability that a skilled worker achieves an observable breakthrough. In the presence of a deadline, it is shown that career concerns not only affect the amount of work produced, but also its timing: while {{it would be best to}} have the worker put in effort early, it is optimal for him to do so midway through his probationary period if this effort is not observed, and late if it is observed. Committing to a deadline is shown to be welfare-increasing, even if it curtails learning. If effort is publicly observable, it is better to condition termination on time than on assessed ability. ...|$|R

Some injurers nevertheless exert socially efficient care because of intrinsic prosocial concerns. Others {{have no such}} concerns but would like {{people to believe that}} they do. We show that negligence is more effective than strict liability at transforming esteem concerns into incentives to exert care. This extends to the case where courts may err in assessing the defendants’ behavior. The regime of proof then affects the inferences drawn from the finding of negligence and can therefore be chosen to make the best use of <b>reputational</b> <b>incentives.</b> When suits are rare, the plaintiff should bear the burden of proving negligence; when they are frequent, the defendant should bear the burden of proving compliance with due care.
