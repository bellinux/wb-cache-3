Galvanised by the escalation of violence, Arthur called a meeting of Van Diemen's Land's Executive Council—comprising himself, the chief justice and the colonial treasurer—and on 1 November declared martial law against the Aboriginal people in the Settled Districts, who were now [...] "open enemies of the King". Proclamation of martial law was a crown prerogative to be used [...] "against rebels and enemies as a ... convenient mode of exercising a right to kill in war, a right originating in self-defence" [...] and Arthur's move was effectively a declaration of total war.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of Carens’s careful {{exploration}} lies a core norm or belief: “The moral <b>right</b> of states <b>to</b> <b>apprehend</b> and deport irregular migrants erodes {{with the passage of}} time. ” This then leads him to the proposition that amnesty should be the result of that passage of time. The passage of time represents attachments, a life well-lived, contributions to the community, the absence of a criminal record after years of residence. The determination of what length of time is meaningful in this domain is partly empirical in that it ought to capture actual life processes and societal connections, and these can vary enormously depending on the individual and the situation. “At some point a threshold is crossed, and they acquire a moral claim to have their actual social membership legally recognized” (Carens, p. 18). Legal recognition basically involves the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> permanent residence and all the rights that go with it, including eventually the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> citizenship. It is easy to produce a vast number of counterarguments to this propositio...|$|R

40|$|This article explores some of {{the changes}} {{regarding}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> silence that have flowed from the passage of the so-called ‘anti-terror laws’, particularly the amendments to the ASIO Act (1979). It finds that the right has been significantly weakened through a number of provisions in the legislation. The writer contends that the judicial protection of the accused, embodied in the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> silence, is fundamental to the workings of an efficient and moral judicial system despite the seemingly overriding imperatives of national security. It argues that the loss of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> silence neither serves the prosecution of terrorists, nor the bolstering of investigative procedures <b>to</b> <b>apprehend</b> them, but in fact weakens such processes and the democratic basis of the Australian judicial system in the rule of law. “Innocence claims the right of speaking, as guilt invokes the privilege of silence...|$|R
