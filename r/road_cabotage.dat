Background: In 1998 the European Union {{introduced the}} concept of free <b>road</b> <b>cabotage.</b> The concept implies that haulers from different Member States are allowed to perform domestic transportation in another Member State {{as long as it}} is conducted on a temporary basis. The introduction of cabotage has given rise to new competitive conditions on domestic markets within the European Union. Not all haulage companies within the European Union have the same competitive prerequisites. Swedish haulers have a high cost structure in comparison with foreign haulers and therefore it is interesting to see how they are affected by cabotage. Research Questions: o How do Swedish haulers perceive cabotage in their industry and how do they manage it today? o Which improvements can be achieved strategically to sustain and/or improve Swedish haulers’ competitive situation towards foreign haulers? Purpose: The objective of this bachelor thesis is to investigate how Swedish haulers’ are affected by competition concerning <b>road</b> <b>cabotage.</b> Depending on how they are affected by <b>road</b> <b>cabotage</b> we also intend to present strategic improvements that can sustain and/or improve their competitive ability. Methodology: Survey on three haulage companies Theoretical Framework: For our first research question we have chosen to present {{the concept of}} cabotage to enlighten readers. To be able to understand what characterises the Swedish haulage industry we have chosen Porter’s Five Forces Model as a foundation. The results from the Five Forces Model are used as inputs to the theories concerning Porter’s generic strategy. Conclusions: Through this bachelor thesis we have concluded that Swedish haulers are in different ways affected by <b>road</b> <b>cabotage.</b> Depending on their type of business, they are more or less affected by cabotage. Through differentiation Swedish haulers can sustain and improve their competitive situation. The differentiation should be focused on issues regarding markets, customers, and specific service characteristics that are difficult for foreign competitors to imitate...|$|E

This has been extensively analyzed in the CNR studies, the report by Claude Abraham [1]. These studies see the issue of competitiveness as taking a specific form in France, as France is subjected to particularly severe competition, as {{it is one of the}} countries in Europe, if not the country in Europe, in which foreign hauliers are the most active. In particular, the Act of 1 May 2009 extended <b>road</b> <b>cabotage</b> allowing seven new countries from Eastern Europe to operate within France, namely Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.|$|E

The aims {{of the present study}} are to: (1) Examine the safety outcomes of increasing internationalisation in (Norwegian) road transport of goods; and (2) Discuss the importance of potential risk factors related to increasing proportions of foreign HGVs on Norwegian roads. We use four data sources to shed light on the aims. Results show that foreign HGVs account for 6 % of the average domestic transport in Norway, and 11 % of the HGVs involved in personal injury accidents. Additionally, foreign HGVs have a three times higher risk of single vehicle accidents, and twice the risk of head-on collisions. Foreign HGV drivers also seem more likely to trigger fatal accidents. We conclude that two risk factors seem to be important: (1) experience with/competence on Norwegian roads and (2) winter driving. Thus, the safety challenge is not that the drivers are foreign, but that they to some extent lack experience with, and competence on, the Norwegian road networks and the challenges that these roads may pose (e. g., narrow roads with high gradients, many curves, snow and ice). Previous research from other countries has also found that lacking experience with national road networks is an important risk factor. Given our results on risk factors, we may hypothesize that if foreign HGV drivers get more experience and education on Norwegian driving conditions, then increased internationalization could perhaps be of less concern in road safety. When discussing the higher accident risk and lower experience of foreign HGV drivers in Norway, {{it is important to note}} that the reason for foreign HGV drivers, working for foreign hauliers, to drive in Norway is that there are customers of the goods in Norway. Interviewees stressed that the foreign driver is often the last link in a long and complex chain of actors involved in the transport. Although these actors have a legal responsibility to “contribute to safety,” interviewees stated that this responsibility is vague and not clearly enforced. We therefore suggest the clarification of, and an increase in, the responsibilities of the different parties involved in goods transport, especially the transport buyers. This means to both ensure the experience and training of the drivers (e. g., preparing them properly to drive on winter roads), and to positively influence their transport safety in other ways (e. g., reducing stress and time-pressure) ...|$|E

Originally a shipping term, cabotage now also covers aviation, railways, and <b>road</b> transport. <b>Cabotage</b> is [...] "trade or navigation in coastal waters, or the exclusive right of a country to operate the air traffic within its territory". In the context of [...] "cabotage rights", cabotage refers {{to the right of}} a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation terms, for example, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries enact cabotage laws for reasons of economic protectionism or national security.|$|R
