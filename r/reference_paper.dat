5000|$|Antares is a {{supergiant star}} with a stellar {{classification}} of M1.5Iab. With a radius that is approximately 883 {{times that of}} the Sun, it is one of largest stars, if placed {{in the center of the}} Solar System, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Based upon parallax measurements, Antares is approximately [...] from the Sun. Its visual luminosity is about 10,000 {{times that of the}} Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the bolometric luminosity equals roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star has been calculated to be in the range of 15 to 18 solar masses. A 2012 analysis by Pecaut and colleagues comparing the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars which include rotation an initial progenitor mass of approximately 17 solar masses and an age of 12 million years. Initial mass must also take into account the mass loss from powerful winds, and this would yield a less massive star not stated in this <b>reference</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{actuator}} strain for electrically driven actuators {{of carbon}} nanotube sheets {{can be improved}} up to 0.7% in a 1 M electrolyte once the sheets are annealed in an inert atmosphere at very high temperatures (1100 oC) in contrast to once reported 0.1% or less for low electrochemical potentials (~1 V or less). The maximum strain for the carbon nanotube sheet actuators at low voltages is {{greater than that of}} the high modulus ferroelectric ceramic actuators (~0.1%), but it is lower than that of the low voltage (~0.4 V) conducting polymer actuators (~3% film direction, 20% thickness direction). Strokes were reported as high as 215% for strain biased low modulus electrostrictive rubbers under biases greater than 1kV (corresponding to an electric field 239 MV/m for the geometry mentioned in the <b>reference</b> <b>paper).</b> Spinks et al. realized pneumatic actuation from the carbon nanotube sheets in electrolyte solutions with high electrochemical potential (1.5 V), which cause gas generation in the electrolyte. The released gas dramatically increases the actuator stroke from the carbon nanotube sheet. Thickness of the carbon nanotube sheet expands by ~300% and the sheet plane contracts by 3%.|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} and defined biosimilar pathway, {{taking into consideration}} the complexity of biologics and its follow-on products, is neither applicable for NBCDs and its similars. Since NBCDs are by definition not biologicals but are rather synthetic. However, basic principles {{can be used for}} an NBCD similar evaluation. Since the NBCD follow-on versions are not identical but only similar to the originator product, they are never the same as it is with generic small molecule products. NBCDs and their similars containing nanoparticulate can also be referred to as nanosimilars (see figure 1). A stepwise quality, non-clinical and clinical approach is suggested for market approval of NBCD nanosimilars and to show comparability. There is a lack of non-clinical models to test such products like e.g. the rodent approach addressed by EMA in their <b>reference</b> <b>paper</b> for the NBCDs iron sucrose and its similars. Recently, the hatching egg model was used as an alternative model to study time-dependent iron concentrations in heart and liver avian tissues for various intravenous iron complexes applied in equimolar doses. Such models need in-depth evaluation and validation to demonstrate robustness and to further define potential use in an evaluation and comparison testing. When evaluated similar enough, the challenge then still is to define to either use them as a therapeutic alternative or as an equivalent product and if at the end the follow-on version can substitute the reference product or can be interchanged which also needs head-to-head comparisons in patients to prove therapeutic equivalence and comparable safety.|$|E
