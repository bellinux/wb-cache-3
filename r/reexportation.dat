The receipts of our Custom-House, under the head of Groceries, afford us, however, some means of calculating our luxuries of the table. The articles of tea, coffee, and cocoa-nuts I would propose to omit, and to take them instead from the excise, as best showing what is consumed at home. Upon this principle, adding them all together, (with the exception of sugar, for a reason which I shall afterwards mention,) I find that they have produced, in one mode of comparison, upwards of 272,000l., {{and in the other}} mode upwards of 165,000l., more during the war than in peace.[41] An additional duty was also laid in 1795 on tea, another on coffee, and a third on raisins,--an article, together with currants, of much more extensive use than would readily be imagined. The balance in favor of our argument would have been much enhanced, if our coffee and fruit ships from the Mediterranean had arrived, last year, at their usual season. They do not appear in these accounts. This was one consequence arising (would to God that none more afflicting to Italy, to Europe, and the whole civilized world had arisen!) from our impolitic and precipitate desertion of that important maritime station. As to sugar,[42] I have excluded it from the groceries, because the account of the customs is not a perfect criterion of the consumption, much having been reëxported to the North of Europe, which used to be supplied by France; and in the official papers which I have followed there are no materials to furnish grounds for computing this <b>reëxportation.</b> The increase on the face of our entries is immense during the four years of war,--little short of thirteen hundred thousand pounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{services}} sector made up nearly 50 percent of Paraguay’s {{gross domestic product}} in 2004 and employed about 19 percent of Paraguay’s working population. The importation of goods, especially from Argentina and Brazil, for sale and illegal <b>reexportation</b> creates service industry jobs. The {{services sector}} had a moderate growth rate of 0.9 percent from 1990 to 2003. The sector decreased by 7.8 percent in 2002, before rebounding in 2003 with a 1.6 percent growth rate. Instability {{in the economy and}} a large black market have hampered development of the formal services sector in Paraguay.|$|E
50|$|United States Treasury Secretary Robert Walker {{proposed}} {{the establishment of}} a bonded warehousing system based on the one employed by Britain in his 1846 report to Congress. The bill was adopted following the Walker Tariff of 1846 and implemented in 1847. During the Zachary Taylor administration members of the Whig party predicted the system would amount to failure and urged its repeal. The system quickly flourished however and produced a rapid increase in <b>reexportation</b> commerce through American ports. The impact was particularly strong in New York City where an established warehousing industry facilitated its rapid implementation.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between British and American conceptualizations of the Anglophone Caribbean {{and the way that}} Anglophone Caribbean fiction writers and filmmakers tend to represent the region. Central to my project is the process of <b>reexportation,</b> whereby Caribbean artists attain success at home by first achieving renown abroad. I argue that the primary implication of <b>reexportation</b> is that British and American conceptualizations of the Anglophone Caribbean have had a determining effect upon attempts by Anglophone Caribbean fiction writers and filmmakers to represent the region. Chapter I introduces the dissertation. Chapter II, "The 'Doubl...|$|E
40|$|In {{a dynamic}} global economy, {{emergent}} configurations of capitalist production produce novel spatial assemblages and correspondingly unique geometries of power. The "global cities" literature frames these transformative processes {{in terms of}} hierarchical world urban systems, providing a clear theoretical path to understanding the local implications of global spatial restructuring. This article develops {{the concept of the}} "relational city" as a transnational urbanist approach to understanding a particular subset of cities that are emblematic of the spatial transformations manifest through advanced capitalism. Relational cities are those constituted through globally critical flows of capital, goods, and ideas, and whose economies are dedicated to intermediary services such as offshore banking, container- and bulk-shipping, and regional <b>reexportation.</b> Similar to gateway cities and entrepôts, relational cities are found eccentrically at one end of a fan-shaped network, connecting the global economy with a regional economic matrix. Drawing upon Doha, Dubai, and Panama City as illustrative case studies, this article suggests a new way of understanding urban change in a global context while simultaneously moving beyond the recurrent focus on the top-tier financial world cities of the Global North...|$|E

The private industrial units as they show a positive rentability, {{they tend to}} distribute their earnings, {{not being able to}} ensure an acceptable financial autonomy. - many private facilities overlook administrative efficiency. In general there is favorable situation where the State intervenes, specially in the joint units. - a large number of manual work has an average labor experience and a minimum sufficient quality; - the production units which have a strong percentage of technicians, managers or employers born in Cape Verde do not show work conflicts caused by different rhythms of living, not giving, thus, way to great problems. On the other hand, however, the situation is less satisfactory when then technical staff is strongly foreign. iii. This country is made up by several islands with scarce internal resources, so its efforts should be engaged in creating industrial units which might devote themselves to the <b>reexportation</b> of manufactured goods. This strategy should come out the establishment of sub-contract participation in the capital of these new industrial projects. Concerning the global administrative aspects, industrialization policies should carry out the entrance of foreign investment. The close relationship between Portugal and a great number of Cape Verdean technicians, managers and industrialists, could be an important factor to achieve this outwardly directed policy. The adequate preparation of managers has also to be strengthened. With this movement outwards, factories will only be able to compete in the international market if they go on ensuring an efficient management, now with a higher quality. And this means that managers have to have a much better and up to date trainingAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.
