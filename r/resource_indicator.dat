40|$|Purpose: While {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) has standardized methods for assessing emission impacts, some comparable methods for the accounting or impact assessment of resource use exist, but are not as mature or standardized. This study contributes to the existing research by offering a comprehensive comparison of {{the similarities and differences}} of different <b>resource</b> <b>indicators,</b> in particular those based on thermodynamics, and testing them in a case study on titania (titanium dioxide pigment) produced in Panzhihua city, southwest China. Materials and methods: The system boundary for <b>resource</b> <b>indicators</b> is defined using a thermodynamic hierarchy at four levels, and the case data for titania also follow that hierarchy. Seven <b>resource</b> <b>indicators</b> are applied. Four are thermodynamics-based-cumulative energy demand (CED), solar energy demand (SED), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment (CEENE) -and three have different backgrounds: abiotic resource depletion potential, environmental priority strategies, and eco-indicator 99. Inventory data for the foreground system has been collected through on-site interviews and visits. Background inventory data are from the database ecoinvent v 2. 2. Characterizations factors are based on the CML-IA database covering all major methods. Computations are with the CMLCA software. Results and discussion: The scores of <b>resource</b> <b>indicators</b> of the chloride route for titania system are lower than that of the sulfate route by 10 - 35 %, except in terms of SED. Within the four thermodynamic <b>indicators</b> for <b>resources,</b> CED, CExD, and CEENE have similar scores, while their scores are five orders of magnitude lower than the SED score. Atmospheric resources do not contribute to the SED or CEEND score. Land resources account for a negligible percentage to the SED score and a small percentage to the CEENE score. Non-renewable resources have a dominant contribution to all seven <b>resource</b> <b>indicators.</b> The global production of titania would account for 0. 12 and 0. 14 % of the total anthropogenic non-renewable resource demand in terms of energy and exergy, respectively. Conclusions: First, we demonstrate the feasibility of thermodynamic <b>resource</b> <b>indicators.</b> We recommend CEENE as the most appropriate one within the four thermodynamic <b>resource</b> <b>indicators</b> for accounting and characterizing resource use. Regarding the case study on the titania produced in China, all the <b>resource</b> <b>indicators</b> except SED show that the sulfate route demands more resource use than the chloride route...|$|R

30|$|The {{case study}} is used to {{illustrate}} {{how to use a}} probabilistic model. Therefore, when other scholars use the probabilistic model, they can change the assumptions according to the information of their projects. For example, if the project is not a new project, we can use the production curve and some other information, such as the years of production, to calculate the production for each year. The shortcoming of this paper is that some assumptions are rough, such as OOIP. With reference to Jakobsson et al. (2012), we assume that it follows a lognormal distribution. However, OOIP is a very complicated <b>resource</b> <b>indicator,</b> it is decided by many factors, such as the degree of porosity, block size, the effective thickness of reservoirs and so on. Although different experts may have different assumptions about the distribution of OOIP, they have a consensus that OOIP is a stochastic variable.

IRIS springs from the concept that end-users should not be bogged down with network names when looking for a resource on the network, and should have the liberty to freely sketch and describe {{what they want and}} not where to go about finding it. IRIS archives the following in performing network searches for resources: (i) expressiveness in near English like queries, (ii) subjective searches leading to more relevant results, and (iii) complete transparency with increased usage. IRIS design bifurcates nodes in the networks to resolvers and end-hosts. Resolvers and resources form a network overlay using soft state communications. Network routing is coupled with user intent to dynamically map requests to available resources using this overlay, thereby allowing a graceful join and leave procedure. We perform algorithmic analysis of IRIS at an abstract level for the most computationally intensive steps for tree based recursive searchings. We also present implementation results in terms of memory, CPU usage, control signalling, and delay to demonstrate the performance of IRIS. I...|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{the stock}} status of mixed and/or multi-species fishery {{resources}} is challenging. This {{is especially true}} in highly diverse systems, where landed catches are small, but comprise many species. In these circumstances, whole-of-ecosystem management requires consideration of the impact of harvesting on a plethora of species. However, this is logistically infeasible and cost prohibitive. To overcome this issue, selected ‘indicator’ species are used to assess the risk to sustainability of all ‘like’ species susceptible to capture within a fishery <b>resource.</b> <b>Indicator</b> species are determined via information on their (1) inherent vulnerability, i. e. biological attributes; (2) risk to sustainability, i. e. stock status; and (3) management importance, i. e. commercial prominence, social and/or cultural amenity value of the resource. These attributes are used to determine an overall score for each species which is used to identify ‘indicator’ species. The risk status (i. e. current risk) of the indicator species then determines the risk-level for the biological sustainability of the entire fishery resource and thus the level of priority for management, monitoring, assessment and compliance. A range of fishery management regimes are amenable to the indicator species approach, including both effort limited fisheries (e. g. individually transferable effort systems) and output controlled fisheries (e. g. species-specific catch quotas). The indicator species approach has been used and refined for fisheries resources in Western Australia over two decades. This process is now widely understood and accepted by stakeholders, as it focuses fishery dependent- and/or independent-monitoring, biological sampling, stock assessment and compliance priorities, thereby optimising the use of available jurisdictional resources...|$|E
40|$|Many recent patents {{worldwide}} {{address the}} concept of harvesting wind energy from aerodynamic losses in motorways, however the mechanics of a specific device dedicated to the task has never been described. The lack of a characterization of the energy resource likely explains why the international market is still to acknowledge any technology related to the concept. Here, an experimental activity is presented to investigate the flow field generated by traffic in motorways and eventually develop an innovative technology that complies with emerging energy policies. In the case of traffic source, the energetic rationale {{seems to have a}} double motivation: there will always be an optimal energy supply associated with an increment in transport demand and, contrary to other renewables, the transport aerodynamic losses belong to a source of costs, making them a remarkably sustainable energy source. After a thorough analysis of the correlation between truck flow and wind speed classes, the characterization of a <b>resource</b> <b>indicator</b> for time of wind above a cut-in speed is given, with an account for the effects of traffic clusters and traffic related wind-drops. We demonstrate how during weekdays daytime hours the traffic-generated resource can allow an energy conversion beyond a threshold possibly permitting a positive energetic balance of the system. A study on the effect of traffic related wind-drops is also carried out to investigate how the issue could be relevant in the transient behavior and ultimately in the performance of a mini wind turbine in the kW-range.

40|$|Background Prioritization is a {{critical}} factor in the healthcare sector, and it is critical that prioritization be based on relevant criteria which facilitate the comparison of different interventions and health measures. When deciding whether or not to implement new interventions, typically projections of increased costs are weighed against expected benefits of the interventions. This comparison allows the calculation of quality adjusted life year gains, also known as a QALY, as well as the comparison of the new intervention to existing measures or other new interventions, through the current cost per QALY, or through the incremental cost per QALY of additional intervention. Method This thesis is a case study of resource spending on patients recovering from stroke, using length of stay as a <b>resource</b> <b>indicator</b> and 30 -day survival rate as health outcome. We compare all health enterprises and their differences in both length of stay and 30 -day survival rate to determine whether there are any indications of correlation. We seek to answer the question of what the possible health effects would be of increasing length of stay by one day. To measure this, a simple equation was made to help measure the cost of an incremental QALY. Incremental cost per QALY = Incremental cost (Δc) = Cost of increasing one LOS Incremental benefit (Δb) Δp*Δy*Δq In this equation Δp is the increased probability in 30 day survival rate, Δy is the expected life years by surviving a stroke, Δq is the quality of life a stroke survivor has after the stroke. Results A linear regression model of a five year weighted average indicated a correlation of 0. 18 % increase in 30 day survival rate by increasing length of stay by one extra day for all Health Enterprises, resulting in a QALY of 372, 802 NOK (the simulation yielded a 95 % confidence interval of [232, 208 - 656, 220]). Other relevant linear regressions also yielded similar results with different significance. The results also indicated a negative correlation between increasing length of stay and 30 day readmittance rate. While more research would be needed to reach a definitive conclusion, as other factors not taken into account here could possibly affect length of stay or 30 day survival rate, this research indicates that increasing length of stay by a single day could yield a larger benefit than other measures which demand more resources as measured by incremental cost per QALY...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{number of}} defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 patient days {{is often used}} as an {{indicator}} for the selection pressure exerted by antibiotics in the hospital setting. However, this unit of measurement does not fully describe the selection pressure and is sensitive to changes in hospital <b>resource</b> <b>indicators.</b> Additional information is required to facilitate interpretation of this indicator. The number of DDD per 100 admissions could be a valuable additional tool. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the importance of units of measurement in quantifying antibiotic use data with regards to antibiotic resistance risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trends in antibiotic use in acute care Dutch hospitals between 1997 - 2001 were studied. Antibiotic use was expressed in DDD per 100 patient days and in DDD per 100 admissions. RESULTS: From 1997 to 2001, total systemic antibiotic use significantly increased from 47. 2 to 54. 7 DDD per 100 patient days, whereas expressed in DDD per 100 admissions it remained constant. Some individual antibiotics increases in DDD per 100 patient days were not accompanied by increases in DDD per 100 admissions and vice versa. The mean number of total DDD per hospital decreased (not significantly) between 1997 and 2001. The mean number of patient days, admissions and length of stay decreased significantly.
