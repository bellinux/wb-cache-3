40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{influence}} of a defender on the performance of a motor skill from an invasion sport. Design: Highly skilled basketball players performed different variations of basketball shots using a <b>randomised</b> <b>test</b> schedule. Method: Participants completed a total of 30 test trials comprising 6 trials of 5 different shot types in both defended and undefended conditions. Results: The presence of a defender led to significant changes in several behavioral measures including faster shot execution times, longer jump times, and an increase in the amount of time that the ball spent in the air as it travelled to the basket after being released from the shooter's hand. These behavioral changes were accompanied by an overall decline in shooting accuracy of over 20 %. Defended shots also tended to elicit greater amounts of movement variability which, when interpreted in conjunction with the other findings, suggests that participants were attempting to adapt their movements to accommodate for the changing demands of the performance environment. Comparisons across different shot types revealed that the influence of the defender was generally context and task dependent. Conclusions: The results have important implications for representative task design, and highlight how the manipulation of key information sources can have a marked effect upon behavioral responses...|$|E

After inserting the dental implants, peri-implant defects were treated according to the GBR technique using a VN membrane with prolonged resorption time in the <b>randomised</b> <b>test</b> site and a BG membrane in the control site.

RESULTS: A total of 16 patients fulfilled the initial non-surgical inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the study was discontinued early after 9 surgically treated patients because unacceptable safety issues arose and severe infection related to the VN membranes.

The objective was to compare the satiating effect of two isocaloric "solid" preloads containing egg or milk protein (omelette or fresh cheese), and to relate this effect to plasma metabolites and hormones variations. 30 subjects participated to 2 <b>randomised</b> <b>test</b> days, one per preload. On each test day, after consumption of the whole prelaod (322 kcal; 26 g proteins, 21 g lipids, 7. 5 g lactose), their appetite sensations were recorded until they asked for the next meal. The delay between the preload and the next meal {{as well as the}} spontaneous energy intake at the meal were measured. In 10 volunteers, blood samples were taken during the same time in order to measure plasma concentrations of energy metabolites and satiety hormones. The two products displayed no difference for the delay between the preload and the meal, but the omelette reduced significantly the energy intake at the meal by 300 kcal in comparison to the fresh cheese. Subjects reported to feel less hunger with the omelette. GIP and insulin secretions and uremia increased significantly after the fresh cheese but not the omelette, while glucagon and GLP- 1 secretions displayed delayed profiles with the omelette. We conclude that eggs present a more satiating effect than a fresh dairy product {{on the basis of a}} decreased energy intake.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the effect of different liquid preloads made up of proteins, fats or carbohydrates only, under stringently controlled conditions, on satiety. Fifty-six subjects participated in the present study which consisted of four <b>randomised</b> <b>test</b> days, i. e. 1 d per macronutrient and one control day. During each test day, the subjects were required to consume the preload in full, and then their subsequent food intake was measured. The volunteers were divided into two groups: the first (T 0) group, which consumed the preload immediately before lunch, and the second (T 1) group, which consumed it 1 h beforehand. The main results showed that the participants consumed significantly less at lunch following the consumption of all three preloads than on the no-preload day, and consumed less after the consumption of the carbohydrate preload than after the consumption of the lipid preload. When energy from the preload was included, overall energy intake was significantly greater in all the three preload conditions than in the situation involving no preload, with only partial compensation for preload energy in all conditions. Total daily energy intake was highest after the lipid preload ingestion, but this could be a chance finding since it was not significantly higher than that observed after protein or carbohydrate preload ingestion. No significant effects of the interval between the preload and test meal ingestion were found. These results do not confirm the greater satiety effect of proteins than of carbohydrates, but partially confirm the weaker effect of fats...|$|E

40|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} impairs executive function, information processing, visual-spatial perception, psychomotor skills and, importantly, affects clinical performance. Alternating day {{and night}} shifts causes circadian misalignment, compounding these deficits. Risk taking, although causally linked to sleep deprivation, has not been reported in doctors working night shifts. We studied risk taking in 12 healthy junior doctors (below consultant level) working 3 - 4 consecutive 13 h night shifts in neurological and paediatric ICUs. Participants were tested at lunchtime before the first night shift and between 8 : 30 - 10 : 00 am after the last shift. <b>Randomised</b> <b>testing</b> order controlled for practice effects. Eleven participants (9 male); aged 26 - 36 y, completed two computerised tasks at each time point: the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and the Attention network task (ANT). Wilcoxon-signed rank tests in SPSS v 22 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the difference between medians in Confidence Interval Analysis (CIA) software (version 2. 2. 0) {{were used in the}} analysis. The study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee, University of Southampton. Participants showed a significant increase in risk taking on the BART (pre-shift median= 38. 5, post-shift median= 45. 0; difference between medians with 95 % CI= 11. 4 (3. 1 to 20. 9); p= 0. 021). (Figure 1). There were no differences in change in BART scores by gender. There was no significant change in ANT scores (see online supplement, below), noteworthy as attention is sensitive to sleep deprivation, indicating that risk taking may be particularly vulnerable to night shift exposure. What are the professional implications of risk taking? Junior doctors are less risk averse than senior peers and confidence levels in decision-making remain intact during sleep deprivation. Higher levels of risk-taking, without compensatory reduction in confidence, increase the likelihood of clinical error, particularly in an ICU where rapid decisions are necessary. What of the personal consequences? Of 1, 135 UK doctors surveyed online, 41 % of reported falling asleep whilst driving home after a night shift. Junior doctors may suffer double jeopardy on the roads as risk taking behaviours increase vulnerability to road traffic accidents. Risk-taking behaviour in junior doctors after ICU night shifts has potentially serious implications for professional practice and personal wellbeing and deserves further study<br/...|$|R
