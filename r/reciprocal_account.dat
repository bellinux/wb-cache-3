40|$|Parental and {{recombinant}} phage {{production by}} tandem, double lysogens of Corynebacterium diphtheriae was studied in strains {{in which the}} coupling of prophage markers and the order of prophage was established. The results from studies of mass lysates and single bursts showed that the recombinant class of phage, designated R 1, was predominant in UV-induced lysates followed by the parental, P 1 class {{and to a lesser}} extent the P 2 and R 2 classes. Single bursts of UV-treated cells contained phage from one to all four of the phage classes, and this appeared to reflect the action of two excision processes. The data indicate that recombinant phages R 1 and R 2 are formed by a process of general recombinational excision and that this is the primary event leading to phage production in both UV-irradiated and spontaneously induced double lysogens. This process, which depends on exchange between homologous genes and is <b>reciprocal,</b> <b>accounts</b> for the excision of R 1 phage from the host chromosome. A second excision process, probably site-specific excision, also occurs in many of the same cells and accounts for the excision of P 1, P 2, and R 2 phages. The significance of these results for the spread of toxinogenicity in strains of C. diphtheriae is discussed...|$|R

Fitting our model to experimental data we find that institutions influence social preferences.

When fines are rejected, internalization of a social norm explains the increased cooperation; violations (accidental or not), coupled with <b>reciprocal</b> preferences, <b>account</b> for the erosion.

While it seems fairly clear that neuropeptides are involved in the process of interneuronal communication, their specific role appears to be different from that of classic transmitters (which include dopamine). Neuropeptides coexist with dopamine in specific dopamine-containing neurons; in addition they interact abundantly with the dopaminergic neurons, by acting either on the perikarya or on the dopaminergic nerve terminals. Such interactions are <b>reciprocal</b> and <b>account</b> for some behavioral correlates of neuropeptide and dopamine alterations in the brain.

40|$|Flow {{of funds}} data {{are used to}} compare methods of finance in 5 {{countries}} over the period 1970 to 1985.

Corrections for inflation are provided by employing flow rather than stock figures and using own aggregation procedures to derive stock measures. Significant variations in financing emerge. These are not readily explained by traditional descriptions of corporate finance, in particular taxation. As an alternative, the paper suggests that relationships between borrowers and lenders establish forms of commitment that are conducive to the provision of long term finance. The separation between investment and finance, which has been the starting point of corporate finance theory, is untenable in a multiperiod context in which terms of finance define future allocation of control...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} studies {{proposed}} abstract models of social media and investigated their properties. Anderson [19] proposed a game theoretic approach aimed at understanding how social media emerge as a driving force in contemporary marketing and how this would affect future marketing. Toriumi et al. [8] revealed that SNSs have similar properties to public goods games, but they correspond to the dual part of the meta-norms game [20] because SNSs seem to lack a means of punishing non-cooperators and only give (psychological) rewards to cooperators. Their model includes two games, the rewards game (RG) and the meta-rewards game (MRG), and they indicated that meta-rewards facilitate cooperation, resulting in active use of an SNS. Hirahara et al. [9, 10] subsequently extended this model to the SNS-norms game that includes {{the characteristics of the}} interaction patterns in SNSs. They ran this game in a variety of complex networks and found that users at network hubs facilitate posting articles to some degree even if no meta-reward is provided.

40|$|There {{are several}} aspects of perceptual {{processing}} that were identified by Gestalt theory which remain as mysterious today computationally as they were when originally identified decades ago. These phenomena include emergence, reification or filling-in, and amodal perception. Much of the difficulty in characterizing these aspects of perceptual phenomena stems from the contemporary practice of modeling perceptual phenomena in neural network terms, even though the mapping between perception and neurophysiology remains to be identified. In fact, the reason why those particular aspects of perception have received less attention is exactly because they are particularly difficult to express in neural network terms. An alternative perceptual modeling approach is proposed, in which computational models are designed to model the percept as it is experienced subjectively, {{as opposed to the}} neurophysiological mechanism by which that percept is supposedly subserved. This allows the modeling to be conducted independent of any assumptions about the neurophysiological mechanism of vision. Illusory phenomena such as the Kanizsa figure can thereby be modeled as a computational transformation from the information present in the visual stimulus, to the information apparent in the subjective percept. This approach suggests a multi-level processing model with <b>reciprocal</b> feedback, to <b>account</b> for the observed properties of Gestalt illusions. In the second paper of this series the modeling is extended to focus on more subtle second order phenomena of illusory contour completion...|$|R

40|$|In genetic crosses, HC-toxin {{production}} in the filamentous fungus Cochliobolus carbonum appears {{to be controlled by}} a single locus, TOX 2. At the molecular level, TOX 2 is composed of at least seven duplicated and coregulated genes involved in HC-toxin biosynthesis, export, and regulation. All copies of four of the TOX 2 genes were previously mapped within a 540 -kb stretch of DNA in strain SB 111. Subsequently, an additional three TOX 2 genes, TOXE, TOXF, and TOXG, have been discovered. In this paper we have mapped all copies of the new genes, a total of seven, and show that except for one of the two copies of TOXE, which was previously shown to be on a chromosome of 0. 7 Mb in strain SB 111, they are all linked to the previously known TOX 2 genes within; 600 kb of each other on a chromosome of 3. 5 Mb. We show here that this chromosome also contains at least one non-TOX 2 gene, EXG 2, which encodes an exo-b 1, 3 -glucanase.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} how and why {{management}} accounting practices are linked to an organization's identity and identity discrepancies. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative field study of a one-year change project in a large manufacturing company is {{used as the basis}} for the analysis. Findings – The empirical study reveals how discrepancies between organizational members' perceived identity and their construed external (and desired future) image both influence and are influenced by emergent accounting practices. Empirical evidence suggests such a <b>reciprocal</b> relationship between <b>accounting</b> and identity, since accounting practices are an important means of (de) legitimizing an organization's current self-perception. Research limitations/implications – The uncovered reciprocal relationship between management accounting practices and organizational identity (discrepancies) have implications for a broader literature, including the works on how different forms of control interact as a “control package” and the discourse on potential sources of organizational identity change. Originality/value – Although it has previously been suggested that management accounting may be an important means for, as well as an outcome of, processes of identity (re) constructions in organizations, this study suggests a more complex interplay than has previously been noted in the literature. Specifically, it was found that organizational identity may for a considerable time work as a highly influential and largely unquestioned categorical imperative, signifying the boundaries of appropriate organizational action. At times, however, accounting practices may spark (re) constructions of identity discrepancies through: providing identity-inconsistent evidence; and using (new) measures in a “feed-forward” manner to explore possible ways to close such perceived discrepancies.

40|$|In my {{research}} project, I aim {{to explore the}} relationship between perceived employability (PE; i. e. the belief about the likelihood of obtaining and maintaining employment) and work-related learning (WRL). The importance of WRL and PE comes to the fore for both organisations and individuals. For example, WRL is crucial {{for the maintenance of}} organizational competitiveness in today’s economy. Also for employees, WRL {{can be seen as a}} way to secure employment within and across organizations. This project seeks to enhance insight into this relationship by achieving three aims. First, next to exploring the influence of WRL on PE, we will also take the <b>reciprocal</b> relationship into <b>account.</b> Although the relationship between WRL and PE seems obvious, research about this relationship and its directionality is scarce and theories are conflicting. On the one hand, in line with the Conservation of Resources Theory (Hobfoll, 1989), graduates experiencing high PE might want to invest more in their PE by participating in WRL, which may, in turn, increase their PE. On the other hand, Powers’ Control Theory (1973) predicts the opposite effect. High PE graduates might feel employable enough, so they invest less in WRL, potentially leading to a reduction of their PE. A low PE might, in turn, lead to more participation in WRL in order to restore their PE. Second, we conduct this research among vocational and technical graduates. Particularly lower educated individuals may benefit from investing in WRL as they already hold a vulnerable position in today’s knowledge-based economy. Third, we will contribute to the PE and WRL literature by sharpening these concepts. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Heim, Lasnik, and May (1991 a, {{henceforth}} HLMa) note {{an interesting}} contrast {{in the behavior}} of the following sentences in English (their 78 a -b) : 1. a) They look like each other. b) They look alike. As HLMa point out, when embedded, the two sentences have distinct properties (their 79 a -b) : 2. a) John and Mary think they look like each other. b) John and Mary think they look alike. Sentence (2 a) is ambiguous between broad and narrow scope interpretations. Thus, (2 a) can either mean 'John thinks he looks like Mary, and Mary thinks that she looks like John' (the broad reading) or 'John and Mary think they (John and Mary) look like each other' (the narrow reading). In contrast, (2 b) can only be construed with narrow scope. For HLMa the ambiguity of (2 a) receives an explanation in terms of the morphological complexity of the reciprocal expression each other. Specifically, the quantificational distribution element each is adjoined to an antecedent, which is then subject to QR via the rule move-α at logical form (see May 1977, 1985). Put simply, this allows for different scope interpretations, depending on how far up the phrase marker each is moved. In contrast, the morphologically simplex alike contains no detachable distribution element, and, as a result, only the narrow scope reading is available. Of interest here is the fact that HLMa base their argument on the distinction between reciprocal meaning that is incorporated within a morphologically simplex versus a morphologically complex item. In support of this claim, they offer the following minimal pair of sentences from Italian (attributed to Luigi Rizzi) : 3. a) I due pensano [di essersi battuti] (contradictory); the two thought be-each other-clitic beaten b) I due pensano [di avere prevalso l'uno sull'altro] (ambiguous); the two thought have prevailed the one over the other HLMa note that when taken by themselves, the embedded clauses in (3 a -b) are both contradictory, but that only (3 b) receives a non -contradictory reading in the embedded construction. In a manner analogous to their treatment of the English data in (1 - 2), HLMa claim that this distinction is attributable {{to the fact that the}} clitic in (3 a) forms a morphological unit with the verb to which it is attached and, thus, cannot be moved at LF. In contrast, they follow Belletti (1982) in arguing that the full form of the Italian reciprocal l'uno [...] . l'altro includes a distributor l'uno which can be detached and moved at LF. Though no specific analysis is provided, it is assumed that the broad scope, and hence non -contradictory, construal of (3 b) is attributable to the adjunction of the distributor l'uno to the antecedent I due. With these facts in mind, I consider the question of scope in Spanish reciprocal constructions. In sections 2 and 3, I present a surprising scope asymmetry between non -full (clitic) and full reciprocal constructions, which indicates that unlike English, the full reciprocal el uno al otro in Spanish does not allow for broad scope interpretations when embedded. In section 4, I argue that el uno al otro in Spanish is best analyzed as an adjunct, rather than as the subcategorized argument of the verb. And in section 5, I explore HLM's (1991 b) "each-binding" variant of the movement analysis proposed in HLMa, showing that the asymmetry between full and non -full <b>reciprocals</b> can be <b>accounted</b> for in terms of the obligatory local A'-binding of the variable el uno of the adjoined full form. In section 6, I expand the data, providing evidence of another scope asymmetry. Specifically, I show that in contrast to the el uno al otro adjunct of the clitic doubled construction, VP adjuncts such as prepositional phrases with a reciprocal object do allow broad construals from embedded clauses. I argue that this asymmetry motivates the need to formally distinguish between at least two types of adjuncts, appositional adjuncts such as the doubled el uno al otro construction, and standard adjuncts such as PPs. I suggest that a profitable way of making this distinction can be found in restricting the assignment of referential indexes in the Relativized Minimality framework (Rizzi 1990). This approach both preserves the account of the asymmetry between non-full or clitic reciprocals and their doubled counterparts, as allows for broad construals from standard adjuncts...|$|R
