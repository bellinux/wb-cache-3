25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} arrangements to build a deposition chamber for PLD. The target material which is evaporated by the laser is normally found as a rotating disc attached to a support. However, {{it can also be}} sintered into a cylindrical rod with rotational motion and a translational up and down movement along its axis. This special configuration allows not only the utilization of a synchronized <b>reactive</b> <b>gas</b> pulse but also of a multicomponent target rod with which films of different multilayers can be created.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{refractory}} oxides and carbides undergo fragmentation {{during their}} evaporation by the electron beam, {{resulting in a}} stoichiometry {{that is different from}} the initial material. For example, alumina, when evaporated by electron beam, dissociates into aluminum, AlO3 and Al2O. Some refractory carbides like silicon carbide and tungsten carbide decompose upon heating, and the dissociated elements have different volatilities. These compounds can be deposited on the substrate either by reactive evaporation or by co-evaporation. In the reactive evaporation process, the metal is evaporated from the ingot by the electron beam. The vapors are carried by the <b>reactive</b> <b>gas,</b> which is oxygen in case of metal oxides or acetylene in case of metal carbides. When the thermodynamic conditions are met, the vapors react with the gas {{in the vicinity of the}} substrate to form films. Metal carbide films can also be deposited by co-evaporation. In this process, two ingots are used, one for metal and the other for carbon. Each ingot is heated with a different beam energy so that their evaporation rate can be controlled. As the vapors arrive at the surface, they chemically combine under proper thermodynamic conditions to form a metal carbide film.|$|E
2500|$|John Bernadou {{patented}} a single-base propellant {{while working}} at the Naval Torpedo Station in 1897. Bernadou's colloid of nitrocellulose with ether and alcohol was formulated for the reaction pressures generated within naval artillery. The colloid was extruded in dense cylinders with longitudinal perforations to decompose in accordance with Piobert's law. If all external surfaces of the grain are ignited simultaneously, the grain reacts inward from {{the outside of the}} cylinder (creating a reaction area of decreasing size), and outward from each perforation (creating a reaction area of increasing size.) Propellant decomposition is initiated by heat causing the colloid to melt and form bubbles of <b>reactive</b> <b>gas</b> which decompose in a luminous exothermic reaction after the bubbles burst. [...] Rate of reaction is controlled by heat transfer through the temperature gradient from the luminous reacting gas through the bubbles to the intact colloid. Heat transfer (and rate of reaction) is faster if the bubbles are under pressure, because heat transfer is more efficient through smaller bubbles. These propellants may not react satisfactorily at low pressures within the oxygen-deficient atmosphere of a gun barrel.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFormation of dust {{particles}} in a plasma {{can be the}} consequence of two mechanisms: the presence of <b>reactive</b> <b>gases</b> (for example silane, methane or acetylene), or the sputtering of surfaces exposed to the plasma. This sputtering induces the ejection {{from the surface of}} either small solid particles or molecules that behave like <b>reactive</b> <b>gases</b> in the plasma phase.

40|$|The {{influence}} of varying nitrogen and oxygen partial pressures on microstructure, mechanical and optical properties of magnetron sputtered CrAlSiNx and CrAlSiOyNx coatings has been studied. The partial pressure of nitrogen reactive gaswas varied from 0. 037 Pa to 0. 15 Pa for CrAlSiNx films, and the N 2 /O 2 (85 %: 15 %) partial pressure was varied from 0. 046 Pa to 0. 21 Pa for CrAlSiOyNx layers. Transmittance and reflectance of samples were measured and were modeled {{to obtain the}} spectral optical constants, n and k. Chemical state, composition, morphology and microstructure of films were analyzed by XPS, RBS, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy and SEM. Films' hardness was evaluated using nanoindentation method. XRD results revealed that the two samples CrAlSiNx with PN = 0. 15 Pa and CrAlSiOyNx with PNO = 0. 21 Pa are polycrystalline with cubic (fcc-B 1) structure. On contrary, all other films prepared with lower <b>reactive</b> <b>gases</b> partial pressures are amorphous. The chemical composition changed with the variation of <b>reactive</b> <b>gases</b> partial pressure, although the Cr: Al: Si composition ratio remained approximately constant, 1. 25 : 1. 5 : 1. All samples showed low hardness, mainly due to lower content of <b>reactive</b> <b>gases</b> and higher content of Si. However, the sample CrAlSiNx with PN = 0. 15 Pa has the highest value of 11. 1 GPa. Optical constants are seen to be very sensitive to <b>reactive</b> <b>gases</b> partial pressure.
