Nourabad {{and some of the}} {{fishermen}} enter to report that the funeral pyre is <b>ready.</b> <b>As</b> Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and <b>ready,</b> <b>as</b> is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{army was}} not <b>ready</b> <b>as</b> {{of the summer}} of 1815, delaying the crossing.

Buenos Aires did not send more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Martín proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, if they would support the campaign. San Martín and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director Antonio González de Balcarce the full military plan of operations.|$|E

5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but when considering Hancock's findings in September 1963 it {{wanted to be able to}} offer a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was <b>ready</b> <b>as</b> unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E
5|$|No. 12 Squadron was {{the first}} Vengeance-equipped RAAF unit to see combat. After {{converting}} to the dive bomber, the squadron was used on routine patrol and search-and-rescue tasks {{off the coast of}} the Northern Territory. On 18 June 1943, twelve Vengeances from the squadron, escorted by six No. 31 Squadron Bristol Beaufighters, were dispatched to attack two villages on Selaru island in the occupied Netherlands East Indies that were believed to be housing workers engaged in constructing an airfield. This operation was successful, and all the dive bombers returned to base. In July 1943 the squadron began moving from Darwin to Merauke in Netherlands New Guinea, where it was to operate as part of No. 72 Wing. A party of 270 ground crew arrived at Merauke early that month, but little of the infrastructure needed to support the unit's aircraft was <b>ready.</b> <b>As</b> a result, No. 12 Squadron's Vengeances and air crew were stationed at Cooktown, Queensland, from where they conducted anti-submarine patrols and escorted shipping. The aircraft were redeployed to Merauke over the course of September, and began regular patrol duties on the 28th of the month. No. 12 Squadron's only combat during this deployment occurred on 9 October 1943, when a Vengeance exchanged machine-gun fire with a Japanese Aichi E13A reconnaissance aircraft. The Vengeances proved unsuited to the maritime patrol tasks they were assigned while at Cooktown and Merauke.|$|E

25|$|After the Italian {{government}} had signed an armistice, the Italian garrisons {{on most of}} the Dodecanese either wanted to change sides and fight alongside the Allies or just return to their homes.

25|$|According to widely {{accepted}} local and family tradition, Anna Strong's {{role in the}} ring was to signal Brewster that a message was <b>ready,</b> <b>as</b> he ran regular trips with whaleboats across the Sound {{on a variety of}} smuggling and military missions. She did this by hanging a black petticoat on her clothesline at Strong Point in Setauket, which was easily visible by Brewster from a boat in the Sound and by Woodhull from his nearby farm after he began to operate almost exclusively from home. She would add a number of handkerchiefs for one of six coves where Brewster would bring his boat and Woodhull would meet him. Historian Richard Welch writes that the tradition of the clothesline signal is unverifiable, but it is known that the British suspected a woman of disloyal activities at Setauket who fit Anna's profile.|$|E

25|$|The Flamingo {{opened on}} December 26, 1946, {{at which time}} only the casino, lounge, theater, and {{restaurant}} were finished. Although locals attended the opening, few celebrities materialized. A handful drove in from Los Angeles despite bad weather.

The desert's first air conditioning collapsed regularly.

25|$|After {{she almost}} kisses Alfie, Kat nearly has sex with Max, but regrets it {{and goes to}} Alfie for comfort. The next day, she tells Alfie {{that she wants to}} get back {{together}} with him, but he tells her that he is not <b>ready</b> <b>as</b> {{he does not want to}} hurt her again. This causes Kat to reevaluate her life, so she visits the convent where she gave birth to Zoe to seek some answers, though it is now a nun's care home. A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), remembers her going into labour and they talk about the past and the future. Kat then leaves and goes to the police station to make a statement about Harry. Ruth checks their records and discovers that Kat also gave birth to a son. Later, a content Kat returns to Walford and tells Stacey and Alfie that she has finally made her peace with the past and is no longer willing to let Harry control her.|$|E
25|$|Jules Jeanneney and Edouard Herriot, Presidents {{respectively}} of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, urged Lebrun to reappoint Reynaud as Prime Minister (all {{four men}} {{wanted to continue}} the war from North Africa). Lebrun felt he {{had little choice but}} to appoint Pétain, who already had a ministerial team <b>ready,</b> <b>as</b> Prime Minister. Pétain became the leader of the new government (the last one of the Third Republic), and signed the armistice on 22 June. De Gaulle had returned to Bordeaux at around 10pm on 16 June. He visited Reynaud, who still hoped to go to North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day, and made money available to de Gaulle. De Gaulle flew to London with Edward Spears at 9 am on 17 June, and the next day made his famous broadcast announcing that he would fight on. It has been suggested that Reynaud had ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} constituent of the Royalist {{strength was}} tactical air power. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), backed by an all out effort by their Air Commando advisers, doubled their daily sortie rate to 44. 7th Air Force (7th AF) committed 48 daily sorties, with 12 more held <b>ready</b> <b>as</b> a quick reaction force. This {{was a sharp}} contrast to the 200 sorties per day of U.S. tactical air that had been available just a few months prior during Kou Kiet. There was a concerted effort to more efficiently use such U.S. air power as was received. For air strike control, the U.S. Air Attaché promulgated a designated battle area (DBA) containing the Communist units threatening Long Tieng. The main Communist gun parks and troop staging areas could be bombed by jets using all-weather methods under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) in certain areas. Communist bases on the Plain of Jars, down to Ban Ban, and east along Route 7 to the North Vietnamese border were free fire zones. All other air strikes would be under the existing rules of engagement, which included targets being acquired, marked and directed by Raven Forward Air Controllers operating from Long Tieng's 20 Alternate airfield.|$|E
