5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; <b>rather,</b> <b>they</b> bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E

5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; <b>rather,</b> <b>they</b> can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to such examples, creationists specify that they are objecting only to macroevolution, not microevolution: most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in dog breeding. <b>Rather,</b> <b>they</b> dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes {{over long periods of}} time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} heavy product placement, with American Airlines, Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels all featured prominently. Competing brands {{are displayed}} as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms in dialogue. However, the brands {{did not pay}} for the exposure; <b>rather,</b> <b>they</b> waived the fees for the producers to shoot on location, such as at AA's airport areas and inside Hilton hotels. Reitman expressed his desire to use actual brands as he finds them less distracting.|$|E

These range from simple {{exercise}} (such as jumping as high {{out of the water}} as possible with two hands) to drills not specifically used in water polo; <b>rather</b> <b>they</b> are used to improve the goalkeeper's core muscles (such as catching a ball dropped from the side into the water).|$|E

30|$|Design & methods: We sent 1, 300 {{questionnaires}} by email for all {{the participants}} to courses at the EITS (European Institute for Telesurgery) during 2007. The questionnaire consisted of 21 questions about the EITS course and WeBSurg (World electronic Book of Surgery) site (which is an e-learning example). Participants answer each question according if they totally do not agree, <b>they</b> <b>rather</b> do not agree, they do not agree but do not disagree, <b>they</b> <b>rather</b> agree or <b>they</b> totally agree.|$|R

The entryway just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record of the members of the order.|$|E
5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. <b>Rather,</b> <b>they</b> are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. <b>Rather,</b> <b>they</b> suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. <b>Rather,</b> <b>they</b> are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. <b>Rather,</b> <b>they</b> saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sana, {{as well as}} Operation Maestral 2, {{were crucial}} in {{applying}} pressure on the VRS in the final weeks of the Bosnian War. A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effects of Operation Deliberate Force, Sana and Maestral 2 on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units, <b>rather</b> <b>they</b> targeted the command and control infrastructure of the Bosnian Serb military. The analysis concluded that, while NATO degraded {{the capabilities of the}} VRS, the final HV, HVO and ARBiH offensives inflicted the most damage. It further noted that those offensives, rather than the NATO bombing, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war. Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV, HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had NATO not intervened and denied the VRS its long-range communications.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to Henry's {{religious}} policies {{was quickly}} suppressed in England. A number of dissenting monks, {{including the first}} Carthusian Martyrs, were executed and many more pilloried. The most prominent resisters included John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, both of whom refused to take the oath to the King. Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought to have the men executed; <b>rather,</b> <b>they</b> hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as supreme head of the Church, but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the Treason Act, which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however – More on the evidence of a single conversation with Richard Rich, the Solicitor General. Both were duly executed {{in the summer of}} 1535.|$|E
5|$|The Russian system {{differed}} from the British and American systems in its relationship with indigenous peoples. Using the same method they had used in Siberia, the Russians employed or enserfed Aleut and Alutiiq people, the latter being a subgroup of the Yupik Eskimo people. The Aleut and Alutiiq people were expert sea otter hunters, noted for their use of kayaks and baidarkas. Russian ships were mainly used for transporting and assisting native hunting parties. This {{differed from}} the British and American system, where the natives hunted sea otters and prepared the furs on their own, and were essentially independent agents of the fur trade. The Russians did not trade freely with the native Alaskans; <b>rather,</b> <b>they</b> imposed a fur tribute known as yasak. The yasak system, which was widely used in Siberia, essentially enslaved the natives. In 1788, it was banned in Russian America, only {{to be replaced by}} compulsory labor.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, <b>rather</b> <b>they</b> continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed at Krečane were left unburied for two weeks. Some {{of the victims were}} not {{immediately}} killed, <b>rather</b> <b>they</b> took days to die and people living on the opposite bank of the Una River in Bosnia and Herzegovina claim that they heard cries for help for days after the killings took place. After two weeks, most of the bodies were bulldozed into a shallow grave {{on the bank of the}} river, and the rest thrown into the Una. The grave was located sufficiently close to the river to allow the current to wash at least some of the bodies away.|$|E
5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, <b>rather</b> <b>they</b> should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.|$|E
5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. <b>Rather,</b> <b>they</b> simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
