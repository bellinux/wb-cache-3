5000|$|A Sou'wester is a {{traditional}} form of collapsible oilskin <b>rain</b> <b>hat</b> that is longer in the back than the front to protect the neck fully. [...] A gutter front brim is sometimes featured. A possible theory for the derivation of the name is {{to do with the}} Sou'wester wind which is the prevailing wind in the seas around the UK. A Sou'west wind tends to bring warm air containing moisture, thus rain. A fishing net would always be brought up in the lee of the wind so that a fisherman facing the net would have his back to the wind and without a hat the rain would be driven down the fisherman's neck, above his oilskin jacket. A Sou'wester hat has a roll up brim at the front which works like a gutter whilst keeping the face clear. The hat extends down the back, bridging and protecting the neck. Sou'wester hats were popular to dress small boys in during the 1950s in Britain.|$|E

It then moves into a sequence of her first driving {{down one of the}} hilly streets of the city, followed by general shots of the city (some including Doris), then the cast credits, where Buck and the boys are shown in an outdoor farm environment (Lord Nelson is no longer included), while the Today's World staff members are seen in the office. The opening credits do not include Smith, despite he being a frequent cast member this season. The opening sequence ends with Doris as a pedestrian out on the city streets supposedly rushing off to work. This is interspersed with a sequence of Doris getting off a San Francisco cable car followed by her hopping across an intersection crosswalk (the cable car and hopping sequence is not part of this specific commute as she is wearing a red raincoat during it instead).|$|E
5000|$|Gary Barkovitch (#5) -- Barkovitch is from Washington DC. He is {{described}} as being olive-skinned and dark-haired and wears a yellow <b>rain</b> <b>hat</b> multiple times during the book. He cements himself as a loud-mouth Walker whom everyone hopes to outlast. He first provokes another boy named Rank, leading to an altercation resulting in Rank's death. Because of this, the other Walkers turn against Barkovitch and refer to him as [...] "killer". McVries states several times that his only goal {{in life is to}} outlast Barkovitch. McVries despises Barkovitch, but Garraty is willing to give him a chance later in the novel as he (Barkovitch) begins to lose his mind. Barkovitch admits that he wishes he had friends, and that he just doesn't know how to act any other way. Then he agrees to help donate some of the winning proceeds to Scramm's young wife. Later, he reverts to his previous demeanor and hassles the other Walkers. The others realize that Barkovitch has finally lost his mind, the intensity of the Walk being too much for him. At some point during the night, several shots are heard, and a walker (Pearson) wonders if it is Barkovitch who has been killed. Barkovitch, however, yells {{from the back of the}} crowd he's not finished yet. He then screams in agony and tears out his own throat, thereby denying the soldiers their chance to kill him, even though they shoot him anyway in what can be little more than a symbolic gesture.|$|E
50|$|At {{the right}} time of year, the bark is easily removed from live trees in long strips. It is {{harvested}} for use in making mats, rope and cordage, basketry, <b>rain</b> <b>hats,</b> clothing, and other soft goods. The harvesting of bark must be done with care because, if the tree is completely stripped, it will die. To prevent this, the harvester usually only harvests from trees which have not been stripped before. After harvesting the tree is not used for bark again, although it may later be felled for wood. Stripping bark is usually started {{with a series of}} cuts {{at the base of the}} tree above any buttresses, after which the bark is peeled upwards. To remove bark high up, a pair of platforms strung on rope around the tree are used and the harvester climbs by alternating between them for support. Since redcedars lose their lower branches as all tall trees do in the rainforest, the harvester may climb 10 m or more into the tree by this method. The harvested bark is folded and carried in backpacks. It can be stored for quite some time as mold does not grow on it, and is moistened before unfolding and working. It is then split lengthwise into the required width and woven or twisted into shape. Bark harvesting was mostly done by women, despite the danger of climbing 10 meters in the air, because they were the primary makers of bark goods.|$|R

And then Ordonez did a great thing. Four times he stood forth, and four times, at the first attempt, he stuck in the banderillos, so that eight of them, well placed, stood {{out of the back}} of the bull at one time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} dress and {{accessories}} of the Indians on the Pacific Northwest Coast at the time contact with white man was made, and during the period following contact, until cultural disintegration was complete. Information was obtained from historic accounts by early explorers, and books written by anthropologists. Examination of items in the Portland Art Museum, The Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum, and Victoria Provincial Museum provided necessary association with the clothing and accessories worn at the time. Several conversations with Dr. Erna Gunther were of invaluable assistance. A study of clothing and accessories has value as it is related to the cultural achievements of the people, for viewed in isolation, these items played only a minor role in the total cultural development. Consequently, this study has been correlated to the history, religion, social structure, artistic accomplishments, and aspects of daily living of the Pacific Northwest Coast peoples. Shredded cedarbark clothing was worn by the Indians on the Pacific Northwest Coast from the Columbia River area to Alaska. These garments were mainly conical flaring capes for both sexes, or dresses and aprons for the women, and finely-woven <b>rain</b> <b>hats.</b> Fur robes, worn mainly by the northerners, and skin clothing by the mainland groups, were a part of the clothing pattern. Dentalia, abalone, copper, iron, and other materials were worn both for personal ornaments and for decoration on garments. Dress for ceremonial occasions was more elaborate, that of the chiefs with the Chilkat blanket, ornate headdress, and other clothing items, designed to command respect and indicate rank. The "button" blanket and dance shirt were developments of the Indian's clothing resulting from the use of goods brought by traders. Pacific Northwest Coast art was revealed in all aspects of the Indians' daily lives. Closely related to nature, the art was encouraged by the Indian's religious beliefs and system of social organization. Influence of the white man's culture at first spurred the Indian to achieve new heights in cultural attainment. A brief period of cultural glory was followed by cultural disintegration when the Indian was unable to adapt to the new system imposed by the white man...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Native American {{culture in}} many parts of California is {{preserved}} in fragmentary oral and conventional written histories, but also in sometimes dramatic petroglyphs and pictographs throughout the state. The symbolism of these images has been interpreted to reflect the natural environment, in particular issues related to rain. Although there is little doubt <b>hat</b> <b>rain</b> was of para-mount concern to native tribes. I suggest that geological context also {{played an important role in}} shaping early spiritual beliefs in general, and petroglyph sites in particular. F om the standpoint of Native American philosophies and spiritual beliefs, geological unrest is not merely a reflection but in some cases anactual embodiment of the spiritual world. To understand the significance of pet-roglyph sites, they must be considered in the context of overall Native American beliefs. In this context, sites of repeated geological unrest would invariably have evolved great spiritual signifi-cance. Petroglyph locations and ages may thus provide independent age controls on 'prehistoric' earthquakes in California.

5000|$|William C. Sturtevant {{wrote about}} the Nootka in [...] "Handbook of North American Indians: Northwest Xoast":"Kinship and {{hereditary}} rank were fundamental {{in the organization of}} Nootkan society. Kinship terminology is lineal in parents' generation and Hawaiian in ego's generation, consistent with ambilineal descent and the option to shift residence. The generations are consistently distinguished, and within ego's generation, senior and junior lines are distinguished. Parents' older and younger siblings' children are called by the terms used for own older and younger siblings, and the distinction continues in subsequent generations, so that an old man might call a boy 'older brother' if the boy's grandparent was the older sibling of his own grandparent. This usage is consistent with the importance of primogeniture. Brother and sister treated one another with reserve, especially while unmarried. Those called brother and sister could not marry, even if remote cousins, but if kinship was so remote that links could not be traced it was possible [...] "to marry one's own", usually to get back hereditary rights that had left a descent line. Parent-child relations were close, and grandparent-grandchild especially close, as children often stayed with grandparents. Aunts and uncles were like parents, and one helped oneself to their things without asking. With parents-in-law there was great familiarity. Step-father and step-daughter kept their distance. Descent was ambilateral and kinship traced in any line allowed an individual to claim membership in more than one local group. Residence with a given group activated membership in it as a kinsman, and while there the individual gave it his loyalty and participated in its activities. Although residence was mainly patrilocal, in the long run there was no set rule. People were constantly moving between groups. Rank was closely linked with kinship, positions, such as chief, being inherited by primogeniture. A chief (the native term, hawii, also means 'wealthy upper class') was simply the highest-ranking member of a kin group of whatever level. Rank was founded on inherited rights called tupa'ti, thought of as property, which governed the ownership and use of practically everything of value. Tupa'ti, depending on their nature, could be inherited by an eldest son, shared by several children, held by an eldest daughter until her marriage and then transferred to her brother, or given to a son-in-law as common alternatives. There was a sense of patrimony of rights in a local group to be kept as intact as possible as it passed down through successive chiefs. The inheritance of tupa'ti tended to be through males. Over generations a number of descent lines developed in a group in a ranked relationship made explicit at feasts and potlatches in the order of seating, serving, and gift receiving. Rank was also constantly embodied in the place occupied in the big house. The top chief and house owner occupied the right rear (right for one facing the entrance), the next in rank, a brother or other close kinsman, the left rear. In between might be the head's married sons. Left and right front corners belonged to the third and fourth ranked. Middle sides could be for fifth and sixth ranked. Such interior locations were hereditarily owned. By the entrance were the slaves, mostly war captives, who were significant as trade objects, protective attendants, and even sacrificial victims. Commoners (were either those living with a chief, often quite close relatives, or less definitely associated transients along the sides. They always belonged to some chief who addressed them as kin. Even secondary chiefs were mascim (commoner) to a head chief. Although rank was graded continuously, an upper stratum could be distinguished consisting of indisputable chiefs with potlacht seats and titles to resource sites plus closely associated supporters, generally immediate relatives. Chiefs were the nuclei of Nootkan society; they owned practically everything and ideally did not work but directed followers. A chief and his family wore richer dress, abalone and dentallum ornaments, sea otter or fur-trimmed robes, and decorated <b>rain</b> <b>hats</b> and owned powerful symbols. For the use of resource sites the chief collected a tribute in kind, of no fixed amount, with which he could give a feast. However, big sea or land mammals belomged to the hunter who gave a feast with his catch. A chief's sons and younger brothers were subsidiary chiefs, war chiefs, and speakers, but the eldest son nominally took the top position while still a youth to ensure succession, the father continuing to actually run affairs. Some younger brothers of chiefs became independent chiefs through conquest of other groups. Other avenues to chiefship were potlatching or marriage to a woman of high rank. A chief and his more distantly related commoners were interdependent, the maintenance of his high standing resting on the support of the commoners, who in return had their children named ceremonially, were assisted in marriages, often lent privileges for social use and even granted minor rights. The chief of a group was regarded as a father looking after his children, authoritarian but beneficent".Irving Goldman thought that the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast could be related to the Polynesians. He wrote:"For reasons that remain to be discovered, the Indian tribes of this area Coast share formal principles of rank, lineage, and kinship with Pacific islanders. The Kwakiutl, especially, seem very close to what I have designated as the [...] "traditional" [...] Polynesian society. They share with Polynesians a status system of graded hereditary ranking of individuals and of lineages; a social class system of chiefs ("nobles"), commoners, and slaves; concepts of primogeniture and seniority of descent lines; a concept of abstract supernatural powers as special attributes of chiefs; and a lineage system that leans toward patriliny, but acknowledges the maternal lines as well. Finally, Kwakiutl and eastern Polynesians, especially, associate ambiguity of lineage membership with [...] "Hawaiian" [...] type kinship, a fully classificatory system that does not distinguish between maternal and paternal sides, or between siblings and cousins".Ranking by matrilineal primogeniture (the nephews of a man by an elder sister rank higher than his nephews by a younger sister) prevailed among the Natchez.|$|R
