40|$|Background: For {{reliable}} assessment of ventilation inhomogeneity, multiple-breath washout (MBW) systems should be realistically validated. We describe a new lung model for in vitro validation under physiological {{conditions and the}} assessment of a new nitrogen (N 2) MBW system. Methods: The N 2 MBW setup indirectly measures the N 2 fraction (FN 2) from main-stream carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sidestream oxygen (O 2) signals: FN 2 = 12 FO 22 FCO 22 FArgon. For in vitro N 2 MBW, a double chamber plastic lung model was filled with water, heated to 37 uC, and ventilated at various lung volumes, <b>respiratory</b> <b>rates,</b> and <b>F</b> CO 2. In vivo N 2 MBW was undertaken in triplets on two occasions in 30 healthy adults. Primary N 2 MBW outcome was functional residual capacity (FRC). We assessed in vitro error (![difference] 2) between measured and model FRC (100 – 4174 mL), and error between tests of in vivo FRC, lung clearance index (LCI), and normalized phase III slope indices (S acin and S cond). Results: The model generated 145 FRCs under BTPS conditions and various breathing patterns. Mean (SD) error was 2. 3 (1. 7) %. In 500 to 4174 mL FRCs, 121 (98 %) of FRCs were within 5 %. In 100 to 400 mL FRCs, the error was better than 7 %. In vivo FRC error between tests was 10. 1 (8. 2) %. LCI was the most reproducible ventilation inhomogeneity index. Conclusion: The lung model generates lung volumes under the conditions encountered during clinical MBW testing and enables realistic validation of MBW systems. The new N 2 MBW system reliably measures lung volumes and deliver...|$|R

In addition, {{effects of the}} drug on vagal reflexes, respiratory mechanics and gas exchange were investigated in anesthetized animals. Acute cocaine elicited rapid and shallow breathing in awake rats. Ventilatory excitation, but not tachypnea, was present in anesthetized animals. In untreated rats, <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>f)</b> increased during 10 % O$ sb 2 $ and 5 % CO$ sb 2 $ exposures; f decreased after cocaine, but in absolute terms, it was still higher after than before treatment.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{deposition}} models for humans, {{as well as}} experimental animals, have been described. However, no breath-by-breath deposition measurement in rats {{has been reported to}} date. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine lung deposition of micrometer-sized particles as a function of breathing parameters in the adult rat lung. A new aerosol photometry system was designed to measure deposition of nonhygroscopic, 2 -μm sebacate particles in anesthetized, intubated, and spontaneously breathing 90 -day-old Wistar-Kyoto rats placed in a size-adjusted body plethysmograph box. Instrumental dead space of the system was minimized down to 310 μl (i. e., ∼ 20 % of respiratory dead space). The system allows continuous monitoring of particle concentration in the respired volume. Breathing parameters, such as <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>f),</b> tidal volume (Vt), as well as inspiration/expiration times, were also monitored at different levels of anesthesia. The results showed that Vt typically varied between 1. 5 and 4. 0 ml for regular breathing and between 4. 0 and 10. 0 ml for single-sigh breaths; f ranged from 40 to 200 breaths/min. Corresponding deposition values varied between 5 and 50 %, depending on breath-by-breath breathing patterns. The best fit of deposition (D) was achieved by a bilinear function of Vt and f and found to be D = 11. 0 − 0. 09 ·f + 3. 75 ·Vt. We conclude that our approach provides more realistic conditions for the measurement of deposition than conventional models using ventilated animals and allows us to analyze the correlation between breath-specific deposition and spontaneous breathing patterns...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{value of}} {{respiratory}} variables as weaning predictors {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU) is controversial. We evaluated the ability of tidal volume (Vt(exp)), <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>f),</b> minute volume (MV(exp)), rapid shallow breathing index (f/Vt), inspired-expired oxygen concentration difference [(I-E) O(2) ], and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (Pe'(co(2))) at the end of a weaning trial to predict early weaning outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-three patients who required > 24 h of mechanical ventilation were studied. A controlled pressure support weaning trial was undertaken until 5 cm H(2) O continuous positive airway pressure or predefined criteria were reached. The ability of data from the last 5 min of the trial to predict whether a predefined endpoint indicating discontinuation of ventilator support within the next 24 h was evaluated. RESULTS: Pre-test probability for achieving the outcome was 44 % in the cohort (n= 32). Non-achievers were older, had higher APACHE II and organ failure scores before the trial, and higher baseline arterial H(+) concentrations. The Vt, MV, f, and f/Vt had no predictive power using a range of cut-off values or from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The [I-E]O(2) and Pe'(co(2)) had weak discriminatory power [area under the ROC curve: [I-E]O(2) 0. 64 (P= 0. 03); Pe'(co(2)) 0. 63 (P= 0. 05) ]. Using best cut-off values for [I-E]O(2) of 5. 6 % and Pe'(co(2)) of 5. 1 kPa, positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2 and 0. 5, respectively, which only changed the pre- to post-test probability by about 20 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} changes in breathing pattern, neuromuscular drive (P 0. 1), and activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) during a gradual reduction in pressure support ventilation (PSV) in patients being weaned off controlled mechanical ventilation.  METHODS—Eight non-COPD patients recovering from acute respiratory failure were included in this prospective interventional study. All patients were unable to tolerate discontinuation from mechanical ventilation. Each patient was evaluated during a period of spontaneous breathing and during PSV. Four successive levels of PSV were assessed in the following order: 20 cm H 2 O (PS 20), 15 cm H 2 O (PS 15), 10 cm H 2 O (PS 10), and 5 cm H 2 O (PS 5).  RESULTS—When pressure support was reduced from PS 20 to PS 10 the <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>f)</b> and the rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT) significantly increased and tidal volume (VT) significantly decreased. These parameters did not vary when pressure support was reduced from PS 10 to PS 5. Conversely, P 0. 1 varied negligibly between PS 20 and PS 15 but increased significantly at low PSV levels. P 0. 1 values were always greater than 2. 9 cm H 2 O (4. 1 (1. 1) cm H 2 O) when SCM activity was present. When contraction of the SCM muscles reappeared the P 0. 1 was the only parameter that changed significantly.  CONCLUSIONS—In postoperative septic patients the value of P 0. 1 seems to be more useful than breathing pattern parameters for setting the optimal level of pressure assistance during PSV. ...|$|E

Ventilatory pattern and oxygen saturation were monitored by means of inductive plethysmography during 30 minutes spontaneous breathing at rest (sb) and during a 30 minute yoga lesson (y).

30|$|Many {{factors may}} explain the lower lung {{deposition}} during pressure support. The lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (while keeping a similar inspiratory time and tidal volume) during pressure support led to a decrease in lung deposition as compared to volume control. Reducing the <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> without increasing neither the inspiratory time nor the tidal volume led {{to an increase in}} the expiratory time and hence reduced aerosol delivery distal to the endotracheal tube during continuous nebulization [28]. Aerosol lung deposition normalized to the <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> becomes similar to the two modes (p =  0.378).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the bispectral index (BIS) effects in calves through continuous infusion of propofol with or without fentanyl. Eight Holstein male calves (ages from six to twelve months old) with an average weight of 123 ± 18 kg were used. All animals participated in both groups, always keeping a minimum interval of one week between the anesthetic procedures; the calves were randomly distributed between groups. Anesthesia was induced with an intravenous (IV) dose of propofol of 5 mg kg- 1 in control group (GP) or with propofol (4 mg kg- 1) associated with IV fentanyl 0. 001 mg kg- 1 (GF). All the calves were positioned in right lateral recumbency and were allowed to spontaneously breathe room air. Subsequently, the anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of propofol at the rate of 0. 6 mg kg- 1 min- 1 IV in GP, and associated with the infusion of fentanyl 0. 001 mg kg- 1 hour- 1 in GF. Measurements of BIS, signal quality index (SQI) and electromyography (EMG) were evaluated before anesthesia induction (TB), and at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the beginning of continuous drugs infusion (T 15, T 30, T 45 and T 60, respectively). The heart rate (HR), <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>f),</b> end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO 2) and recovery times were evaluated as well. No significant differences were observed between the groups in the BIS variables and the recovery time was longer in GF. Co-administration of propofol and fentanyl infusions, at the doses reported here, did not change the values of BIS in cattle, but delayed the recovery time...|$|E
40|$|Yoga is an {{applied science}} {{in a number}} of fields such as education, {{physical}} education and sports, health education, family welfare, psychology, medicine and therapy. Here scholars was investigated the effect of pranadharana on selected physiological variables-resting heart rate, resting respiratory rate, positive breath holding capacity, negative breath holding capacity. Pranadharana is a meditation on the breath and the experience of breathing in the different bodies: the physical body-air breath; the mental body – different breath – vitalities; the casual body – pranic breathing. The study was delimited to the 20 male students of Naveen Vidhya Niketan School, Gwalior, ranging from 12 - 16 years of age. For six weeks duration and subjects were divided into two groups (10 each) and randomly i. e. One experimental and one control group [...] The analysis of covariance revealed that practice of pranadharana had effect on Resting <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>F</b> = 13. 503, against required value of 4. 45). Resting Heart Rate (F =. 016,against required value of 4. 45), Positive Breath Holding Capacity (F = 2. 963, against required value of 4. 45), Negative Breath Holding Capacity (F = 1. 089, against required value of 4. 45) showed no differential change by the practice of Pranadharana on Subjects. The result of study reveals that Pranadharana had significant effect on the certain physiological variables. In the under taken research study the resting heart rate was not improved by pranadharana practice and resting respiratory rate was improved by pranadharana practice because it is some how related to breathing which is easily improved and Pranadharana being breathing best exercise which might have direct impact on breathing. The results of the study showed that no change occurred in positive and negative breath holding capacity as a result of Pranadharana. This might be {{due to the fact that}} Pranadharana is a meditation practice that is closely associated with the activity of pray instead of respiratory system...|$|E
30|$|We used an IngMar ASL 5000 ™ {{artificial}} lung simulator (version 3.4, 3.5; IngMar Medical, Pittsburgh, PA) {{with a built-in}} cylinder with a 17.8 -cm diameter. The ASL 5000 ™ is a popular lung stimulator, which can imitate different breathing conditions and can measure various ventilation parameters including WOB, trigger work (TW), pressure of effort (pressure of muscle [Pmus]), maximum pressure drop during trigger, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Respiratory parameters are automatically displayed on the control panel. We regarded the ASL 5000 ™ {{as a model of}} the lower respiratory tract (i.e., the upper respiratory tract was not included). We set the ASL 5000 ™ to reflect a 3 -kg neonate after cardiac surgery to simulate SBTs with compliance at 0.5 [*]mL/cmH 2 O/kg [5] and resistance at 40  cmH 2 O/L/s. The reference values for healthy neonate compliance and resistance are 1.5 – 2.0 [*]mL/cmH 2 O/kg and 20 – 40  cmH 2 O/L/s, respectively [13, 14]. The ASL 5000 ™ was set to the constant VT mode under computer control, with a tidal volume of 30 [*]mL (10 [*]mL/kg) and a minute volume of 720 – 1080 [*]mL/min, which corresponds to a <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>f)</b> of 24 – 36 /min. Endotracheal tubes with an inside diameter of 3.0 and 3.5 (Mallinckrodt™; Hi-Contour Oral/Nasal Tracheal Tube Cuffed Murphy Eye, Dublin, Ireland) were clinically curved and cuffed to prevent gas leakage. A 22 / 19 -mm adapter with a built-in duct (diameter, 9 [*]mm) was attached because the port of the ASL 5000 ™ was too large to attach an endotracheal tube. A ventilator (SERVO-i Universal™, version 3.0. 1; Maquet, Danvers, MA) was set at PSV: PEEP, 4  cmH 2 O; FIO 2, 0.4; inspiration time was set at 45 % of respiration; and bias flow of 0.5 [*]L/min was continuously delivered to the respiratory circuit. Trigger sensitivity was set to 5 to detect bias flow deviation of 0.25 [*]L/min at the expiratory channel. The ventilator was connected to the {{artificial lung}} by means of a respiratory circuit (Smooth-Bor™; Smooth-Bor Plastics, Laguna Hills, CA). No respiratory humidifier or heat/moisture exchanger was used.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Thais emarginata is a {{gastropod}} which inhabits the midlittoral {{zone of the}} intertidal region. Oxygen {{consumption of}} high-level and low-level organisms was determined at various seasons of the year over an experimental temperature range of 5 to 20 ° C. No significant difference in <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate</b> between separate populations of high-level and low level organisms was found. Temperature compensation studies performed by testing both field-acclimatized and laboratory acclimated organisms indicated that the low-level organisms adapted to cold temperatures (8 - 10 °C.) responded by having <b>respiratory</b> <b>rates</b> more sensitive to warmer (20 °C.) temperatures. High-level organisms adapted to cold temperatures (8 - 10 °C.) responded {{in the same manner}} as warm adapted (17 °C.) high-level organisms. Both high-level and low-level organisms showed partial temperature compensation. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>rates</b> measured at different times of the year indicated that <b>respiratory</b> <b>rates</b> were higher during warmer months of the year and also during those months (August and September) in which the organisms were actively feeding. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>rates</b> during this time were also more temperature dependent than at other times during the year. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>rates</b> tended to be higher before the reproductive season than following reproduction. During the colder months, following reproduction, <b>respiratory</b> <b>rates</b> were generally lower than during warmer months. It was concluded that T. emarginata is a metabolic regulator.
