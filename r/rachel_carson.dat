Through a qualitative content analysis research methodology of news articles, peer-review journals, and books relating to research on the Arctic region, globalization, and ecocide, raw data has been collected and condensed into categories which fundamentally include globalization and modern technologies, global warming and climate change, air and water pollution, Arctic vegetation and fauna, Arctic indigenous populations, and social movements and green policies. I will discuss and elaborate the problem of globalization, particularly the technology utilized, and how it can be blamed for ecocide in the Arctic. I will also mention both the systems and populations consequently affected. Suggestions in saving and regenerating the damages caused to the arctic environment by modern technology have been noted by focusing on green energy policies and social movements with a possible collaboration with ally organizations and or nations...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to {{increasing}} public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. Senator James E. Murray introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959, in the 86th Congress. The 1962 publication of Silent Spring by <b>Rachel</b> <b>Carson</b> alerted {{the public about the}} detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House-Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator Henry M. Jackson, and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative George Miller, to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.|$|E
25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 deep ecology paper, Arne Næss claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists who {{were out in}} the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were <b>Rachel</b> <b>Carson,</b> David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E
