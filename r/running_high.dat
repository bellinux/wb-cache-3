5|$|The second romance, in A minor, {{an exuberant}} piece, {{has a strong}} semiquaver figure {{supporting}} the theme, and <b>running</b> <b>high</b> into the treble and low into the bass.

5|$|After a naval career lasting {{more than}} forty years, in 1912 he was {{appointed}} First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With World War I looming, he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his background as a German prince forced his retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was <b>running</b> <b>high.</b> He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, {{at the behest of}} King George V, in 1917.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was <b>running</b> <b>high</b> in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally {{spilled over into}} open war in 1167, triggered by a trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still <b>running</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German feeling in Britain <b>running</b> <b>high,</b> the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly {{in part because the}} Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E

25|$|With {{tensions}} <b>running</b> <b>high</b> in Britain, prominent politicians suggested {{attacking the}} French force in port, {{in the hopes}} of at the very least delaying the anticipated invasion while defences were hurriedly constructed along the coast. Boulogne had been heavily fortified over the years, and a number of conventional assaults had already failed, notable being one commanded by Horatio Nelson in 1801. The invasion barges were defended by a double line of warships anchored nose-to-tail, with these covered by gun batteries lining the cliff tops. New methods had to be considered.|$|E
25|$|During {{a public}} meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, {{emotions}} were <b>running</b> <b>high.</b> James Bevel, {{as director of}} the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor George Wallace directly about Jackson's death, and to ask him if he had ordered the State Troopers to turn off the lights and attack the marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus the anger and pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1877, Russia and Austria-Hungary {{signed a}} written {{agreement}} confirming {{the results of}} an earlier Reichstadt Agreement in July 1876. This assured Russia of the benevolent neutrality of Austria-Hungary in the impending war. These terms meant that in case of war Russia would do the fighting and Austria would derive most of the advantage. Russia therefore made a final effort for a peaceful settlement. After reaching an agreement with its main Balkan rival and with anti-Ottoman sympathies <b>running</b> <b>high</b> throughout Europe due to the Bulgarian atrocities and the rejection of the Constantinople agreements, Russia finally felt free to declare war.|$|E

25|$|The war {{was going}} badly for the Russians and the Russian Navy revolted. The revolts soon {{spread out in}} the nation and Finland managed to secure its {{independence}} from Russia in the turmoil. However, tensions were still <b>running</b> <b>high</b> and soon after the declaration of independence the Finnish Civil War erupted. The socialists (reds) and the non-socialists (whites) clashed. Elements of the Russian Baltic fleet were still moored in Finnish harbours and the Russian sailors were sympathetic with the socialist side. However, the Finnish reds faced tough pressure from the whites, who had better military leadership. A German force that landed in southern Finland - {{in the back of the}} reds - finally broke the reds fighting spirit.|$|E
25|$|After Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's command left Lookout Mountain {{at about}} 10 a.m. and moved east, they {{encountered}} a significant obstacle. The bridges across Chattanooga Creek, {{about a mile}} from Rossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night before and the creek was <b>running</b> <b>high.</b> Brig. Gen. Peter Joseph Osterhaus assigned a 70-man pioneer unit to start rebuilding one bridge while men of the 27th Missouri created a rickety footbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and wagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance was delayed about three hours and the bulk of his force did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|As a royalist or even imperialist opera, it {{was badly}} {{received}} by Republicans and revolutionaries. In 1792, Étienne Méhul had finished his version Adrien with a libretto by François-Benoît Hoffman based on Metastasio; {{it was set}} to premier at the Paris Opera on 6 March 1792, but the Commune opposed it, as the opera was written by an Austrian (Anti-Austrian sentiments were <b>running</b> <b>high</b> {{at the time and}} France would declare war on Austria the next month), and the theme was imperialistic, which went against the ideals of the French Revolution. The premier was postoponed for a week, and Hoffman defended his work in an open letter, but to no avail, as the work was banned on 12 March 1792. It finally premiered in 1799, but was again shut down by the Directory after four performances.|$|E
