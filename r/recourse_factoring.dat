40|$|Research in {{connection}} with jurnal writing thesis takes the theme {{the protection of the}} law against companies factor in billing accounts receivable factoring transactions. Problems studied involves two things; the first what factors the company’s legal position as a buyer on receivables in factoring and financing institution both what form of legal protection that can be given to companies factor of a possible failure of the trade receivables collection. This includes research conducted legal research categories, namely normative legal research literature or legal research based on secondary data. The approach used is the approach ot the laws and facts approach. Next to for further analysis techniques use the description legal interpretation techniques based argumentative theory, principles, and concepts relevan laws. The results showed that the company,s legal position as a purchaser of  factoring receivables is very weak and vulnerable than risk the possibility of failure of collection of accounts receivable due to non fulfillment of the achievements by the customer. In this context there is no guarantee of  legal protection for the company for the payment or refund factor its receivables in full. The next from legal protection that can be given to the factor as a buyer of receivables is; a) apply the type of <b>recourse</b> <b>factoring</b> in the factoring agreement with the burden of responsibility is on the client in case of failure of collection of accounts receivable, b) implement a system of personal/corporate guarantees, and c) apply the prudential banking principle...|$|E
40|$|It is {{emerging}} that {{mesenchymal stem cell}} (MSC) metabolic activity may be a key regulator of multipotency. The metabolome represents a "snapshot" of the stem cell phenotype, and therefore metabolic profiling could, through a systems biology approach, offer and highlight critical biochemical pathways for investigation. To date, however, it has remained difficult to undertake unbiased experiments to study MSC multipotency {{in the absence of}} strategies to retain multipotency without <b>recourse</b> to soluble <b>factors</b> that can add artifact to experiments. Here we apply a nanotopographical systems approach linked to metabolomics to regulate plasticity and demonstrate rapid metabolite reorganization, allowing rational selection of key biochemical targets of self-renewal (ERK 1 / 2, LDL, and Jnk). We then show that these signaling effectors regulate functional multipotency...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{anisotropy}} in an austenitic ferromagnetic {{shape memory}} alloy (SMA), Ni 50 Mn 26. 25 Ga 23. 75, is investigated along (010), (1) over bar 20, (1) over bar 21, 23 (1) over bar and (232) using nanoindentation. While (010) exhibits the highest reduced modulus, Er, and hardness, H, (232) shows the lowest amongst the grain orientations examined in this study. The significant elastic anisotropy measured is attributed to differences in planar packing density and number of in-plane Ni-Mn and Ni-Ga bonds, whereas the plastic anisotropy {{is due to the}} differences in the onset of slip, which is rationalized by <b>recourse</b> to Schmid <b>factor</b> calculations. This would help determine the grain orientations in austenitic NiMnGa which exhibit better mechanical properties for SMA applications such as improving vibration damping characteristics of the alloy...|$|R
30|$|In {{classical}} economic theory, {{human capital}} {{is regarded as}} an exogenous factor in economic development, rather than a main contributor. According to Blundell et al. (1999), the concept of human capital come up from a recognition that an individual’s or an organization’s choice to invest in human capital such as educate or train their employees is similar to choices about other types of investments. Human capital investments involve a costs which the individual or organization expects to gain a return on in the future such as increasing their productivity. However, more {{recent studies have shown}} that human capital, through education, innovation, and constant improvement, makes a significant contribution to economic growth and development (Pelinescu 2015; Dakhli and De Clercq 2004). This relates to the endogenous growth theory, which argues that that economic growth is driven by the improvement and enhancement of human capital (by means of innovation) to constantly create new, effective, and efficient processes and ideas from within the organization or system itself, without <b>recourse</b> to external <b>factors</b> of any sort (Grossman and Helpman 1994).|$|R
40|$|Attitudes about {{intimate}} partner violence (IPV) {{against women}} are widely surveyed, but attitudes about women’s recourse after exposure to IPV are understudied, despite their importance for intervention. Designed through qualitative research and administered in a probability sample of 1, 054 married {{men and women}} 18 to 50 years in My Hao District, Vietnam, the ATT-RECOURSE scale measures men’s and women’s attitudes about a wife’s recourse after exposure to physical IPV. Data were initially collected for nine items. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with one random split-half sample (N 1 = 526) revealed a one-factor model with significant loadings (0. 316 - 0. 686) for six items capturing a wife’s silence, informal recourse, and formal <b>recourse.</b> A confirmatory <b>factor</b> analysis (CFA) with the other random split-half sample (N 2 = 528) showed adequate fit for the six-item model and significant factor loadings of similar magnitude to the EFA results (0. 412 - 0. 669). For the six items retained, men consistently favored recourse more often than did women (52. 4 %- 66. 0 % of men vs. 41. 9 %- 55. 2 % of women). Tests for uniform differential item functioning (DIF) by gender revealed one item with significant uniform DIF, and adjusting for this revealed an even larger gap in men’s and women’s attitudes, with men favoring recourse, on average, more than women. The six-item ATT-RECOURSE scale is reliable across independent samples and exhibits little uniform DIF by gender, supporting its use in surveys of men and women. Further methodological research is discussed. Research is needed in Vietnam about why women report less favorable attitudes than men regarding women’s recourse after physical IPV...|$|R
40|$|Broadly {{discussed}} in the literature the concept of project success still remains ambiguously defined. The well known success criteria like time, cost and quality does not provide any practical nformation of achieving of project objectives in an efficient way. Identification of main drivers of project success gain particular importance for companies {{in the light of}} highly competitive environment. Housing construction projects represent one of the largest sector in construction industry and Ukrainian housing construction industry is considered to have one of the highest rate of return in EU. However the amount of research related to Ukrainian market is limited to few general economy overviews published by such organizations like World Bank and big consulting firms. The main aim of this research is identification of the most influential success factors from the 26 factors identified in existing project management literature. The analysis was performed in a highly profitable housing construction industry with a focus on Ukrainian market peculiarities. A questionnaire survey was sent to 110 experienced housing construction project managers and 26 responses there received. Based on the findings of the questionnaire success factors were ranked according to their impact on project success. In addition success factors interrelationship was studied in order to study the importance of each factor in depth. The findings of the research contributed both to project management field of study and Ukrainian construction market research. A primary and support areas of success factors were identified which might serve as a practical guide for managing housing construction projects in Ukraine. The most important success factors were defined: economic environment, project manager’s experience and qualification of project team. Project managers in housing construction industry in Ukraine would probably consider being more aware of the dominance of environment and human <b>recourses</b> related success <b>factors.</b> Additionally, success factors interrelation matrix might be used as a success diffusion map. Further research might be also essential in this area like studying different types of project and expanding the focus of current study or analysing the importance of success factors on different stages of the project life cycle...|$|R
