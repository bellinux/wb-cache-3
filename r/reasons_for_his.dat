He started the season with half-centuries in the three consecutive innings ahead of the Tests. The third of these was in a state match that resulted in an innings victory over England.|$|E
5|$|Belisarius {{arrived in}} the East in 541, but after some success, was again {{recalled}} to Constantinople in 542. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> withdrawal are not known, but {{it may have been}} instigated by rumours of disloyalty on behalf of the general reaching the court.|$|E

5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again under {{scrutiny}} {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of his victims.|$|E
5|$|Believing Marcus {{killed his}} crew, Khan {{engineers}} attacks on a Starfleet archive and Starfleet leadership, before fleeing to the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS. Marcus arms Enterprise with 72 advanced torpedoes and sends Kirk and Enterprise to Qo'noS to kill Harrison. Against orders, Kirk attempts to capture him alive.

5|$|Fàbregas' {{increase}} in exposure drew transfer speculation during the summer; Real Madrid {{expressed a desire}} to sign the Spaniard despite his long-term contract with Arsenal, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger stated that Arsenal would not listen to any offers. In September 2006, with six years left on his deal, Arsenal offered a new five-year deal (with an option to extend by a further three years) to the midfielder, which he signed on 19 October 2006. While the contract was unusually long, Fàbregas cited Arsenal's playing style and Wenger as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> long-term commitment to the club.|$|E

5|$|However, Gandhi had sound <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> decision. The salt tax was {{a deeply}} {{symbolic}} choice, since salt {{was used by}} nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Brown {{was named}} to the University of Kentucky College of Law Alumni Association's Hall of Fame. In a press release, the {{association}} cited Brown's success at Kentucky Fried Chicken, his political career, and his help in establishing the university's Sanders–Brown Center on Aging as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> induction. The center is named in honor of Harland Sanders and Brown's father. Brown divides his time between homes in Lexington, Kentucky and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Kaiserslautern {{announced}} that Lokvenc would {{be sold in}} April 2004, citing his salary demands as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> sale. He joined VfL Bochum of the Bundesliga {{in the summer of}} 2004, agreeing the transfer before the European Championships. Bochum were relegated from the league after 33 games of the 34-game season, with Lokvenc scoring his tenth goal of the season in a 2–0 win at third placed Stuttgart.|$|E

5|$|Less than a {{month before}} the start of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Durant {{announced}} that he would be dropping out of the competition, citing mental and physical exhaustion as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> departure.

In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.|$|E
5|$|Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were {{historical}} characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, {{are based}} on an actual incident {{that took place in}} 13th century Florence. Dante had several <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.|$|E
5|$|Darabont's {{departure}} as showrunner in July 2011 {{during the}} second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere {{and a few days}} after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> firing.|$|E

5|$|Henry and Anne {{formally}} {{married on}} 25 January 1533, after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid. Shortly afterwards, the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer. As {{a result of}} this marriage and these excommunications, the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533. On 7 September, she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently had three miscarriages, and by March 1536, Henry was courting Jane Seymour. In order to marry Jane Seymour, Henry had to find <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> marriage with Anne to end.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the High Court ruling, and with the {{appropriation}} bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, had there been no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged - contrary to government statements - that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the Melbourne Herald printed documents in support of Khemlani's allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned. Fraser determined to block supply, convened a shadow cabinet meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench. At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor state of the economy and the continuing scandals as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E

5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> decision.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{frustrating}} for the midfielder, who was sidelined {{for two months}} by knee and head injuries and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli match fixing scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus' relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, many stars (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players' future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing {{his family and his}} commitment to the club as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{boosted the}} morale of the Song {{soldiers}} and increased dissatisfaction among the Jin army. News of the victory improved confidence in the government and bolstered the stability of the Song. The Jurchens gave up their ambitions of conquering the Southern Song and reunifying China. The Jin army withdrew in 1162, and diplomatic relations between the two states resumed. Emperor Gaozong retired nine months after the conclusion of the battle. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> abdication are complicated, but Gaozong's handling of the war with Wanyan Liang may have had a part in his decision to resign. He had ignored the warnings of a Jin attack and his hopes for conciliation held back plans for strengthening the Song defenses.|$|E
