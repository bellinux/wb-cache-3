40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of metal oxide nanomaterials {{is one of the}} key steps for achieving highly efficient energy conversion and storage on an industrial scale. Solution combustion synthesis (SCS) is a time- and energy-saving method as compared with other routes, especially for the preparation of complex oxides which can be easily adapted for scale-up applications. This review summarizes the synthesis of various metal oxide nanomaterials and their applications for energy conversion and storage, including lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen and methane production, fuel cells and solar cells. In particular, some novel concepts such as <b>reverse</b> <b>support</b> combustion, self-combustion of ionic liquids, and creation of oxygen vacancies are presented. SCS has some unique advantages such as its capability for in situ doping of oxides and construction of heterojunctions. The well-developed porosity and large specific surface area caused by gas evolution during the combustion process endow the resulting materials with exceptional properties. The relationship between the structural properties of the metal oxides studied and their performance is discussed. Finally, the conclusions and perspectives are briefly presented.

Through its Artist Community, <b>REVERSE</b> <b>supports</b> a select group of artists who feature regularly in its exhibitions and projects. Members include: CHi KA, Melissa F.

40|$|Life {{insurance}} {{has become}} the need in today modern community’s life. In Indonesia, the demand on life insurance grew continuously {{in line with the}} increase of people’s income and awareness on the importance of risk anticipation. To fulfill this demand, the number of life insurance companies always increased as well as various products supplied in the market. However, the contribution of insurance industry, especially life insurance, on Indonesia’s economy was relatively low. This research is aimed to analyze factors affecting the life insurance industry growth from supply side. The secondary data was collected from 15 biggest life insurance companies in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the main tools of analysis used were including descriptive statistic and dynamic panel regression. The analysis result shows that the product variety has no impact on the gross premium of life insurance growth, number of policies, and insurance funds.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore the puzzle of {{possible}} institutionalization or reversal of rules ‘imported’ by new member states from Central and Eastern Europe during their preparation for accession to the EU. It argues that the institutionalization of formal rules adopted as part of enlargement requirements is not automatic post accession. New formal rules can be <b>reversed,</b> <b>supported</b> by secondary rules and institutionalized or ignored and not implemented. The paper proposes a politics framework that suggests that these different outcomes will {{be influenced by the}} environment of weak post communist states and will depend on the area specific configuration of formal and informal veto players and on the EU’s ability to impose sanctions. In the case of non acquis imported rules, reversal of formal rules would be possible without sanctions whereas in the case of acquis rules, the likely outcomes are institutionalization or ‘empty shells’. Another outcome, ‘capture’ of the new rules is likely in areas with distributive imp...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft {{structural}} materials like the aluminium alloy Al 2024 require a surface pretreatment by chemical processes prior to bonding. Investigations in microareas like boundary zones in adhesive joints require techniques with high resolution for imaging and small spot sizes (nm-range) for microanalytical systems with sufficient detection efficiency. Today these specifications are fulfilled best by an equipment which uses electrons for excitation of the specimen material because {{these can be}} imaged by electromagnetic lenses and may be focussed to a very small probe. Some Airbus A 300 aircrafts equipped with US-engines had delaminations of aluminium-honeycomb adhesive joints at the fan <b>reverser</b> <b>support</b> assemblies.
