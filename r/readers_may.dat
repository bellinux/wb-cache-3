I did not know, myself, until the sixth of this present month, when I went to look. I found the outer front courtyard, often mentioned in this story, metamorphosed into a butter shop; and then I almost gave up every brick of the jail for lost. Wandering, however, down a certain adjacent [...] "Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey", I came to [...] "Marshalsea Place": the houses in which I recognised, not only as the great block of the former prison, but as preserving the rooms that arose in my mind's eye when I became Little Dorrit's biographer...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard called it a [...] "compelling story". He said that Spurr tells this [...] "naval saga", which had {{degenerated}} into a [...] "racial conflict", {{from the point of view}} of the people involved, [...] "people who had little time for moralizing or preachments, anything but getting on with the killing". American author and journalist Charles Kaiser, also writing in The New York Times, said that the book's strength is [...] "its ability to re-create the fear the Japanese engendered with their desperation tactics" [...] and the resulting American perception that they were all prepared to fight to the death. Kaiser added that younger <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> have a better understanding from this book of what led to US President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan, [...] "even if they ... question the morality of that decision".|$|E

That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews. Liesl Schillinger of The New York Times praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift [...] "not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting". Kirkus Reviews said it [...] "will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks". They considered Rowling's [...] "wry wit" [...] to turn into [...] "outright merriment", but called the climax [...] "tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking". Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found {{as far back as}} Chamber of Secrets came into play. On the other hand, she noted that it [...] "gets a little exposition-heavy in spots" [...] and older <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> have seen the ending coming.|$|E
500|$|The strongest {{themes in}} Sherwood's early evangelical {{writings}} are {{the need to}} recognize one's innate [...] "depravity" [...] {{and the need to}} prepare oneself for eternity. For Sherwood, the most important lessons emphasize [...] "faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God." [...] In her adaptation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678)—The Infant's Progress (1821)—she represents original sin as a child named [...] "In-bred Sin" [...] who tempts the young pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Celestial City (Heaven) and it is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, [...] "tedious" [...] for even the [...] "willing reader." [...] Thus, [...] "some young <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> have found [...] activities more interesting than the spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation." [...] Such religious allegory, although not always so overt, continued to be a favorite literary device [...] of Sherwood's.|$|E
500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to just read one of them it wouldn't be like you {{had no idea what was}} going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E

500|$|The Tenjho Tenge manga is {{described}} by Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD as an [...] "...engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping it all up in a large plot that's fairly dark and really violent at times". Its creator, Oh! great, is known to flavor his works with wanton sex and violence. Oh! great uses sex as {{an important aspect of}} the storyline by using it as a powerful motivator both negatively and positively. He often has his characters contemplate the significance and importance of fighting as well as the meaning of strength. This conscious deliberation of subjective reasoning and objective truth between characters is the most imperative aspect of story and is considered to be rare in manga. Dani Moure of AnimeOnDVD said <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> find that Oh! great's narrative is occasionally hard to follow and at times the plot moves slowly. Oh! great is known for his characters to have unrealistic body proportions, and Tenjho Tenge is no different. The majority of the female characters have [...] "...ultra large breasts..." [...] and the males characters are extraordinarily muscular, but this facilitates the characters personalities to come through in their distinctive features. Overall, the Tenjho Tenge manga is well received having sold over 10.7 million copies, and its volumes regularly being in the top twenty best-selling manga for Japanese Tohan charts and North American Diamond Comic Distributors charts.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert called Philosopher's Stone [...] "a classic," [...] {{giving the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, and {{particularly}} praising the Quidditch scenes' visual effects. Praise was echoed by both The Telegraph and Empire reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter naming it the film's [...] "stand-out sequence". Brian Linder of IGN.com also gave the film a positive review, but concluded that it [...] "isn't perfect, but for me it's a nice supplement to a book series that I love". Although criticising the final half-hour, Jeanne Aufmuth of Palo Alto Online stated that the film would [...] "enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers." [...] USA Today reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, especially praising the set design and Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid, but criticised John Williams' score and concluded [...] "ultimately many of the book's <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> wish for a more magical incarnation." [...] The sets, design, cinematography, effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter, although he deemed John Williams' score [...] "a great clanging, banging music box that simply will not shut up." [...] Todd [...] McCarthy of Variety compared the film positively with Gone with the Wind and put [...] "The script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine." [...] Jonathan Foreman [...] of the New York Post recalled that the film was [...] "remarkably faithful," [...] to its literary counterpart as well as a [...] "consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} '80s, when lesbian feminists {{rejected}} the butch and femme identities that Hall's novel {{had helped to}} define, writers like Jane Rule and Blanche Wiesen Cook criticised The Well for defining lesbianism in terms of masculinity, {{as well as for}} presenting lesbian life as [...] "joyless". Furthermore, The Well arguably embodies what modern <b>readers</b> <b>may</b> regard as misogynistic and biphobic ideas in its presentation of the femme women who experience attraction towards Stephen but eventually end up in heterosexual relationships. Mary’s femininity, in particular, is belittled by Hall’s presentation of her: she is not Stephen’s equal in age, education, family, or wealth, and so is constantly infantilised by her lover. This, coupled with Mary’s dependence on Stephen, seems to emphasise the supposed inferiority of the feminine to the masculine. As Clare Hemmings argues, Mary is merely used as “a means for Stephen to reach her own understanding of {{the true nature of the}} deviant’s plight.” Moreover, Hemmings continues that both Mary and Angela represent the “‘traitorous femme’ who remains untrustworthy as she may leave you [...] for a man.” The idea that Mary’s sexuality and seemingly genuine feelings for Stephen are invalidated by the possibility of her heterosexual relationship with Martin may seem biphobic to modern readers. Furthermore, Hall’s treatment of Mary as a dependant and a foil for Stephen’s masculinity seemingly degrades femme lesbianism, or femininity in itself, as innately untrustworthy and inferior to forms of masculinity, whether exhibited by men or women. Alternatively, some critics assert that The Well's queer significance extends beyond lesbianism, arguing that the novel provides important bisexual representation in literature.|$|E
