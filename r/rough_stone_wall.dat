60|$|Leaning {{back against}} the <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> of the cottage, she seemed to bask languidly {{in the warmth of}} the rosy flush. Only her lowered eyes glanced at her little feet.|$|E
60|$|Now {{round the}} open space where these savages were celebrating their worship, or {{whatever}} it might be, ran a <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> about six feet in height, in which wall was a gateway. Towards this we advanced quite unseen, for upon {{our side of the}} wall grew many stunted pines. Through these pines our guide led us, till in the thickest of them, some few yards from the open gateway and a little to the right of it, she motioned to us to stop.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a very}} {{bare and}} desolate room, with no hangings to the <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> and {{scarcely}} any furniture, except a great carved bedstead, one wooden chair, a table, and some stools. On the bare floor, {{in front of the}} fire, her arm under her head, and a profusion of long hair falling round her like flax from a distaff, lay wearily a little figure, beside whom Sir Eberhard was kneeling on one knee.|$|R
50|$|The {{summit of}} Rough Tor {{once had a}} neolithic tor enclosure. The summit is encircled {{by a series of}} <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> that align with natural stone outcroppings on the tor. The walls would have {{originally}} completely encircled the tor. The walls would have had numerous stone lined openings. In the interior of the circle, there are remains of terraces leveled into the slopes, which archaeologists believe formed the foundations of circular wooden houses. There are also cleared areas near the terraces that have been garden plots.|$|R
50|$|The Selwyn Township {{is located}} at the {{northern}} end of a valley running south to Mount Elliott Smelter which is about 1.5 km distant. All buildings have been removed and the evidence of the township now comprises garden plots, cement surfaces and corrugated iron water tanks.The site of the Union Hotel remains identifiable and the timber stumps of the stationmaster's house, the railway formation and surviving timber sleepers are among the most visible remains. The railway embankment follows {{the eastern side of the}} valley between the town and smelter passing several miners' hut sites comprising <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> and benched surfaces with <b>stone</b> retaining <b>walls.</b>|$|R
60|$|A <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> {{protected}} the land {{on either side}} of the road. Nearly behind the milestone there was a gap in this fence, partially closed by a hurdle. A half-ruined culvert, arching a ditch that had run dry, formed a bridge leading from the road to the field. Had the field been already chosen as a place of concealment by the police? Nothing was to be seen but a footpath, and the dusky line of a plantation beyond it. As she made these discoveries, the rain began to fall again; the clouds gathered once more; the moonlight vanished.|$|E
60|$|This, indeed, {{proved to}} be the case, for it was not till the afternoon, after many hours' weary journey up gorges and through {{mountain}} valleys, that they arrived within sight of the village of Ostragarth. It was situated {{on one side of the}} valley, and consisted of huts surrounded by a <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> of such height that only the tops of the circular roofs were visible above it. A loud shrill cry was heard as they came in sight, a cow horn was blown in the village, and instantly men could be seen running in. Others, engaged in tending flocks of goats high up on the mountain side, left their charges and began to hurry down.|$|E
60|$|Above {{the wood}} {{there was an}} open space some {{hundreds}} of yards across, bounded by a <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> built for herding cattle. A second wall ran {{at right angles to}} this down towards the wood. An enfilading rifle fire had been sweeping across this open space, but the wall in front {{does not appear to have}} been occupied by the enemy, who held the kopje above it. To avoid the cross fire the soldiers ran in single file under the shelter of the wall, which covered them to the right, and so reached the other wall across their front. Here there was a second long delay, the men dribbling up from below, and firing over the top of the wall and between the chinks of the stones. The Dublin Fusiliers, through being in a more difficult position, had been unable to get up as quickly as the others, and most of the hard-breathing excited men who crowded under the wall were of the Rifles and of the Irish Fusiliers. The air was so full of bullets that it seemed impossible to live upon the other side of this shelter. Two hundred yards intervened between the wall and the crest of the kopje. And yet the kopje had to be cleared if the battle were to be won.|$|E
60|$|So Godwin {{took the}} lamp and went in, {{and the door}} was shut behind him. Surely the place was {{familiar}} to him? He knew that arched roof and these <b>rough,</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b> Why, {{it was here that}} he had been brought to die, and through that very door the false Rosamund had come to bid him farewell, who now returned to greet her in this same darksome den. Well, it was empty--doubtless she would soon come, and he waited, looking at the door. It did not stir; he heard no footsteps; nothing broke that utter silence. He turned again and stared about him. Something glinted on the ground yonder, {{towards the end of the}} vault, just where he had knelt before the executioner. A shape lay there; doubtless it was Masouda, imprisoned and asleep.|$|R
50|$|Seton began {{designing}} and building his castle in 1933. The 32-room, 6,900 square foot (640 m2) multi-level building had a flat-roof and <b>rough</b> hewn <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> exterior. The interior had oak floors and plaster walls with the ceilings supported by log rafters. The Castle {{was built on}} one of the highest points on Seton's property, with views over his village and the western landscape.|$|R
50|$|In 1199, Andrew De Bovedon gave Gaulden to Taunton Priory. It was a {{settlement}} in the mid-thirteenth century. During the Valor Ecclesiasticus (1535), Gaulden was listed as belonging to the priory. The priory's possessions were surrendered to King Henry VIII in 1539, and that the manor was granted to William Standysh in 1544. On his death in 1553, the manor passed to Francis Southwell and Alice, his wife. As they left no heirs, it became the possession of John Mynne, and then George Mynne and Elizabeth, his wife. In 1565, James Turberville, the former Bishop of Exeter, lived at the manor. Either Turberville or his great-nephew, John Turberville, added the plasterwork. Built from limestone with <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> the house is dated to the 16th century but underwent alterations in the 17th century; much of the plasterwork is dated to 1640-1660.|$|R
60|$|They {{were seated}} {{in the shade of}} the little house that Jess had learned to love as she had never loved a spot before, but around them lay the flood of {{sunshine}} shimmering like golden water; and beyond the red line of the fence at the end of the garden, where the rich pomegranate bloom tried to blush the roses down, the hot air danced merrily above the <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> like a million microscopic elves at play. Peace! everywhere was peace! and in it the full heart of Nature beat out in radiant life. Peace in the voice of the turtle-doves among the willows! peace in the play of the sunshine and the murmur of the wind! peace in the growing flowers and hovering butterfly! Jess looked out at the wealth and glory which were spread before her, and thought that it was like heaven; then, giving way to the melancholy strain in her nature, she began to wonder idly how many human beings had sat and thought the same things, and had been gathered up into the azure of the past and forgotten; and how many would sit and think there when she in her turn had been utterly swept away into that gulf whence no echo ever comes! But what did it matter? The sunshine would still flood the earth with gold, the water would ripple, and the butterflies hover; and there would be other women to sit and fold their hands and consider them, thinking the same identical thoughts, beyond which our human intelligence cannot travel. And so on for thousands upon thousands of centuries, till at last the old world reaches its journey's appointed end, and, passing from the starry spaces, is swallowed up with those it bore.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked into}} the gaslit streets and looked up and down. The mysterious {{stranger}} had vanished. There was not a soul in sight. He clutched the <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> with his hands, he kicked the pavement with his heels. There was no doubt about it--everything around him was real. Most real {{of all was the}} fact that within a few feet of him lay a murdered man, and that in his hands was that brown leather pocket-book with its miraculous contents. For the last time Laverick retraced his steps and bent over that huddled-up shape. One by one he went through the other pockets. There was a packet of Russian cigarettes; an empty card-case of chased silver, and obviously of foreign workmanship; a cigarette holder stained with much use, but of the finest amber, with rich gold mountings. There was nothing else upon the dead man, no means of identification of any sort. Laverick stood up, giddy, half terrified with the thoughts that went tearing through his brain. The pocket-book began to burn his hand; he felt the perspiration breaking out anew upon his forehead. Yet he never hesitated. He walked like a man in a dream, but his footsteps were steady and short. Deliberately, and without any sign of hurry, he made his way towards his offices. If a policeman had come in sight up or down the street, he had decided to call him and to acquaint him with what had happened. It was the one chance he held against himself,--the gambler's method of decision, perhaps, unconsciously arrived at. As it turned out, there was still not a soul in sight. Laverick opened the outer door with his latchkey, let himself in and closed it. Then he groped his way through the clerk's office into his own room, switched on the electric light and once more sat down before his desk.|$|E
60|$|I turned instinctively to {{the walk}} beneath my study-window, where I {{had seen her}} the evening before with her little dog, and {{followed}} the path which her dear feet had trodden so often, till I came to the wicket gate that led into her rose garden. The winter bareness spread drearily over it now. The flowers that she had taught me to distinguish by their names, the flowers that I had taught her to paint from, were gone, and the tiny white paths that led between the beds were damp and green already. I {{went on to the}} avenue of trees, where we had breathed together the warm fragrance of August evenings, where we had admired together the myriad combinations of shade and sunlight that dappled the ground at our feet. The leaves fell about me from the groaning branches, and the earthy decay in the atmosphere chilled me to the bones. A little farther on, and I was out of the grounds, and following the lane that wound gently upward to the nearest hills. The old felled tree by the wayside, on which we had sat to rest, was sodden with rain, and the tuft of ferns and grasses which I had drawn for her, nestling under the <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> in front of us, had turned to a pool of water, stagnating round an island of draggled weeds. I gained the summit of the hill, and looked at the view which we had so often admired in the happier time. It was cold and barren--it was no longer the view that I remembered. The sunshine of her presence was far from me--the charm of her voice no longer murmured in my ear. She had talked to me, on the spot from which I now looked down, of her father, who was her last surviving parent--had told me how fond of each other they had been, and how sadly she missed him still when she entered certain rooms in the house, and when she took up forgotten occupations and amusements with which he had been associated. Was the view that I had seen, while listening to those words, the view that I saw now, standing on the hill-top by myself? I turned and left it--I wound my way back again, over the moor, and round the sandhills, down to the beach. There was the white rage of the surf, and the multitudinous glory of the leaping waves--but where was the place on which she had once drawn idle figures with her parasol in the sand--the place where we had sat together, while she talked to me about myself and my home, while she asked me a woman's minutely observant questions about my mother and my sister, and innocently wondered whether I should ever leave my lonely chambers and have a wife and a house of my own? Wind and wave had long since smoothed out the trace of her which she had left in those marks on the sand, I looked over the wide monotony of the sea-side prospect, and the place in which we two had idled away the sunny hours was as lost to me as if I had never known it, as strange to me as if I stood already on a foreign shore.|$|E

500|$|Union Station is {{particularly}} large for a Richardson train station, and {{stands out as}} the only of his stations not built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style of Trinity Church in Boston. Instead, it is a [...] "severe, compact brick box", with significant Colonial influence taken from other buildings in New London. Its design is heavily based on Sever Hall at Harvard University, which Richardson designed in 1878. The station has a similar profile, brick color and patterns, and arched entryway, but lacks the ornamentation of Sever. Richardson originally designed Union Station with <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and Longmeadow trim like his other stations, but the material was changed to less expensive brick shortly before construction; the ornamentation was also likely eliminated at this time. The strict symmetry is atypical of Richardson's designs {{and may have been}} a later change by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge after Richardson's death.|$|R
60|$|A lad was {{standing}} on the little lookout turret, {{on the top of a}} border fortalice. The place was evidently built solely with an eye to defence, comfort being an altogether secondary consideration. It was a square building, of <b>rough</b> <b>stone,</b> the <b>walls</b> broken only by narrow loopholes; and the door, which was ten feet above the ground, was reached by broad wooden steps, which could be hauled up in case of necessity; and were, in fact, raised every night.|$|R

50|$|St Cormac's Cave is on {{the south}} end of the island. The cave is around 3 metres long, 1 metre wide and 2 metres high, and {{contains}} two incised crosses on its east wall, dated by their style to around 700 AD. Saint Cormac (or Cormaic, Carmaig, Charmaig) is an obscure figure; he lived at the beginning of the 7th century and he may have been a son of Cormac, King of Leinster. He is the legendary founder of Keills Chapel 3.5 miles to the north on the Scottish mainland, and he is reputed to have used this cave as his hermitage. The <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> in front of the cave may have been a medieval structure to control pilgrim access to the cave.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{village was}} called Bridechapel and was north west {{of what is}} now Brydekirk Mains farm. In 1507, over 500 years ago, it was known as Bridechapel, in 1517 Brydekyrk and in 1660 Brydekirk. It had its own water at St Brydes Well and the spring is still there 500 years later. The pond which is over grown was the village pond at Brydekirk Mains Farm. You may see signs of the old village. The chapel had a <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> surrounding it, it was in 1100 over 900 years ago. We also found out before Dirom’s time the village north west of Brydekirk called Brydechaple was built round a small chaple dedicated to Saint Bryde, or Saint B9riget born 452. In 1983 it was excavated by archaeologists they found coins dating back to 1496 these are in the Dumfries Museum.|$|E

At the time of the battle which was to witness its downfall the centre of the structure was roofless, but the ends were well covered.

60|$|The {{universal}} stare {{made the}} eyes ache. Towards the distant line of Italian coast, indeed, {{it was a}} little relieved by light clouds of mist, slowly rising from the evaporation of the sea, but it softened nowhere else. Far away the staring roads, deep in dust, stared from the hill-side, stared from the hollow, stared from the interminable plain. Far away the dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages, and the monotonous wayside avenues of parched trees without shade, drooped beneath the stare of earth and sky. So did the horses with drowsy bells, in long files of carts, creeping slowly towards the interior; so did their recumbent drivers, when they were awake, which rarely happened; so did the exhausted labourers in the fields. Everything that lived or grew, was oppressed by the glare; except the lizard, passing swiftly over <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> and the cicala, chirping his dry hot chirp, like a rattle. The very dust was scorched brown, and something quivered in the atmosphere as if the air itself were panting.|$|R
50|$|Reddin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm and was educated at the local {{national}} school. He learned his hurling skills on the family farm. When ploughing the fields he would carry a hurley and ball, striking the ball into the air and trapping it on the stick on its way down. To sharpen his reflexes he would practice against a <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> from close distance, catching the sliotar as it rebounded in different directions. Times were tough, however, in post-war Ireland. He tried in vain to make a living on a small holding of land also being farmed by his brother and the rest of their family, so at the age of twenty-eight he made the decision to leave. England was booming, however, the Mullagh man had a great love for the game of hurling and when he got the offer of a job on a farm in Lorrha in Tipperary he took it.|$|E
5000|$|Constructed by Newark {{builders}} Hibbert and Schaus {{according to}} a design by J.W. Yost, this three-story courthouse comprises such elements as <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> with smooth trim, a colonnaded porch with Ionic columns surrounding the main entrance, and a prominent pediment on the northern side. [...] From its completion until the 1950s, the courthouse featured a statue of Lady Justice located atop the northern pediment, but its deterioration led local officials to place it in storage for many years until area lawyers paid for its restoration. Lesser elements of the building's architecture include steel details, ornamental columns and pilasters closer to the mansard roof, plastered ceilings, a state of Lady Justice {{in the center of}} the tiled floor in the building's lobby, and towers on the courthouse's corners. A prominent clock is located in the tower of the courthouse. Today, the Holmes County Courthouse remains the county's center of government. Courtrooms in the building serve as meeting places for the Holmes County Court of Common Pleas, along with other courts. Because of the county's exceptionally large Amish population, the courthouse features a parking area with use restricted to horses and buggies.|$|R

50|$|Donegal Presbyterian Church Complex is a {{historic}} Presbyterian church complex on Donegal Springs Road in East Donegal Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The church was built in 1732, and is a 1 1/2-story, three bay by five bay, stuccoed stone building with a gambrel roof. The chapel underwent a remodeling in 1851. The adjacent cemetery is enclosed in a <b>rough</b> hewn <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> built in 1791.

60|$|Early {{next morning}} I left Tolosa and {{travelled}} {{the whole day}} in a south-westerly direction. I did not hurry, but frequently dismounted to give my horse a sip of clear water and a taste of green herbage. I also called during the day at three or four estancia houses, but failed to hear {{anything that could be}} advantageous to me. In this way I covered about thirty-five miles of road, going always towards {{the eastern part of the}} Florida district in the heart of the country. About an hour before sunset I resolved to go no farther that day; and I could not have hoped to find a nicer resting-place than the one now before me--a neat rancho with a wide corridor supported by wooden pillars, standing amidst a bower of fine old weeping-willows. It was a calm, sunshiny afternoon, peace and quiet resting on everything, even bird and insect, for they were silent, or uttered only soft, subdued notes; and that modest lodge, with its <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and thatched roof, seemed to be in harmony with it all. It looked like the home of simple-minded, pastoral people that had for their only world the grassy wilderness, watered by many clear streams, bounded ever by that far-off, unbroken ring of the horizon, and arched over with blue heaven, starry by night and filled by day with sweet sunshine.|$|R
5000|$|The building's {{design has}} been called a [...] "Queen Anne splendor," [...] a style {{represented}} by the Woolley House's massive bay windows and projecting roof masses. Like other early Wright works, the design is much more conventional than later high-style examples of Wright's Prairie School such as the Heurtley House. The New York Times quipped in a 1996 article that the [...] "two-story frame house with a hip roof that could almost pass for the vernacular architecture of the period." [...] The design of the house is reminiscent of Wright's first teacher Joseph Silsbee and typical of Wright's early, low-cost residential designs. Its high-pitched, hip roof, polygonal and rectangular dormers, polygonal bay windows and <b>wall</b> foundations of <b>rough</b> <b>stones</b> are all reflections of Silsbee's picturesque manner of design. On the home's southeast portion are its polygonal bay windows and due to a restoration the <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> foundation <b>walls</b> are more enhanced than they once were. The original horizontal wooden clapboarding has been restored as well.|$|R
5000|$|In 1882 the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine {{described}} Beitin as {{a village}} [...] "built {{on the side}} of a flat spur which rises slightly on the north. On the south-east is a flat dell, with good fig and pomegranate gardens, and there are other fig-trees round the village and among the houses. The cottages have a ruinous appearance, with <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b> There is one square white house in two stories, which is visible from a great distance. The ground is very open, and the slopes gentle; the village slopes down gradually south-east. The surrounding ground is quite bare of trees, of white chalk, very barren and stony on the south; of hard limestone cropping up on the north; the fields divided off by low drystone walls. The contrast of the grey rocks, the red ploughland and the dark green figs is very striking. The remains of a good-sized tower exist towards the north, and on the south the walls of a church of Crusading date, once dedicated to St. Joseph. The population is stated at 400. The place is supplied from a fine spring on the south, which wells up in a circular basin. The spring is double, and was surrounded with a large reservoir, 314 feet long north-west and south-east, by 217 feet; of massive stones. The eastern and southern walls are standing about 10 feet high. The spring is perennial..." ...|$|R
6000|$|The village itself, {{looked upon}} from this same elevation, is very attractive. Life seems quieter, more {{peaceful}} there {{out of sight}} of the ocean's turbulence, out of hearing of its [...] "accents disconsolate." [...] The cottages are seen ranged in a double line along the narrow crooked street, like a procession of cows with a few laggards scattered behind the main body. One is impressed by its ancient character. The cottages are old, stone-built and thatched; older still is the church with its grey square tower, and all about are scattered the memorials of antiquity--the chantry on the hill, standing conspicuous alone, apart, above the world; the vast old abbey barn, and, <b>rough</b> thick <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> ivy-draped and crowned with beautiful valerian, and other fragments that were once parts of a great religious house.|$|R

60|$|We {{were close}} to the churchyard when she spoke. The church, a dreary {{building}} of grey stone, was situated in a little valley, {{so as to be}} sheltered from the bleak winds blowing over the moorland all round it. The burial-ground advanced, {{from the side of the}} church, a little way up the slope of the hill. It was surrounded by a <b>rough,</b> low <b>stone</b> <b>wall,</b> and was bare and open to the sky, except at one extremity, where a brook trickled down the stony hill-side, and a clump of dwarf trees threw their narrow shadows over the short, meagre grass. Just beyond the brook and the trees, and not far from one of the three stone stiles which afforded entrance, at various points, to the churchyard, rose the white marble cross that distinguished Mrs. Fairlie's grave from the humbler monuments scattered about it.|$|R
60|$|Stanton Harcourt is a {{very curious}} old place. It was {{formerly}} {{the seat of the}} ancient family of Harcourt, which now has its principal abode at Nuneham Courtney, a few miles off. The parsonage is a relic of the family mansion, or castle, other portions of which are close at hand; for, across the garden, rise two gray towers, both of them picturesquely venerable, and interesting for more than their antiquity. One of these towers, in its entire capacity, from height to depth, constituted the kitchen of the ancient castle, and is still used for domestic purposes, although it has not, nor ever had, a chimney; or we might rather say, it is itself one vast chimney, with a hearth of thirty feet square, and a flue and aperture of the same size. There are two huge fireplaces within, and the interior walls of the tower are blackened with the smoke that for centuries used to gush forth from them, and climb upward, seeking an exit through some wide air-holes in the comical roof, full seventy feet above. These lofty openings were capable of being so arranged, with reference to the wind, that the cooks are said to have been seldom troubled by the smoke; and here, no doubt, they were accustomed to roast oxen whole, with as little fuss and ado as a modern cook would roast a fowl. The inside of the tower is very dim and sombre (being nothing but <b>rough</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> lighted only from the apertures above mentioned), and has still a pungent odor of smoke and soot, the reminiscence of the fires and feasts of generations that have passed away. Methinks the extremest range of domestic economy lies between an American cooking-stove and the ancient kitchen, seventy dizzy feet in height and all one fireplace, of Stanton Harcourt.|$|R
