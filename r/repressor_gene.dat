40|$|Transformation of rodent cells by bovine {{papillomavirus}} type 1 (BPV- 1) {{has been}} shown to require the direct contribution of the viral oncogenes encoded by the E 5, E 6, and E 7 translational open reading frames (ORFs). It is also known that the viral E 1 and E 2 ORFs contribute indirectly to cellular transformation through their transcriptional modulation of these viral oncogenes. A mutant BPV- 1 disrupted in two of the proteins encoded by the E 2 ORF, the E 2 transcriptional repressors, has a complex transformation phenotype. In this paper, we provide evidence that (i) this phenotype is not attributable to the absence of other viral genes that overlap the E 2 <b>repressor</b> <b>genes,</b> (ii) the acquisition of transformation over time in cells harboring the E 2 double-repressor mutant correlates with reversions of the mutations that disrupt one of the E 2 <b>repressor</b> <b>genes,</b> E 8 /E 2 TR, and (iii) the initial transformation defect in the E 2 double-repressor mutant can be rescued by disruption of the full-length protein encoded by the E 1 ORF, the E 1 transcriptional repressor.

Furthermore, the expression of grapevine PcG-like genes was also detected in fruits and vegetative organs, suggesting that epigenetic changes could be at the basis of the regulation of various proliferation-differentiation cell transitions that occur during grapevine development...|$|R

A comparative analysis of the repressor proteins of different mycobacteriophages suggests that the mycobacteriophage-specific repressor proteins constitute a new family of repressors, which were possibly evolved from a common ancestor. Alignment of the mycobacteriophage-specific repressor proteins showed at least 7 blocks (designated I-VII) that carried 3 - 8 identical amino acid residues.

The total range of trp operon regulation is about 700 X (on/off). When the trp repressor was knocked out, one still got about 10 X regulation by the absence or presence of trp. When the sequence {{of the beginning of}} the trp operon was determined an unusual open reading frame (ORF) was seen immediately preceding the ORFs for the known structural genes for the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes.

50|$|Most prokaryotic {{arginine}} deiminase pathways {{are under}} the control of a <b>repressor</b> <b>gene,</b> termed ArgR. This is a negative regulator, and will only release the arginine deiminase operon for expression in the presence of arginine. The crystal structure of apo-ArgR from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been determined to 2.5A by means of X-ray crystallography. The protein exists as a hexamer of identical subunits, and is shown to have six DNA-binding domains, clustered around a central oligomeric core when bound to arginine. It predominantly interacts with A.T residues in ARG boxes. This hexameric protein binds DNA at its N terminus to repress arginine biosyntheis or activate arginine catabolism. Some species have several ArgR paralogs. In a neighbour-joining tree, some of these paralogous sequences show long branches and differ significantly from the well-conserved C-terminal region.|$|E

In addition, the retroviral proteins themselves have been co-opted to serve novel host functions, particularly in reproduction and development.

We localized the functional D 108 <b>repressor</b> <b>gene</b> and found that the wild-type and thermo-sensitive D 108 <b>repressor</b> <b>gene</b> products have apparent molecular weights that are smaller (19 Kilodaltons (KDa)) than the thermo-sensitive Mu <b>repressor</b> <b>gene</b> product (22. 5 KDa). Using gel electrophoresis band-retardation assays, we found that the D 108 and Mu thermo-sensitive repressors display different DNA-binding properties.

We mapped the sites of transcription initiation for both the D 108 <b>repressor</b> <b>gene</b> and the D 108 early region operon. Finally, we determined that the host protein, Integration Host Factor (IHF), is required for D 108 lytic growth and that it protects from DNase I cleavage, a sequence that lies within the D 108 repressor operator. Our results suggest that the role of the D 108 repressor may be to repress early operon expression, and thus lytic growth, by preventing the binding of the transcriptional activator protein IHF...|$|E
