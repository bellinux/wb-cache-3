50|$|Low oil {{pressure}} may be simply {{because there is}} not enough oil in the sump, due to burning oil (normally caused by piston <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> or worn valve seals) or leakage. The piston rings serve to seal the combustion chamber, as well as remove oil from the internal walls of the cylinder. However, when they wear, their effectiveness drops, which leaves oil on the cylinder walls during combustion. In some engines, burning a small amount of oil is normal and shouldn’t necessarily cause any alarm, whereas burning lots of oil is a sign that the engine might be in need of an overhaul.|$|E

50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston <b>ring</b> <b>wear),</b> and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E

5000|$|Initial {{power output}} {{was quoted as}} 110 {{horsepower}} -- a little higher than the target figure -- at 3,900 rpm, a rather high power peak for those days. The torque curve was quite flat, however, with at least 180 pounds/feet available from 3,500 rpm {{all the way down}} to 400 rpm, which made for incredible top-gear performance. Though the Zephyr V-12 no more resembled previous Lincoln engines than the ubiquitous V-8 (despite sharing the latter's stroke), it was more like a [...] "12-cylinder Ford" [...] than a classic multi-cylinder powerplant in character. And it was not without problems. The main ones were inadequate crankcase ventilation that caused rapid sludge buildup in sustained low-rpm running, aggravated by poor oil flow, plus too-small water passages that led to overheating, bore warpage, and <b>ring</b> <b>wear.</b> To a degree, some of these maladies were dealt with during the Zephyr's first year, and Ford improved the engine by adopting hydraulic valve lifters for 1938 and cast-iron heads and oiling improvements for 1942.

5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, {{the end gap}} is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a feeler gauge. End gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended [...] "load" [...] of engine. Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of blow-by gases or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or <b>ring</b> <b>wear.</b> (Radial wear on ring face reduces thickness of used/worn ring (face wear in bore) essentially decreasing face circumference of ring and thereby increasing size of ring end gap.) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} engine oil {{consumption}} (OC) was conducted both theoretically and experimentally. It {{was found that}} oil blowing into the combustion chamber through the top ring gap (termed ‘reversed oil’) and oil returning to the crankcase through the oil ring gap (termed ‘blowby oil’) are important factors affecting OC. It was also observed that depending on the ring gap clearance, enlarged because of <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> (for example the radial <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> of 50 pm corresponds to a gap enlargement of roughly 0. 31 mm) or non-optimal ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume, the 2 nd land pressure can exceed cylinder pressure-leading to increasing reversed oil and consequently higher OC.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{several studies}} relating to fundamental characterization of CMP consumables in planarization processes. These are also evaluated with {{the purposes of}} minimizing environmental impact and reducing cost of ownership (COO). The first study is conducted to obtain the retaining <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> rate in a typical ILD CMP process and is specifically intended to investigate the effect of retaining ring materials and slot designs during the CMP process. The results show that retaining ring materials have effect on the COF, pad temperature and retaining <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> rate, while retaining ring slot designs affect the pad surface abruptness. The second study is performed to compare the effect of different retaining ring slot designs on the slurry film thickness within the pad-wafer interface. A novel non-intrusive optical technique, dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence (DEUVEF), was applied to accurately measure the film thickness of the slurry underneath the wafer during polishing. It is indicated that the optimized retaining ring slot design can significantly reduce the COO of CMP processes by increasing slurry utilization. A COF method is applied to measure the slurry mean residence time (MRT) during CMP. This technique uses transient COF data induced by a shift in slurry concentration to determine MRT. Variations in consumables as well as sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate can affect the slurry MRT. One study in this dissertation focus {{on the effect of}} retaining ring slot designs on the slurry MRT. Another study compares the slurry MRT under same polishing conditions using pads with different groove width. Both studies are conducted on multiple sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate variations to understand the characteristics of consumable designs. The method of measuring MRT during polishing presented in this dissertation can be easily applied in general CMP processes. The subsequent studies focus in the diamond conditioner discs characterization techniques. A newly developed method for determining active diamonds and aggressive diamonds on a diamond conditioner disc under a certain vertical load is elaborated in this dissertation.

40|$|A wear {{resistant}} {{internal combustion engine}} component, especially a piston ring, has, on its wear surfaces, a 50 - 400 (preferably 100 - 300) microns thick thermally sprayed layer comprising cubic hard material phases, which contain titanium, carbon and optionally another metal, and a metallic binder phase. Preferably, the layer is formed by thermal spraying of a coating powder having a cemented carbide-like microstructure and consisting of two cubic hard material phases, forming a clad core particle structure with the hard material phase consisting mainly of Ti and C in the core and of Ti, a second metal and C in the cladding, embedded in a binder phase of Ni, Co and/or Fe. Also claimed is {{a process for producing}} the above component, in which the layer is applied by plasma spraying in air or high velocity flame spraying (HVOF), metal ions preferably being transferred from the hard phases to the binder phase by oxidation during spraying.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} method of detecting an automotive engine manufacturing defect known as cylinder bore non-cleanup. This defect is best described as a rough surface finish inside any cylinder bore of an engine. This defect causes increased piston <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> and engine noise and vibration. Recently published literature on engine vibration analysis and defect detection is presented. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} engine dynamic modeling. This study examines the effects of cylinder bore non-cleanup on the motion of the piston rings. This is accomplished by modeling the dynamics of the piston and piston rings using a mass-spring-damper model. The equations of motion are derived and the model is presented in state-space form. The input to the model is the force exerted on the piston rings by the cylinder bore surface. The outputs of the model are the piston ring accelerations or vibrations. These vibrations were analyzed in the frequency domain to determine the dominant frequency components. A bank of bandpass filters was designed to filter the measured vibration data from engines with the non-cleanup condition. This was done to increase the signal to noise ratio in narrow bands corresponding to frequency components predicted by the model. Data collection was carried out using an engine test stand that was capable of measuring cylinder block vibration while the crankshaft is being driven by a motor. Three engines with increasing levels of the non-cleanup defect are tested. The measured vibration signals were filtered through the bandpass filters. The RMS value of the filtered measured vibration signals were calculated. A threshold level of detection was set based on the comparison of the RMS value for good engines and for engines with the non-cleanup defect. Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear of piston rings in a {{hydraulic}} radial piston motor. The piston ring has to satisfy increasing demands for reliability and longer service life. It has two contacting surfaces, the face and the flank, and operates under a boundary lubrication state. This {{first part of the}} project aimed to detect and characterise piston <b>ring</b> <b>wear.</b> Measurement by weighing gives an overall value for wear defined as loss of mass. Two-dimensional form and surface roughness measurements show the distribution of wear on the piston ring face in contact with the cylinder bore and the piston ring flank in contact with the piston groove. Three-dimensional analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, allow the wear mechanisms to be identified. The wear of piston rings from an actual hydraulic motor was characterised. As well, rig testing was performed in two different test rig set-ups, one simulating the sliding movement of the piston ring and the other the tilting movement {{at the end of the}} strokes. Wear during the running-in period was investigated, and the findings indicate that the period when this takes place is of short duration. In the long term, mild wear makes the surfaces smoother than they were when new, resulting in a very low wear coefficient. Significant levels of wear were measured on both contacting surfaces of the piston ring. In cases in which the flank exhibits more wear than the face, the wear on the flank can be reduced by proper design of the piston groove. The second part of the project aimed to evaluate use of a textured surface for the cylinder bore counter surface and a coated surface for the piston ring. Three modelling experiments were performed to characterise the friction and wear properties under lean boundary lubrication conditions. Under such conditions, textured surfaces have the advantage of retaining more lubricant and supplying it over a longer time. Stable friction was also a distinctive feature of the textured surface. Use of a coating could also possibly reduce the amount of wear. Though a smooth surface, like a polished one, is hard to beat for a working texture, a coated surface is far ahead of a smooth uncoated one. Different manufactured and commonly used cylinder bore surfaces, including textured ones, were evaluated in the sliding movement test rig. That allowed favourable wear properties, such as lowest wear coefficient, to be determined with the use of a roller burnished surface. A final part of the research involved simulating wear on the piston ring face throughout the entire service life of a hydraulic motor. This allowed us to determine the roles of surface roughness and coating in prolonging service life and achieving acceptable and secure piston ring operation. The model is simple and realistic, but still needs to be refined so as to correspond even better to reality. QC 2010100...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium silicon alloy {{has been}} found to be {{advantageous}} in many automobile components like pistons, cylinders, brakes and clutches. The main objective in using these alloys is to obtain lightweight and low friction at a reasonable cost without sacrificing reliability and durability. Out of all the tribological components piston skirts, piston rings and cylinder liners, have to face the most hostile of environments in an internal combustion engine. Wear mechanism of these components have been identified as abrasion, scuffing and corrosion. Narrowing down the line of interest, cylinder wear is more important than <b>ring</b> <b>wear</b> to both the engine manufacturer and the user, as cylinders are more expensive to replace than piston rings. Wear of piston ring and cylinder combination have been studied using a wide range of techniques. It is difficult to predict the tribological performance of these parts in an engine, even with the most well designed laboratory tests, due to chemical, thermal and mechanical complexities in the operating environment. Therefore, a good correlation is sought from the wear behaviour of test bed engines and laboratory tests. This should form the basis of further development particularly in terms of efficiency, weight eduction and wear life improvement of the components. Many ASTM bench-wear tests are used to study wear, some of the common tests being ball-on-disc and pin-on-disc testing. From these tests, a large database of wear information can be achieved and they offer rapid and low cost means of comparison. The only drawback is that the real components are not tested. However, since the bench tests can never simulate the engine environment completely, engine tests are always required for final verification. This thesis work reports preliminary studies of machining damage and wear in actual engine bore to set a bench mark, followed by a set of unidirectional sliding bench tests to study the wear of aluminium alloy under lubricated conditions, to classify the different wear regimes in boundary lubrication zone under different pressure conditions, and to study the effect of a surface modification technique, etching, which improves wear properties. The investigation is divided into four parts. 1. Study of subsurface damage in an actual cylinder surface as introduced by prior machining and actual worn case: A study of the microstructure of bores, processed through a range of machining variables; feed and speed, are investigated in this part of the thesis. This work suggests that the first step of rough machining may be responsible for the microstructure of the finished bore even though subsequent processing steps are intended to remove all prior damages. This also includes some observations of worn surface of an actually run engine, locating the various worn spots and studying the cause of this damage 2. Bench wear test in pin-on-disc under dry and lubricated condition with varying load and lubricant: After setting a benchmark on wear in engine using actual worn cylinder bore, a set of bench tests were carried out on aluminium alloy. Here, steel pins are slid on aluminium silicon alloy discs in the boundary lubrication regime in the presence of one drop of oil. The effect of pure hexadecane and engine oil containing additives on friction and wear are analysed and the data are discussed in terms of the formation of a mechanically mixed layer at the interface. 3. Ultra-mild Wear in Lubricated Tribology of an Aluminium Alloy: To study the different wear regimes in boundary lubrication zone, flat faces of cylindrical steel pins were slid on an eutectic aluminium silicon alloy under lubricated condition in the 1 - 100 MPa mean contact pressure range and 0. 2 m/s sliding speed. Two transitions in wear rate were observed, at 10 MPa and 70 MPa. The wear rate in the 1 - 10 MPa regime was found to be very small and within the measuring instrument resolution and also insensitive to contact pressure. The regime is designated ultra-mild wear. Lack of plastic flow, minimal fragmentation of silicon particles and the presence of undistorted voids on the fractured and unfractured silicon particles in the subsurface suggest that the state of stress in the near surface region is elastic. Contact mechanical calculations demonstrate that at contact pressures less that 13. 7 MPa the system is likely to shakedown to an elastic state. 4. Ball-on-disc wear tests for etched and unetched samples: In the fourth part of the thesis, comparative studies have been done between the as polished and chemically treated samples. Formation of grooves in a ball-on-disc experiment is observed on etched and unetched flats as a function of normal load and sliding distance. The groove is initially formed by plastic flow, and then expanded by micro-abrasion as the ball continues to slide on the groove. However etching causes surface hardening of the alloy, but, more importantly, creates a surface topology that reduces the peak contact pressure, which inhibits further plastic flow in the subsurface...|$|E
