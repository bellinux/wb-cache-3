40|$|In {{wastewater}} disposal the unsolved organic and mineral substances that {{are contained in}} the wastewater play a decisive role. In all surveys these solids have not been given sufficient attention, although they significantly influence the operation and service life of drainage systems by forming deposits. In the future, these effects are likely to intensify due to the {{turning away from the}} common practice of draining all stromwater flows that occur on settlement and traffic areas quickly and to the greatest possible extent. The measures taken to decentrally retain or seep stormwater namely have more or less strong influence on the drainage and self-cleaning capacity of a sewer system and thus on the formation of deposits. Furthermore, mineral solids in the wastewater deserve special attention when looking at water pollution caused by organic micro elements as many of these micro pollutants preferably accumulate on solid particles and thus enter bodies of water via discharges from sewer systens. In the face of the importance of mineral solids, special efforts to prevent their entry into drainage systems appear necessary. Based on an analysis of the solids' origin, composition and quantity contained in the wastewater road gullies offer the greatest potential to retain solids. As results of the performed laboratory and in-situ tests as well as a weak point analysis have shown, road gullies that are standardised in DIN 4052 and have been used so far fulfill their function of retaining solids only to a very insufficient level. Here, their productivity is heavily influenced by the practiced cleaning intervals. In order to optimise the retention of solids, the separative <b>road</b> <b>gully</b> (SSA), which is presented in the survey at hand, was developed. It is based on the concept of mechanically separating the solids that are contained in the <b>road</b> <b>gully</b> from the liquid phase. A special system ensures that this is carried out in the most concentrated way and in three steps. In addition, it prevents retained solids from being mobilised irrespenctive of the duration and intensity of precipitation events. The tests and optimisation of the constructive and hydraulic approaches as well as the verification of the functionality and efficiency of the SSA were performed within the scope of laboratory test and in-situ tests over several years. Here, as a comparison conventional road gullies were also taken into account. Improvements in the retention of solids by the SSA arose without utilising its capacities under test conditions. Compared to road gullies that comprise a sediment chamber the performance increased by around 32 % and compared to road gullies with floor outlet even up to 81 %. In this way for the SSA the verification of suitability could be provided as a decentral measure to reduce solid entry into sewer systems. An area-wide conversion of conventional road gullies to the SSA also appears economically interesting in the medium term as the cleaning costs for sewer systems could be significantly reduced...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} a {{brief review of}} rainwater harvesting and rainwater harvesting tools, which are then used in case study examples for domestic, office block and warehouse rain water harvesting scenarios. Rainwater harvesting is placed in an historical context as a source of water supply and in a modern context as being complementary to centralised water distribution networks with benefits for wider water management including flood risk treatment as well as providing environmental and economic benefits. A range of readily available rainwater harvesting tools are presented and compared using data supplied by the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (CBMDC). Rainwater harvesting is discussed in the context of applicable British Standards, from which formula for assessing rainwater harvesting potential and requirements, such as maximum storage tank sizes, are given. Using data from 2008 to 2010 and provided by CBMDC, case study examples are given for rainwater harvesting potential and reductions in rainfall run-off volumes. These include city centre office blocks, domestic properties and estates, and large commercial warehouses: Offices in Bradford are assessed for water demand and rainwater harvesting potential using the ‘RainCycle’ rainwater harvesting tool. The report identifies that whilst reducing demand at source the most effective way of reducing water use, rainwater harvesting can also contribute to reductions in water demand and rainfall run-off even from office buildings with low roof area to occupancy ratios. The report considers rainwater harvesting from individual domestic properties and from a small urban estate using rainfall data, roof area data and alternative methods of determining dwelling occupancy numbers (occupants verses roof area and statistical occupant numbers). Using roof yield coefficients identified in literature and acknowledging the difficulties in determining occupancy numbers (and therefore water demand), the report notes that individual domestic properties can contribute to surface water management though reducing rainfall run-off via rainwater harvesting. This potential is increased as greater numbers of domestic dwellings use rainwater harvesting. Using the same simplistic method of determining rainwater harvesting potential, the report considers rainwater harvesting from large, warehouse-type buildings, firstly by only considering available rainfall collected from a large warehouse, and secondly in considering a large warehouse with comparatively low occupancy rates but high water demand (through vehicle maintenance). Both example detail volumes of rainfall that could be captured, thus reducing run-off, whilst the second example also details potential reductions in mains supplied water through comparing mains water supply volumes with potential volumes of harvested rainwater. As an illustrative example, the report considers the potential for reducing rainfall run-off from a city centre area, and therefore contributing to flood management, should all roof areas be connected to a rainwater harvesting system and disconnected from urban drainage systems. This illustration details the potential volumes of rainfall that could be collected from roofs within a two kilometre square city centre area, detailing an approximate reduction in run-off of 23 %. This compensates for the anticipated increase in runoff that will be generated by climate change {{by the end of the}} 21 st Century. The report briefly discusses and gives examples of the potential benefits associated with rainwater harvesting (reduced energy costs associated with unnecessary cleaning and transporting of potable water supplies, increased capacity in drainage networks, less water abstraction, and potentially reduced demand for reservoir capacity) and uses for harvested rainwater (vehicle and <b>road</b> <b>gully</b> cleaning, urban irrigation schemes, toilet flushing and industrial cleaning operations). Additional benefits include urban flood management and less tangible benefits to the wider environment such as groundwater recharge and reduced water abstraction from rivers. Constraints on rainwater harvesting such as cost factors and uncertainty of economic gains are noted along with uptake by businesses and the public. The report concludes that rainwater harvesting has potential for non-potable water use and wider water management through reductions in run-off, particularly so if implemented within urban areas and on a larger, city wide scale, but that this is unlikely to happen unless an appropriate degree of leadership and coordination is provided...|$|E

40|$|In many {{forests of}} Northwestern Europe old gullies can be found, but {{few studies have}} {{reported}} their genesis and characteristics. This study investigates these old gullies under forest in the large case-study area of Meerdaal Forest, in the Central Belgian loess belt. The objectives are (1) to determine the spatial distribution of these gullies, (2) to measure their morphological and topographical characteristics and (3) to reconstruct the factors that led to their development. In the 1329 -ha study area, 252 channel-like incisions were mapped. Different types of incisions could be distinguished. Besides small and large gullies, many incisions were sunken lanes or <b>road</b> <b>gullies.</b> These <b>road</b> <b>gullies</b> are aligned along north-south oriented lines, whereas the concentration of old gullies is strongly related to the distribution of archaeological sites. Out of the 252 mapped incisions, 43 large gullies and 21 representative <b>road</b> <b>gullies</b> were selected for detailed morphological and topographical measurements. The characteristics of {{these two types of}} incisions were compared with ephemeral gullies formed under nearby cropland. Significant differences in morphology between the three types could be demonstrated. Ephemeral gullies under cropland and large gullies under forest differ significantly in all measured parameters, except bottom width. Both the old <b>gullies</b> and <b>road</b> <b>gullies</b> under forest have a significantly larger cross section and total eroded volume compared with the ephemeral gullies observed under cropland. This indicates that once formed, the old gullies were not ploughed in nor were they filled by sediment originating in their drainage areas, because of limited sediment production. Comparing topographical characteristics (i. e. slope at the gully head and runoff contributing area) of forest gullies and ephemeral gullies that formed under cropland yields important indications about their formation. The larger sedimentation slope of forest gullies, compared with ephemeral <b>gullies</b> and <b>road</b> <b>gullies,</b> suggests that the forest gullies incised on vegetated slopes as a consequence of runoff from the adjacent plateau, where the forest cover was disturbed. For the old gullies under forest, no relation between slope at the gully head and runoff contributing area is observed, probably because most gullies occur on very steep slopes. When simulating arable land-use in the study area, zones where ephemeral gullies are expected to develop can be predicted using published topographical threshold relationships. Comparing the zones where ephemeral gullies are predicted with the position of old gullies under forest leads to the conclusion that gully incision was most probably not triggered by extreme rainfall events and that they are not of periglacial origin. The observed gully pattern can best be explained by local, anthropogenically determined land-use changes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Floating {{emergence}} traps {{were used}} in 15 <b>road</b> <b>gullies</b> to determine the effectiveness and longevity of S-methoprene briquets over 124 days. Samples were taken monthly from October 2014 to March 2015. Two treatment methods were assessed: application of briquet using a float, and application without a float. These methods were compared with untreated control gullies. Mosquito emergence peaked in early November, and decreased by February. Effectiveness of the briquet was not impacted significantly by {{the presence or absence}} of a float (P = 0. 329). Gullies yielded a mean of 108 mosquitoes per day per gully over the season. Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes notoscriptus were the most abundant species. The maximum number of Cx. quinquefasciatus emerging could exceed 1, 600 per day per gully. Aedes notoscriptus numbers could exceed 70 adults per day per gully. Treatment with S-methoprene was highly effective against both species for at least 70 days and partially effective for up to 120 days. Treatment provided no control by day 124. S-methoprene provided 90 % control over 124 days. <b>Road</b> <b>gullies</b> have been confirmed as a significant larval habitat and are likely to be increasing the potential for Ross River virus transmission in the area...|$|R
