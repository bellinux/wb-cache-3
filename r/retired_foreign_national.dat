40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the rapid expansion of}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prison population in the UK against a backdrop of public and political anxiety about immigration and crime.

Whilst increases in both the number of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> entering the UK and the number of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in UK prisons has strengthened the association between immigration and crime in the public imagination, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> are more dangerous than British nationals.

40|$|This {{briefing}} {{looks at}} the startling increase {{over the last decade}} in the number of <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners and highlights their conditions and inconsistent treatment. It argues that their specific needs are being overlooked and that they are not given the attention and support they require – in some cases they are treated with disrespect and experience racism. The Prison Service should implement a policy on <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> that sets out a coherent strategy to improve their predicament. Key Facts and Figures ■ There are 8, 937 <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners (defined as anyone without a UK passport), about one in eight ■ (12 per cent) of the overall prison population. One in five women in prison are <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> ■ They come from 168 countries, but over half are from just six countries (Jamaica, Irish Republic, Nigeria, ■ Pakistan, Turkey and India). A quarter are Jamaicans, by far, the largest single group. ■ There has been a 152 per cent increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners {{in the last ten years}} compared to a 55 ■ ■ per cent increase in British nationals. ■ In two prisons, the Verne in Dorset and the women’s prison Morton Hall in Lincolnshire, <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> ■ make up half or more of the population. In sixteen prisons they make up a quarter or more. ■ Despite their number the Prison Service does not have a dedicated policy or strategy to deal with <b>foreign</b> ■ <b>national</b> prisoners. ■ A recent Prison Service survey found that nearly 90 per cent of prisons holding <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> are not ■ making regular use of the available translation service. ■ The vast majority of <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners, four out of ten sentenced men and eight out of ten ■ sentenced women, have committed drug offences, mainly drug trafficking. Six out ten <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> ■ prisoners are serving sentences of more than four years. ■ Last year eight <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners committed suicide, out of a total of 94 suicides. In the past five ■ years, 35, have taken their own lives. PRT Briefin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in Spain has increased. Our aim was to report the trends in {{hospital}} admissions, differentiating between <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from high-income countries (HICs) and from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in a public hospital. A retrospective analysis of hospital admissions in patients aged ⩾ 15 years between 2000 and 2012 was performed by means of hospital information systems at a public hospital {{in the city of}} Alicante, Spain. During the period of the study, 387, 862 patients were admitted: 32, 020 (8. 3 %) were foreign, 22, 446 (5. 8 %) were from LMICs, and 9574 (2. 5 %) were from HICs. The number of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs, and <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from HICs admitted increased from 1019, 530, and 489 in 2000 to 2925, 2097, and 828, respectively in 2012. A total of 27. 5 % of patients were admitted for pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, especially <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs (34. 3 %), and 14. 1 % of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> were admitted for cardiovascular diseases (14. 1 %), which were more common in those from HICs (26. 3 %). The number of admissions among <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs increased significantly in all the diagnoses, but in pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, the increase was higher. In conclusion, nearly one out of 10 adult patients admitted to our hospital was foreign, mainly from LMICs, and the main reason for admission was diagnoses related to pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of blaming foreigners for crime problems in England and Wales. The contemporary manifestation of this centres on suspicion about the involvement in crime of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and irregular migrants. General descriptive terms like <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> encompass people in widely diverse circumstances and of different legal immigration statuses. Debates about crime and about the management of movement across national borders have become entangled in political debate, to the detriment of clear thinking about either matter. The rehabilitation principle has a different significance and application for <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> in practice if not in law. The limited statistics available concerning the involvement of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in crime and their treatment by judicial and criminal justice agencies, require more analysis. In criminal justice and sentencing, there are no formal requirements for agencies and courts to bring different principles to their decisions about <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> but in practice this group of offenders can be disadvantaged. The context of offending by <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and their distinctive and individual needs are often insufficiently appreciated and too little is done to support rehabilitation and desistance. The perceived political imperative to remove <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> offenders by deportation distorts any principled approach to policy and practice...|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{examines}} the current legal framework governing Fourth Amendment rights for <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> accused of committing crimes within the United States. Over {{the past three}} years, federal courts have tried several cases charging <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> with committing crimes {{through the use of}} the Internet; these cases demonstrate a lack of clarity in the standard for warrant requirements regarding these searches. Utilizing these cases, this Comment creates a hypothetical case that presents the issues of Fourth Amendment rights for <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and seeks to determine how such a question should be answered. It advocates the clear application of United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez to remote cross-border searches conducted by law enforcement officials against <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> It concludes by introducing several suggestions to clarify the standard implemented by Verdugo for non-remote cross-border searches. In addition, this Comment adds a critical view to the rights that should be accorded <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> when accused of committing crimes through the Internet...|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 2013 {{there were}} 10,786 prisoners from 160 {{different}} {{countries in the}} jails of England and Wales. Poland, Jamaica and the Irish Republic formed {{the highest percentage of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in UK prisons. In total, foreigners represented 13% of the prison population, whereas <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> are 13% of the total population in England and Wales. During the 2000s, there was an 111% increase of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in UK prisons. According to one study, [...] "there is little evidence to support the theory that the <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prison population continues to grow because <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> are more likely to commit crime than are British citizens or more likely to commit crime of a serious nature". The increase may partly be due to the disproportionate number of convicted for drug offences; crimes associated with illegal immigration (fraud and forgery of government documents, and immigration offences); ineffective deportation provisions; and a lack of viable options to custody (which affects bail and sentencing decision making).|$|R
