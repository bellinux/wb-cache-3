40|$|The {{majority}} of industrial enzymes available at present {{is used in}} food industry. Safe-ty regulations of food enzymes differ among countries, including fundamental aspects, whether a pre-market approval is needed and {{on the level of}} details, e. g. what particular information manufacturers have to provide in the course of safety evaluation. Occupa-tional safety concerns focus on allergenic properties as it is well established that enzymes are potent inhalative sensitizers and can cause allergic reactions including asthma. Other-wise toxic substances including bacterial toxins and mycotoxins might also be present in en-zyme isolates and might thus constitute a safety risk to consumers. Safety evaluation pro-cedures seem to be appropriate as no incidents have been reported so far, resulting in sug-gestion for <b>reduced</b> <b>test</b> <b>packages.</b> Safety precaution and monitoring measures established by industry have also reduced but not entirely eradicated occupational risks. Challenges to regulators and industry arise from unresolved issues, e. g. whether enzymes might be contact sensitizers, and from the lack of harmonisation of both legislation and safety eval-uation. In the EU, most food enzymes are not covered by food safety regulations neither on Community nor on national level. On top of this the availability of enzymes with new and unusual properties raises questions of safety. In the EU {{there seems to be a}} chance that these challenges will be tackled in the course of establishing a harmonised legislation on food enzymes.

40|$|Background and purpose: Testing the {{performance}} of treatment planning systems by using the AAPM Task Group 23 <b>test</b> <b>package</b> is a useful approach, but has its limitations. To be able to include technical developments, such as the asymmetric collimator, {{it was decided to}} remeasure the AAPM data set on more modern radiotherapy equipment, to extend the test geometries, and to evaluate the use of the new package. Materials and methods: A coherent set of beam data of 6, 10 and 18 MV photon beams was measured on two modern linear accelerators. These data served as input data in seven commercially available treatment planning systems, which were clinically in use in different radiotherapy departments. Next, a <b>test</b> <b>package</b> was measured which included a missing tissue geometry and fields with asymmetrical collimator setting, with and without a wedge. Results: The absolute dose prediction from the different treatment planning systems in which the measured beam data were entered, was compared for all test points with the results of direct measurements. The criteria of acceptability were exceeded by some systems in cases of irregular field geometry and missing tissue geometry. The majority of the systems had difficulties with accurate dose calculation for asymmetrically wedged fields. Conclusions: The application of the new <b>test</b> <b>package</b> did not introduce insuperable difficulties and was highly appreciated by the participating centres. Most systems performed reasonably well {{for the majority of the}} beam geometries, with the exception of asymmetrically wedged beams. The extended <b>test</b> <b>package</b> is available for other users or user group, for the purpose of commissioning new treatment planning systems, or new releases of existing systems.
