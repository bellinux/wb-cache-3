40|$|A {{translating}} flexible beam system {{driven by}} a <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinder</b> using a proportional valve is proposed. Active vibration control of the flexible beam is developed by using a pneumatic cylinder and a surface-bonded piezoelectric actuator. The experimental test bed constitutes a pneumatic circuit, piezoelectric control system, and corresponding interface circuits. Then, a proportional derivative (PD) controller and an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AFSMC) algorithm are designed and applied to vibration control of the experimental system. Experiments are conducted for set-point residual vibration suppression and resonant vibration control under the excitation of the first mode. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} designed controllers can increase the damping of the system to damp out the residual vibration and minimize certain resonant responses...|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} decades, a great {{interest}} {{has been shown}} in pneumatic position servo systems. Compared with that of position servo controls, research on the design of pressure controllers at present is quite limited although the pneumatic pressure control systems have been used in the fields of robots, pressure calibration and various industrial processing systems. In some cases, the pressure controller is designed for improving the control performance of pneumatic position servo system [7 – 9]. In Ref. [7], a position control for a <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinder</b> was investigated. The proposed controller had an inner linearization pressure control loop and an outer position control loop. A PID controller with feedback linearization was used in the pressure control loop to nullify the nonlinearity arising from the compressibility of air. Noritsugu et al. [8] investigated a positioning control system with pressure control loop for improving control performance. A disturbance observer was employed to improve the pressure response and compensate the influence of friction force and parameter change. Igo et al. [9] used a conventional proportional controller with a variable offset pressure controller for achieving quick response and less overshoot of pneumatic robots.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pneumatic {{actuation}} {{systems are}} widely used in industrial automation, such as drilling, sawing, squeezing, gripping, and spraying. Also, they are used in motion control of materials and parts handling, packing machines, machine tools, food processing industry and in robotics; e. g. two-legged robot. In this paper, a Neural Network based intelligent PI controller is designed and simulated to increase the position accuracy in a pneumatic servo actuator where the pneumatic actuator consists of a proportional directional control valve connected with a pneumatic <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In this design, a well-trained Neural Network provides the PI controller with suitable gains depending on feedback representing changes in position error and changes in external load force. These gains should keep the positional response within minimum overshoot, minimum rise time and minimum steady state error. A comparison between this type of controller with a conventional PI type shows that the position of cylinder using a conventional PI controller keeps jittering even when the cylinder reaches the required steady state. This is because of nonlinearities {{that exist in the}} pneumatic actuator. This jitter does not persist when a Neural Network based Intelligent PI type controller is used.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a test method for evaluating air leakage in <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinders</b> with longitudinal slot and sealing band. To this aim a specific test rig {{was developed in}} order to carry out leakage tests under different operating conditions. Specifically, {{the performance of the}} sealing system consisting of the band, seal, and barrel is analyzed, identifying the critical conditions and factors that influence operation. Particular importance was assigned to selecting band and seal cross-sections in order to minimize leakage and thus limit energy consumption. A final rodless configuration with considerably reduced leakage was propose...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} experimental test of a tripod type- 3 UPRR pneumatic parallel manipulator. This manipulator consists of three identical kinematic chains (pneumatic axes) connecting the fixed base and the moving platform. The tool center point TCP of the moving platform is a resultant of relocation of three pneumatic <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinders</b> independ-ently controlled by servo-valves. For simulation purposes a solid model of pneumatic tripod parallel manipulator in SolidWorks was constructed. Since the application of 3 -CAD in modelling kinematics and dynamics of parallel manipula-tors is restricted further simulation {{was carried out by}} means of SimMechanics library and Matlab-Simulink package. The experimental research focused on determining the precision of positioning of manipulator's end-effector point of the moving platform during point-to-point control. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel translating piezoelectric flexible manipulator {{driven by a}} <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Simultaneous positioning control and vibration suppression of the flexible manipulator is accomplished by using a hybrid driving scheme composed of the pneumatic cylinder and a piezoelectric actuator. Pulse code modulation (PCM) method is utilized for the cylinder. First, the system dynamics model is derived, and its standard {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) state-space representation is provided. Second, a composite proportional derivative (PD) control algorithms and a direct adaptive fuzzy control method are designed for the MIMO system. Also, a time delay compensation algorithm, bandstop and low-pass filters are utilized, under consideration of the control hysteresis and the caused high-frequency modal vibration due to the long stroke of the cylinder, gas compression and nonlinear factors of the pneumatic system. The convergence of the closed loop system is analyzed. Finally, experimental apparatus is constructed and experiments are conducted. The effectiveness of the designed controllers and the hybrid driving scheme is verified through simulation and experimental comparison studies. The numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system scheme of employing the pneumatic drive and piezoelectric actuator can suppress the vibration and achieve the desired positioning location simultaneously. Furthermore, the adopted adaptive fuzzy control algorithms can significantly enhance the control performance...|$|E
40|$|Within LiU Fluid {{laboratory}} {{there had}} been a number of hydraulic and pneumatic test stands for research projects and teaching. The effort was needed to do more extension within the field of pneumatics. This thesis was about designing, manufacturing, building and testing the Test Stand for vertical application of pneumatic <b>rodless</b> <b>cylinder.</b> It consisted of three main parts; mechanical structure, pneumatic system and electrical and electronics. The design part focused more on the mechanical structure and pneumatic system. Electrical and electronics had to be installed to facilitate actuation and control of the system after mechanical and pneumatic components were assembled together. The mechanical structure consisted of three main parts; cabinet, carriage and ball balancer. For each part three concepts were generated, evaluated and selected to obtain the most promising concept for further development. The design values were given such that the mechanical structure should have total weight not exceeding 500 kg. The pneumatic system would supply maximum pressure of 8 bar. Upstream pressure was considered to be 6 bar after 25 % pressure drop assumed to occur in the system. The mass to be lifted was typically 26 kg moving at a maximum speed of 2 m/s. The whole design process was carried out with safety and design for assembly in mind. The methodologies applied in the design included; identification of need, concept generation, concept selection, CAD modeling and simulation and FE Analysis. Development of concepts involved CAD drawings (3 D and 2 D) in CATIA V 5, calculations and selection of appropriate materials for each component. The pneumatic cylinder applied in this design was a rod-less cylinder (Bosch Rexroth; RTC-DA, MNR: R 480628571) with a Piston diameter of 50 mm, stroke of 1. 2 m and cushioning stroke of 20 mm. More design information on RTC-DA was not available therefore the information in appendix A was based on series RTC-BV which had close similarities with series RTC-DA. The carriage that moves up and down along the cylinder stroke was designed with a mechanism that imparted disturbance to the system. The mechanism could be set to impart either 100. 7 N or 151. 02 N disturbance. The design was done with the assumptions that:  Spring force Fs and extension x were constant  The system had sonic flow characteristics and critical flow appeared in meter out orifice.  The air was perfect gas which obeyed equation of state  Specific heat was constant  Viscosity was constant  Flow was one dimensional  System pressure drop was 25 % of the maximum supply pressure. Dynamics of the system were estimated analytically and by means of simulation. Corresponding parameter values such as pressure, velocity, flow rate, cushioning stiffness, cushioning force and acceleration were obtained and compared. The product in general conformed to the specifications made prior to the design process...|$|E
