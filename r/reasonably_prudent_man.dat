40|$|Horizontal {{drilling}} and modern completion techniques have transformed the energy industry. As these techniques {{continue to evolve}} and improve, the Texas courts have already recognized that they must remain vigilant {{to ensure that the}} common law achieves sound public policy outcomes and does not frustrate oil production now made possible only through horizontal drilling. This judicial recognition is important because the dominant mineral estate common law, which was developed in the context of vertical wells, needs to be reformulated for the horizontal drilling practices of today. To better achieve sound public policy outcomes {{while at the same time}} providing equitable outcomes to surface owners, this paper argues that the Texas Supreme Court should adopt the following common law rule for horizontal wells: Proposed Common Law Reform: The <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator of a lease on a particular tract should have the same rights to drill a horizontal well on that tract as it would have to drill a vertical well on that tract regardless of whether production comes from beneath that tract, but if the horizontal well that is drilled extends off-tract, then the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator must compensate the surface owner for any surface damages arising as a result of the drilling, development, and production activities related to this horizontal well. The above proposed common law rule seeks to protect the development rights of the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator in the context of today’s horizontal drilling in unconventional shale formations. However, this common law rule also seeks to provide an equitable outcome for surface owners who find themselves burdened by the surface location of a horizontal well. The doctrine of the dominant mineral estate has not been a static doctrine. As detailed in the article, the Texas Supreme Court has reformulated the dominant mineral estate doctrine when that doctrine created a substantial and uncompensated interference of the surface estate. Consistent with this historical evolution, this article argues that the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Moser v. U. S. Steel Corp. provides authority for the proposed common law reform set forth above. Given the importance of horizontal drilling, the Texas Supreme Court should now act to clarify the doctrine of the dominant mineral estate in the horizontal well context to promote the development activities of the <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> operator and to provide more equitable outcomes for surface owners...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{seeks to}} {{determine}} if the CFTC needs new tools to combat disruptive, manipulative, or otherwise harmful trading practices that originate solely from the “minds” of ATSs. Part I of this Article provides a brief regulatory background of the derivatives markets, then examines the increased automation in those markets today, and concludes by looking at the CFTC’s initial responses to the issues raised by automation. Part II briefly looks at the law concerning different mental states for causes of action. Part III examines the CFTC’s pre and post-Dodd–Frank Act tools to police disruptive and manipulative trading practices, which are causes of action that, generally speaking, have scienter or culpable mental state requirements. This makes these tools ineffective in situations where none of the prospective defendants acted with the requisite mental state. Part IV analyzes the failure-to-supervise cause of action under CFTC Regulation 166. 3. It determines that this regulation potentially could be an effective weapon against ATS-initiated behavior that disrupts or manipulates derivative markets because: (1) a Regulation 166. 3 claim does not require proof of an underlying violation of the CEA or CFTC Regulations, and (2) decisions analyzing Regulation 166. 3 appear to apply a reasonableness standard (as opposed to a scienter requirement) in scrutinizing whether a firm diligently supervised its employees and agents in connection with its business as a CFTC registrant. More specifically, although never explicitly stated, Regulation 166. 3 violation decisions appear to apply a reasonableness standard that analyzes whether a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> registrant—as opposed to a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> person—would have acted the same in similar circumstances. Part IV also suggests that, to ensure that Regulation 166. 3 will effectively deter disruptive and manipulative trading practices by registrants’ ATSs, the CFTC could promulgate a rule making clear that a registrant’s duty to diligently supervise its employees in connection with its business as a registrant includes making sure that employees monitor ATSs for improper trading practices. This Article is the first to: (1) suggest that Regulation 166. 3 is most likely the best tool for combatting improper trading practices by ATSs where no human connected to the activities had the requisite scienter; (2) contend that Regulation 166. 3 uses a reasonableness standard that is best viewed as a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> registrant (as opposed to a <b>reasonably</b> <b>prudent</b> person) standard for diligence in connection with supervisory duties; and (3) point out that this standard establishes, as a baseline, mandatory awareness of requirements in the CEA and applicable CFTC and self-regulatory organization (SRO) rules and guidelines...|$|R
