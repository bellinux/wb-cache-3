40|$|AbstractResearch in {{ubiquitous}} {{and pervasive}} technologies {{have made it}} possible to <b>recognise</b> activities of daily living through non-intrusive sensors. The data captured from these sensors are required to be classified using various machine learning or knowledge driven techniques to infer and <b>recognise</b> activities. The process of discovering the activities and activity-object patterns from the sensors tagged to objects as they are used is critical to <b>recognising</b> the activities. In this paper, we propose a topic model process of discovering activities and activity-object patterns from the interactions of low level state-change sensors. We also develop a recognition and segmentation algorithm to <b>recognise</b> activities and <b>recognise</b> activity boundaries. Experimental results we present validates our framework and shows it is comparable to existing approaches...|$|R

5|$|Inocybe maculata has no {{generally}} <b>recognised</b> synonyms.

The form I.maculata f. fulva was named and described in 1991 by Marcel Bon in France. Inocybe maculata is commonly known as the frosty fibrecap.|$|E
