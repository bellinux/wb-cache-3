40|$|The {{excellence}} of Károly Sajó {{as a researcher}} into Hungary’s natural history has been undeservedly neglected. Yet he did lasting work, especially in entomology, {{and a number of}} his discoveries and initiatives were before their time. Born in 1851 in Győr, he received his secondary education there and went to Pest University. He taught in a grammar school in 1877 – 88 before spending seven years as an entomologist at the National Phylloxera Experimental Station, later the Royal Hungarian State Entomological Station. Pensioned off at his own request in 1895, he moved to Őrszentmiklós, where he continued making entomological observations on his own farm and wrote the bulk of his published materials: almost 500 longer or shorter notes, articles and books, mainly on entomological subjects. Sajó was among the first in the world to publish in 1896 a study of how the weather affects living organisms, entitled Living Barometers. His Sleep in Insects, which appeared in the same year, described his discovery, from 1895 observations of the <b>red</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>beetle,</b> Entomoscelis adonidis (Pallas 1771), of aestivation in insects – in present-day terms diapause. It was a great loss to universal entomology when Sajó ceased publishing about 25 years before his death. His unpublished notes, with his library and correspondence, were destroyed in the World War II. His surviving insect collection is now kept in the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest...|$|E
50|$|There {{are a lot}} of insects: mosquitoes, flees, wasps, bees, gypsy moths, green crickets, hornets, {{different}} louses, crickets, ladybugs, moths, butterflies, etc. Among {{agricultural pests}} the widest spreads are: potato <b>beetle,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>beetle,</b> grain weevil and bean weevil.|$|R
40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) were {{assembled}} {{by using the}} bougainvillea flowers, <b>red</b> <b>turnip</b> and the purple wild Sicilian prickly pear fruit juice extracts as natural sensitizers of TiO 2 films. The yellow orange indicaxanthin and the red purple betacyanins are the main components in the cocktail of natural dyes obtained from these natural products. The best overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 1. 7 % was obtained, under AM 1. 5 irradiation, with the <b>red</b> <b>turnip</b> extract, that showed a remarkable current density (Jsc = 9. 5 mA/cm 2) and a high IPCE value (65 % at λ = 470 nm). Also the purple extract of the wild Sicilian prickly pear fruit showed interesting performances, with a Jsc of 9. 4 mA/cm 2, corresponding to a solar to electrical power conversion of 1. 26 %...|$|R

Originally, the dish used raw wolf herring, although in deference to the popular wishes of customers, salmon was later offered as an alternative due to the growing popularity of Salmon.|$|R
5000|$|The pre-cooked {{and finely}} ground filling varies from area to area and {{typically}} includes vegetables and ricotta cheese. The original recipes are the [...] "red" [...] variety (casunziei rossi) with beet, potato, and red Veronese turnips; and the [...] "green" [...] one (casunziei verdi) with spinach, the wild-growing erba cipollina in the filling. Other varieties have fillings of pumpkin or radishes. The filling may included other ingredients such as ham, mushrooms, {{other kinds of}} cheese, poppy seeds, etc. In particular, the casunziei all'ampezzana have a filling of <b>red</b> and yellow <b>turnips</b> and are typically served with melted butter, poppy seeds, and Parmesan cheese. Other servings are sage-flavored melted butter, or a radish-based sauce.|$|R
40|$|Rye is an {{important}} cereal crop {{which can be used}} as a winterhard and well adopted to Poland’s natural conditions cover plant (Borowy et al. 1998). Several authors observed its allelopathic activity in laboratory and field studies (Barnes et al. 1986, Oleszek 1995). The aim of this work was to compare the growth of weeds on no-tilled plots covered with rye mulch and on conventionally tilled plots in a field experiment conducted in the south-eastern part of Poland. Rye was seeded at the rate of 140 kg·ha- 1 on half of the field in the middle of September in the years 1997 - 1999. Following year, in the beginning of May it was sprayed with glyphosate 1440 g a. i. ·ha- 1 plus adjuvant. At that time the rye plants reached 80 - 90 cm height and average fresh weight of their aerial parts and roots was 3, 1 and 0, 8 kg·m- 2 respectively. After two weeks the seeds of snap bean, carrot, cucumber, <b>red</b> beet and <b>turnip</b> were seeded and transplants of cabbage, leek, celeriac and tomato were planted on the half of the field covered with rye mulch and also on second half of the field which had been tilled conventionally. Each vegetable species was planted in 4 succeeding 6 -m-long rows, with interrow distances of 0, 75 m (1, 5 m in the case of cucumber). Weeds were counted by species in four 0, 25 m x 0, 4 m frames placed randomly in each interrow space and then the plots were weeded by hand 3 and 7 weeks after planting. Moreover, at the end of the experiment in the middle of Septembe...|$|R
