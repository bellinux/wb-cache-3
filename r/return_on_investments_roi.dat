50|$|A pumpable-ice-based Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS) {{can be used}} in {{centralized}} water-cooled {{air-conditioning systems}} in order to eliminate peak demand loads at critical times. This reduces the operating costs of buildings, the need for new power plants and modern transmission lines, power plant energy consumption and pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The idea is to make and accumulate pumpable ice during off-peak electricity hours with the lowest kWh tariff. The stored pumpable ice is used during middle- or high-tariff hours to cool the equipment or air supplied to the buildings. The <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> (<b>ROI)</b> takes 2-4 years. In comparison with static and dynamic ice storage systems, the overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) during the production of pumpable ice is more than tens or hundreds of times higher (more efficient) than the same coefficient for the above-mentioned TESS types. This is explained by the presence of many different kinds of thermal resistances between the boiling refrigerant at the evaporator and water/ice in the storage tanks of static and dynamic ice storage systems. The high OHTC value pumpable-ice-technology-based TESS means a decrease in component volume, an increase in the maximum achievable concentration of ice in the volume of a storage tank, and ultimately a decrease in the price of equipment. TESSs based on pumpable ice technology have been installed in Japan, Korea, USA, UK and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

Due to the multiple azeotropes that the organic components in the feed had with water, we had to first explore different methods of removing water. We explored two different approaches in depth – pervaporation and azeotropic distillation. Both processes allowed us to break the azeotropes with water by removing at least 98 wt % of the water and recover at least 88 wt % of pyridine. To get a 15 % <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> (<b>ROI)</b> by the third year of production, we found that the pervaporation method allowed us to pay up to $ 0. 71 /lb for the necessary feed stream, while the azeotropic distillation method gave us a flexibility of up to $ 0. 82 /lb. Using a feed value of $ 0. 71 /lb for both processes, the total capital investment (TCI) for the pervaporation process is $ 10. 7 million with a net present value (NPV) of $ 1. 8 million, while the TCI for azeotropic distillation is $ 7. 0 million with a NPV of $ 6. 4 million.

40|$|In current (4 G) {{and future}} (5 G) {{broadband}} cellular networks, new cell coverage planning ideas, network architectures proposals, novel physical resources allocation optimization techniques, and dynamic spectrum allocation optimization frame works provide good opportunities for mobile service providers (MSPs) {{to improve their}} <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> (<b>ROI),</b> and for mobile equipments manufacturers to increase their profit and market share. Despite the attractive opportunities that network architecture, cell planning and resources allocation optimization offers, there are many challenges and difficulties that are facing MSPs when planning and operating networks {{to cope with the}} tremendous increase in mobile applications and to satisfy different users requirements. Physical resources allocation, spectrum allocation optimization, network architecture enhancement, and fault tolerance cell planning are major issues in broadband cellular networks. The work accomplished in this thesis aims at enhancing the network performance by optimizing the planning and operations of the network. Different optimization techniques are used throughout this thesis to help increase the spectral and energy efficiency in 4 G and 5 G networks. The objectives of this study are four objectives, first to propose a physical resources allocation utility based frame work using a novel utility function that can jointly optimize the maximum normalized spectral efficiency (NSE) and power consumed locally in each cell in order to increase the mobile service providers ROI. The ROI is enhanced by increasing the profits through maximizing the network spectral efficiency and decreasing the operational costs by minimizing the power consumption in the network. The second objective is to determine the optimal down-link frequency partition configuration that can efficiently allocate the spectrum resources to different network frequency partitions in order to globally achieve the same joint optimization objective by addressing the DFPCs dynamic behavior according to the network topology, load conditions, and users distribution. The third objective is to propose a new network architecture that consists of a data collection system that aid as a traffic data repository and a decision support system (DSS) introduced as a new self optimization module within the self organized networks (SON) framework to automate the optimization of the dynamic spectrum allocation. The last objective is to perform a network planning that aims at placing the optimal number of relay stations that aid in achieving network full coverage and minimum rate requirements with a fault tolerance functionality to avoid network failures and using the self organized frame work to perform the self healing by managing the backup solutions needed in response to the network failures. In order to achieve the previously mentioned objectives a detailed study to {{the state of the art}} in network planning using relay stations, physical resource allocation, dynamic spectrum allocation, network architecture and SON frame work is conducted. Different methodologies such as integer linear programming, stochastic programming and non-parametric estimation analysis are presented to propose a novel physical resources and dynamic spectrum allocation schemes. A plan-do-control-act model is also proposed within the DSS in the new suggested network architecture for continuous improvement of spectrum allocation. A non-linear to linear formulation conversion using an expanded space state is utilized to perform an in-band fault tolerance network planning that consider network interference between relay stations and base stations and avoid network failures. Simulations and results are conducted to validate the proposed methodologies and to compare it against state of the art work...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Magister Technologiae: Quality In the Faculty of Engineering At the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) 2013 Advances in internet technologies have created opportunities for facilitating learning and improving performance in education. The applications of these technologies {{have given rise to}} the phenomenon widely referred to as e-Learning. E-Learning has been widely adopted by tertiary institutions globally as a strategic initiative to improve the knowledge delivery process. This study was carried out at a University of Technology (UoT) in the Western Cape, South Africa, where e-Learning technology is used mainly for distribution of course materials. The study focuses on the impact of a web-based e-Learning program on the quality of teaching and learning; with an overall aim of creating awareness {{of the extent to which}} the quality of teaching and learning can be improved through a learning environment that engages an e-Learning program for leverage. The need to maximize the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> (<b>ROI)</b> by the institution on an enterprise e-Learning platform (Blackboard), the learning enablement which educational technologies afford, and the dividends promised by a strategic implementation of e–Learning in enhancing and enriching learning environments makes this study relevant and timely. The research was conducted using the UoT as a case study, and utilised the principles of both qualitative and qualitative research paradigms. The research was based on a review of relevant literature, administration of survey questionnaires to specific faculty and students’ populations, and statistical comparisons of students’ test results based on instruction delivery methods. The findings of this study underline that students’ satisfaction with a teaching method can positively influence how they learn and the outcomes they achieve, that instruction methods can greatly affect students’ performance, and consequently the quality of learning. The result of this study conforms to the view of many authors that instruction methods can be improved by systematic use of specific internet technologies (or simply, e-Learning tools) in the teaching and learning process. It was found that student achieved better results in modules of a subject that were taught using a combination of e-Learning program and face-to-face learning method than in the module taught using the traditional method only. Other emerging findings from this study suggest that lecturers at the institution are biased against the term e-Learning mainly because of their negative experiences with the e-Learning platform, lack of knowledge of the potentials of an e-Learning program and the challenges it poses. However, some faculty members show some willingness to use this e-Learning approach if conditions for its success are favourable with the necessary support systems in place. The main conclusion drawn from this research as a consequence of the findings is that powerful learning environments that meet the needs and enhance the learning of students would be in place at the institution if academic staff are duly aware of the benefits of an e-Learning program to them and their students; and if they are well resourced and capacitated. This study therefore argues for a multipronged approach to facilitate the institution-wide use of e-Learning program in teaching and learning. This includes but is not limited to educating the academic staff on the advantages/benefits of using technology as an effective tool for learner engagement, providing meaningful pedagogical training with the specific aim of preparing them for integrating e-Learning into their teaching, identifying learning objectives and learning processes that can best be supported by either e-Learning components or face-to-face, or by both and adequate support structure...|$|E
