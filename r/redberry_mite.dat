50|$|Overwintering mites colonize tiny spaces {{beneath the}} {{exterior}} scales of dormant buds of blackberries. As the season progresses, <b>redberry</b> <b>mite</b> migration occurs up the flower stem to colonize leaf axial bracts, the fruit's calyx area {{as well as}} the spaces between berry druplets. <b>Redberry</b> <b>mite</b> feeding prevents berries from ripening uniformly, causing from one to many druplets to remain as a bright red cluster on the otherwise black and fully ripe fruit. Affected druplets never do ripen, causing the entire fruit to be inedible and unmarketable. Historically, <b>redberry</b> <b>mite</b> has been most damaging to blackberry varieties such as Chester, which mature later in the summer (August and September). Yield loss to <b>redberry</b> <b>mite</b> damage can range from 10 to 50% of the total blackberry crop.|$|E
50|$|The <b>redberry</b> <b>mite</b> (Acalitus essigi), is an {{eriophyid}} mite {{which is}} a serious pest of commercially produced blackberries in the United States. The <b>redberry</b> <b>mite</b> is microscopic, requiring at least a 20× hand lens to detect. It has two pairs of legs and a thin, translucent appearance.|$|E

40|$|Acarological {{surveys were}} carried out {{fortnightly}} from March to June 2011 on blackberries and weeds in a greenhouse at Fataca Experimental Farm in Odemira, in order to study species diversity and population interaction. This study focused on two blackberry cultivars, ‘Ouachita’ and ‘Karaka Black’. Sixteen mite species were identified on blackberries. The <b>redberry</b> <b>mite</b> Acalitus essigi (Hassan) was the most noxious mite in both cultivars, causing severe damage. However, the late maturing Ouachita cultivar was the most attacked by this eriophyid mite. The most common predacious mites were the stigmaeid Agistemus longisetus Gonzalez and the phytoseiids Amblyseius stipulatus Athias-Henriot and Amblyseius californicus (McGregor). From the 36 weed species identified, 22 were host plants of mites with agricultural interest, 14 mite species being identified. Phytoseiids, especially A. stipulatus, observed on 13 weed species, indifferent tydeids, in particular Orthotydeus californicus (Banks), observed on 10 weed species, and the stigmaeid A. longisetus, observed on seven weed species, were the predominant mites. These mite species also occurred on blackberries. The most important host weeds of mites were Amaranthus deflexus L., Chenopodium murale L., Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronq., Conyza canadensis (L.) and Solanum nigrum L., mainly associated to predators, A. stipulatus and A. longisetus. From acarological point of view, safeguarding the competition relatively to some vegetal species, ground cover vegetation {{can be an important}} component of conservation biological control in blackberry crop, because host weeds of mites are mostly repositories of predacious specie...|$|E
