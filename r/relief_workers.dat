5|$|After {{the passage}} of Typhoon Mamie, more than 800,000civilians and 9,000 {{soldiers}} were organized {{in order to protect}} reservoirs from flooding. By August28, 150,000civilians and 10,000soldiers were fighting against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis. Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist <b>relief</b> <b>workers.</b> The government organized buses and boats to carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 1985, {{one week}} later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the <b>relief</b> <b>workers,</b> their job was over.|$|E

He mentions {{in the preface to}} his play that a <b>relief</b> <b>worker</b> had arrived at a village which had been recently destroyed. When the <b>relief</b> <b>worker</b> talked with the villagers, the <b>relief</b> <b>worker</b> discovered that the villagers were not angry because they were hungry and homeless, but because they had a story that no one would listen to. The <b>relief</b> <b>worker</b> mentioned to Soans, [...] "A huge part of what we call terrorism arises from no-one listening." [...] Soans wanted to emphasise not just the unheard stories of former terrorists throughout the play, but he wanted the audience to hear the tales of everyone involved and affected by terrorism.|$|R

5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Though major {{locations}} held up {{well against}} the earthquake, most villages did not. From Qeshm Island came reports of power outage and minor damage; 100 houses {{in all of}} Qeshm were damaged between 30 and 50 percent. Two-hundred villages were devastated by the earthquake's velocity. Walls {{in the village of}} Zeynabi were leveled; all were reduced by the earthquake to debris. <b>Relief</b> <b>workers</b> were sent to rescue any residents from their homes if they had been caught under debris.|$|E
5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. <b>Relief</b> <b>workers</b> on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E

Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and <b>relief</b> <b>workers,</b> who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{is one of}} {{only three}} major hurricanes on record to strike Mazatlán, the others being the 1943 hurricane, as well as another in 1957; in {{addition}} Hurricane Tico in 1983 came close to striking the city. Reconstruction began immediately, and the Secretariat of National Defense quickly deployed food and water to the storm victims. By a day after the storm's passage, the Mexican Navy sent two ships worth of relief supplies to Mazatlán, including water, medicine, and rescue equipment. Three days after the storm passed through the region, <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> began cleaning up the storm debris.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the storm, the bodies of {{drowning}} victims had been recovered by the hundreds, and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea. One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500, suggesting {{the worst of the}} tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie. The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and <b>relief</b> <b>workers,</b> at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little was known about the extent of losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|The Queensland Government State Disaster Management Group {{dispatched}} relief {{helicopters to}} remote communities for evacuation {{of people in}} flood zones and transport of <b>relief</b> <b>workers.</b> Relief efforts were already underway in relation to Cyclone Larry which caused significant damage in Queensland. The Government of Australia assisted affected business by providing disaster loans up to A$25,000 for severely impacted areas and A$10,000 for less affected areas. Farmers were also provided with up to $200,000 in loans {{over a period of}} nine years. Following the impacts in the Northern Territory, two cleanup teams were dispatched from Darwin to assist in cleanup efforts in the hardest hit regions. Despite the minimal damage caused by Monica, the name was retired from the circulating lists of tropical cyclone names for the Australian Region.|$|E
5|$|The first French {{units to}} come under attack were those {{officers}} accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard. The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated from {{one another in the}} citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines. He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> who were assisting the local population.|$|E

5|$|United States Navy and Air Force troops {{stationed}} at Lajes functioned as disaster <b>relief</b> <b>workers,</b> sheltering {{as many as}} 150 families. Portuguese Air Force members brought supplies to earthquake victims, while a João Coutinho class corvette navy ship transported medical officials to the island. The Portuguese President, António Ramalho Eanes, flew in on a plane accompanied by medical personnel and supplies (such as bedding). Local officials including policemen and volunteer firemen cleared roads for relief supplies and transports. Responding to the situation, these officials were also involved in looking for survivors in the rubble. Soon after, tents were erected to replace the destroyed or unsafe homes for approximately 200 families of the islands. Portable homes were constructed by the People to People International project fund, resulting in 100 shelters.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{communication}} disruptions on Socotra made {{it difficult}} for <b>relief</b> <b>workers</b> to determine the needs of the affected residents. Due to the main port being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from a ship carrying 700tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. The United Arab Emirates sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado {{outbreak}} law enforcement officers, including 30 national guard troops, were sent to Lone Grove to provide security. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Ardmore, Edmond, and Oklahoma City. About 100 volunteers from the Sorghum Mill Estates Neighborhood Association traveled to affected areas in Edmond to help with cleanup efforts. A local restaurant provided free meals to the volunteers as they assisted <b>relief</b> <b>workers.</b> The Salvation Army had two canteens in Oklahoma City, one in Lone Grove, and one in Perkins. About 2,000 meals, drinks, and snacks were provided by the Salvation Army to emergency responders. Feed the Children sent two truckloads of relief supplies to Carter County. They also sent three food trucks, containing a total of 619 meals, 900 drinks, and about 500 snacks, to Ardmore. On February22, the New Life Baptist Church sent drinks and prepackaged snacks, along with items needed for clean-up. Baptist Disaster Relief assisted in Lone Grove with food and emotional care. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) gave away two tickets to anyone who made a donation of $25 or an equivalent amount of food to benefit victims of the tornado. A concert featuring Chris Cagle and other local musicians at Heritage Hall in Ardmore raised over $18,000 to benefit Carter County tornado victims. Another concert set up by the Salvation Army raised $2,300 more for victims.|$|E
