50|$|CISH probes are {{approximately}} 20 nucleotides {{in length and}} are designed for DNA targets. They are complementary to the targeted sequence and bind to it after a denaturation and hybridization step. Only a few CISH probes are available commercially, so for most applications {{they have to be}} extracted, amplified, sequenced, labelled and mapped from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). BACs were developed during the Human Genome Project as it was necessary to isolate and amplify short fragments of human DNA for sequencing purposes. Nowadays, BACs can be selected and positioned on the human genome using public databases such as the UCSC Genome Browser. This ensures optimal complementarity and sequence specificity. DNA is extracted from the BAC clones and amplified using a polymerase-based technique, such as degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP)-PCR. Next, the clones are sequenced and their position on the genome is verified. Probe labelling can be carried out by using either <b>random</b> <b>priming</b> or nick translation to incorporate biotin or digoxigenin.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{method to}} G&T-seq, {{developed}} months earlier, is DR-seq (DNA and RNA sequencing). The primary {{difference between the}} two techniques is the amplification step, where DNA and polyA-RNA amplification occurs without their prior separation. DR-seq uses <b>random</b> <b>priming,</b> where primers containing a common 27-nucleotide sequence along with a variable 8-nucleotide (ad2 primers) bind to different locations on the cDNA. Despite there being multiple (50-250) primer binding sites on most cDNA, each original (i.e. not the product of amplification/in vitro transcription) cDNA molecule is usually primed only once during the initial amplification step, thus creating a single amplicon of a unique length, containing the ad2 primer on the 5' end. The 3' end contains the ad1 primer, which is the original poly-dT primer used for reverse transcription. This unique amplicon is termed the length-based identifier. Importantly, the length-based identifier is created, but not amplified by this quasilinear PCR step. The number of unique length-based identifiers for each gene can then be used to infer the number of original cDNA (and thus mRNA) molecules present for the gene, providing a method of estimating gene expression that avoids the effect of amplification bias. To further amplify the cDNA for RNA-seq, the cDNA amplicons generated by the original PCR step undergoes in vitro transcription using the T7 promoter incorporated in the ad1 primer to ensure RNA transcripts come from cDNA, not gDNA.|$|E

40|$|The use of digoxigenin-labelled probes was {{studied for}} quantitation of HBV-DNA during {{antiviral}} drug evaluation. Digoxigenin (dig) -labelled probes were generated either via incorporation of dig-dUTP in a {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) or a <b>random</b> <b>priming</b> reaction. Using the PCR-labelled probe (delineating a 523 bp fragment in the core gene of the HBV) as little as 1 pg of immobilized HBV-DNA could be detected following an 8 h exposure of the hybridized membrane. A close correlation (r = 0. 95) {{was found between the}} amount of HBV-DNA (range 2. 5 - 200 pg) and the signal generated by the probe hybridized to its target DNA. By using a probe that was labelled with digoxigenin via <b>random</b> <b>priming,</b> the minimal quantity of immobilized HBV plasmid DNA that could be detected following an 8 h exposure was 4 pg, whereas a 32 P-labelled probe, generated in parallel by <b>random</b> <b>priming,</b> allowed the detection of 16 pg of HBV plasmid DNA following a 4 -day exposure. The PCR-generated digoxigenin-labelled probe proved to be useful for antiviral drug evaluation, i. e. to detect HBV-DNA in total cellular DNA from HBV-positive hepatoma cells (HepG 2. 2. 15) that had either been treated with reference antiviral agents or left untreated. The 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50) that were calculated for inhibition of HBV-DNA production by lamivudine (3 TC), penciclovir (PCV), lobucavir (LBV), adefovir (PMEA) and tenofovir (PMPA) were comparable to those reported in the literature. The use of digoxigenin-labelled probes thus appears to be a simple, convenient, rapid, reliable and non-radioactive method for use for anti-HBV screening. In addition, and in contrast to 32 P-labelled probes, digoxigenin-labelled probes can be stored for > 1 year without loss of specific activity, which makes these probes particularly attractive for large-scale antiviral drug evaluation purposes. status: publishe...|$|E

Both schemes are very efficient in terms of storage. However, the schemes need mechanisms to share <b>random</b> <b>prime</b> numbers, which causes huge time consuming computation. Moreover, the public key {{in the scheme of}} Johnson and others is designed to be used only once. In this paper, we improve the computational efficiency of these schemes by eliminating the use of a <b>random</b> <b>prime</b> sharing mechanism while sustaining the storage efficiency of them. The size of our signature scheme is {{the same as that of}} the standard RSA signature scheme plus the size of the security parameter. In our scheme, the public key can be used multiple times, and more efficient key management than the scheme of Johnson and others is possible.

Oligo-dT versus <b>random</b> <b>priming</b> To {{generate}} {{a list of}} transcripts enriched in SP (Table S 6), two additional ML and two additional SP cultures were compared on microarrays in dye-swap duplicate, using oligo-dT priming of mRNA, as in the time-course. Because each gene is represented twice on the arrays, this results in eight measurements of the ratio of transcript levels between SP and ML phase. The average background substracted spot intensity (after normalization on genes) is plotted for each gene in A. Red spots indicate 460 transcripts significantly upregulated in SP after SAM analysis (Tusher et al., 2001) with a false discovery rate of less than 0. 001. The diagonal lines indicate two-fold change up, no change and two-fold change down in SP, respectively. Green spots indicate transcripts significantly down-regulated in SP. The results of applying external control normalization on this data are presented in Figure 2 B of the accompanying paper. It has been previously reported that mRNA polyA tails decrease in size in SP (Sogin and Saunders, 1980). This may effect the transcripts reported down-regulated in SP using the oligo-dT priming. To investigate this, an equivalent analysis was carried out using <b>random</b> <b>priming</b> of total RNA (Tani et al., 2002).
