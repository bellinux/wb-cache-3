50|$|A self-winding watch {{movement}} has a mechanism which winds the mainspring using the natural {{motions of the}} wearer's body. The watch contains an eccentric weight that turns on a pivot. The normal movements of the watch in the user's pocket or on the user's arm cause the rotor to pivot on its staff, which {{is attached to a}} <b>ratcheted</b> <b>winding</b> mechanism. The motion of the watch is thereby translated into circular motion of the weight which, through a series of reverser and reducing gears, eventually winds the mainspring. There are many different designs for modern self-winding mechanisms. Some designs allow winding of the watch to take place while the weight swings in only one direction while other, more advanced, mechanisms have two <b>ratchets</b> and <b>wind</b> the mainspring during both clockwise and anti-clockwise weight motions.|$|R
50|$|The Simplex engines came {{either as}} direct drive or geared drive. The direct drive engines had a <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> {{diameter}} of 14 ft, 16 ft, 18 ft, 20 ft and 25 ft. A 25 ft high tower was supplied as standard, {{but could be}} made to any height a customer desired at extra cost. The blades of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> were similar in design and operation to the shutters on a Spring or Patent sail. Some of the larger direct engines were turned to wind by a fantail. A single or double fantail could be had, per the customer's wishes.|$|R

By {{means of}} site test of horizontal-axis wind turbine tower under {{different}} working conditions, the paper make a further analysis by DASP system and obtained the acceleration spectrum and characteristic frequency; Again to build {{finite element model}} of the tower and calculated it's dynamic characteristics. The measured results and calculative results {{provide a basis for}} avoiding resonance and further study of structure dynamic response of wind turbines tower; In addition, it can provide valuable modal parameter data for wind tower design and structural vibration control. The tower of horizontal-axis wind turbine, on the top of which fits engine-room of great mass and revolving <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> which bring forth live load to the tower. Under the action of natural wind, the different of wind speed, wind direction and wind presssure also will bring forth different live load to the tower. As the combined action of them, the loads would lead to distortion and vibration of the tower. The vibration would not only bring forth the tower's extra-stress which will affect the structural strength, but also affected the distortion and vibration of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel.</b> Meanwhile, it's possible that the tower would resonate with revolving <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> and thus affected the performance of wind unit...|$|R

40|$|A {{wind turbine}} located in Yunnan {{is taken as}} an example in this paper. By using the {{analytical}} method and the finite element method, the modal analysis of wind turbine tower is carried out, then the structural dynamic behavior is obtained. Based on the comparison of the results from different calculation methods, the rigidity and the resonance of tower induced by <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> rotation are studied. The research shows that, the finite element model is simplified, while {{the results of this}} method are rich; the transient resonance inevitably appears for two times in the starting process for the flexible wind tower which has the structure of symmetry basically; while in the normal operation stage, the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> would not induce the resonance for flexible tower. The research provides a theoretical basis for the design of wind turbine tower...|$|R

In addition, the output power of the synchronous generator is the rated power PSN.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Wind {{turbines}} {{consists of}} three key parts, namely, <b>wind</b> <b>wheels</b> (including blades, hub, etc.), cabin (including gearboxes, motors, controls, etc.) and the tower and Foundation. <b>Wind</b> turbine <b>wheel</b> {{is the most important}} part,which is made up of blades and hubs. Blade has a good aerodynamic shape, which will produce aerodynamic in the airflow rotation, converting wind energy into mechanical energy, and then, driving the generator into electrical energy by gearbox pace. Wind turbine operates in the natural environment, their load wind turbine blades are more complex. Therefore load calculations and strength analysis for wind turbine design is very important. Wind turbine blades are core components of wind turbines, so understanding of their loads and dynamics by which the load on the wind turbine blade design is of great significance. 1...|$|R
2500|$|In 1875, the Drainage Commissioners spent £294 on a flash lock, {{which had}} a {{flagstone}} floor, a chamber constructed of white bricks, a timber guillotine gate, and a mechanism for raising the gate made from cast-iron, supported by a timber frame. The chamber was [...] wide, and the mechanism included a winding drum with <b>winding</b> <b>wheel,</b> and cogwheels with ratchets.

40|$|Modal {{testing was}} used {{to show that the}} {{roundabout}} swing was a natural vibration mode of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). During the vibration, the blade root was simultaneously subjected to bending and rotary shear stresses. A method for indirect testing and determination of the dynamic frequencies of the typical vibrations of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> was developed, based on the frequency-holding characteristic of each subsignal during the transmission of the multiple mixed-vibration signals. The developed method enabled simple and accurate acquisition of the dynamic frequencies without destruction of the flow and structural fields. The dynamic vibration stress of the roundabout swing was found to be significantly stronger than those of the first- and second-order flexural vibrations of the blades. By a combination of numerical simulations and tests, it was determined that the pneumatic circumferential force was the primary determinant of the roundabout swing vibration frequencies, the relationship being quadratic. The roundabout swing vibration potentially offers new explanations and analytical pathways regarding the behavior of horizontal-axis wind turbines, which {{have been found to be}} frequently involved in fatigue-damage accidents within periods shorter than their design lives...|$|R
