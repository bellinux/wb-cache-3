40|$|Polyketone fiber is {{considered}} as a reinforcement of the mechanical rubber goods (MRG) such as tires, automobile hoses, and belts because of its high strength and modulus. In order to apply it to those purposes, the high adhesion of fiber/rubber interface and good sustainability to aging conditions are very important. In this study, polyketone fiber reinforced natural rubber composites were prepared and they were subjected to thermal and humidity aging, to assess the changes of the interfacial adhesion and material properties. Also, the effect of adhesive primer treatment, based on the <b>resorcinol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> and latex (RFL), of polyketone fiber for high interfacial adhesion was evaluated. Morphological and property changes of the rubber composites were analyzed by using various instrumental analyses.

The formula of the MOE predicts the MOE of Cathay poplar glulam glued with one-component polyurethane precisely. Three formulae are used to predict the MOR, and Equation (12) predicts the MOR of Cathay poplar glulam precisely. The finite element analysis simulation results of both the MOE and MOR {{are similar to the}} experimental results. The predicted results of the finite element analysis are shown to be more accurate than those of the formulae, because the finite element analysis considers the glue layers, but the formulae do not. Three types of typical failure modes due to bending were summarized. The bending properties of Cathay poplar glulam were compared to those of Douglas fir glulam.

40|$|Sea water {{reverse osmosis}} (SWRO) brine {{contains}} significant quantity of Rb. As an economically valuable metal, extracting Rb using a suitable and selective extraction method would be beneficial. An inorganic sorbent, copper based potassium hexacyanoferrate (KCuFC), exhibited high selectivity to extract Rb compared to potassium hexacyanoferrate consisting of other transition metal combinations such as Ni, Co and Fe. An organic polymer (polyacrylonitrile, PAN) encapsulated KCuFC (KCuFC-PAN) achieved a Langmuir maximum Rb sorption capacity of 1. 23 mmol/g at pH 7. 0 ± 0. 5. KCuFC-PAN showed Rb selectivity {{over a wide}} concentration range of co-existing ions and salinity of SWRO brine. High salinity (0. 5 - 2. 5 M NaCl) resulted in 12 - 30 % sorption capacity reduction. At a molar ratio of Li:Rb (21 : 1), Cs:Rb (0. 001 : 1) and Ca:Rb (14, 700 : 1) commonly found in SWRO brine, sorption reduction of only 18 % occurred. Nevertheless, {{at a very high}} K:Rb molar ratio (7700 : 1), KCuFC-PAN sorption capacity of Rb reduced significantly by 65 - 70 %. KCuFC-PAN was well suited for column operation. In a fixed-bed KCuFC-PAN column (influent concentration 0. 06 mmol Rb/L, flow velocity 2 m/h), two sorption/desorption cycles were successfully achieved with a maximum Rb sorption capacity of 1. 01 (closely similar to the batch study) and 0. 85 mmol/g in the first and second cycles, respectively.

The spherical forms of resorcinol formaldehyde ion exchange resin (sRF) {{as well as a}} hypothetical spherical SuperLig{reg_sign} 644 (SL 644) are evaluated for decontamination of dissolved saltcake wastes (supernates). Both SuperLig{reg_sign} and <b>resorcinol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> beds can exhibit hydraulic problems in their granular (nonspherical) forms. SRS waste is generally lower in potassium and organic components than Hanford waste. Using VERSE-LC Version 7. 8 along with the cesium Freundlich/Langmuir isotherms to simulate the waste decontamination in ion exchange columns, spherical SL 644 was found to reduce column cycling by 50 % for high-potassium supernates, but sRF performed equally well for the lowest-potassium feeds. Reduced cycling results in reduction of nitric acid (resin elution) and sodium addition (resin regeneration), therefore, significantly reducing life-cycle operational costs. These findings motivate the development of a spherical form of SL 644. This work demonstrates the versatility of the ion exchange modeling to study the effects of resin characteristics on processing cycles, rates, and cold chemical consumption.

To separate cesium from waste the media being considered is made of <b>resorcinol</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> deposited on spherical plastic beads and is a substitute for a previously tested resin made of crystalline silicotitanate. This spherical media not only has an advantage of being mechanically robust, but, unlike its predecessor, it is also reusable, that is, loaded cesium can be removed through elution and regeneration. Resin regeneration leads to more efficient operation and less spent resin waste, but its hydraulic performance in the planned ion exchange column was unknown. Moreover, the recycling process of this spherical resorcinol formaldehyde causes its volume to significantly shrink and swell. To determine the spherical media's hydraulic demand a linearly scaled column was designed and tested. The waste simulant used was prototypic of the wastes' viscosity and density.

The effect of finger joint orientation (vertical or horizontal fingers) was also examined. In general, the results from the measurements of modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity of green glued finger-jointed specimens indicated that green gluing of Black pine wood is feasible...|$|R
40|$|Structure {{and density}} of organic RF (<b>resorcinol</b> <b>formaldehyde)</b> aerogels and pyrolized RF aerogels (carbon aerogels) can be {{modified}} upon variation of the resorcinol to catalyst (RC) ratio and by varying the mass ratio of the reactants <b>resorcinol</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> in the sol. Here, series of RF and carbon aerogels have been produced with RC 200, 500 and 1500, each covering a wide density range. All samples were investigated using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), N 2 and CO 2 adsorption. The creation of {{a huge amount of}} microporosity due to pyrolysis was observed and investigated by CO 2 adsorption. SAXS scattering curves exhibit interesting structural changes. These investigation were accompanied by sound velocity measurements to obtain the elastic modulus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Boron-containing bisphenol-S <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (BBPSFR) was {{synthesized}} by formalin method. The {{structure and}} thermal properties of BBPSFR {{were characterized by}} 1 H NMR, FTIR, torsional braid analysis (TBA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The {{results showed that the}} borate had formed, and the six-member ring containing boron-oxygen coordinate structure also formed during the curing process. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of BBPSFR is higher 104 o C than that of bisphenol-S <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (BPSFR); the initial degradation temperature (Ti) increases about 43 o C; thermal degradation rate decrease and thermal stability increase significantly...|$|R
