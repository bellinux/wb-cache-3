2500|$|Iturbide {{returned}} to Mexico on 14 July 1824, [...] {{accompanied by his}} wife, two children, and a chaplain. [...] He landed {{at the port of}} Soto la Marina on the coast of Nuevo Santander (the modern-day state of Tamaulipas). [...] They were initially greeted enthusiastically, but soon they were arrested by General Felipe de la Garza, the local military commander. Felipe de la Garza was notorious in that he had been the head of a short-lived and unpopular revolt during Iturbide's reign. De la Garza gave up without a fight and was presented to Iturbide, who chose to pardon the general and reinstate him in his old post. The roles, as it happened, had not been reversed. Perhaps it was because of this debt that de la Garza wavered in his resolve to detain Iturbide, at first receiving him warmly, then arresting him and, on the way to his trial, de la Garza gave Iturbide command over the military escort that accompanied them, requesting that Iturbide presented himself to the nearby village of Padilla. Iturbide gave his word of honor and did as was bid, surrendering himself to authorities. The local legislature held a trial and sentenced Iturbide to death. [...] When a local priest administered last rites, Iturbide said, [...] "Mexicans! In the very act of my death, I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the love to the fatherland, and the observance to our religion, for it shall lead you to glory. I die having come here to help you, and I die merrily, for I die amongst you. I die with honor, not as a traitor; I do not leave this stain on my children and my legacy. [...] I am not a traitor, no." [...] He was executed by firing squad on 19 July 1824. [...] Three bullets hit him, one of which delivered the fatal blow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{my young}} friend," [...] said I, {{in one of}} those tones of persuasive admonition, which I had so often loved in Glencoe, [...] "let me <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> this admirable poem; you will find in it sources of {{intellectual}} enjoyment far superior to those songs which have delighted you." [...] Julia looked at the book, and then at me, with a whimsically dubious air. [...] "Milton's Paradise Lost?" [...] said she; [...] "oh, I know the greater part of that by heart." ...|$|E
60|$|COKESON. That's right. When a man's down {{never hit}} 'im. 'Tisn't necessary. Give him a hand up. That's a metaphor I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in life. It's sound policy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Adieu. I would <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> keep {{apart from}} all other trades, and {{to see that the}} revelries of to-morrow do not debauch thy people." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{will take}} this {{occasion}} of <b>recommending</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> (if <b>you</b> happen <b>to</b> have Daniel's poems) {{to read the}} epistle addressed to the Lady Margaret, Countess of Cumberland, beginning, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{sensible}} fellow, Joceline, and comprehend always what is <b>recommended</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> This youth {{will not be}} controlled, I fear, by either of us; but we must look the closer after his safety. You keep your watch over that prying fellow the steward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can if {{you make}} the effort, and I am sure you will. My {{experience}} is that {{in the early stages of}} spiritual development we are impervious to certain truths. Will you permit me to <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> certain books dealing with these questions in a modern way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, darling, Mr. Longdon will <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{some nice}} {{historical}} work--for we love history, don't we?--that leaves the horrors out. We like to know," [...] the Duchess {{explained to the}} authority she invoked, [...] "the cheerful happy RIGHT things. There are so many, after all, {{and this is the}} place to remember them. A tantot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{woman whom}} I {{am happy to}} be able to <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> will not stand {{anything}} of that kind," [...] answered Mr. Cranley. [...] "She is quiet, but extremely firm, and has been accustomed to deal with a very desperate character. At one time, I mean, she was engaged as the attendant of a person of treacherous and ungovernable disposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘How do you do, reverend sir?’ said Mr. Grewgious, with {{abundant}} {{offers of}} hospitality, which were as cordially declined as made. ‘And {{how is your}} charge getting on over {{the way in the}} set that I had the pleasure of <b>recommending</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as vacant and eligible?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{extremely}} obliged <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, {{but it is}} not {{of myself}} I was thinking. I only wanted, if I might take the liberty, <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> lose no time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Comrade: Exclaimed to Lucy, “ {{never mind}} it, George, {{you have already}} won laurels {{sufficient}} <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the pretty girls, when <b>you</b> return <b>to</b> port!’’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am aware}} of the statute 1700, chapter 3,' said Alan, 'banishing from the realm priests and {{trafficking}} Papists, and punishing by death, on summary conviction, any such person who being so banished may return. But I have no means of knowing you, sir, {{to be one of}} those persons; and I think your prudence may <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to keep your own counsel.' ...|$|E
60|$|DUTY.--Reckon not on that. But, however, good-night for the present. I {{would only}} <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to think no {{thoughts}} in which I am not mingled--to read no books in which I have no concern--to write three sheets of botheration all the {{six days of}} the week per diem, and on the seventh to send them to the printer. Thus advising, I heartily bid you farewell.|$|E
6000|$|By way of {{an awful}} warning {{to you on}} this score, and also, as {{you say you want}} a true book about Red Indians, let me <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the best book about them I ever came across. It is called [...] "A Narrative of the Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner, during Thirty Years' Residence among the Indians," [...] and it was {{published}} at New York by Messrs. Carvill, in 1830.|$|E
60|$|THE SERGEANT [stealing {{across to}} the coat, and picking it up to replace {{it on the back}} of the chair]. Little Father, the English captain, so highly <b>recommended</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by old Fritz of Prussia, by the English ambassador, and by Monsieur Voltaire (whom [crossing himself] may God in his {{infinite}} mercy damn eternally!), is in the antechamber and desires audience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that {{thou shalt}} hear more in proper season. In the meantime, I would <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> a {{cautious}} tongue, for St. Mark makes no idle jokes {{with those who}} offend him. I am glad <b>to</b> see <b>thee</b> in this state of preparation, worthy padrone, and wishing thee a happy night, and a prosperous voyage, I commit <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> thy patron. But hold--ere I quit thee, I would know the hour that the land-breeze will serve?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hear you}} are {{sent off to}} Lille. I have a cousin there, and have written <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> his care. I will keep my promise, and let you know, if needs be, of what is {{happening}} to the young person we spoke of--Diana." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If the Colonel or you choose, Mistress Phoebe, {{you shall}} {{find me a}} man--I think the gentleman can say {{something}} to the purpose already.-- Probably he may <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{the part of the}} Lady in Comus; and I only hope his own admiration of John Milton will not induce him to undertake the part of Samson Agonistes, and blow up this old house with execration, or pull it down in wrath about our ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, {{above all}} things, I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and which I can never {{sufficiently}} repeat, is, that whatsoever voyage you make, and wheresoever you shall be, you shall endeavour {{to gain the}} love of all people, by your good offices and fair demeanour, by which means you will have greater opportunities for the gaining of souls, which God Almighty grant you all the grace to do, and abide for ever with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For whom or {{for what}} take you me, fair nephew," [...] said Balafre, {{somewhat}} sternly; [...] "I {{have not been}} trained, indeed, in the cloister, neither can I write or read. But I am your mother's brother; I am a loyal Lesly. Think you that I am like to <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> anything unworthy? The best knight in France, Du Guesclin himself, if he were alive again, might be proud to number my deeds among his achievements." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. B.--You are a kind, affectionate creature, Miss Prior. I do {{not very}} much like the gentleman who <b>recommended</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Arabella, <b>you</b> know. But I do think he sent my son a good governess for his children.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hm!" [...] grunted the fellow, very sullenly I thought. [...] "I {{work for}} Farewell in the mornings. Why should he <b>recommend</b> me <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Am I not giving satisfaction?" ...|$|R
60|$|You didn't {{ask me for}} a {{subscription}}-publisher. If you had, I {{should have}} <b>recommended</b> Osgood <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> He inaugurates his subscription department with my new book in the fall.....|$|R
6000|$|... "I depend with {{complete}} confidence on your soldierly and patriotic zeal, {{which is already}} well and gloriously known to me, and which, while I live, I will acknowledge with the heartiest satisfaction. Before all things, I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and prescribe as your most sacred duty, That, in every situation, you exercise humanity on unarmed enemies; and be continually attentive that, in this respect too, there be the strictest discipline (MANNSZUCHT) kept among those under you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have met}} with many strange events, and some {{stranger}} people, {{in the course of}} my experience. But fare you well, Sergeant; I must detain you no longer. You are now on your guard, and I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> untiring vigilance. I think Muir means shortly to retire; and, should you fully succeed in this enterprise, my influence will not be wanting in endeavoring to put you in the vacancy, to which you have many claims." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your lordship {{will forgive}} me," [...] said Anderson, [...] "if I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{in the present}} circumstances, to conceal at least {{a part of this}} generous indignation; we cannot, unfortunately, do our work without the {{assistance}} of those who act on baser motives than our own. We cannot spare the assistance of such fellows as our friend the soldado. To use the canting phrase of the saints in the English Parliament, the sons of Zeruiah are still too many for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did {{not explain}} all his motives to me, and nobody ever gained much by {{attempting}} to force a Thurston's confidence. If you were not my kinsman and were in better health I should feel tempted <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> place your affairs in other hands. Confound the property!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Umph, umph--the {{stranger}} gentleman!" [...] said Hildebrod to Nigel, whom he drew {{a little}} apart. [...] "I fancy the captain has made the stranger gentleman's fortune when {{he was making a}} bold dash for his own. I can tell your honour--I must not say lordship--that I think my having chanced to give the greasy buff-and-iron scoundrel some hint of what I <b>recommended</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to-day, has put him on this rough game. The better for you--you will get the cash without the father-in-law.--You will keep conditions, I trust?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what have}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a father for such permission? Do you not know, sir, {{that when a}} gentleman proposes to a lady it is his duty {{to show that he}} is in a {{condition}} fit for the position which he seeks; that in character, in means, in rank, in conduct, he is at least her equal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is bad news," [...] said Captain Truck, {{listening}} to the fluttering blows of the canvas against the masts. [...] "I never like to hear a ship shaking its wings {{while there is a}} heavy sea on; but this is better than the Desert of Sahara, and so, my dear young lady, let me <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> a cup of this coffee, which is flavoured this morning by a dread of ouran-outangs, as Mr. Saunders will have the honour to inform you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{to see how you}} have been {{employing}} your time, sir," [...] replied the English officer--as indeed the honest gentleman's reasoning had a strong relish of the liquor he had been drinking--"and I could wish, sir, it had been otherwise on an occasion of this consequence. I would <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to try to sleep for an hour.--Do these gentlemen belong to your party?"--looking at the Bailie and me, who, engaged in eating our supper, had paid little attention to the officer on his entrance.|$|E
60|$|This is all I {{have been}} able to screw up to you for this month, and I may add that it is not only more than you deserve, but just about more than I was equal to. I have been and am entirely useless; just able to tinker at my Grandfather. The three chapters--perhaps also a little of the fourth--will come home to you next mail by the hand of my cousin Graham Balfour, a very nice fellow whom I <b>recommend</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> warmly--and whom I think you will like. This will give you time to {{consider}} my various and distracted schemes.|$|E
60|$|The eye {{will endure}} with patience, or even linger with pleasure, on any line that is right, however coarse; while the faintest or finest {{that is wrong}} will be {{forcibly}} destructive. And again and again I have <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> draw always {{as if you were}} engraving, and as if the line could not be changed.|$|R
60|$|This {{good work}} of the Church, in the {{preservation}} and even resuscitation of the municipal institutions of the towns, has been discust so well and fully by M. Guizot, M. Sismondi, and Sir James Stephen, that I shall say no more about it, save <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> read what they have written. I go on to point out <b>to</b> <b>you</b> some other very important facts, which my ideal sketch exemplifies.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My sympathies {{are much}} engaged with you,’ he said, ‘and I should be delighted, I am sure. But our {{position}} is most unusual; and circumstances over which I have, I can assure you, no control, deprive me of the power—the pleasure—Unless, indeed,’ he added, somewhat brightening at the thought, ‘I were <b>to</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{the care of the}} police?’ ...|$|R
