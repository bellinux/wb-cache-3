5|$|Indefatigable and Droits de l'Homme manoeuvred {{around one}} another, exchanging fire when {{possible}} until 18:45, when Amazon arrived. During this exchange, one of Droits de l'Hommes cannon burst, causing heavy casualties on her packed deck. Approaching the larger French ship with all sail spread, Reynolds closed to within pistol shot before <b>raking</b> Droits de l'Homme. Lacrosse {{responded to this}} new threat by manoeuvring to bring both British ships to face the westward side of his ship, avoiding becoming trapped in a crossfire. The battle continued until 19:30, when both Amazon and Indefatigable pulled away from their opponent to make hasty repairs. By 20:30, the frigates {{had returned to the}} much slower French ship and began weaving in front of Droits de l'Hommes bow, repeatedly <b>raking</b> her. Lacrosse's increasingly desperate attempts to ram the British ships were all unsuccessful and what little cannon fire he did manage to deploy was ineffectual, as the rolling of the ship of the line prevented reliable aiming.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. <b>Raking</b> light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
5|$|In early 1799 Prudente was {{operating}} off South Africa, attacking British trade passing {{to or from}} the Cape Colony when the ship was discovered by British frigate HMS Daedalus under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Prudente turned away and Ball gave chase, following the French ship closely. After five hours Daedalus caught Prudente and fired a <b>raking</b> broadside into the stern, disabling the French ship. For another hour the action continued at close range until Prudente was forced to surrender.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Rake</b> {{race is a}} {{competition}} to generate more <b>rake</b> than other players on a particular online poker site in a given timeframe. Points are allocated to participants in a <b>rake</b> race depending on either the number of hands a player <b>rakes</b> (in a <b>raked</b> hand race), or {{the value of the}} <b>rake</b> from the hands which the player has played (a contributed <b>rake</b> race).|$|R
5000|$|Large [...] "mechanized" [...] {{versions}} of <b>rakes</b> {{are used in}} farming, called hay <b>rakes,</b> are built in many different forms (e.g. star-wheel <b>rakes,</b> rotary <b>rakes</b> etc.). Non-mechanized farming may be done with various forms of a hand <b>rake.</b>|$|R
5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden <b>raking</b> cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, <b>raking</b> Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up to this point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several <b>raking</b> broadsides into the French ship.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rake</b> {{angle is}} a {{parameter}} used in various cutting and machining processes, describing {{the angle of}} the cutting face relative to the work. There are two <b>rake</b> angles, namely the back <b>rake</b> angle and side <b>rake</b> angle, both of which help to guide chip flow. There are three types of <b>rake</b> angles: positive, negative, and zero.|$|R
5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the weeding <b>rake.</b> The invention of the Chinese weed <b>rake</b> is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth <b>rakes</b> due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip <b>rake,</b> Y-shaped <b>rake,</b> and square <b>rake.</b> The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip <b>rakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The typical early horse-drawn hay <b>rake</b> was a dump <b>rake,</b> a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved {{steel or}} iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the <b>rake</b> with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This <b>rake</b> gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the <b>rake,</b> turn around and drop the teeth to <b>rake</b> {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep <b>rake,</b> which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|R
5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, <b>raking</b> {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and <b>raking</b> his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a <b>raking</b> ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E

50|$|Side <b>Rake</b> {{along with}} back <b>rake</b> {{controls}} the chip flow and partly counteracts {{the resistance of}} the work to the movement of the cutter and can be optimized to suit the particular material being cut.

50|$|The <b>rake</b> of a ships prow {{measures}} the angle {{at which the}} prow rises from the water (the <b>rake</b> below water being called the bow <b>rake).</b> A motorcycle or bicycle fork <b>rake</b> {{measures the}} angle at which the forks are angled down towards the ground.|$|R
5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted {{to break through}} at several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating <b>raking</b> broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating {{to close the gap}} between herself and her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte. Achille accelerated and closed the gap, and Brunswick turned her fire against Vengeur, while Achille engaged HMS Ramillies and Valiant.|$|E
5|$|The French {{corvette}} {{had been}} struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at Ceylon, the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a <b>raking</b> position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to Ceylon without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although {{it is not clear}} whether Victor opened fire or not before the British surrender). Victors men boarded Ceylon and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The <b>raking</b> fire inflicted massive {{damage and}} {{casualties}} on the French ship, and although Dénian continued to resist for some time, his ship {{was no longer}} effectively able to respond once Saumarez had crossed his bow. Eventually, with Circe now rapidly approaching with a strengthening of the wind, Dénian accepted {{that he had no}} choice but to surrender his vessel after an engagement lasting two hours and ten minutes. The cutter, which had been ignored during the battle, successfully escaped to Cherbourg while the captain of Sémillante, anchored in the harbour, made a fruitless effort to reach the engagement, delayed by contrary wind and tides that prevented the frigate from sailing.|$|E
50|$|A fire <b>rake</b> is a {{wildland}} fire fighting tool. A fire <b>rake</b> has a wooden or fiberglass handle with a <b>rake</b> head consisting of four very sharp, serrated, triangular steel blades. It {{is used to}} <b>rake</b> a fire break with the sharp teeth enabling it to reach fire in undergrowth in addition to loose surface debris. Another type of fire <b>rake</b> which {{looks more like a}} steel <b>rake</b> but with sharp edges on the teeth, and is sometimes referred to as a <b>rake</b> hoe is called a McLeod. The teeth of the more traditional fire <b>rake</b> which resemble the teeth of a great white shark allow it to get deeper into the undergrowth when necessary. But the preference for one over the other is somewhat subjective.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rake</b> {{consists}} of 12 Sleepers, 6 AC Coaches (1AC, 2AC, 3AC), 1 Pantry car, 3 General sitting and 2 SLRs. This train shares its <b>rakes</b> with the Howrah Chennai Mail Since 2008. Thus a <b>rake</b> of the Coromandal Express {{consists of}} 24 coaches with ICF <b>Rake.</b>|$|R

5|$|To the {{surprise}} of Lacrosse and his officers, Indefatigable did not retreat from the ship of the line, nor did she pass the ship of the line at long-range to leeward as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of Droits de l'Homme and opened a <b>raking</b> fire. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy volley of musket fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of Droits de l'Homme and rake her bow, to which Lacrosse responded by attempting to ram Indefatigable. Neither manoeuvre was successful, as Droits de l'Homme raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|While the Dutch rearguard was {{overwhelmed}} by British numbers, a more equal combat was being contested to the north. There the combat was centred around the two flagships, Duncan's Venerable engaging De Winter's Vrijheid 18 minutes after Monarch broke the line to the south. Duncan had originally intended to break the line between Vrijheid and the next ship Staaten Generaal under Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, but Story ensured {{that there was no}} gap between his vessel and the flagship to break through, and their combined fire was so dangerous to the advancing Venerable that Duncan instead cut through behind Staaten Generaal, <b>raking</b> Story's ship twice and causing it to drift off in confusion as Duncan engaged Vrijheid from the east.|$|E
5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a <b>raking</b> broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E

25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the <b>rake,</b> with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned <b>rake.</b> Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the <b>rake</b> would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the <b>rake</b> exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the <b>rake</b> cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the <b>rake</b> on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the <b>rake,</b> CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the <b>rake</b> in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the <b>rake</b> due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the <b>rake</b> to WR. The <b>rake</b> was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that <b>rake</b> would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|R
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating <b>raking</b> fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, <b>raking</b> the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning across her bows to open a <b>raking</b> fire.|$|E
