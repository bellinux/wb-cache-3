5|$|Little Catawissa Creek flows over <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Mauch Chunk Formation for {{its entire}} length. Most {{of the rest}} of the {{watershed}} is also on this rock formation. However, other rock formations also occur in the watershed. A substantial area of the Pocono Formation can be found in the northwestern part of the watershed and large areas of <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Pottsville Formation occupy portions of the southern and western parts of the watershed. Small areas of the Spechty Kopf Formation and the Buddys Run Member of the Catskill Formation are found in the northwestern part of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|On the Olympic Peninsula the Blue Mountain unit at {{the base}} of the Crescent Formation {{includes}} sediments (including large boulders of quartz diorite) of continental origin, showing that the continent was close by; other sediments were eroded from the pre-Cenozoic <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> Vancouver Island and the northern Cascade Range. At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains, while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Idaho Batholith.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross Abbey and Blarney Castle. Historically {{important}} monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
40|$|First data on major, {{minor and}} trace element (XRF. ICP-MS) {{concentrations}} in the volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the IVS 50 th anniversary Fissure Tolbachik eruption are reported for the period from 27. 11. 2012 to 25. 01. 2013; scheme of lava flows distribution by March 2013 is made. The volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the new eruption are substantially {{different from the other}} studied volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Tolbachinsky Dol by their higher alkalis and incompatible elements content. The <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the first three days of eruption (Menyailov Vent) have higher silica and alkalis content than all previously reported volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Tolbachinsky Dol. Volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Naboko Vent, at silica content similar to high-Al basalts of Tolbachinsky Dol, have different concentrations of trace elements and some major elements (K 2 O, CaO, TiO 2, P 2 O 5). REE and other incompatible element {{concentrations in the}} <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Menyailov Vent are higher than in the <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Naboko Vent at the same element ratios. The differences <b>of</b> the volcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the two vents of the new eruption may be caused {{by the fact that the}} erupted lavas came from the different levels of the same magma chamber...|$|R

5|$|The {{geologic}} {{story of}} the Kootenay is strongly connected to the geology of the Columbia, Selkirk and Rocky Mountains. The mountains {{in much of the}} Kootenay River catchment are composed of Precambrian sedimentary <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Belt Supergroup, in turn stratified into several subgroups with slightly different characteristics and ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{light on}} the small <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> Oxcars was {{automated}} as early as 1894. At {{that time it was}} controlled by a clockwork timer and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton gasworks. A lighthouse was constructed on the Bass Rock in 1902.|$|E

5000|$|Barinasuchus (meaning [...] "Barinas crocodile," [...] in {{reference}} to where the type material was found) is an extinct genus of sebecid mesoeucrocodylian. Its fossils {{have been found in}} middle Eocene-age <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Divisadero Largo Formation of Argentina, middle Miocene-age <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Ipururo Formation of Peru, and middle Miocene-age <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Parángula Formation of Venezuela.|$|R
50|$|In other memoirs, {{among which}} may be {{mentioned}} those on the Cretaceous <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Ardennes and of the Basin of Oviedo, Spain; on the (Devonian) Calcaire d’Erbray; on the Palaeozoic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Brittany and of northern Spain; and on the granitic and metamorphic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Brittany, Dr Barrois proved himself an accomplished petrologist as well as palaeontologist and field-geologist.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} groups <b>of</b> igneous <b>rock</b> {{have been found}} within Alexander Island. One group <b>of</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> consist <b>of</b> volcanic and plutonic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Late Cretaceous to Paleocene age. They unconformably overlie and intrude metasedimentary and other <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the LeMay Group and the sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Fossil Bluff Group. Some <b>of</b> these volcanic <b>rocks</b> consist <b>of</b> distinctive magnesium-rich andesites, which were created by the subduction of a segmented ancient mid-ocean ridge about 80 million years ago. Finally, there are several small outcrops of Neogene alkaline volcanic rocks, which formed after the cessation of subduction.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{has twice}} been adapted into a film. A 1919 silent version The <b>Rocks</b> <b>of</b> Valpré was {{directed}} by Maurice Elvey. In 1935 a sound version The <b>Rocks</b> <b>of</b> Valpré {{was directed by}} Henry Edwards.|$|R
50|$|The Gascoyne Complex is {{separated}} from the Yilgarn Craton to the south by a major fault, the Errabiddy Shear Zone. To the east and northeast <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the complex are overlain unconformably by fine-grained Mesoproterozoic sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Edmund Basin and Collier Basin (formerly known as the Bangemall Basin). Several inliers of granite within these sedimentary basins also belong to the Gascoyne Complex. To the west, the Gascoyne Complex is overlain unconformably by sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Phanerozoic Carnarvon Basin. To the north, schist of the Gascoyne Complex probably pass with decreasing intensity of metamorphism into metamorphosed sedimentary <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the upper Wyloo Group.|$|R
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade metamorphic <b>rocks.</b> Many <b>of</b> the <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Blue Ridge {{appear to}} be the metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Others are metamorphosed igneous rocks, including Corbin metagranite, Fort Mountain gneiss, varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks, and the metavolcanic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the Gold Belt.|$|R
5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was one of}} {{the last}} crop of foals sired by Danehill one of the most {{successful}} stallions of the last twenty years, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas, <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan (Winter Hill Stakes), Madison's Charm (Comely Stakes) and Bite The Bullet (Sanford Stakes), and, as a granddaughter of Lassie Dear, is closely related to Summer Squall, A. P. Indy and Lemon Drop Kid.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters also were dug in the limestone <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and a few are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|In the winter, melting snow seeps into {{cracks and}} joints and freezes at night. The {{force of the}} {{expanding}} ice helps to erode the <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.|$|E
40|$|The results <b>of</b> study <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> {{ophiolite}} assemblage exposed on {{the east}} coast of Kasargi Lake are presented. The ophiolite assemblage is formed with the serpentinised ultramafic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> dunite-harzburgite association, which are residual and the shlirenbanded gabbros with a number of later dikes of diabases and porphiritic gabbros. The chemical content of mafic and ultramafic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Kasargi massif shows that they are likely the equivalent rocks encountered within the backarc spreading ridges...|$|R
40|$|Strontium isotopic {{analyses}} {{have been made}} on strontium-rich, rubidium-poor, gangue minerals from several vein-type hydrothermal mineral deposits. These minerals were from deposits in which: 1) Tertiary mineralization occurs within <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Tertiary age, 2) Tertiary mineralization occurs within <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Precambrian age, and 3) the mineralization is Precambrian. The results of these analyses show that the gangue strontium was derived, at least to a very large extent, from the <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> the host environment...|$|R
50|$|Fossils {{of these}} snails {{have been found}} in the Cretaceous <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Austria, Egypt, France, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Yemen and in the Jurassic <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> Argentina, Ethiopia, Israel, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania and Tunisia.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the bridge}} is built on a gravel bed covered by {{shifting}} sand. The north end by the swing bridge section is next to the <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> Figle Fawr {{at the base of}} the Rhinogydd Range of mountains and the river channel here can flow up to 9 knots (16.7km/h). The first two spans here are built directly onto the rock.|$|E
5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived in caves around the <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 2007, Kelly Johnson died of spinal cancer, {{after six}} years of painful therapy and {{treatment}} of her illness. At Kelly’s memorial, Tracey Lamb read the eulogy she had written for her. The band performed a tribute gig on 20 August 2007 at the Soho Revue Bar in London, with many of Johnson’s friends and former Girlschool’s members and a concert for Cancer Research UK at <b>Rock</b> <b>of</b> Ages Fest in Tamworth on 8 September 2007.|$|E

5|$|Soil {{cover in}} the city region is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying <b>rock</b> <b>of</b> the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants {{dating back to the}} late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E
