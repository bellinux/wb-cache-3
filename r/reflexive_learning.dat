The reflective and <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> systems are competitive and neurally dissociable. Relatively {{little is known about the}} role of these domain-general learning systems in speech category learning. Given the multidimensional, redundant, and variable nature of acoustic cues in speech categories, our working hypothesis is that speech categories are learned reflexively. To this end, we examined the relative contribution of these learning systems to speech learning in adults. Native English speakers learned to categorize Mandarin tone categories over 480 trials. The training protocol involved trialby-trial feedback and multiple talkers. Experiment 1 and 2 examined the effect of manipulating the timing (immediate vs. delayed) and information content (full vs. minimal) of feedback. Dual-systems models of visual category learning predict that delayed feedback and providing rich, informational feedback enhance reflective learning, while immediate and minimally informative feedback enhance <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning.</b> Across the two experiments, our results show feedback manipulations that targeted <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> enhanced category learning success. In Experiment 3, we examined the role of trial-to-trial talker information (mixed vs. blocked presentation) on speech category learning success. We hypothesized that the mixed condition would enhance <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> by not allowing an association between talker-related acoustic cues and speech categories. Our results show that the mixed talker condition led to relatively greater accuracies. Our experiments demonstrate that speech categories are optimally learned by training methods that target the <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> system...|$|E

In teacher education, transformative learning impacts {{on the development of}} students’ action theories, self-efficacy and professional attributes. Although considered imperative to reflective practice, not all students take a transformative, ‘double-loop’ approach to learning; <b>reflexive</b> and adaptive <b>learning</b> are also identifiable. This paper discusses the integration of the three learning approaches in the conceptualisation of LEARnT Theory (Jones, 2008), whereby Learning evolves as: Efficacy informs Actions, and Reflection impacts Theory building. LEARnT integrates reflexive, adaptive and transformative approaches. In <b>Reflexive</b> approaches, <b>learning</b> is restricted, action theories remain covert, efficacy remains stable and actions are automated. In Adaptive learning, reflection is ‘single-loop’ in nature; it involves the modification of concepts whilst maintaining existing schema; theories of action, efficacy and behaviours may alter.

40|$|Adaptive {{resource}} management is a learning-by-doing approach to natural {{resource management}}. Its effective practice involves the activation, completion, and regeneration of the "adaptive management cycle" while working toward achieving a flexible set of collaboratively identified objectives. This iterative process requires application of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning, to strategically modify inputs, outputs, assumptions, and hypotheses linked to improving policies, management strategies, and actions, along with transforming governance. Obtaining an appropriate balance between these three modes of learning {{has been difficult}} to achieve in practice and building capacity in this area can be achieved through an emphasis on <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning,</b> by employing adaptive feedback systems. A heuristic <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> framework for adaptive resource management is presented in this manuscript. It is built on the conceptual pillars of the following: stakeholder driven adaptive feedback systems; strategic adaptive management (SAM); and hierarchy theory. The SAM <b>Reflexive</b> <b>Learning</b> Framework (SRLF) emphasizes the types, roles, and transfer of information within a <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> context. Its adaptive feedback systems enhance the facilitation of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning. Focus on the <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> process is further fostered by streamlining objectives within and across all governance levels; incorporating multiple interlinked adaptive management cycles; having learning as an ongoing, nested process; recognizing when and where to employ the three-modes of learning; distinguishing initiating conditions for this learning; and contemplating practitioner mandates for this learning across governance levels. The SRLF is a key enabler for implementing the "adaptive management cycle," and thereby translating the theory of adaptive resource management into practice. It promotes the heuristics of adaptive management within a cohesive framework and its deployment guides adaptive resource management within and beyond typical single-loop learning, across all governance levels...|$|E

40|$|If {{public policy}} sectors dealing with natural hazards are {{to play their}} part in climate change adaptation, the sectors must {{themselves}} be adaptive in their policies and larger governance contexts. Facilitating adaptive governance requires collaboration among many parties in the complex policy domain of natural hazard planning. To benefit from such collaborative processes as well as inquiries, reviews and experience, public sectors need to adopt a <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> approach. <b>Reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> involves explicit consideration of current and alternate policy frames and informal institutions that structure a sector&# 039;s governance arrangements, policy options and practices.

Useful practical and theoretical work is being undertaken to better understand the role of <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> in bringing together different knowledge to address complex problems like climate change. Through a review of practical cases and learning theories commonly used in the areas of resilience, climate change adaptation and environmental management, this article: (i) reviews the theories that have shaped approaches to <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> in large, highly-distributed climate change and resilience-building programmes for development; and (ii) conducts a comparative learning review of key challenges and lessons emerging from early efforts to promote and integrate <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> processes in programmes of this nature.

40|$|If {{public policy}} sectors like fire {{management}} are {{to support the}} adaptive capacity and adaptation of our social-economic-ecological systems, they themselves require a considerable adaptive capacity. Yet when arguing for adaptive approaches to policies and governance, literature concerned with climate change adaptation (CCA) often treat public administration {{as something of a}} mysterious ‘black box’ where ideal policies and implementation are a ‘natural’ results of research and community inputs. Mainstreaming adaptation into a policy sector cannot ignore the structuring influence of a sector’s current policy frames and informal institutions. Even less acknowledged is the role of a sector’s bureaucrats in the adaptive capacity of public policy sectors. To consider these issues, this thesis sought to address the central research question: what capacity for <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> exists within the administration of the fire management sector of Victoria, Australia? The literature review directed attention to several key factors in <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> in public sectors and provided the thesis its theoretical basis, which stems from the following: Policy frames, informal institutions and networks are key influences in a sector’s capacity for <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning.</b> Adaptation in public policy requires a capacity for deliberate reflection upon the policy frames and informal institutions that underlie and structure a sector’s practices, policy options and governance arrangements. It also requires exploration of multiple, alternate frames of the sector’s fundamental issues to increase the adaptability of a sector’s policy repertoire. To enable its adaptive capacity, a public policy sector needs to adopt an explicitly <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> approach. The study combined frame, institutional and network analyses to explore these factors, and provide a more nuanced appreciation of the capacity for <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> than may have been gleaned from a singular perspective. A key methodological contribution of this study was the application of this triangulated analytical framework to a public policy sector and using the perspectives of the sector’s bureaucrats. The policy sector of landscape fire management in the state of Victoria, Australia was chosen for the case study because of its complex formal institutional structure and because its two objectives – disaster risk reduction and ecological management – are often argued to be key CCA strategies. The research identified two dominant master-frames: emergency management and sustainability. While the majority of participants drew on a sustainability frame, the institutional analysis indicated that an emergency management frame is highly institutionalised within the sector. The findings suggest that it may be challenging to introduce perspectives that counter or do not ‘fit’ with the sector’s current policy frames and institutional landscape. The network analysis indicated a complex role for social networks in <b>reflexive</b> <b>learning</b> within the sector, a role that can both close down and open up the sector to new frames or ideas. Overall, this research aims to support fire management in its approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and CCA, and to inform the often called for interchange between DRR and CCA...|$|E

During a three years action research project, four medium-sized companies have undergone a process of substantial change almost completely renewing their organisations for improved competitiveness.

Both fixed-ratio size and reinforcement-period duration were manipulated. Rats were used as subjects, food as reinforcement, and a lever press as the operant. Major findings included (a) a rapid decline in response rates during the first 15 to 20 seconds of the reinforcement periods, and (b) a strong positive relationship between these response rates {{and the size of the}} fixed ratio.

According to the theory of objectification, thinking is not only characterized by its semiotically mediated nature but more importantly by way of its existence as a <b>reflexive</b> praxis.

Little is known about adequate teaching and learning strategies that allow for teaching reflexive skills. The research presented in this paper aims to contribute in this direction. In elaborating reflexive skills we distinguished three components: (i) assessing the relative contributions of scientific disciplines and non-academic knowledge to environmental problem solving; (ii) assessing the role of norms and values in research; and (iii) critically assessing one's own position (in terms of knowledge and values) in research projects. We then present a framework for teaching and <b>learning</b> <b>reflexive</b> skills which is based on the following interrelated core elements: theories on science-society interaction; concrete experiences in problem-oriented research; interactions with others engaged in <b>learning</b> <b>reflexive</b> skills, and explicit reflection tasks. In order to investigate whether and how this framework indeed can be applied for improving reflexive skills we applied an experimental design to an existing course.
