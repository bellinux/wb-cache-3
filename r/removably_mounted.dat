40|$|An {{apparatus}} for transporting core samples {{includes an}} outer tube having an open end and a cover <b>removably</b> <b>mounted</b> {{to the open}} end; a core tube slidable into and out ofthe outer tube when the cover {{is removed from the}} outer tube; and a stabilizing structure between the core tube and the outer tube, the stabilizing structure supporting the core tube within the outer tube with the core tube spaced from contact with an inner wall ofthe outer tube...|$|E
40|$|A {{cryostat}} {{for use in}} a low or {{a substantially}} gravity-free environment adapted to cool an experiment through the use of helium 2, or helium in its super fluid state is characterized by a number of interchangeable daughter dewars and helium supply or mother dewar. A low pressure venting system is provided for converting helium contained in the mother dewar to a superfluid state for use as a primary cryogen. Each daughter dewar is adapted to be <b>removably</b> <b>mounted</b> in mated relation on the mother dewar and is characterized by support for an experiment package, a source of helium to be employed as a secondary cryogen. A heat pipe is suspended from each daughter dewar and adapted to be extended into the mother dewar for facilitating cooling of the secondary cryogen. A transfer of heat from the package to the primary cryogen, via the secondary cryogen, is accommodated as a film flow of helium 2 progresses from the heat pipe to the experiment dewar...|$|E
40|$|There is {{provided}} a {{climate control system}} for a parked vehicle that includes a solar panel, thermostatic switch, fans, and thermoelectric coolers. The solar panel can serve as the sole source of electricity for the system. The system affords convenient installation and removal by including solar panels that are removably attached to the exterior of a vehicle. A connecting wire electrically connects the solar panels to a housing that is <b>removably</b> <b>mounted</b> to a partially opened window on the vehicle. The thermostatic switch, fans, and thermoelectric coolers are included within the housing. The thermostatic switch alternates {{the direction of the}} current flow through the thermoelectric coolers to selectively heat or cool the interior of the vehicle. The interior surface of the thermoelectric coolers are in contact with interior heat sinks that have air circulated across them by an interior fan. Similarly, the exterior surface of the thermoelectric coolers are in contact with exterior heat sinks that have air circulated across them by an exterior fan...|$|E
