Transitional state governments in each district were to be led by military governors general. Grant, who was to select the general to govern each district, preferred the will of Congress through the enforcement of congressional Reconstruction, but at the outset opposed the {{use of the}} military; nevertheless, he adapted, and for example, authorized Sheridan to remove public officials in Louisiana who were against congressional Reconstruction. Sheridan's aggressive methods to register freedmen met with Johnson's disapproval, and the President sought his <b>removal.</b> <b>Grant</b> perceptively stayed the middle course, and recommended a rebuke but not a dismissal. Throughout the Reconstruction period, more than 1,500 African Americans were elected to political office, while Grant and the military protected their rights initially by overturning the black codes in 1867. Congressional Reconstruction finally ended with the Compromise of 1877 and the complete withdrawal of military troops from the southern states.|$|E

An MDC system with DD pretreatment removed 60 or 52 % of boron with the initial boron concentration of 5 or 20 mgL- 1. In the absence of DD, direct cathodic alkalinization of boron in an MDC was not effective in terms of boron removal and had a serious issue of salt accumulation. The MDC with DD post-treatment could reduce the boron concentration below 2 mgL- 1, although the high pH of its final effluent needs to be further addressed.

He communicated directly with his commander-in-chief, President Lincoln, offering his criticisms of the strategies of other generals, including Maj. Gen. George B.

On January 11, 1863, he took Arkansas Post, an expedition suggested by Sherman. On January 17, Grant, after receiving the opinion of Admiral David Dixon Porter and General Sherman that McClernand was incompetent to lead further operations, united a part of his own troops with those of McClernand and assumed command in person, and three days later ordered McClernand back to Milliken's Bend.

40|$|In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Test (SWAT) {{was used}} as a tool to predict whether diffuse water removal from the Cadron Creek {{watershed}} for use with natural gas development would have an impact on downstream flow within the watershed. Cadron Creek watershed expands across four counties within Arkansas and is located in the Fayetteville Shale Gas region. This region is experiencing significant growth in natural gas development. Successful development of shale gas depends on the identification of what water supplies are available for production without interfering with community and environmental needs. The SWAT model used to evaluate hypothetical water removal scenarios was calibrated and validated for accuracy using historical observed water flow (cms) from USGS gage number 07261000 at Wolf Creek outlet. Three scenarios were evaluated using the calibrated model for the 2000 - 2009 time periods. These scenarios are hypothetical, but based on water <b>removal</b> permits <b>granted</b> by the Arkansas National Resources Commission for consumption of surface water for natural gas extraction. The first scenario set up a base level of flow for the watershed, while the second scenario simulated downstream water flow impacts if there was annually consistent water removal.

Sinking funds (SFs) have to be created, out of rental income, that are adequate to finance the long term projected maintenance demand. This paper reviews the use of SFs for building asset management with particular reference to the requirements being made of HAs. Current assumptions of what constitutes an adequate level of SF investment by their funding agencies are questioned with an analysis of case study data. Using linear-programming, the benefits of modelling an SF over merely calculating it are demonstrated. The technique is used to formulate SF strategies, some of which admit the possibility of going into deficit in the future, and these are compared with results from conventional SF projections. Finally, the effect that varying element and component lifespans can have on SF projections are investigated by using Monte Carlo methods to simulate profiles of long term maintenance expenditure, and observing how well funds projected with the original SF strategy match them. The results show the importance of reviewing regularly the SF policy in order that it remains relevant {{to the needs of}} the stock.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} {{a study of the}} strategy adopted by UK research associations which led to success. The success of research associations, being not for profit organisations, was measured in terms of sustainable growth. Research associations were established {{as a result of a}} government initiative to improve the performance of sectors of British industry. Initially they were financed by way of membership subscriptions and a related government grant. With the decline in the size ofthe manufacturing sectors they served and the <b>removal</b> of government <b>grant,</b> research associations have had to make the transition from publicly supported co-operative research associations to independent privately financed research institutes. The identification of the strategy was based on the analysis of documentary archival, interview and questionnaire data. A case study approach was adopted. The research associations were selected and evaluated in pairs to reduce the effect of the external environment, including the influence of the sector the research associations served. Pilot interviews indicated the importance of governance as well as strategy to these organisations. The study therefore included consideration of research associations' governance. The data collected and analysed for case study research associations enabled both their strategy and governance to be classified using the theoretical models of Whittington (2001) and Cornforth (2003) respectively. The more successful research associations were found to have adopted an evolutionary perspective on strategy and a partnership model of organisational governance. Size contributed to success, with the larger research associations exhibiting superior sustainable growth. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

O tratamento, com envolvimento cirúrgico-ortodôntico, visa deslocar o elemento dental para a correta posição na arcada dentária, sem causar danos aos elementos dentais adjacentes, restabelecendo a estética e a função. A colagem direta de botões e braquetes ortodônticos para tração de dentes inclusos transformou-se na técnica preferida, pois exige menor extensão cirúrgica e remoção de tecido para acesso à coroa dental. A pesquisa objetivou analisar a intensidade da força aplicada ao conjunto dente/artifício/fio de amarrilho, pelo tracionamento, e observar o local do rompimento. Utilizaram-se 45 pré-molares, conservados em soro fisiológico 0, 9 %, que foram divididos em 3 grupos (15 com braquetes, 15 com botões e 15 com telas). Os dentes foram fixados em canos de PVC preenchidos com resina acrílica e os acessórios fixados ao dente com resina autopolimerizável. Após a colagem dos acessórios ortodônticos, os dentes voltaram a ser conservados em soro fisiológico e o teste realizado após 72 horas, com a utilização de um sensor de força e um programa de computador (Logger Pro).

40|$|This Article {{is about}} {{deferred}} action and transparency in related immigration cases falling {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). While scholars from other genres have written extensively on the topic of prosecutorial discretion, the subject is largely absent from immigration scholarship, with the exception of early research conducted by Leon Wildes in the late 1970 s and early 2000 s, and a law review article I published in 2010 outlining the origins of prosecutorial discretion in immigration law and related lessons that can be drawn from administrative law and criminal law. That article ends with specific recommendations for the agency that include both codifying deferred action into a regulation and recognizing it as a formal benefit as opposed to a matter of “administrative convenience,” streamlining the array of existing memoranda of prosecutorial discretion floating within each DHS agency, and increasing oversight of prosecutorial discretion to ensure that officers and agencies that fail to exercise prosecutorial discretion by targeting and enforcing the laws against low-priority individuals are held accountable. In this Article, and building upon recommendations published in The Role of Prosecutorial Discretion in Immigration Law, I describe the state of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action in particular by surveying the political climate, public reaction, and advocacy efforts in the last two years. I also chronicle my repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to DHS for information about deferred action, and the stumbling blocks I encountered during this 19 -month journey. The Article will show that while deferred action is one of the very few discretionary remedies available for noncitizens with compelling equities, it currently operates as a secret program accessible only to elite lawyers and advocates. Moreover, the secrecy of the program has created the (mis) perception by some that deferred action can be used as a tool to legalize the undocumented immigrant population or ignore congressional will. This article explains why transparency about deferred action is important and makes related recommendations that include, but are not limited to, subjecting the program to rulemaking under the Administrative Procedures Act, issuing written decisions when deferred action is denied, posting information about the application process, and maintaining statistics about deferred action decisions. Without these remedies, noncitizens that possess similarly relevant equities will face unequal hardships. Background: The Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet-level agency with jurisdiction over many immigration functions. The Department has jurisdiction over immigration “services” such as asylum, citizenship, and green card applications; border-related enforcement actions such as border patrol and inspections; and interior enforcement activities, such as the detention and removal of noncitizens. The immigration court system is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and rests within the Department of Justice. Removal proceedings are initiated by DHS and operate as adversarial hearings at which U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys represent the DHS. On the other hand, noncitizens are entitled to find their own lawyers at no expense to the government. Many noncitizens in removal proceedings are unrepresented because the proceeding itself is considered “civil” and without guaranteed safeguards like court-appointed counsel. At a removal proceeding, an Immigration Judge reviews allegations and charges with the noncitizen defendant, enters pleas, and if appropriate presides over applications for relief from removal such as asylum, adjustment of status, and cancellation of removal. The noncitizen bears the burden of proving that she is eligible for such relief. Decisions by the Immigration Judge may be appealed with the Board of Immigration Appeals. Not every noncitizen residing or entering the United States without legal authority is placed in removal proceedings. Some are removed expeditiously by the Department through other means, while others are considered for prosecutorial discretion. A favorable exercise of “prosecutorial discretion” identifies the Department of Homeland Security’s authority to not assert the full scope of the agency’s enforcement authority in each and every case. The Department’s motivations for exercising prosecutorial discretion are largely economic and humanitarian. According to the agency’s own statistics, ICE has the resources to remove less than 4 % of the total undocumented population. Moreover, many individuals and groups who present redeeming qualities such as lengthy residence, employment or family ties in the U. S., and/or intellectual, military, or professional promise are living in the U. S. vulnerable to immigration enforcement and without a statutory vehicle for legal status. In the first two years of the Obama Administration, such humanitarian cases have swelled in the wake of congressional stalemates over even discrete immigration reforms. At one time prosecutorial discretion was called “nonpriority” and later “deferred action,” but today, prosecutorial discretion is associated with many different actions by the government. For example, a DHS officer can exercise favorable discretion by granting a temporary stay of removal, joining in a motion to terminate <b>removal</b> proceedings, <b>granting</b> an order of supervision, cancelling a Notice to Appear, or granting deferred action. Prosecutorial discretion can also be exercised during different points in the enforcement process, including, but not limited to, interrogation, arrest, charging, detention, trial, and removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{non-return}} of rejected international protection applicants does not enjoy a high political profile on its own, {{but has been}} discussed {{as part of a}} global debate on asylum. Significant efforts are required when considering the wide spectrum of possible reasons of non-return, some reasons depending on the countries of destination, others on the returnee himself/herself. In this respect, reasons of non return range from the non-respect of deadlines, the issuance of travel documents, postponement of removal for external reasons to the returnee, for medical reasons, the resistance of the third-country national and the lack of diplomatic representation of Luxembourg, to name but a few. In regards to the procedure, in Luxembourg the rejection of the international protection application includes the return decision. The Minister in charge of Immigration, through the Directorate of Immigration, issues this decision. The return decision only becomes enforceable when all appeals are exhausted and the final negative decision of rejection of the competent judicial authority enters into force, as appeals have suspensive effects. This decision also sets out the timeframe during which the rejected international protection applicant has to leave the country. In case the applicant does not opt for a voluntary return, the decision will also include the country to which s/he will be sent. In general, the decision provides for a period of 30 days during which the applicant has the option to leave voluntarily and to benefit from financial support in case of assisted voluntary return through the International Organization for Migration (IOM). There are two exceptions to this rule: the applicant who is considered a threat to national security, public safety or homeland security and the applicant who has already been issued a return decision before. The declaration and documentation provided during the procedure of international protection can be used to facilitate return. Subsequent applications are possible, in particular if new evidence of facts appears resulting in an increased likelihood of the applicant to qualify for international protection. For rejected international protection applicants who did not opt for voluntary return and did not receive any postponement of removals, a certain (limited) support is available while waiting for the execution of the enforceable return decision. As such, they continue to stay in reception facilities and to receive certain social benefits unless they transgress any internal rules. If an urgent need exists, rejected applicants may be granted a humanitarian social aid. However, they are not entitled to access the labour market or to receive ‘pocket money’ or the free use of transport facilities. They benefit from an access to education and training, however this access cannot constitute a possible reason for non-return. These benefits are available to rejected applicants until the moment of their removal. In order to enforce the return decision and prevent absconding, the Minister may place the rejected international applicant in the detention centre, especially if s/he is deemed to be obstructing their own return. Other possible measures include house arrest, regular reporting surrendering her/his passport or depositing a financial guarantee of 5000 €. Most of these alternatives to detention were introduced with the Law of 18 December 2015 which entered into force on 1 st January 2016. As a consequence, detention remains the main measure used to enforce return decisions. A number of challenges to return and measures to curb them are detailed in this study. A part of these measures have been set up to minimize the resistance to return from the returnee. First and foremost is the advocacy of the AVRR programme and the dissemination of information relating to this programme but also the establishment of a specific return programme to West Balkan countries not subject to visa requirements. Other measures aim at facilitating the execution of forced returns, such as police escorts or the placement in the detention centre. Finally, significant efforts are directed towards increasing bilateral cooperation and a constant commitment to the conclusion of readmission agreements. No special measures were introduced after 2014 in response to the exceptional flows of international protection applicants arriving in the EU. While the Return service within the Directorate of Immigration has continued to expand its participation to European Networks and in various transnational projects in matters of return, this participation was already set into motion prior to the exceptional flows of 2014. As for effective measures curbing challenges to return, this study brings to light the AVRR programme but especially the separate return programme for returnees from West Balkan countries exempt of visa requirements. The dissemination of information on voluntary return is also considered an effective policy measure, the information being made available from the very start of the international protection application. Among the cases where return is not immediately possible, a considerable distinction has to be made in regards to the reasons for the non-return. Indeed, in cases where the delay is due to the medical condition of the returnee or to material and technical reasons that are external to the returnee, a postponement of <b>removal</b> will be <b>granted.</b> This postponement allows for the rejected applicant to remain on the territory on a temporary basis, without being authorized to reside and may be accompanied by a measure of house arrest or other. In cases of postponement for medical reasons and of subsequent renewals bringing the total length of postponement over two years, the rejected applicant may apply for a residence permit for private reasons based on humanitarian grounds of exceptional seriousness. Nevertheless, apart from this exception, no official status is granted to individuals who cannot immediately be returned. Several measures of support are available to beneficiaries of postponement to removal: they have access to accommodation in the reception centres they were housed in during their procedure, they may be attributed humanitarian aid, they continue to be affiliated at the National Health Fund, they continue to have access to education and professional training and they are allowed to work through a temporary work authorization. The temporary work authorization is only valid for a single profession and a single employer {{for the duration of the}} postponement to removal, although this is an extremely rare occurrence in practice. OLAI may allocate a humanitarian aid might be allocated if the individual was already assisted by OLAI during the procedure of her/his international protection application. All of these measures apply until the moment of return. The study also puts forth a number of best practices such as the Croix-Rouge’s involvement in police trainings, their offer of punctual support to vulnerable people through international networking or the socio-psychological support given to vulnerable people placed in the detention centre among others. A special regard has to be given to AVRR programmes and their pre-departure information and counselling, the dissemination of information and the post-arrival support and reintegration assistance. Indeed, stakeholders singled the AVRR programme out as a best practice and the Luxembourgish government has made voluntary return a policy priority for a long time. However, this increased interest in voluntary returns has to be put into perspective as research shows that sustainable success of voluntary return and reintegration measures is only achieved for a very restricted number of beneficiaries (namely for young, autonomous and dynamic returnees with sizeable social networks and who were granted substantial social capital upon return). Hence, returning women remains a sensitive issue, especially if they were fleeing abusive relationships. Another factor contributing to hardship set forth by research is the difficult reintegration of returnees that have lived outside of their country of return for a prolonged period of time and are therefore unable to rely on social networks for support or for a sense of belonging. Based on these considerations, NGOs and academia cast doubts on the ‘voluntary’ nature of these return programmes, their criticism targeting the misleading labelling of these policy measures...|$|R
