The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E

25|$|More than 20% of Australia’s {{flowering}} plant species and 30% of Australia’s Eucalyptus species are {{found within the}} Great Western Woodlands – making it a highly significant bioregion at a national and international level. The understanding of the biological diversity of the Great Western Woodlands is still being expanded by ongoing scientific work. The Great Western Woodlands account for a significant component of the plant diversity found in the Australia’s South West Global Biodiversity Hotspot. One {{of the main reasons}} why the Great Western Woodlands is biologically <b>rich</b> <b>is</b> its position within the path of significant physical and biotic gradients. It is located in the interzone between Australia’s moist, cooler south-west corner and its desert interior. This means the region has elements of both these climatic zones, but has also created conditions to allow for natural speciation to occur.|$|E

Having lost both Mini and Liv, and now living in Matty's shadow, Nick has a nervous breakdown and smashes up his house with a golf club. Through Matty, however, Nick comes to see his father Leon (Dorian Lough) and his parenting in a more negative light and the two brothers take a stand. In his episode, Alo's parents take him out of sixth form {{to work on the}} farm, and after he causes an explosion they sell all of his belongings. In protest, he throws a massive party and when he confronts his parents, his father suffers a heart attack. Rather than burden his friend Rich, who has just proudly had sex {{for the first time with}} Grace, he goes home and attempts to repair things with his parents. In 'Grace', Grace introduces Rich to her parents; <b>Rich</b> <b>is</b> shocked to discover that her father is headmaster David Blood (Addison). Blood schemes to have Grace's grades slip on her drama assessment, a staging of 'Twelfth Night', so that he can justify removing her from Roundview. Grace sees her dilemma, as peacemaker, through 'Hamlet's sea of troubles soliloquy; she uses 'Twelfth Night' to bring the love triangle between Matty, Liv and Franky to a head, and ultimately receives an A. After Blood still forces Grace to change schools, <b>Rich</b> <b>is</b> inspired by 'Romeo and Juliet' and proposes to her. In the series finale, the two attempt to marry in secret with the gang as witnesses, though Alo's van breaks down. Mini begins to recognise her attraction to Franky, and becomes very protective of her.

After being rescued by Mini, Matty and Liv, Franky reveals more to her friends about her insecurities. Though Blood intervenes and Grace and Rich do not marry, they are happily allowed to continue dating and the gang, solidified as friends, party together at a local fête.|$|E
25|$|Series 6 {{starts with}} the gang on holiday in Morocco; Franky has lost her virginity to Matty but is already {{becoming}} bored, and is tempted by wealthy drug dealer Luke (played by Joe Cole). Mini also decides to take Alo's virginity and swears him to secrecy. Matty pursues Luke and Franky which quickly escalates into a car chase; his truck overturns, putting Grace in a critical condition, and he runs away to avoid being arrested for the possession of the marijuana and ketamine Luke placed inside his vehicle. Back in Bristol, Franky struggles to cope with her guilt and <b>Rich</b> <b>is</b> prevented by her father from seeing Grace in hospital, where she lies in a coma, in 'Rich'. When Mr Blood takes Grace for treatment in Switzerland, Rich squats in the Bloods' home for some time, convinced that Grace is still alive, but after {{a party at the}} house a mournful David Blood informs him that Grace has subsequently died. In 'Alex', new kid Alex, who is a little strange, arrives while the gang are at odds still mourning Grace; Liv in particular develops feelings for him, only for him to disclose to her that he is in fact gay. Nevertheless, they form a close in bond, particularly as Mini remains distant from Liv. In her episode, Franky, overwhelmed with guilt, escapes to 'bad boy' Luke for companionship and excitement. Her actions are negatively viewed, and she quickly becomes alienated. She turns against authoritative figures at school and at home, pushing her to get more involved in her violent and destructive relationship with Luke. During a full-blown fight at a bar, Nick saves Franky and quietly confesses he loves her. After Luke gets rough with her, Franky escapes to a park near home where her father meets her; he is there to fend Luke away when he returns in an attempt to win Franky back.

To get away from it, she clings to her deadbeat dad, Gregory, who she is convinced has changed. Though he abandons her, with the support of Franky she is able to accept her pregnancy.|$|E

500|$|The {{academic}} Nick Rance identifies {{three categories}} of Raffles stories: [...] "the rise of the New Woman", in which Raffles either escapes from romantic entanglements, or uses the infatuations {{of a woman in}} order to achieve his aims; [...] "the rise of the plutocracy", in which Raffles steals from the nouveau riche as much as the upper classes; and those stories that seek [...] "to reaffirm or re-establish a sense of middle-class identity". The last category is based on Raffles not being a member of [...] "Society", only being accepted because of his cricketing ability and associated fame. From this point, Raffles's stealing from the <b>rich</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "rearguard action on behalf of the puritan values" [...] which was perceived as making up middle-class values, although Rance also states that those values are obscured because of the changing boundaries between the classes. Gariepy makes the same point, and considers that [...] "Raffles's daring exploits and fantastic adventures symbolized the growing rebellion against Victorian sensibility {{at the turn of the}} century".|$|E

500|$|Etty {{exhibited}} {{the painting in}} February 1828 at the British Institution under the title of Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love. It immediately met with a storm of derision from critics for the style in which Venus was painted; {{one of the few}} positive reviews was that of The New Monthly Magazine, whose critic considered [...] "the figure of Venus is delightfully drawn and most voluptuously coloured; {{and the way in which}} she awakens love, by ruffling the feathers of his wings, is exquisitely imagined and executed". The Times commented that [...] "the drawing is free and flowing" [...] and [...] "the colouring, though <b>rich,</b> <b>is</b> perfectly natural", but felt that [...] "the subject is, however, handled in a way entirely too luscious (we might, with great propriety, use a harsher term) for the public eye". The Literary Gazette conceded that the painting was [...] "very attractive, especially in colour", but considered the painting's [...] "voluptuousness" [...] as [...] "one of the most unpardonable sins against taste", and chided Etty's [...] "careless" [...] drawing, observing that [...] "it is impossible that an artist who has for so many years, and so unremittingly, studied the living model, can err in that respect from want of knowledge". The Monthly Magazine complained of Venus's [...] "sullen colour and corpulent shape", as well as Etty's [...] "excessive exposure of [...] figure". La Belle Assemblée, meanwhile, felt that Etty's representation of Venus [...] "though a fine voluptuous woman, is not, either in supremacy of beauty, or according to any received description of the love-inspiring goddess, a Venus", and complained that [...] "the colouring of the flesh is chalky".|$|E

2500|$|One {{critique}} of globalization is that natural {{resources of the}} poor have been systematically {{taken over by the}} rich and the pollution promulgated by the <b>rich</b> <b>is</b> systematically dumped on the poor.

2500|$|From his {{definition}} of wealth, Hall argued that the problem in civilised societies came from {{the ability of the}} wealthy, through their control of the labour of others, to determine what is produced. [...] Because the wealthy quickly provide for their own necessities, they spend their surplus on luxuries, which [...] "make it possible for a rich man to consume and destroy infinitely more of the produce of other men's labours than {{he would be able to}} do if only foodstuffs and basic necessities were available". Because the rich exploit the poor to produce their luxuries, Hall argued that [...] "the wealth of the rich and the misery of the poor increase in strict proportion".
