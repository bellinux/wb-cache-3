5000|$|For the sulphur ball of von Guericke (1671) and {{the glass}} globe of Isaac Newton (some say Hauksbee), Gordon {{substituted}} a glass cylinder which made an efficient frictional machine. Two other inventions in physics are noteworthy: {{the first is the}} light metallic star supported on a sharp pivot with the pointed ends bent at right angles to the rays and commonly called the electrical whirl, the second is the device known as the electric chimes. These inventions used to be described in textbooks of electricity; the name of Gordon was not always mentioned, though both inventions are fully described by him in his Versuch einer Erklarung der Electricitat (Erfurt 1745). Benjamin Franklin, who is usually credited with the latter invention, simply adopted the [...] "German chimes" [...] (described by Watson in his famous Sequel, 1746) to serve as an electrical annunciator in connection with his experimental lightning rod of 1752. The [...] "whirl" [...] was an electrostatic <b>reaction</b> <b>motor,</b> the earliest of its kind; while the second derives its theoretical importance as the first instance of the application of what came to be called electric convection.|$|E

40|$|Keywords:Aluminum/Water Reaction Motor;Water {{injection}} angle;Phase transition;Evaporation rate;Axial injection angle;Tangential injection angle Abstract. In Aluminum/Water <b>Reaction</b> <b>Motor</b> chamber, {{water injection}} angle {{plays an important}} role on mixture of aluminum particle fuel and water droplets and can affect motor performance further. On the basis of FLUENT software and taking phase transition and reaction between water droplets and aluminum particles into account, numerically simulated cases of different water injection angles by Particle Stochastic Trajectory Model. Computed total evaporation rate of water droplets, reaction rate of aluminum particles and specific impulse for the motor. Furthermore judged injection angle effect from these parameters. By comparison and analysis, it is found that hybrid injection case could get best multi-phase mixture effect and specific impulse performance for the motor. Namely axial injection angle with 45 °in the main chamber and tangential injection angle with 60 °in the afterburning chamber is the best case. The conclusion could provide a new idea for motor working process design...|$|E
40|$|AbstractColonoscopy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common procedures. Sedation and {{analgesia}} decrease anxiety and discomfort and minimize risks. Therefore, patients prefer to be sedated when undergoing examination, although the best combination of drugs has not been determined. The combination of opioids and benzodiazepines is used to relieve the patient's pain and discomfort. More recently, propofol has assumed a prominent position. This randomized prospective study is unique in medical literature that specifically compared the use of propofol and fentanyl with or without midazolam for colonoscopy sedation performed by anesthesiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the side effects of sedation, discharge conditions, quality of sedation, and propofol consumption during colonoscopy, with or without midazolam as preanesthetic. The study involved 140 patients who underwent colonoscopy at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I received intravenous midazolam as preanesthetic 5 min before sedation, followed by fentanyl and propofol; Group II received intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol. Patients in Group II had a higher incidence of <b>reaction</b> (<b>motor</b> or verbal) to the colonoscope introduction, bradycardia, hypotension, and increased propofol consumption. Patient satisfaction was higher in Group I. According to the methodology used, the combination of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol for colonoscopy sedation reduces propofol consumption and provides greater patient satisfaction...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Reaction</b> <b>Motors</b> XLR99 {{engine was}} the first large, throttleable, restartable liquid-propellant rocket engine. Development began in the 1950s by the <b>Reaction</b> <b>Motors</b> Division of Thiokol Chemical Company to power the North American X-15 {{hypersonic}} research aircraft. It could deliver up to 57,000 pounds force (254 kN) of thrust with an Isp of 279 seconds (239 seconds sl).

5000|$|When the Vanguard rocket was {{selected}} as the first orbital launch vehicle for the US, Martin Company got the contract as prime contractor.

[...] Thus, on October 1, 1955 Martin purchase order 55-3516-CP was signed with General Electric for the X-405 engine for furnishing a self-contained unit which was to include the thrust structure, gimbal ring, engine components, and engine starting equipment.|$|R
