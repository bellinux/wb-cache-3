50|$|Big Boss Man met Steve Austin on {{the walkway}} for their fight, with Austin {{throwing}} Boss Man into the steel steps before the match was officially under way. Inside the <b>ring</b> <b>Boss</b> Man used his punches to subdue Austin before choking {{him in the}} middle of the ring. Crowd support inspired Austin to fight back with a clothesline, shoulder barging his opponent into the turnbuckle before stomping a mudhole. After being Irish whipped against the ropes, Boss Man escaped the ring and when Austin caught up with him, he was met with a night stick from the Boss Man. The referee awarded the match via disqualification to Austin but that did not stop the onslaught from Boss Man's nightstick, much to the delight of Mr. McMahon.|$|E
50|$|The third match {{began with}} Big Boss Man gaining an {{advantage}} by delivering a low blow to Mideon. He then chased {{him out the}} ring with a chair but hit it against the ring post after which Mideon countered by biting Boss Man's fingers. Inside the <b>ring</b> <b>Boss</b> Man dominated Mideon, throwing him round and jumping on him, using the ropes to choke him and jump on him. Although Mideon offered some attempts at fighting back, he ran into a Big Boss Slam and was pinned. As the match ended, the ring was surrounded by the Ministry of Darkness and the lights then went off as The Undertaker {{made his way to}} the ring. When the lights came back on Boss Man was being held down in the ring while Viscera delivered three big splashes to him before being carried away by the Ministry.|$|E
50|$|The opening match began slowly, with Boss Man taunting Road Dogg {{and being}} {{met with a}} crotch chop. The two circled each other, {{occasionally}} going in for a grapple but without achieving a move. Eventually Road Dogg became trapped {{in the corner and}} Boss Man punched him. Road Dogg found some short success when Boss Man tried to run and jump onto him, but was left with his crotch caught on the ropes. Boss Man tried to reply with his night stick but referee Mike Chioda stopped him and while he was being reprimanded, Road Dogg dragged him to his feet and pulled him into the ring post, legs open. After recovering, Boss Man threw Road Dogg outside of the ring. Inside the <b>ring</b> <b>Boss</b> Man took to hurling his opponent into the turnbuckles and then crushing him with a bear hug. Despite some punching back from Road Dogg, Boss Man dominated most of the match from this point and despite a Shake, Rattle & Roll from Road Dogg, Boss Man used his opponent's momentum to catch him in the Boss Man Slam, pinning him afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{originally}} constructed {{by a member}} of the corrupt political <b>ring</b> of <b>Boss</b> Tweed [...] "Slippery Dick" [...] Richard B. Connolly. After Connolly had to flee the country, it was bought by the industrialist Jordan L. Mott and subsequently completed in 1880.|$|R

5|$|The third {{televised}} match {{featured the}} Big Boss Man facing Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow attacked Boss Man before the match and controlled the match's beginning by using power moves to wear Boss Man down. Boss Man performed two clotheslines on Bigelow {{to gain the}} advantage. Bigelow responded by throwing Boss Man with a belly to back suplex, and then threw {{him out of the}} <b>ring.</b> He wore <b>Boss</b> Man down with a bear hug. Boss Man briefly regained the advantage by suplexing Bigelow but eventually tried to run at Bigelow to crush him {{in the corner of the}} <b>ring.</b> As <b>Boss</b> Man approached, Bigelow kicked him in the face and followed this up by performing a diving headbutt from the top rope to win the match by pinfall.|$|R
50|$|The Hell in a Cell match {{began with}} Big Boss Man {{punching}} The Undertaker {{into the corner}} until he ducked out and returned the same. Although Boss Man was able to deliver a swinging neckbreaker, Undertaker took control again throwing Boss Man into the cell. Boss Man reversed an Irish whip and threw Undertaker into the cell too, handcuffing one hand to the chain fence. Boss Man taunted Undertaker's lack of control before striking him repeatedly with his night stick causing Undertaker to {{fall to the floor}} and rip the handcuffs, though Boss Man carried on using the nightstick and cut Undertaker open. Undertaker fought back by grabbing Boss Man at the throat and throwing him back into the fence again, striking him with a chair and running Boss Man face-first into the chain fence with a fireman's carry. As the two returned to the <b>ring</b> <b>Boss</b> Man tried to clothesline Undertaker but he ducked and performed a leaping flying clothesline of his own before going Old School, ultimately falling into the ropes. The two began a fist fight {{in the middle of the}} ring with Undertaker failing a tombstone piledriver attempt, but successfully performing it seconds later and pinned him afterwards. Undertaker stood up and looked to the heavens with his hands upwards, signaling The Brood to descend onto the roof of the cell. They cut open the roof of the cell and passed through a noose, securing the other end to the top of the cell. The Brood then ascended back into the rafters as Undertaker put the noose around Boss Man's neck, with Paul Bearer causing the Cell to rise and take a hanging Boss Man with it. After the match a video package of the Rage Party was shown while Boss Man was taken down and carried off on a stretcher.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the stages}} are many enemies waiting to attack Sonic, so the player must remain {{aware of their}} surroundings. Sonic is only able to collect <b>rings</b> during <b>Boss</b> fights (and before each of these fights as he rolls down a steep incline toward the Boss) but the player will lose a life if Sonic is hit twice {{regardless}} of how many rings he possesses. If Sonic is not holding any rings, he will only take one hit. Whilst holding the keys, Sonic can withstand a few enemy attacks.|$|R
25|$|It {{was during}} the same period that Gould and Fisk became {{involved}} with Tammany Hall, the New York City political <b>ring.</b> They made <b>Boss</b> Tweed a director of the Erie Railroad, and Tweed, in return, arranged favorable legislation for them. Tweed and Gould became the subjects of political cartoons by Thomas Nast in 1869. In October 1871, when Tweed was held on $1 million bail, Gould was the chief bondsman.|$|R
5000|$|Stopping {{off in a}} bar, {{they hear}} from a news flash that the actress has tried to kill herself and is in hospital. Bluffing their way into her room, they bully the distressed woman into telling the truth: the {{ambassador}} is dead in her apartment, presumably from a heart attack. Taking a photograph of her in bed and stealing her keys, they rush round to find the corpse fully clothed on a sofa. Delmas removes some clothing and puts {{the body in the}} bed for a better picture. <b>Ringing</b> his <b>boss</b> to say the search is at an end, Moreau is told to keep it all quiet. Delmas however wants the money he can make from his pictures and runs off with the rolls of film.|$|R

50|$|The show {{starts with}} a {{beautiful}} scene of the Andes which is where Nuzzle and Scratch are originally from: (We're from {{high up in the}} Andes, we've got hooves instead of handies) Each episode follows the same format, Nuzzle and Scratch work for '2 by 2, the Any Animal Agency'. run by The Boss, a tough-talking girl. She receives a phone call from someone who is in desperate need of some assistance. Unfortunately all her hard working animals are out already and the only free hands (or hooves) available are the two alpacas Nuzzle and Scratch. The Boss knows they aren't any good so is reluctant to send them, but there is usually some misunderstanding over the phone and they end up getting the job. Nuzzle and Scratch mess up and the person <b>rings</b> the <b>Boss</b> to complain. She convinces them to 'give them another chance' and Nuzzle and Scratch normally turn things around and really impress the person who hired them. They often win a rosette or get offered a permanent job but refuse leading them to go on their next assignment.|$|R
50|$|Eyüp, a man {{living in}} a slum at the Yedikule {{neighborhood}} in İstanbul, {{with his wife and}} only son, is the driver of Servet. He wakes {{up in the middle of}} the night with his cell phone <b>ringing.</b> It's his <b>boss,</b> telling Eyüp to meet him immediately. Shivering in shock, Servet explains the current events to his driver. His excuse is if the fatal accident comes out in press it would terminate his political career, so he proposes Eyüp to take over the penalty and stay in prison for a brief period of time in exchange for a lump sum payment upon his release, whilst still paying his salary to his family so they can get by. Eyüp accepts the deal.|$|R
60|$|At Geneva we {{had barely}} {{time to think}} Rousseau, to think Calvin, to think Voltaire, to drive swiftly through the town and back again to the boat, fuming and {{fretting}} to be off. There is an old town, gravely picturesque and austerely fine in its fine old burgherly, Calvinistic, exclusive way; and outside the walls {{there is a new}} town, very clean, very cold, very quiet, with horse-cars like Boston, and a new Renaissance theatre like Paris. The impression remains that Geneva is outwardly a small moralized Bostonian Paris; and I suppose the reader knows that it has had its political <b>rings</b> and <b>bosses</b> like New York. It also has an exact reproduction of the Veronese tombs of the Scaligeri, which the eccentric Duke of Brunswick, who died in Geneva, willed it the money to build; like most fac-similes, they are easily distinguishable from the original, and you must still go to Verona to see the tombs of the Scaligeri. But they have the real Mont Blanc at Geneva, bleak to the eye with enduring snow, and the Blue Rhone, rushing smooth and swift under the overhanging balconies of quaint old houses. With its neat quays, azure lake, symmetrical hotel fronts, and white steamboats, Geneva was like an admirable illustration printed in colors, for a holiday number, to imitate a water-color sketch.|$|R
500|$|Marie et Julien: The {{letter is}} from Madame X's sister Adrienne to Madame X. Julien meets Madame X again, {{and she tells}} him her sister killed herself by {{drowning}} six months before. He cannot understand who gave Marie the letter, but she insists that her sister left the letter to frame her and although dead she is [...] "reliving" [...] (a revenant) — and Marie is also. Adrienne —who though dead still appears and speaks to her— has told Madame X that Marie is [...] "like me". He thinks she is mad. Julien becomes frustrated at Marie {{spending so much time}} alone in the attic. When she finally shows him the room, she says she does not know what it is for. She leaves before Julien wakes and checks into another hotel. He <b>rings</b> Marie's old <b>boss</b> who suggests talking to Marie's friend Delphine; Delphine says that Marie's relationship with Simon drove Marie mad and ended their friendship.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Boss Man began feuding with Nailz, an ex-convict {{character}} who, in {{a series}} of promos aired before his debut, claimed Boss Man had been his abusive Officer in prison, and warned he was seeking revenge. On the May 30 episode of WWF Superstars, Nailz — clad in an orange prison jumpsuit — ran into the <b>ring</b> and attacked <b>Boss</b> Man, handcuffing him to the top rope and repeatedly choking and beating him with the nightstick. Boss Man took time off TV to sell his (kayfabe) injuries, eventually returning and having a series of matches with Nailz {{in the latter half of}} 1992. The feud culminated at Survivor Series, when Boss Man defeated Nailz in a Nightstick on a Pole match. This was the final push for the Boss Man during this run, as he was subsequently used as enhancement talent against Razor Ramon, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Yokozuna on the house show circuit.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRing {{compression}} test (RCT) {{is a very}} popular method used to quantitatively evaluate friction conditions at the tool–workpiece interface by measuring the variations of the inner diameter of the ring in metal forming. There are many possibilities for measuring the inner diameter variations in RCT because of non-uniform deformation of the inner hole during the test. Such non-uniform deformation of the inner hole causes difficulties in precise measurement of the inner diameter and hence {{the accuracy of the}} derived friction coefficient. To avoid the disadvantage in dimension measurement of the conventional RCT, an alternative method for evaluating friction conditions in cold forging named <b>ring</b> with <b>boss</b> {{compression test}} (RCT-B) is proposed. By the introduction of the RCT-B concept, finite element simulation results under different friction conditions were obtained. Results showed that the shape of the outer boss remains stable during the compression deformation and allows the diameter of the outer boss to be measured more easily and accurately. The calibration curves of the RCT-B concept were constructed by using FE simulation, which cover the range of friction conditions in cold forging process. Finally, the RCT-B method was successfully applied to determine the friction factors of four different lubricating conditions in compression of aluminum rings. Furthermore, the phenomena with different lubricating conditions between the upper and lower die–workpiece interfaces were also studied using both simulation and experimental testing. The results show {{that it is possible to}} quantitatively assess the difference of friction conditions at the upper and lower die–workpiece interfaces by simply checking the inclined angle of the outer boss with the RCT-B method...|$|R
5000|$|Clay then works {{overtime}} {{to get the}} money for Clayboy's <b>ring,</b> and his <b>boss</b> Col. Coleman (Hayden Rorke) gives him an added bonus: a day off with pay the day trout season opens. While Clay slips off to fish (instead of working on the house), the town prepares for the arrival of their new minister. Enjoying himself at the river, Clay meets a stranger, who joins him, and Clay tells him about the old granddad of all fish - and offers him a drink from a bottle he calls [...] "insect repellent". Later, the man comments that he finds the [...] "repellent" [...] to be [...] "somewhat numbing". It is in fact moonshine, and the man hooks [...] "old granddad". When the fish gets away, Clay launches into a profanity-laden tirade. The man chides him for his salty speech, and then - right before he plunges head first into the river - reveals that he's Preacher Goodman (Wally Cox), the town's new minister. When he and Clay, drunk and drenched, stumble into town, he is now disgraced to everyone.|$|R
5000|$|Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts {{stole the}} belt during their feud in early 1990. This {{also led to}} a face turn for the Big Boss Man who resented his manager Slick selling his {{services}} to DiBiase in order to retrieve the belt from Roberts. After attacking Jake and stealing the bag containing the belt and Roberts's pet python, Damien, DiBiase, the Boss Man and Slick headed for The Brother Love Show where DiBiase bragged about buying the Boss Man's services. The Boss Man then told both Slick and DiBiase that he couldn't be bought and immediately returned the bag to Roberts, who had been left handcuffed to the <b>ring</b> ropes. The <b>Boss</b> Man then released Roberts, {{walked back to the}} Brother Love set, pushed Slick, and again told an irate Million Dollar Man that he couldn't be bought before walking off to the cheers of the crowd, cementing his face turn. DiBiase had his bodyguard Virgil get the belt back from Roberts back at WrestleMania VI after Jake was counted out during their match at the SkyDome.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{match was}} Jim Duggan vs. Big Boss Man. Boss Man heavily pounded on Duggan in the {{beginning}} but Duggan countered with a clothesline to the floor. Boss Man caught Duggan and {{brought him to the}} floor. Duggan punched back but was thrown into the ringpost. Boss Man eventually missed a charge and got crashed into the ringpost. Duggan pounded on his hurt shoulder. They both went to the <b>ring</b> where <b>Boss</b> Man reversed an Irish whip by Duggan. He splashed Duggan in the corner. Boss Man followed it up with an enzuigiri. He soon began hitting Duggan's head into the turnbuckle but Duggan Irish whipped Boss Man into the corner. Duggan began {{to take control of the}} match until Slick interfered in the match, which gave Boss Man a comeback in the match. Boss Man got a near-fall on Duggan after a knee drop. He locked in a bear hug. Duggan tried to escape by hitting headbutts but Boss Man fell on top of him near the ropes. Boss Man pounded on Duggan in the corner but Duggan clotheslined him. Duggan drove Boss Man into the corner for a ten-count punch but missed a charge in the corner and was clotheslined by Boss Man. Boss Man went for a big splash but Duggan moved out of the way. Slick grabbed Duggan up against the ropes as Boss Man charged Duggan but Duggan moved out of the way and Boss Man accidentally nailed Slick. However, Slick was able to give Boss Man a nightstick. Slick tried to distract the referee, but the referee saw Boss Man hitting Duggan with a nightstick. Referee disqualified Boss Man and Duggan was announced the winner.|$|R
5|$|Julien: Julien {{dreams of}} Marie, {{whom he met}} {{just over a year}} before at a party, and with whom he would have begun a {{relationship}} but for them both having partners. He immediately runs into her on the street as she is running for her bus and he is off to meet Madame X. They agree to meet again, but Marie fails to appear and he returns home to find Madame X waiting for him against their agreement, so he raises his price tenfold. Madame X returns the next day to try to bargain, and asks for a letter back that he does not have. Marie invites him to her place for dinner, where Julien tells her his girlfriend ran away with another man and Marie says her boyfriend Simon died six months ago. They have sex, but in the morning Marie has checked out of her apartment. Julien returns home to find that his house has been ransacked.

Julien visits her there, and Marie agrees to move in with him.|$|R
500|$|After the concert, Tammy {{and several}} other girls are invited backstage, where they think the Jonas Brothers {{want to have sex}} with them. Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity <b>rings</b> by their <b>boss,</b> Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|R
5000|$|Nishi {{returns to}} the moment just before Atsu pulled the trigger. This time, Nishi seizes Atsu's gun with his buttocks, and shoots him dead. He, Yan and Myon all pile into the yakuza's car, leaving the father and Ryo (still unconscious) behind. They speed off, {{followed}} by the massed yakuzas. The Yakuza <b>boss</b> <b>rings</b> Nishi using the yakuza's car phone and reveals that Atsu was a player on the Japanese national soccer team. Then after further chase the boss has his men force the trio in to a dead end on a bridge. However, Nishi steers the car off the bridge and they are swallowed up by an enormous whale. Inside the whale, they meet {{an old man who}} was formerly yakuza and has been trapped in the whale for more than 30 years. (He is later shown through flashbacks to be the father of the senior Yakuza shown earlier). He shows them to the elaborate suspended house he has constructed over the 'sea' inside the whale's belly. Nishi attempts to escape the whale but he fails and they resign themselves to life inside the whale. Yan practices dancing and art, Myon practices swimming (a dream she gave up when her breasts got bigger), Nishi practices writing and drawing humorous manga and he and Myon finally become sexually intimate.|$|R
50|$|The {{main event}} saw Shane McMahon as the ring announcer, announcing more {{changes to the}} card with Pat Patterson as the guest time keeper, Gerald Brisco as the special guest referee and Big Boss Man changed to {{enforcer}} alongside Vinnie Jones. After a brawl between the two enforcers, Brisco gave Jones a red card and had him ejected. The four-way match began prematurely with Mankind and Kane brawling before The Undertaker arrived, who chokeslammed Mankind and threw him outside before throwing Kane out too. Steve Austin then made his entrance but was met on the walkway by Undertaker while Mankind and Kane continued to fight {{in the middle of the}} ring, Mankind being taken down with a flying lariat. After dealing with Undertaker, Austin then took Mankind around the ring smashing head into the announce table and crowd barrier. Austin and Undertaker continued to fight inside the ring, Austin using his vest to choke his opponent but was taken down with a flying clothesline and leg drop. Kane, meanwhile, was being beaten by Mankind outside the ring and had his head thrown into a television monitor. In the ring Austin recovered from Undertaker's dominance with a Lou Thesz Press but Kane broke up the pin count. Kane then fought Austin as Undertaker dealt with Mankind. Undertaker used some cable to choke Mankind, then Kane came up behind and choked Undertaker with cable before finally Austin used some cable to choke Kane as Mankind escaped and used a microphone to the head of Undertaker and Kane. Eventually the four wrestlers came back into the ring with Kane choking Undertaker into the corner until Austin turned his attention to Kane. Undertaker did not thank him for it, though, instead trying to walk the rope for Old School but his balance was thrown when Mankind threw Kane against the ropes. Austin and Mankind briefly teamed up against Kane, then Mankind offered his hand in alliance but Austin replied with a finger. Mankind replied with a mandible claw until Undertaker pulled him off his feet and wedged his crotch into the ring post from outside the ring. Kane and Undertaker then teamed up on Austin but while nobody was looking Mankind donned Mr Socko, kicking Austin and then high-fiving the referee. Mankind then brought a steel chair into the ring, hitting Kane but receiving a shot by Undertaker. As Undertaker tried to pin him, Austin hit him on the back with a chairshot and was met with a slow count from Brisco. With the ring cleared, Kane tried to chokeslam Austin but was kicked in the crotch and received a stunner. Again Brisco tried to avoid the count by checking the time on the outside. An enraged Austin kicked Brisco out of the ring meaning Earl Hebner had to run to ringside when Undertaker chokeslammed both Kane and Austin. When the count was broken up by Mankind, Undertaker fought with him on the outside of the ring during which time Austin stunnered Kane and covered him to win the match. When Brisco attacked Hebner, Austin also gave him a stunner. Vinnie Jones then came down to the <b>ring</b> and kicked <b>Boss</b> Man to allow Austin to deliver another stunner before Hebner kicked him out of the ring, using an Austin like taunt.|$|R
