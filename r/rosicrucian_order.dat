5000|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>orders,</b> {{there are a}} number of {{historical}} Rosicrucian societies with similar names that either no longer have a Masonic connection, or have gone dormant: The SRIA (A for [...] "America") was chartered by the SRIA (in England) in Philadelphia in 1878. It reformed in 1889 as Societas Rosicruciana in the United States (SRIUS), and reformed again as SRIA in 1912. In 1916 the order began admitting women, and its charter was revoked. It is in existence today, but has no Masonic connections whatsoever.|$|R

2500|$|Gerald Gardner {{claimed that}} {{after moving to}} the borough of Christchurch, Dorset in 1939, he got {{involved}} with the <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order</b> Crotona Fellowship, an occult organisation based upon Rosicrucianism. However, he was largely dissatisfied with the Order, and in particular its leader, George Alexander Sullivan, believing them to be devoid of any genuine esoteric knowledge. Meanwhile, he met {{a group of people}} within the Fellowship who claimed to have been involved in a form of Freemasonry known as Co-Masonry, who informed him that they had moved to the area where they had joined the <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order</b> when their friend and fellow Co-Mason, Mabel Besant-Scott, had done so. The researcher Philip Heselton identified two of these individuals as Ernest and Susie Mason, a brother and sister couple who had in prior decades been involved in a variety of occult groups, including Co-Masonry and Theosophy, and who had recently moved to the area from Southampton.

2500|$|Gardner {{claimed that}} this group had met in the New Forest in {{southern}} England, {{and that he had}} met some of their members initially through the occultic <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order</b> Crotona Fellowship.

25|$|As {{time went}} by, Gardner became {{critical}} {{of many of}} the <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order's</b> practices; Sullivan's followers claimed that he was immortal, having formerly been the famous historical figures Pythagoras, Cornelius Agrippa and Francis Bacon. Gardner facetiously asked if he was also the Wandering Jew, much to the annoyance of Sullivan himself. Another belief held by the group that Gardner found amusing was that a lamp hanging from one of the ceilings was the disguised holy grail of Arthurian legend. Gardner's dissatisfaction with the group grew, particularly when in 1939, one of the group's leaders sent a letter out to all members in which she stated that war would not come. The very next day, Britain declared war on Germany, greatly unimpressing the increasingly cynical Gardner.|$|R
50|$|FUDOFSI {{ceased to}} exist {{at some point during}} World War II. However, in 1947 some of its members {{contacted}} each other and tried to establish a new organisation. Hans-Rudolf Hilfiker and R. Swinburne Clymer (1878-1966) tried to create a Worldwide Alliance of <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Orders.</b> In Rio de Janeiro, Clymer successfully merged his organisation with Krumm-Heller's. Hilfiker and Clymer had a meeting on May 7, 1947 and also on June 5, 1948, in Zürich, Switzerland at the hotel Baur au Lac. The Fraternitas Rosae Crucis official biography of Emerson Myron Clymer, son of R. S. Clymer, describes him as Supreme Grand Master of FUDOFSI after his father's death, so {{it is possible that the}} Fraternitas Rosae Crucis considers FUDOFSI to have survived later.|$|R

2500|$|In Highcliffe, Gardner {{came across}} a {{building}} describing itself as the [...] "First Rosicrucian Theatre in England". Having an interest in Rosicrucianism, a prominent magico-religious tradition within Western esotericism, Gardner decided to attend one of the plays performed by the group; in August 1939, Gardner took his wife to a theatrical performance based {{on the life of}} Pythagoras. An amateur thespian, she hated the performance, thinking the quality of both actors and script terrible, and she refused to go again. Unperturbed and hoping to learn more of Rosicrucianism, Gardner joined the group in charge of running the theatre, the <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order</b> Crotona Fellowship, and began attending meetings held in their local ashram. Founded in 1920 by George Alexander Sullivan, the Fellowship had been based upon a blend of Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, Freemasonry and his own personal innovation, and had moved to Christchurch in 1930.|$|E

5000|$|The Ordo Secreta Sapientiae (Order of Secret Wisdom 1886 - 1898) was one {{of several}} initiatory <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>orders</b> that {{developed}} during the Victorian magical revival, alongside such groups as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Aurum Solis. [...] Its early membership consisted of former members of Kenneth MacKenzies's Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA) and students of Frederick Hockley, who died in 1885 and passed on many of his papers [...] It is quite probable that the initiatory structure of the Ordo Secreta Sapientiae was borrowed from the SRIA, which was in turn borrowed from the German [...] "Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross". [...] The focus of the Secreta Sapientiae was in excavating secret pagan symbolism buried within the art of Christian Europe, which they, and others, believed could be found in its painting and architecture.

2500|$|Born into an upper-middle-class {{family in}} Blundellsands, Lancashire, Gardner {{spent much of}} his {{childhood}} abroad in Madeira. In 1900, he moved to colonial Ceylon, and then in 1911 to Malaya, where he worked as a civil servant, independently developing an interest in the native peoples and writing papers and a book about their magical practices. After his retirement in 1936, he travelled to Cyprus, penning the novel A Goddess Arrives before returning to England. [...] Settling down near the New Forest, he joined an occult group, the <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order</b> Crotona Fellowship, through which he claimed to have encountered the New Forest coven into which he was initiated in 1939. Believing the coven to be a survival of the pre-Christian Witch-Cult discussed in the works of Margaret Murray, he decided to revive the faith, supplementing the coven's rituals with ideas borrowed from Freemasonry, ceremonial magic and the writings of Aleister Crowley to form the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca.|$|E
2500|$|Newton's {{ownership}} {{of these materials}} by no means denotes membership within any early <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>order.</b> [...] Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. [...] However, in religious terms, {{the fact that a}} saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search — quite the opposite. [...] The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater. During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society. [...] Though it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|Although sceptical of the <b>Rosicrucian</b> <b>Order,</b> Gardner got on {{well with}} a group of {{individuals}} inside the group who were [...] "rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves." [...] Gardner's biographer Philip Heselton theorised that this group consisted of Edith Woodford-Grimes (1887–1975), Susie Mason, her brother Ernie Mason, and their sister Rosetta Fudge, all of whom had originally come from Southampton before moving to the area around Highcliffe, where they joined the Order. According to Gardner, [...] "unlike many of the others , [...] had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult". Gardner became [...] "really very fond of them", remarking that he [...] "would have gone through hell and high water even then for any of them." [...] In particular he grew close to Woodford-Grimes, being invited over to her home to meet her daughter, and the two helped each other with their writing, Woodford-Grimes probably assisting Gardner edit A Goddess Arrives prior to publication. Gardner would subsequently give her the nickname [...] "Dafo", for which she would become better known.|$|E
2500|$|The French occultist and {{physician}} Gérard Encausse (perhaps better known by his pen-name Papus) was one such contact.
