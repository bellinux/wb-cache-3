Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Exile" [...] was a well rounded episode but thought that it did not [...] "venture as far as it could've and perhaps should've". He described the scene where Trip has problems with the shuttlecraft as a [...] "irrelevant but nevertheless great scene that's kind of brilliant in a Three Stooges kind of way". He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|Bene Viera of VH1 praised Brown [...] "for {{creating}} a video that fits perfectly with the song". Viera continued writing that the song [...] "wouldn't be [...] proper smoker's anthem" [...] without the cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg.

A reviewer for Rap-Up described the video as [...] "wild" [...] and [...] "colorful", and noted {{that it seems to}} be inspired by the Beastie Boys' classic [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)"

Several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying the song itself, including Mullins, Futterman and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson. Tucker felt that it had [...] "more snap and vigour" [...] than the final number, but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion, writing that it impacted negatively on the episode's momentum. Fallon gave the track an entirely positive review, suggesting {{that it should have}} been the episode's opening number and lauding it as [...] "surprising, oozing with charm, and actually kind of joyous." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France embraced the [...] "completely random and bizarre" [...] song choice, writing that it <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first season, [...] "when [...] never knew what to expect and [...] was often happily surprised." [...] Reiter too reviewed it favorably, calling it the best performance of the show.

500|$|Beyoncé {{explained}} on her iTunes Radio {{channel that}} [...] "Rocket" [...] {{was one of}} the [...] "most sensual songs", adding that it <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibes of D'Angelo's song [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). The singer elaborated the concept behind the song during an album documentary filmed for Beyoncé, titled [...] "Honesty", saying, [...] "Now I'm in my 30s, and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up, and I always felt like it was my responsibility to be aware of kids and their parents and all these generation". With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey.

The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery.

500|$|Writing for School Library Journal, Cara von Wrangel Kinsey found Fairy Cube [...] "more {{accessible}} than Yuki's previous works," [...] despite covering {{subjects such}} as murder and revenge. A. E. Sparrow of IGN gave the first volume a favorable review, enjoying the series' different view of the fairies. Mania Entertainment's Danielle Van Gorder wrote that the story <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-Victorian version of the fairytale [...] "Snow White" [...] or the British Sidhe fairies, in her review of the first volume. Van Gorder worried that the cover would mislead readers into believing that it was [...] "a light and fluffy kind of story" [...] and drive away the target audience. In a follow-up review of the final volume, she wrote that {{the conclusion of the}} series was less confusing than that of Yuki's earlier work Angel Sanctuary (1994–2000) and thought the story was [...] "well-executed," [...] though it still had some flaws. Rating the series 3 out of 4 stars, Jason Thompson, author of [...] (2007), wrote that while it reminded him of Angel Sanctuary, it covered [...] "more original subject matter" [...] and had [...] "tighter" [...] plotting. Anime News Network's Casey Brienza highly recommended the first volume, praising her inclusion of Celtic mythology. She enjoyed the plot and described the cover as beautiful, though she disliked the artistic inconsistencies caused by Yuki's use of assistants. According to [...] Katherine Dacey of PopCultureShock in her review of the first volume, the story succeeded through Yuki's use of [...] "outlandish touches," [...] creating [...] "an intoxicating—if occasionally ridiculous—mix of horror, romance, and revenge." [...] In her review of the final volume, Dacey expressed her feelings of annoyance that the characters spent much of the volume talking with very little action, and wrote that the story, despite a promising start, went downhill with the introduction of the beauty contest in the second volume. Categorizing [...] "Psycho Knocker" [...] as [...] "comeuppance theater," [...] she enjoyed it more than Fairy Cubes conclusion, though still wrote that [...] "it isn't her best work." [...] A reviewer of the French edition disliked how quickly the story progressed, commenting that the protagonists' personalities were not fully explored as a result. The reviewer praised the covers of the first and third volumes as [...] "magnificent".|$|E

Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought.

No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood. She thought not.|$|E

2500|$|David Browne {{reviewed}} the album for Entertainment Weekly and awarded it a [...] "B" [...] rating, calling Enya [...] "even less {{the life of}} the pub" [...] with her new release. [...] "With its layered, breathing-lesson choral harmonies cushioned in sullen keyboards, the album is, except for a few perky moments, wistful to the point of stultification. A gorgeous formula, but perhaps even Enya could use a good stiff belt." [...] The Los Angeles Times issued a three stars out of four rating in a review by Don Heckman. He wrote that Enya remains in her [...] "musical trance ... on an ethereal plateau of her own", which he recognises as a good thing for her fans. The [...] "technical proficiency and the mood-sustaining qualities" [...] of the music, that Heckman called [...] "mysterious" [...] and [...] "rich" [...] coupled with Enya's [...] "angelic, folk soprano" [...] and [...] "nostalgic" [...] piano, flow to make a seamless album that [...] "almost demands that the album be heard in its entirety". Heckman praised Enya for the [...] "remarkable" [...] feat of being the album's sole musician, and concluded with: [...] "If anything can restore the tarnished image of New Age music, this may be it". Rolling Stone magazine reporter Elysa Gardner gave the album three stars out of four. She wrote: [...] "Because Enya's lush, synthladen arrangements rarely come off as bloated or banal, her work typically inspires less ridicule than, say, Yanni's". Gardner picked out [...] "China Roses" [...] as a track that <b>reminded</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "tranquil radiance" [...] of [...] "Caribbean Blue" [...] from Shepherd Moons, with [...] "Once You Had Gold" [...] sounding [...] "equally tender, with a reassuring lyric and all the prettiness of a Christmas carol". She continued: [...] "Regardless of whether you understand Latin or Gaelic, the atmospheric warmth of [...] "Pax Deorum" [...] and [...] "Athair Ar Neamh" [...] will temporarily convince you that the world isn't such a terrible place after all". The album received a more critical review from Howard Cohen for The Los Angeles Daily News, saying it does not [...] "disappoint, at least not stylistically" [...] with its [...] "flawless" [...] recording and [...] "gorgeous" [...] sounds, but goes on to write, [...] "She stalls ... drowning in her formula. Two stars".|$|E
