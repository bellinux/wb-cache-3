40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedTobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) is required through Department of Defense (DoD) Lean initiatives and directives {{to reduce the}} cycle time of its repair and overhaul lines. The activities involved at DoD repair and overhaul depot facilities are a multi-billion dollar expenditure within the DoD budget. The DoD, {{in an attempt to}} reduce expenditures, has focused on Lean manufacturing as an operational strategy oriented toward achieving the shortest possible cycle time by eliminating waste across all depot systems and processes. We establish a discrete event simulation model to study the AIM- 9 Sidewinder Missile repair process line, specifically the repair of the Guidance and Control Section (GCS) component of the missile. Currently TYAD does not employ a computer simulation model to support the leaning technique for its repair and overhaul processes. This thesis is the first attempt to model the Sidewinder <b>Repair</b> <b>Line</b> with a computer-aided discrete event simulation. TYAD will implement results from this analysis to help reduce cycle time and garner insights into current policies and procedures employed on the Sidewinder <b>Repair</b> <b>Line.</b> TYAD has identified potential for future use of this analysis by employing the technique of discrete event simulation to augment its DoD-mandated Leaning procedures.

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Occupational {{accidents}} and diseases cost 1. 25 thousands billion $ to economic of world & links 2 million annually. Rate of death due to occupational accidents {{in developing countries}} in some cases is 4 times to developed industrial countries. To control accidents & resultant damages, identification of potential agents causing accidents in  necessary. One of the modern methods for identification these agents is ETBA. This method is  based on energy model. This model present energy as potential agent causing accident & according  to this, propose a set of control strategies that are in different levels of priority due to their  effectiveness   Methods   This research is a case study that {{is a kind of}} qualitative researches and it had done in an  automobile factory's paint shop. First in this study ETBA method used to identify hazards, then  risks were analysed and in the last phase, approaches were proposed for decrease level of   unacceptable risks.   Results   This study determined that in this field, two category of hazards are in first priority for   performing control measures:  First category contains chemical hazards that might lead to catastrophic consequences like fire &  cancer. Highest risk portion o this paint shop is manually spray painting booth and spray painting  stations that is placed in <b>repair</b> <b>lines.</b>   Second category contains hazards that causes accidents repeatedly the highest risk portions are stations where ground conveyor moves car bodies (pain and <b>repair</b> <b>lines).</b>   Conclusion   Because of these two category of hazards are concentrated in paint and <b>repair</b> <b>lines,</b> these lines should be in first priority for control hazards...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the repair of interruptions {{in the back}} contact (P 1) scribing line between two Mo back electrodes by thermally induced fractures. The fractures occur during Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) absorber co-evaporation, as it is applied in CIGS thin-film module manufacturing and can effectively <b>repair</b> <b>line</b> interruptions of up to about 70 [*]μm. Additionally, we present that a thermal treatment after P 1 laser scribing and before CIGS co-evaporation can repair even interruptions of up to 1 [*]mm. The fractures which are required for insulation are only of approximately 4 [*]μm width which indicates the potential for further reduction of the interconnection width in CIGS modules and therefore improvement of the electrical module efficiency...|$|E

He explains the various jobs he held throughout the plant and the specifics of those jobs such as workloads and difficulties experienced, as well as safety in the plant. He discusses various relations within the plant including race and gender relations, co-worker relations, and worker and management relations over his years of employment. He explains the MOA (Modern Operating Agreement) and its implementation on the plant. The plant community and daily job is discussed with regards to the sale of food, alcohol use, and informal markets for other goods within the plant.

40|$|Longitudinally-welded 72 mm ID service pipes (HSP) {{made from}} {{titanium}} grade 2 {{is used by}} the two suppliers of the helium tanks for the EU-XFEL accelerator. From the perspective of the PED DESY is legally designated as the manufacturer and is responsible for conformity to all relevant codes. During module assemblies at CEA Saclay the orbital welds of the interconnection bellows between cavities showed pores with dimensions outside the specifications set by DESY. These welds needed to be redone which caused a project delay of several months. The X-ray examination of the HSP showed that the pipes already exhibited many out-of- DESY spec pores in the longitudinal welds and were most likely the main cause of the problems in the orbital welds. It was decided to replace the extremities of the service pipes with seamless titanium tubes both on “naked” helium tanks as well as on tanks with cavities already welded in. At DESY more than 750 service pipes were exchanged over a period of 2 years.

40|$|The mask {{industry}} has recently witnessed {{an increasing number}} of new MoSi mask blank materials which are quickly replacing the older materials as the standard in high end mask shops. These new materials, including OMOG (opaque MoSi on glass) and high transmission (Hi-T) films, are driven foremost by the need to reduce feature size through resolution enhancement techniques (RET). The subject of this paper is a new low stress, Hi-T material which addresses the challenges presented by transitioning to smaller technology nodes including difficulties with pattern transfer, cleaning and repair. This material, based on currently employed MoSi films, eliminates process steps and utilizes a thinner overall substrate stack than currently used Hi-T schemes allowing an increase in critical dimension (CD) uniformity and feature resolution and more robustness due to a lower aspect ratio. While this new material is MoSi based the small compositional change requires, in some cases, a significant change in processing. Among the most impacted areas are the etch, clean and repair steps. Given the potential for defects to manifest on masks, repair is an invaluable step that can significantly impact the overall yield and lead to a reduction in cycle time 1. The Carl Zeiss MeRiT ® electron beam mask <b>repair</b> <b>line</b> provides the most advanced repair capabilities allowing a wide range of repairs to be performed on a number of mask types 2. In a joint effort between MP Mask Technology Center LLC and Carl Zeiss SMT, this paper focuses on the benefits of the new Hi-T mask blank and the challenges it presents to the repai...|$|E

50|$|The use {{of tires}} is {{becoming}} obsolete. The utilisation of traditional freight wagons was often {{so low that}} tires never needed renewal, so it was cheaper to fit a one-piece ("monoblock") wheel. Monoblock wheels are lighter and offer better integrity {{as there is no}} tire to come loose. Modern flow-line <b>repair</b> <b>lines</b> are disrupted by the inspection of the wheel centre once the tire is removed, possibly generating extra rectification work, and the need to make each tire fit its allocated wheel centre. Monoblock wheels are now more economical.|$|R
