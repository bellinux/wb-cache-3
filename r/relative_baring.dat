Analysis of microbial communities using phospholipids fatty acid analysis (PLFA) revealed that Alnus and Rhacomitrium {{had the greatest}} impact on microbial growth, increasing total PLFA by some 6 – 7 fold <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> soil, whereas Equisetum led to a 5. 5 fold increase in total PLFA <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> soil. These coloniser species also had significant effects on the composition of their associated microbial communities.

According to the flat band potential and optical band gap measurements, both semiconductors can absorb visible light and have band edge positions that allow the transfer of photoelectrons from BiVO 4 to WO 3. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed poor charge transfer characteristics of BiVO 4, which accounts for the low photoactivity of bare BiVO 4. The measurements of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra showed that the heterojunction electrode utilized effectively light up to 540 nm covering absorption by both WO 3 and BiVO 4 layers. Thus, in heterojunction electrodes, the photogenerated electrons in BiVO 4 are transferred to WO 3 layers with good charge transport characteristics {{and contribute to the}} high photoactivity.

Using density functional theory, the adsorption energetics of crotonaldehyde on bare and oxidised gold clusters (Au 13, d = 0. 8 nm) were determined as a function of oxygen coverage and coordination geometry. At low oxygen coverage, sites are available for which crotonaldehyde adsorption is enhanced <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> Au clusters by 10 kJ mol− 1. At higher oxygen coverage, crotonaldehyde is forced to adsorb in close proximity to oxygen weakening adsorption by up to 60 kJ mol− 1 <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> Au. Bonding geometries, density of states plots and Bader analysis, are used to elucidate crotonaldehyde bonding to gold nanoparticles in terms of partial electron transfer from Au to crotonaldehyde, and note that donation to gold from crotonaldehyde also becomes significant following metal oxidation. At high oxygen coverage we find that all molecular adsorption sites have a neighbouring, destabilising, oxygen adatom so that despite enhanced donation, crotonaldehyde adsorption is always weakened by steric interactions. For a larger cluster (Au 38, d = 1. 1 nm) crotonaldehyde adsorption is destabilized in this way even at a low oxygen coverage. These findings provide a quantitative framework to underpin the experimentally observed influence of oxygen on the selective oxidation of crotyl alcohol to crotonaldehyde over gold and gold–palladium alloys...|$|R

The clinical manifestation is the end-point of a subclinical process that destroys the insulin producing B·cells in the islets of Langerhans (prediabetes). Prediabetes may last months to years and theoretically gives the unique opportunity for prevention of the disease. This requires {{the availability of}} an effective therapy and the possibility to reliably identify individuals who are eligible for such a therapy. In order to develop intervention strategies, studies on the pathogenesis of Type- 1 diabetes are required. At the clinical manifestation of the disease B-cell autoimmunity has been present for years. As a consequence disease-initiating events will have disappeared and the immune response and pathophysiology of the B-cells may have changed due to the ongoing destruction process. Thus, studies of the prediabetic phase are a prerequisite. The identification {{of those who are}} at high risk to develop the disease is therefore an important key to further studies on the pathogenesis of Type- 1 diabetes. In addition, clinical trials of potential prevention strategies require the development of reliable techniques to identify such individuals. Using a combination of genetic markers and autoantibodies against B-cell antigens, prediction is possible in first·degree relatives of patients with Type- 1 diabetes.

40|$|Several {{commercial}} {{tidal turbine}} designs feature axial flow rotors within bi-directional ducts. Such devices are typically intended to increase power extraction through a flow-concentrating effect, operating on flood and ebb tides without a yawing mechanism. Research focused on such devices {{has been limited}} so far, with available results indicating poor performance <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> rotors. This study further investigates the relative performance of bi-directional ducted tidal turbines in confined flow. Several duct profiles are evaluated relative to unducted rotors using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver ANSYS Fluent. The rotor is represented as an actuator disc, which mimics the streamwise thrust of a real device but does not reproduce its swirl or additional turbulence generation. This idealised model achieves optimal energy extraction and enables fair comparison of duct geometries. Device power is reported relative to total frontal area, reflecting {{the fact that the}} overall dimension of the device will be limited by water depth. Comparisons based on rotor area show how the absolute power is increased by a duct, but that this is attributable to an increase in blockage. The fundamental effect of a duct on a rotor, as well as the secondary effects of duct camber and thickness, are identified by analysing streamwise distributions of velocity, pressure and cross-sectional area along the rotor streamtube. Ducts are found to limit the expansion of the downstream flow, in turn restricting the pressure reduction immediately behind the rotor. This effect, in combination with the reduced volumetric flux through a ducted rotor <b>relative</b> to a <b>bare</b> rotor, results in reduced power extraction. The effects of duct curvature and thickness on turbine performance are also examined.

40|$|Biofilms {{influence}} the transport and fate of heavy metals in aquatic environments both directly by adsorption and complexation reactions and indirectly via interactions with oxides {{of iron and}} manganese. These reactions were investigated by introducing lead into a continuous-flow biofilm reactor {{that was designed to}} simulate conditions in a flowing freshwater aquatic environment. The reactor provided controlled conditions, and use of a chemically-defined growth medium allowed calculation of lead speciation with a chemical equilibrium program (MINEQL). Pseudomonas cepacia was employed as a test cell strain because of its ability to grow and form biofilms in the defined medium. This bacterium affected lead distribution in the reactor by adsorbing lead both to adherent and suspended cells. When the aqueous bulk lead concentration was 1. 4 ± 0. 1 µM and biofilm coverage (measured as chemical oxygen demand, COD) was 50 mequiv COD/m 2, lead adsorption was increased by about a factor of five <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> glass. Of the total lead in solution, only 1 % was adsorbed to suspended cells (5 x 107 cells/ml). Lead adsorption to biofilms followed a Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption (Γ max) of 56 µmol Pb/equiv COD and an adsorption equilibrium constant (K) of 0. 64 liter/µmol Pb. Lead complexed with dissolved bacterial exopolymer was below detection limits. Pretreatment of glass slides with colloidal iron also significantly increased lead adsorption <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> glass. Lead adsorption to adsorbed iron fit a Langmuir isotherm with Γmax = 50 µmol Pb/mol Fe, and K = 1. 3 liter/µmol Pb. Lead binding to glass coated with both cells and iron was additive, and could be predicted by summing adsorption predicted using isotherms for each constituent. The presence of iron surface coatings increased initial biofilm formation rates, but after reaching steady state conditions, biofilm coverage was similar for slides treated with iron and untreated slides. A concentration of 1 µM lead produced a transient reduction in suspended cell counts. Cell counts recovered to the original cell density over the course of five to ten reactor retention times.

Mechanical properties of the CCOARs were measured under static and cyclic loads at room, elevated, and cryogenic temperatures to evaluate their mechanical performance <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> Al rings. At room temperature, the breaking load of CCOARs with a 10. 8 % additional weight due to the CNT yarn/thermoset overwrap increased by over 200 % compared to the bare Al ring. The quality of the wound CNT composites was also investigated using x-ray computed tomography...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of silica-coated silver core/shell nanostructures (NSs) and their sensing behavior when deposited on glassy carbon (GC) electrode for nitrobenzene (NB) detection. Synthesized silica-coated silver core/shell NSs were characterized for their chemical, structural and morphological properties. TEM analysis {{confirmed that the}} silica-coated silver nanoparticles (size * 200 nm) are spherical in shape and the core diameter is * 38 nm. FT-IR spectra also confirmed the coating of silica {{on the surface of}} silver nanoparticles. Cyclic voltammetry studies of NB with silica-coated silver core–shell nanoparticles-modified GC electrodes revealed two cathodic peaks at - 0. 74 V (C 1) and - 0. 34 V (C 2) along with two anodic peaks at - 0. 64 V (A 1) and - 0. 2 V (A 2). Enhanced cathodic peak current (C 1, IP) of the core– shell NSs-modified electrode is observed <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> and silica-modified electrodes. Amperometric studies revealed a very high current sensitivity (114 nA/nM) and linearly dependent reduction current with NB amount in the low concentration range and a detection limit of 25 nM. Moreover, the core–shell NSs-modified electrode showed good reproducibility and selectivity toward NB in the presence of many cationic, anionic, and organic interferents...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of clothing on dermal uptake of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), we measured uptake of selected airborne phthalates for an individual wearing clean clothes or air-exposed clothes and compared these results with dermal uptake for bare-skinned individuals under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Using a breathing hood to isolate dermal from inhalation uptake, we measured urinary metabolites of diethylphthalate (DEP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DnBP) from an individual exposed to known concentrations of these compounds for 6 [*]h in an experimental chamber. The individual wore either clean (fresh) cotton clothes or cotton clothes that {{had been exposed to}} the same chamber air concentrations for 9 days. For a 6 -h exposure, the net amounts of DEP and DnBP absorbed when wearing fresh clothes were, respectively, 0. 017 and 0. 007 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3); for exposed clothes the results were 0. 178 and 0. 261 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3), respectively (values normalized by air concentration and body mass). When compared against the average results for bare-skinned participants, clean clothes were protective, whereas exposed clothes increased dermal uptake for DEP and DnBP by factors of 3. 3 and 6. 5, respectively. Even for non-occupational environments, wearing clothing that has adsorbed/absorbed indoor air pollutants can increase dermal uptake of SVOCs by substantial amounts <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> skin...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation-climate {{interactions}} {{are thought to}} have amplified polar warmth during past warm periods. Here, we explore the vegetation-climate interactions in the mid- Cretaceous using a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model with a dynamic vegetation component. We run simulations with 1 ×, 10 × and 16 × preindustrial atmospheric CO 2 . Results show that forests expand from mid-latitudes to high latitudes as CO 2 increases from 1 × to 10 × and 16 ×, mainly due to the CO 2 - induced warming. This expansion of mid-to-high latitude forests are largely supported by the distribution of mid-Cretaceous fossil woods and coal deposits. Globally, the presence of vegetation increases mean annual temperature and precipitation by 0. 9 &deg;C and 0. 11 mm day&minus; 1 <b>relative</b> to <b>bare</b> ground. High-latitude warming induced by the presence of vegetation (&sim; 1. 9 &deg;C) is less than half of that reported in previous studies. The weaker warming here is mainly due to less pronounced albedo feedbacks, and to a less extent, reduced poleward heat transport via weakening of the meridional overturning circulation. Our results suggest that other mechanisms in addition to high atmospheric CO 2 and high-latitude vegetation are required to maintain the polar warmth...|$|R
