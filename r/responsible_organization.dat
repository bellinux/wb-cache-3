40|$|AbstractCorporate social {{responsibility}} by default {{is viewed as}} a positive phenomenon in organization performance and consequently most investigations are focusing on this positive perspective. In the eyes of society socially <b>responsible</b> <b>organizations</b> are usually success stories of impeccable reputation, excellent performance, fostering the welfare of their employees, ensuring the clients’ rights and wealth, focusing on the impacts and outcomes for society, stakeholders and the firm itself; in other words they are an excellent example for all to emulate. However, the CSR domain is not always as brilliant as it may seem from the first glance, and even such organizations are incapable of obviating internal problems of destructive and controversial character. The problem of this research is identification of cases of dysfunctional behaviour in socially <b>responsible</b> <b>organizations</b> and preventive strategies, if any, incorporated in internal regulating rules, codes and other operational documents. The aim of the research: to identify dysfunctional behaviour in organizations, ascribing themselves to the category of socially responsible ones, focusing on such phenomena as nepotism, cronyism, favouritism and CSR code and strategies as a means to prevent this negative phenomenon. Theoretical reasoning for this research is based on the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature, whereas for the empirical research the method of structured interview is used. Interviews with managers of CSR enterprises proved that the construct of dysfunctional behaviour, which covers a wide spectrum of deviant actions, including protectionism in all its forms (nepotism, cronyism, favouritism) is not sufficiently described in ethical codes and other internal regulating documents of even socially <b>responsible</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} consumers support firms' CSR activities, and increasingly demand socially responsible products and services. However, an implicit assumption in the extant literature {{is that the}} purchaser and the consumer of the product are the same person. The current research focuses on a unique form of socially responsible consumption behavior: gift-giving. Through 30 depth consumer interviews, we develop a typology of consumers based on whether consumers integrate CSR-related information into purchases, and whether the purchases are for themselves or for others (i. e., gifts). We find that in some instances, consumers actively avoid purchasing products from socially <b>responsible</b> <b>organizations</b> and do so {{with the intention of}} managing their impressions with the gift recipient. This is counter to previous research that suggests consumers often choose to make socially responsible consumption decisions in efforts to satisfy self-presentation concerns. In addition, the decision to engage in socially responsible consumption for oneself but not for others was motivated by a variety of factors including the role of the recipient and a concern over the credibility of socially responsible gifts. Finally, some participants who do not incorporate CSR into their own personal consumption chose gifts based on a variety of CSR activities in an effort to build awareness for socially <b>responsible</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R
