Tate confessed to feeling pain in the same muscle in the month prior to the injury but played through the pre-season and majority of the first 2 weeks. Tate was listed as day-to-day and did not start Week 3 against the Montreal Alouettes; his back-up QB Kevin Glenn played in his place. Tate was expected to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> for Week 7, however, he suffered a setback to his throwing arm in practice {{leading up to the}} August 9th game. On August 8 it was announced that Tate would miss an additional 2-3 weeks. Coach Hufnagel compared the injury to tennis elbow. Tate finished the 2013 season having only played in 7 games due to various injuries. In the off-season starting quarterback Kevin Glenn was selected by the Ottawa RedBlacks in the Expansion Draft. On January 14, 2014 Tate was signed to a contract extension.|$|E
5000|$|The Push-Up: [...] "The push-up event {{measures}} the endurance of the chest, shoulder, and triceps muscles. On the command ‘get set,’ assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands {{where they are}} comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command ‘go,’ begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At {{the end of each}} repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. If you fail to perform the first ten push-ups correctly, the scorer will tell you to go to your knees and will explain to you what your mistakes are. You will then be sent {{to the end of the}} line to be retested. After the first 10 push-ups have been performed and counted, however, no restarts are allowed. The test will continue, and any incorrectly performed push-ups will not be counted. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of your body weight with your legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or foot from the ground, your performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes in which to do as many push-ups as you can." ...|$|E

40|$|Research {{derived from}} {{architecture}} and urban planning {{suggests that the}} global conguration of space, known as spatial intelligibility, can reliably predict how eciently a person navigates through an environment. Spatial intelligibility {{has been found to}} inuence waynding routes, pause times, and gaze behaviours (Conroy-Dalton, 2001) throughout the waynding process. However, recent studies have emerged suggesting that the shape of the local space, specically intersections (Meilinger, Franz, & Bültho, 2009), is also capable of inuencing pause time, route choice, and landmark memory. The objective of the current study was to investigate the inuence of global spatial intelligibility and availability of local perceptual information on overall waynding eciency.

40|$|Distraction osteogenesis is a {{procedure}} widely {{used for the}} correction of large bone defects. However, a high complication rate persists, likely due to insufficient stability during maturation. Numerical fracture healing models predict bone regeneration under different mechanical conditions allowing fixation stiffness optimization. However, most models apply a linear elastic material law inappropriate for the transient stresses/strains present during limb lengthening or segment transport. They are also often validated using in vivo osteotomy models lacking precise mechanical regulation due to the unavoidable stimulation of secondary interfragmentary motion during ambulation under finitely stiff fixation. Therefore, {{in order to create}} a robust numerical model of distraction osteogenesis, it is necessary to both characterize the new tissue's viscoelasticity during distraction and determine the influence of strictly isolated stimulation in each loading mode (tension, compression, and shear) to account for potential differences in mechanical and histological response. Two electromechanical fixators with integrated load cells were designed to precisely perform and monitor in vivo lateral distraction and isolated stimulation in sheep tibiae using a mobile, hydroxyapatite-coated titanium plate. The novel surgical procedure circumvents osteotomy, eliminating the undesirable and unquantifiable mechanical stimulation during ambulation. After a 10 -day post-surgery latency period, two 0. 275 mm distraction steps were performed daily for 10 days. The load cell collected data before, during, and after each distraction step and was terminated after no less than one minute from the time of distraction. A 7 -day consolidation period separated the distraction phase and 18 -day stimulation phase. Stimulation was carried out in isolated tension, compression, or shear while recording force/time data. Each stimulation session consisted of 120 cycles with a magnitude of either 0. 1 mm or 0. 6 mm in the tension and compression groups and 1. 0 mm in the shear group. The animals were euthanized after a 3 -day holding period following stimulation. Our initial results show that the tissue progressively stiffens and maintains an increasingly large residual traction. The force curves during compressive stimulation show a progressive drift from compression toward tension. We hypothesize that this behavior may be due to the preferential flow of fluid outward from the tissue and a greater resistance to reabsorption during the plate's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E

This master thesis is a part of the Swedish project and its aim is to evaluate how EVOP acts as a working method for improved udder health, with focus on infectious mastitis caused by udder bound bacteria. The project was performed on Jon-jons dairy farm in Växbo, Hälsingland. The intervention was to compare the presently used teat dip on the farm, DeLaval Prima, with the teat dip ProactiveTM Plus. The aim with the intervention was to reduce the somatic cell count and improve the teat condition. The total number of cows in the study were 52. Twenty of these cows were included in a teat condition evaluation. The intervention comprised 6 weeks and ranged from the end of September until the middle of November. In the statistical analysis the last three weeks of the intervention period were compared to a reference period registered three weeks before the intervention started.

Genom det nordiska projektet ”Evolutionary management in large dairy herds” är tanken att ett sådant hjälpmedel ska utvecklas. Sverige ansvarar för att utveckla ett beslutsstöd gällande juverhälsa. Projektet tillämpar principerna för Evolutionary Operation (EVOP). Genom systematiska förändringar ska effektivare lösningar identifieras och slutligen ska EVOP utvärderas om och hur arbetsmetoden kan appliceras inom mjölkproduktionen. Detta examensarbete är ett delprojekt i det svenska projektet och riktar sig mot att utvärdera hur EVOP fungerar som arbetsmetod för förbättrad juverhälsa hos mjölkkor med inriktning mot infektiösa mastiter orsakade av juverbundna bakterier. Projektet genomfördes på mjölkgården Jon-jons gård i Växbo, Hälsingland. Interventionen gick ut på att jämföra gårdens ursprungliga spendoppsmedel, DeLaval Prima mot spendoppsmedlet, ProactiveTM Plus, med mål att reducera celltalet och förbättra spenkonditionen. Totalt ingick 52 kor i studien varav 20 av dessa kor även ingick i en spenkonditionsbedömning. Interventionen omfattade 6 veckor och sträckte sig från slutet av september till mitten av november. I den statistiska analysen jämfördes interventionsperiodens tre sista veckor mot en referensperiod som registrerats tre veckor innan interventionens uppstart. De responsvariabler som analyserades var celltal och spenkondition. Resultatet i studien visar att det inte finns någon signifikant skillnad mellan spendoppsmedlen, DeLaval Prima och ProactiveTM Plus, beträffande celltal och spenkondition. Det går inte att erhålla någon typ av respons eller trend ur den genomförda interventionen. Gården bör därför, i enlighet med EVOP, gå tillbaka till ursprungsläget och utarbeta en ny intervention som sedan testas och utvärderas. Det krävs i framtiden mer forskning för att dra en slutsats om hur EVOP ska implementeras som arbetsmetod inom animalieproduktionen. on and compose a new intervention that will be tested and evaluated.
