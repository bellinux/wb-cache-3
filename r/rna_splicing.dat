5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and {{is the first step in}} post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing</b> to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E

We thoroughly characterized the contribution of <b>spliced</b> <b>RNAs</b> to DNA synthesis in transfected cultures of Huh 7 and HepG 2 cells. We found that up to 50 % of DNA within intracellular capsids is derived from five <b>spliced</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Expressing HBV P protein and pgRNA from separate plasmids {{and the use of}} the CMV-IE promoter contributes to these high levels of encapsidated DNA derived from <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA.</b> A <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA</b> called Sp 1 was the predominant species expressed in both cell lines. All <b>spliced</b> <b>RNAs</b> support the synthesis minus-strand DNA and duplex linear DNA. Only one of the <b>spliced</b> <b>RNAs,</b> Sp 14, supported the synthesis of relaxed circular DNA because splicing removed an important cis-acting sequence (hM) in the other four RNAs. Additionally, we created a variant that was deficient in the synthesis of <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA</b> and supported DNA synthesis at wild-type levels. Our results reinforce and extend the idea that a significant fraction of HBV DNA synthesized under common experimental conditions is derived from <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA.</b> It is important that their presence be considered when analyzing HBV DNA replication in transfected cell cultures...|$|R

5|$|<b>RNA</b> <b>splicing,</b> {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.|$|E

40|$|Cytopathic {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) infections of feline T-cell line (FeT-cell) {{cultures}} led to {{the accumulation}} and maintenance of threefold more proviruses with deletions within the polymerase gene (pol) than minimally cytopathic FeLV infections. Over 60 % of the viral DNA from cytopathic infections bore deletions in pol. Characterization of DNA sequences adjoining the deletions revealed that the junctions were most often flanked by <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> donor and acceptor consensus motifs. A thymidine-to-cytidine mutation introduced at the + 2 position of one <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> donor-like motif inhibited formation {{of the two most}} prevalent viral DNA species with deletions, confirming the origin of many proviruses with deletions from reverse transcription of aberrantly <b>spliced</b> viral <b>RNA</b> species. An example of deletion by misalignment was also characterized. Viral inocula obtained from cells recovered after cytopathic infections were attenuated in their ability to cause cytopathic effects (CPE) and were able to confer superinfection resistance to naïve FeT-cells, despite maintaining envelope gene (env) sequences with full cytopathic potential. This suggested that viral genomes with deletions, rather than being required for cytopathicity, play a role in protecting cells from CPE. Indeed, expression of a molecularly cloned provirus bearing one of the characterized deletions attenuated CPE in FeT-cells caused by superinfecting cytopathic virus...|$|R

40|$|The 441 -nucleotide (nt) region (nt 5325 to 5766) {{around the}} splice {{acceptor}} (SA) site (nt 5491) {{was found to}} be necessary for high-level expression of gag-containing unspliced RNA of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M. Oshima, T. Odawara, T. Matano, H. Sakahira, K. Kuchino, A. Iwamoto, and H. Yoshikura, J. Virol. 70 : 2286 – 2295, 1996). Detailed genetic dissection of the 441 -nt region revealed that the 5 ′-end 64 nt (nt 5325 to 5389) were necessary for high-level expression of the unspliced <b>RNA</b> when the <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA</b> was not produced, while the 3 ′-side 301 nt (nt 5466 to 5766) containing the SA site were necessary for producing <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA.</b> When the <b>spliced</b> <b>RNA</b> was produced, the unspliced RNA could be expressed at a high level even when the 5 ′-end 64 nt were absent.

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} (DM 1) is {{a highly}} variable, multi-system disorder resulting from the expansion of an untranslated CTG tract in DMPK. In DM 1 expanded CUG repeat RNAs form hairpin secondary structures that bind and aberrantly sequester the <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> regulator, MBNL 1. <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> defects resulting {{as a consequence of}} MBNL 1 depletion have been shown to {{play a key role in}} the development of DM 1 pathology. In patient populations, both the number and severity of DM 1 symptoms increase broadly as a function of CTG tract length. However significant variability in the DM 1 phenotype is observed in patients encoding similar CTG repeat numbers. Here we demonstrate that a gradual decrease in MBNL 1 levels results both in the expansion of the repertoire of splice defects and an increase in the severity of the splice alterations. Thus, MBNL 1 loss does not have an all or none outcome but rather shows a graded effect on the number and severity of the ensuing splice defects. Our results suggest that once a critical threshold is reached, relatively small dose variations of free MBNL 1 levels, which may reflect modest changes in the size of the CUG tract or the extent of hairpin secondary structure formation, can significantly alter the number and severity of splice abnormalities and thus contribute to the phenotype variability observed in DM 1 patients...|$|R

40|$|One {{fundamental}} problem of bioinformatics is the computational recognition of DNA and RNA binding sites. Given {{a set of}} short DNA or RNA sequences of equal length such as transcription factor binding sites or <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> sites, the task is to learn a pattern from this set that allows the recognition of similar sites in another set of DNA or RNA sequences. Permuted Markov (PM) models and permuted variable length Markov (PVLM) models are two powerful models for this task, but the problem of finding an optimal PM model or PVLM model is NP-hard. While the problem of finding an optimal PM model or PVLM model of order one {{is equivalent to the}} traveling salesman problem (TSP), the problem of finding an optimal PM model or PVLM model of order two is equivalent to the quadratic TSP (QTSP). Several exact algorithms exist for solving the QTSP, but it is unclear if these algorithms are capable of solving QTSP instances resulting from <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> sites of at least 150 base pairs in a reasonable time frame. Here, we investigate the performance of three exact algorithms for solving the QTSP for ten datasets of splice acceptor sites and splice donor sites of five different species and find that one of these algorithms is capable of solving QTSP instances of up to 200 base pairs with a running time of less than two days...|$|R

We report the first application {{to our knowledge}} of this technology {{to the analysis of}} RNA from a CD 4 T cell line infected with intact HIV. We sequenced the total mRNA from infected cells and detected differences in the expression of both host and viral mRNA. Viral reads represented {{a large portion of the}} total mapped sequencing reads: approximately 20 % at 12 h postinfection (hpi) and 40 % at 24 hpi. We also detected a small but significant suppression of T cell activation-related genes at 12 hpi. This suppression per-sisted and expanded by 24 hpi, providing new possible markers of virus-induced T cell cytopathology. By 24 hpi, the expression of over 50 % of detectable host loci was also altered, indicating widespread alteration of host processes, including <b>RNA</b> process-ing, <b>splicing,</b> and transport to an extent not previously reported. In addition, next-generation sequencing provided insights into alternative viral <b>RNA</b> <b>splice</b> events and the expression of noncoding RNAs, including microRNA host genes. IMPORTANCE Recent advances in sequencing technology now allow the measurement of effectively all the RNA in a cell. This ap-proach is especially useful for studying models of virus infection, as it allows the simultaneous measurement of both host and viral RNA. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we measured changes in total mRNA from a HIV-infected T cell line.

25|$|Several {{steps in}} the gene {{expression}} process may be modulated, including the transcription, <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing,</b> translation, and post-translational modification of a protein.

25|$|A very {{important}} modification of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs consist of alternating segments called exons and introns. During {{the process of}} splicing, an RNA-protein catalytical complex known as spliceosome catalyzes two transesterification reactions, which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure, and then splice neighbouring exons together. In certain cases, some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in mature mRNA. This so-called alternative splicing creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene. Because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins, splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Human {{endogenous}} retrovirus K (HERV-K) {{is the most}} intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C 33 A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. <b>Spliced</b> <b>RNAs</b> detected included viral <b>RNAs</b> <b>spliced</b> as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected {{in most of the}} cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2. 5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. Th...|$|R
25|$|Elongating {{polymerase}} {{is associated}} with a set of protein factors required for various types of RNA processing. mRNA is capped as soon as it emerges from the RNA-exit channel of the polymerase. After capping, dephosphorylation of Ser-5 within the CTD repeats may be responsible for dissociation of the capping machinery. Further phosphorylation of Ser-2 causes recruitment of the <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing</b> machinery that catalyzes the removal of non-coding introns to generate mature mRNA. Alternative splicing expands the protein complements in eukaryotes. Just as with 5’-capping and splicing, the CTD tail is involved in recruiting enzymes responsible for 3’-polyadenylation, the final RNA processing event that is coupled with the termination of transcription.|$|E
25|$|After {{the host}} cell is infected, HPV16 early {{promoter}} is activated and a polycistronic primary RNA containing all six early ORFs is transcribed. This polycistronic RNA contains three exons and two introns and undergoes active <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing</b> to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs. One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, {{serves as an}} E7 mRNA to translate E7 oncoprotein. In contrast, an intron in the E6 ORF that remains intact without splicing is necessary for translation of E6 oncoprotein. However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into host genome by disruption of E2 ORF, preventing E2 repression on E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote cellular proliferation and the chance of malignancy.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{proteins}} recruited to polymerase are elongation factors, thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation. There are different classes of elongation factors. Some factors {{can increase the}} overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin. One of the elongation factors, P-TEFb, is particularly important. P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit 5'-capping enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the <b>RNA</b> <b>splicing</b> machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that the suboptimal sequence complementarity between this 59 ss and U 1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) also contributes to prevent excessive splicing. Analysis of a large set of HIV- 1 sequences revealed that all three regulatory features of the 59 ss region (RNA structure, SR protein binding and sequence complementarity with U 1 snRNA) are highly conserved amongst virus isolates, which supports their importance. Combined mutations that destabilize the local RNA structure, remove binding sites for inhibitory SR proteins and optimize the U 1 snRNA complementarity resulted in almost complete splicing and accordingly reduced virus replicatio...|$|R
