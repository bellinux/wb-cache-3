40|$|In Japan sulphur {{is found}} in chain of volcanoes {{extending}} through the main island; at least 30 known deposits produced 258, 330 long tons of sulphur in 1957. About 70 % of this <b>sulphur</b> is <b>refined</b> by Distillation Process which is usually called Yakitori Process. 　The chief defects of this process are as folows. 　(1) Owing to discontinuity of the operation, thermal efficiency and yield are very low. 　(2) The work is unsanitary and laborious. 　(3) The metallic materials of apparatus are subject to corrosion by sulphur and its compounds. 　The object {{of this research is}} to complete a <b>sulphur</b> <b>refining</b> apparatus which works continuously and so improves the above weak points. 　First, we made the following fundamenal studies. 　(1) Study on properties of sulphtirous ores. 　(2) Study on drying of sulphurous ores. 　(3) Study on heat transmission from the Yakitori Kettle　(4) Study on mechanism for distillation of sulphur. 　(5) Study on fire-proof and sulphur proof materials for the <b>sulphur</b> <b>refining</b> apparatus. 　By applying the above fundamental studies, we designed and made a 240 Kg sulphur/day continuous <b>sulphur</b> <b>refining</b> apparatus and then five semi-scale trials were carried out. 　Comparing the results of our experiments with those of the heretofore used refining processes, we discussed possibility in the industrial application...|$|R

It will discuss the formulation, evaluation and performance characteristics of transformer fluids manufactured from corrosive sulphur free, iso-paraffin base fluids. It has been shown that these fluids can pass the latest corrosive sulphur test methodology without the use of passivation additives (eg. copper passivators). In addition, it will cover increased oxidative stability, heat transfer and biodegradability characteristics as compared to common naphthenic mineral oils...|$|R

(Chemical Engineering) Laboratory {{and pilot}} plant trials {{were carried out}} on a {{modified}} carbonatation process to reduce overall <b>refining</b> costs. <b>Sulphur</b> dioxide dosages of less than 250 ppm on brix were added to carbonatated liquors. The resultant filtered liquor had an additional 4, 6 % colour removal and a 10 % ash gain relative to factory liquors. Reducing sugars and filterability were not affected. Additional colour removal of 14 % was noted in the affinated crystal colour of crystals grown from the resultant brown liquors in the SMRI pilot pan.

Additional colour removal of 14 % was noted in the affinated crystal colour of crystals grown from the resultant brown liquors in the SMRI pilot pan. The failure of the combined carbonatation - sulphitation process to remove the ash that the carbonatation process does, negates the cost benefits of the additional colour removals. The reason for the ash "gain" is that the sulphur dioxide partially dissolves the calcium carbonate, releasing the adsorbed ash and colour. The colour is then adsorbed onto the calcium sulphite. process to remove the ash that the carbonatation process does, negates the cost benefits of the additional colour removals...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{concern about}} air {{pollution}} {{has led many}} countries to adopt more stringent regulations, which impose an ultra-low concentration of sulphur in gasoline. These regulations place many challenges for the <b>refining</b> industry. Lower <b>sulphur</b> levels are being recommended for gasoline and diesel for environmental reasons. New methods and innovations are required to further reduce the sulphur level in liquid fuels. Separation process design to accomplish the removal of sulphur compounds requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of sulphur compounds with hydrocarbons, particularly their activity coefficients at infinite dilution. However, the investigations concerning the systems containing sulphur compounds are very limited. This thesis deals with the VLE measurements of selected sulphur compounds (1 -propanethiol, diethyl sulphide, and thiophene) with various hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 8) and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane (ETBE) under isobaric and isothermal conditions, using a circulation still and the infinite dilutions activity coefficients measurements of 1 -propanethiol, ethyl methyl sulphide, and thiophene in toluene, n-heptane, and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 90  kPa using comparative ebulliometer techniques. The gamma-phi approach {{was used in the}} calculation of VLE. The activity coefficients of the liquid phase (γ) were correlated with the Wilson model. The Wilson model gave a good correlation for all systems. The activity coefficients at infinite dilution (γ∞) were extrapolated from the VLE measurements with the Wilson model. The γ∞ values of sulphur compounds for the systems thiophene + toluene and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane obtained from the recirculation still measurements are compared with the γ∞ values of sulphur compounds obtained from the comparative ebulliometer measurements. The agreement between the measurements is good. All the measured γ∞ of sulphur compounds in hydrocarbons are less than two. 1 -Propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour, and thus the γ∞ of sulphur compounds for these systems are one. The activity coefficients of sulphur compounds in hydrocarbons show the typical behaviour of positive deviations from Raoult's law, which become smaller with increasing temperature and with {{an increase in the number}} of C-atoms of the alkanes. The systems 1 -propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour. No azeotrope formation was observed for the systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and diethyl sulphide + 1 -hexene. The reaction between 1 -propanethiol and 1 -hexene was observed. The systems thiophene + n-hexane and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide + n-heptane and diethyl sulphide + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, show positive deviations from Raoult's law. These systems exhibit maximum pressure azeotropy. The systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and thiophene + 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide with n-hexane, 1 -hexene, cyclohexane, and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, show positive deviation and strong nonideality. No azeotropes formed in these systems. The original UNIFAC predictive model is adequate to describe the behaviour of sulphur in hydrocarbons, even though its application is limited to the availability of the functional group interaction parameters. COSMO-RS gives poor prediction for all the systems studied, and thus it is not currently a suitable model for predicting the behaviour of systems containing sulphur compounds. These new consistent measurements can be used to improve and develop thermodynamic models in dilute systems, and thus the behaviour of organic sulphur compounds in the distillation of hydrocarbons can be simulated. reviewe...|$|R
