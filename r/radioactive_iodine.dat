Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956.

5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Iodine</b> 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodine</b> isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies showed}} an {{increased}} risk of thyroid cancer among children and adolescents exposed to <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodines</b> released after the Chornobyl (Chernobyl) accident, but the effects of screening, iodine deficiency, age at exposure and other factors on the dose-response are poorly understood. METHODS: We screened 11 [*] 970 individuals in Belarus aged 18 years or younger {{at the time of the}} accident who had estimated (131) I thyroid doses based on individual thyroid activity measurements and dosimetric data from questionnaires. The excess odds ratio per gray (EOR/Gy) was modelled using linear and linear-exponential functions.

40|$|The Chornobyl (Chernobyl) {{accident}} in 1986 exposed many individuals to <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodines,</b> chiefly 131 I, {{the effects of}} which on benign thyroid diseases are largely unknown. To investigate the risk of follicular adenoma in relation to radiation dose after Chornobyl, the authors analyzed the baseline data from a prospective screening cohort study of those exposed as children or adolescents. A stratified random sample was selected from all individuals who were younger than 18 years, had thyroid radioactivity measurements taken within 2 months after the accident, and resided in the three heavily contaminated areas in Ukraine. This analysis {{is based on the}} 23 cases diagnosed in 12, 504 subjects for whom personal history of thyroid diseases was known.

5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>iodine</b> brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} {{is the most common}} cause of hypothyroidism. In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodine,</b> injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodine</b> uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E

40|$|The actual {{implementation}} of the epidemiological study on human health risk from low dose and low-dose rate radiation exposure and the comprehensive long-term radiation health effects survey are important especially after radiological and nuclear accidents because of public fear and concern about the long-term health effects of low-dose radiation exposure have increased considerably. Since the Great East Japan earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in Japan, Fukushima Prefecture has started the Fukushima Health Management Survey Project {{for the purpose of}} long-term health care administration and medical early diagnosis/treatment for the prefectural residents. Especially on a basis of the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident, both thyroid examination and mental health care are critically important irrespective of the level of radiation exposure. There are considerable differences between Chernobyl and Fukushima regarding radiation dose to the public, and {{it is very difficult to}} estimate retrospectively internal exposure dose from the short-lived <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodines.</b> Therefore, the necessity of thyroid ultrasound examination in Fukushima and the intermediate results of this survey targeting children will be reviewed and discussed in order to avoid any misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the high detection rate of childhood thyroid cancer...|$|R
5000|$|After using radium in the surgicial {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, researchers including Béla Augustin and A. de Szendeffy soon developed a treatment using <b>radioactive</b> metholated <b>iodine,</b> which was patented {{under the name}} dioradin (formed from [...] "iodine and radium") in 1911. Application of this treatment {{was referred to as}} iodo-radium therapy, and involved injecting dioradin intramuscularly. It seemed promising to the developers, because in several cases, fever and hemoptysis had disappeared. Inhalation of iodine alone had been an experimental treatment for tuberculosis in France between 1830 and 1870.|$|R
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>iodine</b> is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|The main site, {{known as}} H1, was {{established}} on Hermite Island. This was {{the location of}} the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with the equipment to monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodine</b> and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, from whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E

40|$|The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf}} of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All rights reserved. Several studies {{reported}} an increased risk of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents exposed to <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodines,</b> chiefly iodine- 131 (131 I), after the 1986 Chornobyl (Ukrainian spelling) nuclear power plant accident. The risk of benign thyroid tumors following such radiation exposure is much less well known. We have previously reported a novel finding of significantly increased risk of thyroid follicular adenoma in a screening study of children and adolescents exposed to the Chornobyl fallout in Ukraine. To verify this finding, we analyzed baseline screening data from a cohort of 11, 613 individuals aged ≤ 18 years {{at the time of the}} accident in Belarus (mean age at screening = 21 years). All participants had individual 131 I doses estimated from thyroid radioactivity measurements and were screened according to a standardized protocol. We found a significant linear dose response for 38 pathologically confirmed follicular adenoma cases. The excess odds ratio per gray of 2. 22 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 41, 13. 1) was similar in males and females but decreased significantly with increasing age at exposure (P < 0. 01), with the highest radiation risks estimated for those exposed at < 2 years of age. Follicular adenoma radiation risks were not significantly modified by most indicators of past and current iodine deficiency. The present study confirms the 131 I-associated increases in risk of follicular adenoma in the Ukrainian population and adds new evidence on the risk increasing with decreasing age at exposure...|$|R
25|$|A third {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a <b>radioactive</b> isotope of <b>iodine.</b> Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|R
25|$|The risk can be mitigated {{by taking}} iodine supplements, raising {{the total amount}} of iodine in the body and, therefore, {{reducing}} uptake and retention in the face and chest and lowering the relative proportion of <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodine.</b> However, such supplements were not distributed to the population living nearest to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the disaster, though they were widely distributed to children in Poland.|$|E
25|$|According to the workers, TEPCO {{did little}} to inform them about the hazards of the intake of <b>radioactive</b> <b>iodine.</b> All workers with an {{estimated}} dose of 100 millisieverts were offered an annual ultrasound thyroid test during their lifetime for free.

25|$|Despite {{mandatory}} reporting certain readings exceeding EPA MCL levels may be deleted or not included.
