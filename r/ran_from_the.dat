The trail remained until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike — also known as the Salisbury Turnpike — was chartered over the trail and extended from Salisbury, Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge).|$|E

A cut <b>ran</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start of the meander to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the downstream end. The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by {{the construction of a}} water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May, some {{residents}} of Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood informed rebel leaders {{that they could}} use a sewer tunnel that <b>ran</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dung Gate to a mill in the Jewish Quarter, to clandestinely enter Jerusalem.
