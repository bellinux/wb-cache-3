40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the radioprotective effect of carnosine (beta- alanyl- 1 -histidine) on the wound healing in rats. Therefore, 48 male rats were submitted to a surgical procedure to perform a rectangular wound in the anterior-dorsal region. The animals were divided into 4 experimental groups randomly chosen: control; irradiated; carnosine irradiated and carnosine group. The irradiated and carnosine irradiated group were exposed to a dose (6 Gy) of gamma irradiation, in the whole body, 72 hours after surgery. The carnosine and carnosine irradiated groups, in addition to the surgical procedure and the irradiation, received two doses of carnosine aqueous solution, the first one being injected 48 hours after surgery, and the second one 1 hour and 30 minutes before irradiation. The tissue repair of the 4 groups was evaluated at 4, 7, 14, and 21 days after inflicting the wound, by morphological, histochemical and histophysical methods. At all examined periods, it could be observed that the animals from the carnosine irradiated group presented a better developed granulation tissue than the irradiated group and closely similar to that of the control group. Thus, under the experimental conditions used, it was possible to conclude that carnosine is an effective <b>radioprotective</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Radioprotective {{activity}} was examined of extracts prepared from some Araliaceae plants and other medicinal herbs by either measuring 30 -day survival rate or thrombocyte count 14 days after irradiation in mice. The extract was i. p. injected within 4 min after whole body X-irradiation. Among 12 materials examined, Aralia elata, Angelica acutiloba, and Artemisia princeps {{seem to be}} good starting materials for preparing <b>radioprotective</b> <b>substance(s)</b> because of their relatively high tentative specific activity and high yields of the extracts...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days at Heiligenberg, Professor Hagen {{researched}} the <b>radioprotective</b> <b>substances</b> and cell death in lymphocytes and conducted research in Stockholm, in Professor Forssberg's laboratory. It was in Stockholm that Professor Hagen became acquainted with isolated DNA. There he realized {{the importance of the}} cellular effects of ionising radiation in relationship with DNA damage repair. Immediately following this, he began developing analytical techniques that would allow an examination and analysis of various types of DNA damage, which made Hagen an important pioneer in the field of Molecular Radiation Biology.|$|R
40|$|The <b>radioprotective</b> <b>substances</b> {{amifostine}} (WR- 2721) and cystamine {{were tested}} in rats following their parenteral administration (i. p., i. m., and i. v.). Cystamine is more toxic than amifostine in mice {{as well as in}} rats. Amifostine was less toxic after intravenous injection. The radioprotective effects of WR- 2721 (160 mg. kg- 1) and cystamine (40 mg. kg- 1) were not significant when they were administered parenterally 15 – 20 mins before lethal doses of whole body fission neutron irradiation in the thermal column of reactor VVR-S and 30 -days lethality served as an integral criterion of postradiation injury to the rat body. The fission neutrons spectrum was characterized by mean energy 0. 9 - 1. 0 MeV with 30 - 40 % fluency participation of moderate (E= 0. 1 MeV) neutrons. The contamination with gamma rays was 22 - 30 %; the dose rate of whole irradiation was within 0. 3 to 0. 8 Gy. min- 1...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy, in {{addition}} to chemotherapy, is currently the primary method of cancer treatment based on destruction of malignant cells by ionizing radiation. Unfortunately, it also affects normal cells, which is associated with negative consequences for a patient. Radioprotectors are compounds used to prevent/protect the non-tumor cells from {{the harmful effects of}} radiation. To play their role these compounds should meet several criteria; among others, they should significantly protect normal cells from radiation without changing the tumor cell radiosensitivity. In general, agents used to alter normal tissue toxicity from radiation can be broadly divided into three categories based on timing of delivery in relation to radiation: chemical radioprotectors, mitigators, and treatment. These groups include a diverse range of synthetic compounds in terms of their structure and protective mechanisms. The aminoradiothiol amifostine is the only radioprotectant approved in clinical application. However, its use is limited due to toxicity concerns (it may cause hypotension). Natural compounds, derived from plants, meet all criteria of the ideal radioprotector. They exert their protective actions against adverse effects of ionizing radiation by several mechanisms. Plant compounds that show radioprotective activity include flavonoids and phenolic acids, stilbenes, lycopene, alkaloids, peptides, polysaccharides, and phytohormones. Garlic, green tea, apples, citrus, and ginger are examples of constituents of the human diet that contain <b>radioprotective</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Radioprotective</b> {{agents are}} <b>substances</b> those reduce {{the effects of}} {{radiation}} in healthy tissues while maintaining the sensitivity to radiation damage in tumor cells. Due to increased awareness about radioactive substances and their fatal effects on human health, radioprotective agents are now the topic of vivid research. Scavenging of free radicals {{is the most common}} mechanism in oncogenesis that {{plays an important role in}} protecting tissues from lethal effect of radiation exposure therefore radioprotectors are also good anti-cancer agents. There are numerous studies indicating plant-based therapeutics against cancer and radioprotection. Such plants could be further explored for developing them as promising natural radioprotectors with anti-cancer properties. This review systematically presents information on plants having radioprotective and anti-cancer properties...|$|R
40|$|Gamma ir{{radiation}}/DNA damage/Mouse leukocytes/Comet assay/Famotidine. Ionizing radiation induces {{a variety}} of lesions in DNA, each {{of which can be}} used as a bio-indicator for biological dosimetry or the study of the <b>radioprotective</b> effects of <b>substances.</b> To assess gamma ray-induced DNA damage in vivo in mouse leukocytes at various doses and the effect of famotidine, blood was collected from Balb/c male mice after irradiation with 4 Gy γ-rays at different time intervals post-irra-diation. To assess the response, mice were irradiated with doses of gamma-rays at 1 to 4 Grays. Famoti-dine was injected intra-peritoneally (i. p) at a dose of 5 mg/kg at various time intervals before irradiation. Four slides were prepared from each sample and alkaline comet assay was performed using standard pro-tocols. Results obtained show that radiation significantly increases DNA damage in leukocytes in a dose dependent manner (p < 0. 01) when using appropriate sampling time after irradiation, because increasing sampling time after irradiation resulted in a time dependent disappearance of DNA damage. Treatment with only 5 mg/kg famotidine before 4 Gy irradiation led to almost 50 % reduction in DNA damage when compared with those animals which received radiation alone. The radioprotective capability of famotidine might be attributed to radical scavenging properties and an anti-oxidation mechanism...|$|R
