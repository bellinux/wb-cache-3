40|$|Responsible {{procurement}} {{has become}} a real challenge for companies following the current trends of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{and more and}} more ethic-oriented customers. Differing from the concept of green procurement this concept of responsible procurement supports the willingness of companies to have ethic and sustainable supplies. The usual criteria in procurement such as price performances innovation terms and time of payment have increasingly been coupled with more ethic-oriented ones. These criteria related to ethics combine both social and environmental <b>responsibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> and stakeholders such as energetic savings and the possession of a particular certification. Currently many call for tenders set ecological requirements for suppliers or subcontractors even in non-strategic procurement activities. The goal of this thesis is about comparing this approach to responsible procurement between buyers from the X and Y generation: do they share the same ideas and priorities concerning responsible procurement? For both of these generations are the advantages and drawbacks of responsible procurement similar...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} its {{commercial}} importance and signs of some concern by some commentators, trade credit has not been subjected to serious ethical analysis. This is especially important in the current financial crisis, given that credit from banks is in short supply, leading to increasing pressure on trade credit. In addition to identifying trade credit as a topic of ethical significance, this paper develops {{an analysis of the}} ethics of trade credit grounded in an understanding of its purpose. Making a distinction between “operating” trade credit and “financial” trade credit, it provides an account of the maximum period for which it is appropriate for one company to delay payment to another from which it has purchased goods or services. This has implications not only for companies that take credit but also for external commentators who seek to rate companies according to their speed <b>of</b> payment.

40|$|Integration {{into the}} global market is a goal that all {{countries}} strive for. Some succeed in doing so; others are only partially and barely successful. Central America has recently succeeded in gaining access to international trading markets because of its export-oriented apparel industry. Throughout the 1990 ’s the apparel industry in Central America expanded {{to such an extent}} that it now represents more than 60 percent of total manufacturing exports for both Honduras and El Salvador (United States Industry Trade Commission, 2003). As the trends in the global apparel industry change, this places pressure on the Central American countries to also change the modus operandi of their industry. Managers of multinational clothing firms assert that competition between individual firms is now less important than competition between global apparel supply chains. As a result, the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is increasing. 1 Suppliers are not only expected to handle production but also to give input in design and pre- and post-production processes. Furthermore, the industry has become hypercompetitive. “Firms continually disrupt the status quo to create a series of temporary advantages [...] . they create short-lived differentiation advantages that are easily and rapidly eroded through imitation and innovative new styles” (Richardson, 1996). In order to gain the competitive advantage, firms need to continually inven...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to determine the}} nature and extent <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development policy, strategy and practices in the South African (SA) motor industry. This fills a gap in the SA motor industry literature by focusing exclusively and comprehensively on the topic <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development. Multiple data sources and methods were used to gain a balanced, holistic perspective <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development in the industry. The perspectives of both the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and a sample <b>of</b> key first-tier <b>suppliers</b> were obtained. This provides a dyadic study <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development, which is a rarity in the international supplier development literature. The views of other organisations playing a role in supplier development in the SA motor industry were sought to provide further insight. Survey data was obtained from the whole population of light passenger vehicle OEMs located in SA. This contributes comprehensive empirical data to the international supplier development research, which is predominantly case-study based. The supplier development practised by the OEMs with respect to first- and second-tier suppliers was investigated, as well as that employed by first-tier suppliers with respect to second-tier suppliers. In addition to providing an overview <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development in the SA motor industry as a whole, further insight is provided by a mini case study of an OEM exhibiting best practice in supplier development. OEMs and first-tier suppliers differ in their perspectives regarding the overall level <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development practised by the OEMs. OEMs consider the level <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development they provide to be high to moderate, while the first-tier suppliers perceive the supplier development received to be moderate to low. However, the research suggests that vi the level <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development practised by the OEMs in the SA motor industry is nevertheless likely to be more intense than that enjoyed by suppliers in most other SA industries. The level <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> development employed by OEMs was found to be cyclical, peaking at times of new model / part introductions, thereafter moving from proactive to reactive in nature. A key finding was that the overwhelming majority <b>of</b> first-tier <b>suppliers</b> regard Toyota South Africa Motors (Pty) Ltd to be the leader in supplier development in SA. Another interesting finding was that the significant East versus West distinction found in the international supplier development literature is not applicable to the SA situation. Rather, in SA, the relevant division is between Toyota and the other SA OEMs. When sourcing locally, the OEMs prefer to source components from global first-tier suppliers situated in SA. These include SA subsidiaries of global companies, SA suppliers with foreign joint venture partners or SA suppliers with foreign technical agreement partners. The research revealed that many local first-tier suppliers believe that they receive more developmental support from their foreign head-offices or foreign partners, than from the SA OEMs. The OEMs and first-tier suppliers rarely develop foreign suppliers, who supply a significant proportion of total component requirements. The development <b>of</b> foreign <b>suppliers</b> is left to the OEM and first-tier counterparts in the foreign countries. The development <b>of</b> second-tier <b>suppliers</b> in SA is considered to be the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the first-tier <b>suppliers,</b> with OEMs seldom getting involved. The local first-tier suppliers engage in moderate to low supplier development with respect to local second-tier suppliers, citing a lack of resources as the primary reason. Global competition, the Motor Industry Development Plan (MIDP) and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) are identified as key drivers <b>of</b> the OEMs' <b>supplier</b> vii development strategy in SA. There is renewed pressure being placed on the OEMs to improve their sourcing of components from B-BBEE companies. This is in turn resulting in increased pressure being placed on first-tier suppliers to improve their B-BBEE scorecards. Although most OEMs have specific supplier development policies relating to B-BBEE, and government and others have implemented initiatives to develop these <b>suppliers,</b> the amount <b>of</b> component sourcing from such companies was found to be low. The research highlighted innovative projects and institutions playing a role in supplier development in SA, such as the Durban Auto Cluster and The South African Auto Benchmarking Club. The multi-source data obtained in this dissertation provides an empirical benchmark against which to measure the success <b>of</b> future <b>supplier</b> development initiatives. The dissertation also allows industry players to identify how their supplier development policies, strategy and practices compare to the industry as a whole, as well as to best practice...|$|R

The three realities approach and other quality methodologies adapted for this work are presented. After the characterization of the context of the case study, a plan for implementation is defined. Based on the plan, development work focused primarily on obtaining the results of the parts analysis (Genbutsu) and in loco analysis (Gemba). The latter is crucial to determine the process to deal with the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>of</b> costs and quality field problems. After the plan implementation, the results obtained are assessed, particularly regarding the management of warranty costs, which are reduced one third, through the provision <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> between <b>suppliers</b> and internal sectors of the company.

40|$|Abstract: The {{field of}} service modularity, unlike product modularity, is widely new {{area in the}} research. Therefore, {{there is not much}} {{knowledge}} about the modular service architecture. Therefore, this research tries to fill the research gap and find the key characteristics of the modular service architecture. The objective of the thesis is to create more understanding about the service modularity and the modular value chain structure. This research aims to describe the value chain structure {{from the perspective of the}} travel agency and link the roles and <b>responsibilities</b> <b>of</b> customer and <b>suppliers</b> to the modular value chain. To address the issue, comparative study with two companies with different level of modular service architecture is selected. The study is conducted as multiple-case study with semi-structured interviews and secondary data research. To analyze the data a theoretical framework is developed that helps to identify the modular service dimensions and the level of the service modularity. The findings suggest that the highly modular value chain has three important characteristics. The first one is the wide collaboration with customer and co-creation of service offerings. The second one is the long-term relationship with the suppliers. The final characteristic is the continuous two-way communication with its suppliers and customers that enables the responsive and flexible service structure. These findings are formulated as hypotheses that should be further tested with quantitative methods...|$|R

Previous proposed models have considered only two states <b>of</b> nature: all <b>suppliers</b> fail to deliver and not all suppliers fail to deliver. In practice, however, there is clearly a partial loss associated with the failure <b>of</b> any individual <b>supplier.</b> We present models that allow a more realistic decision-making process by taking into consideration the independent risks <b>of</b> individual <b>supplier</b> failures when the probability of failure for each <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is equal {{as well as the}} case where the probability of failure from each <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is not equal. We also consider various levels <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> failure probability and possible procurement or operating cost savings gained from using less reliable suppliers. The results indicate that when suppliers are highly reliable, sole sourcing is the lowest cost approach under all experimental conditions. However, as the suppliers become less reliable, additional suppliers may be required to obtain the lowest cost. Finally, it was shown that only in the extreme conditions <b>of</b> unreliable <b>suppliers,</b> high loss to operational cost per supplier, and low ability to mitigate the failure from a partial set <b>of</b> <b>suppliers,</b> having a large number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> is an effective strategy.
