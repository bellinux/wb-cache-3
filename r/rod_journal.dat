50|$|Each time a {{cylinder}} fires, {{the force of}} the combustion is imparted to the crankshaft <b>rod</b> <b>journal.</b> The <b>rod</b> <b>journal</b> deflects in a torsional motion to some degree under this force. Harmonic vibrations result from the torsional motion imparted on the crankshaft. These harmonics are a function of many factors including frequencies created by the actual combustion and the natural frequencies the metals make under the stresses of combustion and flexing. In some engines, the torsional motion of the crankshaft at certain speeds can synchronize with the harmonic vibrations, causing a resonance. In some cases the resonance may stress the crankshaft to the point of cracking or complete failure.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{positions}} of the main bearings must be between individual cylinders (L4 with 5 main bearings, or L6 with 7 main bearings - only one <b>rod</b> <b>journal</b> between main bearings), or between adjacent pairs of cylinders (L4 with 3 main bearings, L6 or V6 with 4 main bearings, or V8 with 5 main bearings - two rod journals between main bearings).|$|E

50|$|Multi-bank engines {{with many}} cylinders, {{such as a}} V12 layout, have little space {{available}} for many connecting <b>rod</b> <b>journals</b> on a limited length of crankshaft. This is a difficult compromise to solve and its consequence has often led to engines being regarded as failures (Sunbeam Arab, Rolls-Royce Vulture).|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{automotive}} engines {{have one}} main bearing {{at each end}} of the crankshaft and another in between each adjacent pair of connecting <b>rod</b> <b>journals,</b> but not all engines conform to this generalization. Notable exceptions include the Ford flathead V-8, which had only three main bearings, and Chevrolet's inline-six cylinder engine, which had in various iterations, three, four or seven main bearings.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{and most}} important, the crankshaft's rod {{journals}} are physically {{farther from the}} main journals than on the original equipment. A given extension in {{the distance between the}} rod and main journals results in twice that distance in increase of piston travel. For example, in a Chrysler LA (1971-1992) 360 cubic inch (5.9 l) V8, the <b>rod</b> <b>journal</b> centerline is 1.79 in (4.55 cm) from the main journal centerline. The piston travels 3.58 in (9.1 cm) in this configuration. When this engine is modified with a 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) stroker kit, the distance between the main journal centerline and the <b>rod</b> <b>journal</b> centerline is increased to 2.00 in (5.08 cm), which results in the piston travelling 4.00 in (10.16 cm). So, the modified crankshaft with 0.21 in (0.53 cm) further distance between the main and rod journals results in 42 cubic inches (.7 [...] ) of displacement greater than the engine had before.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} {{variations}} of the EJ25D sold in the US market. The engine was introduced in 1996 in the Legacy 2.5GT, LSi, and Legacy Outback. That version of the engine used HLA heads, was recommended to be run on 91 octane fuel, had lower power and torque ratings than the later '97-99 EJ25D, and was only offered with an automatic transmission. In 1997 a revised engine was introduced that used heads with shimmed bucket lifters (versus the HLAs), was designed to run on 87 octane fuel, and was available with either a manual or automatic transmission. Because of the DOHC valve architecture, the spark plugs {{are more difficult to}} service in comparison to SOHC variations. The DOHC engines are therefore installed with platinum spark plugs and an extended spark plug service life of 80000 mi. The EJ25D uses smaller 48mm rod journals, compared to the 2.2L of the same year, and the 1999+ 2.5L engines which use a 52mm <b>rod</b> <b>journal.</b> As well, the EJ25D from the 1999 Outback is a one year only factory hybrid, which uses the phase 2 case halves with an 8 bolt bell housing (as opposed to the 4 bolt bell housing used until 1998), uses a phase 2 crankshaft and rods with 52mm rod journals, but retains the same pistons as the 1997-1998 variant to maintain the same compression ratio. The 1996 EJ25D uses different pistons than what was used for 1997-1999, which will increase the compression ratio significantly if combined with 1997-1999 EJ25D heads.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary design {{solutions}} {{in the engine}} engineering are aimed at raising a great many technical and economic performances, and enhancing manufacturability. When producing the V-shaped six-cylinder engines, the camber angle is often taken to be equal to 90 Â°, which is technologically advantageous {{in the production of}} V 8 engines. However, this solution leads to the engine instability and deteriorates mass-dimension and vibration performances of the engine. A crankshaft with the offset connecting <b>rod</b> <b>journals</b> is the solution to which Western and Russian power plant developers have increasingly taken recourse. However, introducing such a shaft entails a number of difficulties, and what is the most important requires special methods of calculation. There are no direct analytical methods to calculate this type of crankshafts. The article describes a technique to estimate endurance using a software complex "KVAL", developed at the BMSTU Department "Piston engines". This software disables direct examination of the crankshaft of this type, however, in conjunction with other calculations enables estimating endurance. The main point of the technique is a two-staged calculation. The original crankshaft is represented at first as a crankshaft with the connecting rods, sitting side-by-side. The article studies its endurance in the fillets of the <b>rod</b> bearing <b>journal</b> transition to the cheek and also at the outlets of two oil-feed holes. The second stage presumes that the shaft has an articulated rod and using the same type of calculations studies the fillet transition of the <b>rod</b> bearing <b>journals</b> to the intermediate cheek by its representation as an oil hole. Each of the stages refines theoretical coefficients of stress concentration through numerical simulation in the software package "ANSYS", thereby making calculation more stringent. The results obtained are very evident and representative, but also allow us to suggest a number of hypotheses for further research. The proposed technique enables us to study endurance of the crankshafts with offset connecting <b>rod</b> <b>journals,</b> as well as the Napoleone crankshafts of opposed reciprocating engines. </p...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most modern engines utilise pistons with an offset gudgeon pin. In internal combustion engines, the offset is to the major thrust side of the piston. The piston thrust side {{is the part of}} the piston perpendicular to the gudgeon pin that carries the majority of side loading during the power stroke. Primary reason for having the gudgeon pin positioned eccentrically is to prevent the piston from slamming into the cylinder bore after the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>journal</b> passes the top dead centre. This phenomenon is referred to as piston slap, and is more pronounced in compression ignition and high performance engines due to higher combustion pressure than that of commercial spark ignition engines. The coming together of the piston and the bore results in scuffing, at best, or, catastrophic failure at worst. Clearance space between bore and piston is filled by a lubricant film. The main role of the lubricant is to separate the piston and bore by reacting to the applied load. Investigating the above problem requires a holistic approach, whereby a dynamic three degree-of-freedom piston model is coupled with a lubrication model to represent the actual system. The dynamic model determines the motion of the piston in combined axial, lateral and rotation about the gudgeon pin. The reactive forces due to lubricant films on the major and minor thrust sides of the piston play significant roles in piston dynamics and are evaluated by either quasi-static or transient solution of the lubricant contact conjunctions. The novel quasi-static analysis is carried out in the sense of its detailed approach, including many key practical features. not incorporated in other analyses, hitherto reported in literature. These features include first and foremost the development of a specific contact mechanics model for evaluation of conforming contacts for piston skirt against liner or bore. The quasi-static analysis includes many practical feature not encountered in other literature on the subject, such as detailed surface irregularities and modification features, and with thermal distortion. The analysis has been extended to thermohydrodynamics, as well as micro-hydrodynamics, all with high computational mesh densities, and robust methods of solution in space and time domains, including effective influence Newton-Raphson method and linear acceleration integration scheme. The transient tribo-elasto-multi-body dynamics problem includes physics of motion study from film thickness prediction and secondary motion evaluation of the order of micrometers and minutes of arc to large rigid body dynamics, including simultaneous solution of the contact problem at both major and minor thrust sides. Such a comprehensive solution has not hitherto been reported in literature. The thesis discusses many aspects of piston dynamics problem, through the broad spectrum of vehicle manufacture, with many pertinent practical engineering issues. In particular, it provides solutions for high performance Formula 1 racing engines. This is the first ever comprehensive analysis of piston tribodynamics for this range of engines at very high combustion pressures. This study has shown the paramount influence of profile of piston in promoting lubrication between the contiguous bodies, as evident from the pattern of lubricant flow through the contact. Deformation of the bodies increases the volume of lubricant in the contact. During the reversal in direction of piston motion, when the entraining velocity momentarily cases and reversal takes place, the load is held by an elastic squeez...|$|E
50|$|From these {{holes in}} the main journals, the oil moves through passageways inside the {{crankshaft}} to exit {{holes in the}} <b>rod</b> <b>journals</b> to lubricate the rod bearings and connecting rods. Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. However, in modern designs, there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the rod bearings to the rod-piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. This oil film {{also serves as a}} seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase.

40|$|Currently, a {{great number}} of large vehicle engines, {{especially}} diesel ones, have a V-shaped configuration layout. For six-cylinder and eight-cylinder V-engines, to simplify a processing technology of the block-crankcases, in the section manufacturers often use the 90 Â° angle, which is the most prevalent angle for the V 8 engine. However, in this case, an even firing cycle in the cylinders is not provided for the V 6 layout. This leads to significant vibrations, especially at idle and requires for a more massive flywheel. Designers face the challenge to provide the even firing cycle in the cylinders. To solve this problem are often used the crankshaft designs, which have the offset <b>rod</b> <b>journals.</b> However, it leads to the manufacturing complexity of the shaft, and also to the need to use the special methods of calculation. There are no direct calculation methods for the crankshafts of this design. The paper proposes a technique to define the nominal stresses in the crankshaft of this design. To consider the shaft is used a split-type design. The paper presents a schematic diagram of the crankshaft loading, and on its basis describes equations of the moments for each section. A special attention is drawn to the new constructive element, i. e. an intermediate cheek. For clarity, the diagrams of moments in two mutually perpendicular planes are built. It is worth noting that the paper also proposes a technique from transition from the global to the local coordinate system when considering the moments in the crankshaft elements. Further, there are the appropriate expressions to determine the nominal stresses. This {{is one of the main}} desired values in calculating the crankshaft endurance. The developed technique in the particular case allows the calculation of crankshaft engine models that can be subsumed under the advantages. In the future the proposed technique is expected to be a basis for creating a software complex. The complex objective is expected to be capable to calculate the endurance of the crankshafts with offset connecting <b>rod</b> <b>journals</b> in a wide range of the main design variables, and, as already mentioned, calculate the shaft endurance of the reciprocating engine. </p...|$|R

A heat resistant light-metal-alloy is used for the cast pistons. The combustion chamber is integrated into the piston. For compression, the pistons have two piston rings which slots are cast into the piston. The pistons are also equipped with an oil control ring. The cylinder liners are made of centrifugally cast iron, two rubber rings seal the liners off from the crankcase. The engine has two cast iron cylinder blocks with two cylinders; every block has a head, which makes two cylinder heads.|$|R
