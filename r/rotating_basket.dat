40|$|Abstract. —In large, turbid rivers, fish {{wheels are}} often used as a live-capture {{technique}} for monitoring migratory fish runs. After capture in the wheel’s <b>rotating</b> <b>baskets,</b> fish are lifted out of the water, slid down a chute, collected in a live-box, and then sampled. To eliminate the handling and holding of fish associated with fish wheel live-boxes, an event-triggered video system was developed so that fish were video recorded during capture and then immediately released back into the river. A magnetic switch, connected to an exit door installed in the fish wheel chute, signaled a computer to videotape passing fish. Periods of no fish capture were not recorded. Reliability and accuracy were evaluated over a 3 -year period, 2001 – 2003. In over 14, 000 h of operation and 262, 000 recorded fish images, the system failed only once (due to a malfunction of the exit door). Fish counts from the video system were 4 % higher than counts from fish wheel live-boxes, mostly because fish were jumping out of the live-box before counting began. Compared with continuous time-lapse recordings, the video system missed 1 % of captured fish, mostly small Coregonus spp. that passed under the exit door without activating the switch. Subsequent adjust-ments {{to the door and}} software capture settings eliminated undercounting. The advantages of the switch-triggered video system over traditional fish wheels with live-boxes were reduced handling and holding time for captured fish; improved counting accuracy; unattended operation; and lower labor costs. Future developments in image recognition and motion detection software should increase the use of event-triggered video in fishery science.

50|$|Fishwheels, {{though not}} traditional, came into {{use in the}} late nineteenth century. The {{mechanism}} was based on a floating platform tied to a tree on the bank of a river. The wheel consisted of two or four large baskets arranged around an axle. The force of the river's current <b>rotated</b> the <b>baskets</b> as with a conventional waterwheel, and salmon resting in the current were caught in the basket. The basket spilled its contents as it came {{over the top of the}} wheel, and the fish dropped into a large pen or container. Fishwheels are still used in some locations, particularly the Copper and Chilkat Rivers. They have the particular advantage of working without constant attendance, and harvesters can come by a few times a day to remove the caught fish and process them. Their disadvantage is that they are slow, and depend largely on luck to catch salmon being pushed downstream by the current; placement in well known channels increases the recovery, but still does not compare to more active means of harvest.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve fast release of ibuprofen, {{slightly}} soluble model substance (0. 52104 mol/l), surfactant systems for oral use with different PEG- 40 hydrogenated castor oil (C) /diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (T) ratios were investigated. Comparison between dissolution profiles for ibuprofen from formulated systems and from two commercial products, film tablets and soft capsules, is presented in this paper. Photon correlation spectroscopy has shown that after high dilution with water, surfactant systems were able to form micellar solutions. The size of micelles varies from 14. 8 ± 0, 075 nm to 16. 2 ± 0, 021 nm with increasing C/T ratio from 1 : 2 to 2 : 1. Although with increasing content of PEG- 40 hydrogenated castor oil larger micelles have formed, lower values of polydispersity index indicated that more homogeneous distribution of micelles size was gained. Conductometric analysis has demonstrated that system composing of C/T ratio 2 : 1, has shown most pronounced interaction between droplets, which {{can be seen as}} high rise of electrical conductivity with increasing water content (% (wwater/wtotal)) in the sample. No significant difference in percolation threshold between formulations with different C/T ratios was observed. Different surfactant systems were adsorbed on magnesium aluminometasilicate, as adsorbent with high specific active surface (≈ 300 m 2 /g), in order to investigate potential influence of adsorbent on ibuprofen dissolution rate. Formulated systems, with or without adsorbent were filled in hard gelatin capsules. The dissolution profiles of ibuprofen from different formulations were obtained in 30 minutes by dissolution apparatus with <b>rotating</b> <b>baskets</b> and compared with dissolution profiles of ibuprofen from commercial products. For formulations without adsorbent faster release of ibuprofen in first minutes of dissolution test, showed formulations with C/T ratio 2 : 1 and 1 : 1.

The intraparticle diffusivity of S(VI) is obtained from independent tracer experiments. In the oxidation reaction HSO 3 - is the reactive species. Both the S(IV) species in the solution, namely SO 2 (aq) and HSO 3 - get adsorbed onto the active PVP-Cu sites of the catalyst, but only HSO 3 - undergoes oxidation. A kinetic mechanism is proposed based on this feature which shows that SO 2 (aq) has a deactivating effect on the catalyst. A rate model is developed for the three-phase reaction system incorporating these factors along with the effect of concentration of H 2 SO 4 on the solubility of SO 2 in the dilute aqueous solutions of Cu(II). Transient oxidation experiments are conducted at different conditions of concentration of SO 2 and O- 2 in the gas phase and catalyst concentration, and the rate parameters are estimated from the data.

Given the emerging importance of using nanoparticles as a promising way to enhance the dissolution rate of these drugs, a method must be developed to adequately reflect the rate-change due to size reduction. At present, there is little published work examining the suitability of different dissolution apparatus for nanoparticles. Methods Four commonly-used methods (the paddle, <b>rotating</b> <b>basket</b> and flow-through cell from the US Pharmacopia, and a dialysis method) were employed to measure the dissolution rates of cefuroxime axetil {{as a model for}} nanodrug particles.

Following each run, the fuel basket was sectioned and the fuel was removed. Samples of the fuel were analyzed for the extent of uranium oxide reduction to metal and for the concentration of salt constituents, i. e., LiCl and Li 2 O. Extents of uranium oxide reduction ranged from 43 – 70 % in stainless steel wire mesh baskets and 8 – 33 % in sintered stainless steel baskets. The concentrations of Li 2 O in the salt phase of the fuel product from the stainless steel wire mesh baskets ranged from 6. 2 – 9. 2 wt%, while those for the sintered stainless steel baskets ranged from 26 – 46 wt%.

Methocel K 4 M, Methocel K 15 M CR, Methocel K 100 LV CR, Eudragit RSPO and Eudragit RLPO polymers were used as rate retarding agents in twenty four formulations (F- 1 to F- 24). The effect of hydrophilic polymer PEG 6000 as channeling agent with Methocel K 4 M was observed in four formulations (F- 5 to F- 8). The granules were evaluated for angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density. The tablets were subjected to average weight, diameter, thickness, weight variation, hardness, friability and in vitro dissolution studies. The granules showed satisfactory flow properties, compressibility and drug content. The in vitro dissolution study was carried using USP Apparatus-I (<b>Rotating</b> <b>basket</b> method apparatus) for 6 to 12 hours in distilled water with 1 % sodium lauryl sulphate as the dissolution medium. The release mechanisms were explored and explained by Zero order, First order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas and Hixson-Crowell equations. Primarily twelve formulations were prepared by using four variable amount of three polymers; Methocel K 4 M (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg) in th...|$|E
40|$|High {{efficiency}} mist eliminators (HEME) {{and high}} efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) made of High fiberglass {{will be used}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to remove particulate matter from offgases generated during melter feed preparation and vitrification of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). These filters will be contaminated with high-level, radioactive species and also with various high-boiling organic compounds. For this reason, a process was developed at the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) that will dissolve the spent filters so that the residues may be recycled to the HLW tanks for eventual vitrification. This process involves boiling the filters sequentially in NaOH, HN 0 {sub 3 } and NaOH, while contained in a stainless steal wire mesh frame assembly. The objective of this communication is to present some of the original preliminary work done by Ritter on the simple one-step dissolution process. The results from six bench-scale experiments are reported for the dissolution of an organically-fouled sample of HEME obtained from the Integrated DWPF Melter (IDMS) offgas filtration system. The preliminary effects of filter packing density, air sparging versus <b>rotating</b> <b>basket</b> agitation, fouling, and adding Triton X- 405 as a dispersing agent are reported...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} both the in vitro and in vivo release of apomorphine from mucoadhesive powder formulations of Carbopol 971 P and polycarbophil. METHODS: The in vitro drug release from the mucoadhesive formulations was studied using a modified USP XXII <b>rotating</b> <b>basket.</b> The pharmacokinetics of apomorphine given as a solution was determined after subcutaneous and intranasal administrations to rabbits. The animals also received intranasally the mucoadhesive dosage forms and immediate release lactose powder mixture. Comparisons were made between the salient pharmacokinetic parameters of the different dosage forms. RESULTS: Sustained in vitro drug release was obtained from the mucoadhesive formulations. Apomorphine was absorbed more rapidly in rabbits when administered intranasally than as a subcutaneous injection. The mucoadhesive formulations both gave sustained plasma drug concentrations and bioavailabilities comparable to subcutaneous injections. The times taken to achieve peak plasma drug concentrations from these mucoadhesive formulations were more than three-fold that of lactose. With these mucoadhesive formulations apomorphine lasted longer in the blood. It could be detected for up to 6 - 8 h compared to approximately 3 h for the other forms of administration. CONCLUSIONS: The nasal bioavailability of powders is higher than that of solutions. Drug release from the mucoadhesive powders was sustained and there was no significant difference between Carbopol 971 P and polycarbophil. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Colon-specific controlled-delivery 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) {{matrices}} for {{the treatment}} of colorectal carcinoma were prepared and evaluated. Matrices are destined to be introduced into enteric-coated capsules and thereby carried to and liberated in the ileum. There, drug release should be prevented until matrices reach descending colon where release should occur. Matrices (50 mg, diameter 0. 6 mm) were prepared by compression of powders or of granules prepared by melt granulation. The ingredients comprised 30 - 70 % w/w 5 -FU, glyceryl palmitostearate as rate-controlling material and 5 % w/w Aerosil as glidant. Drug release was measured by the <b>rotating</b> <b>basket</b> method. The matrix containing 60 % w/w drug, prepared by compression of powders, was appropriate to make the planned system, in virtue of its fairly high drug load and its nearly constant and reasonable release rate. This matrix was spray-coated with Eudragit S 100 (EUD). Subsequently, an external layer of chitosan hydrochloride (CH-HCl) was applied by a dipping-drying technique. When transit of coated matrix through ileum (phosphate buffer (PB) pH 7. 4), ascending colon (PB pH 6 containing rat cecal contents) and descending colon (PB pH 7. 4) was simulated in vitro, the pH 4. 7 of the CH-HCl gel layer and the pH 6 of the ascending colon prevented dissolution of the protective EUD film until descending colon was reached, then controlled release started. The present small matrices can enter size no. 00 capsules. Considering that each capsule contains 10 matrices, the maximal dose is 300 mg...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} {{the preparation of}} nimesulide-chitosan microparticles (NCM) as sustained delivery carriers with different polymer concentrations by pH change coacervation method using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent. Microparticle size was measured using light microscope. The drug release from NCM was tested by the <b>rotating</b> <b>basket</b> method of USP and the dissolution data were analyzed assuming various kinetic models. According to the results, the mean diameter and morphology of various batches of prepared NCM was 102 ± 1. 95 &# 956;m to 152 ± 1. 73 &# 956;m and yellowish rough spheres, respectively. Fourier trans-form infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetric analysis confirmed the compatibility of nimesulide with chitosan. X-ray diffractometry showed {{that there is a}} decrease in crystallinity of the drug after microencapsulation. All batches of NCM showed good flow properties. The rate of drug release decreased with increased concentration of chitosan. Formulation F 5 was found to be an optimum formulation depending upon good encapsulation efficiency (65. 87 ± 3. 44 %) and smaller size (103 ± 3. 37 &# 956;m). Maximum amount of drug release was 90. 03 % in 12 h. The drug release data was analyzed by Korsmeyer-Peppas equation to calculate the diffusional exponent (n), which indicated diffusion pattern of nimesulide release. The stability studies of the NCM showed that drug was fully stable in microparticles at storage conditions of room temperature, 37 °C, 25 °C/ 60 % relative humidity (RH) and 45 °C/ 60 % RH, for 3 months using stability testing chamber. The present combination for encapsulating nimesulide demonstrates an effective way to prolong the drug release...|$|E
40|$|An in-liquid drying {{microencapsulation}} {{method for}} producing sustained release cefaclor (CF) microspheres has been developed. Sieved fractions of CF monohydrate particles together with polyvinylpyrrolidone (M-w similar to 40 000) were dispersed in a solvent mixture of dichloromethane with cyclohexane (40 : 60 v/v) containing dissolved ethylcellulose (EC; 48 - 49. 5 % ethoxy content). Encapsulation was effected {{by adding the}} dispersion to a stirred aqueous medium saturated with CF. The resulting microspheres (collected overnight and oven-dried at 40 degrees C) were examined for size and surface features by scanning electron microscopy, and for solid-state interactions and phase changes using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffractometry. The rate and extent of CF release in aqueous medium was measured at 37 degrees C using the USP <b>rotating</b> <b>basket</b> method at 100 rpm. The size, degree of sphericity, and rate of CF release of the microspheres were all shown {{to depend on the}} CF to EC mass ratio and the stirring speed employed in encapsulation. Higher EC to CF mass ratio and lower stirring speed afforded microspheres with slower release rate of CF. The rate of CF release from the microspheres fit the simplified Higuchi's planar model equation, and for the samples prepared at various EC:CF ratios, exhibited a strong correlation with drug loading (r = 0. 98; n= 4 (mean values); p < 0. 05). DSC studies on the samples indicated an absence of molecular interactions between EC and CF in the microspheres. The results demonstrate that the in-liquid drying method, if appropriately optimized, could be used to produce sustained-release CF microspheres with the desired release pattern and physical properties.

40|$|The study uses Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) {{spectroscopy}} {{to identify}} five Nevirapine (NV) co-crystals, determines the dissolution {{profile of the}} co-crystals and the antiviral activity comparative to pure NV. Hot stage microscopy measured the purity and integrity of each co-crystal. FTIR {{analysis was used to}} identify the co-crystals to make recommendations regarding the future use of the technique to identify the NV co-crystals. Dissolution studies of the NV co-crystals prepared with maleic acid, salicylic acid and glutaric acid (NVMLE, NVSLI and NVGLT, respectively) were completed using the <b>rotating</b> <b>basket</b> method. Assays were conducted using High Performance Liquid Chromatography and compared to pure NV and the five NV: co-former mixtures. The antiviral activity was tested to determine whether the co-crystals had an improved activity against HIV- 1 compared to pure NV. All co-crystals, except NVTTA (a NV co-crystal prepared with rac-tartaric acid), were pure and maintained their integrity for approximately one year. NVGLT, NVMLE and NVTTA, 1 : 1 molar ratio co-crystals were identified by FTIR. The C=O stretching frequency of the carboxylic acid groups of NV and GLT were observed at 1638. 15 cm- 1 and 1719. 23 cm- 1 in the NVGLT co-crystal which corresponded with spectra of NVMLE and NVTTA. In NVMLE the C=O stretching frequency of the C=O of NV and MLE were observed at 1640. 58 cm- 1 and 1694. 10 cm- 1 and in NVTTA it was at 1637. 25 cm- 1 and 1708. 50 cm- 1, suggesting the presence of both parent molecules in the new phase for NVGLT, NVMLE and NVTTA. Dissolution studies suggested that NVGLT was the only co-crystal that yielded better results than both NV and its physical mixture. The antiviral activity of the NVSC (an NV co-crystal prepared with saccharin) and NVSLI cocrystals in DMSO was significantly different to pure NV, demonstrating an improvement in anti-viral activity...|$|E
