5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures {{to be on the}} ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E
