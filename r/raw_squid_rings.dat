40|$|ABSTRACT: Oil {{degradation}} {{caused by}} the number of fryings performed and the effect of oil degradation on the color of fried battered <b>squid</b> <b>rings</b> were studied. Spectrophotometric tech-niques with absorbance in the UV and visible ranges, and io-dine, peroxide, and acid values were used to determine oil degradation. Determination of various CIELAB parameters in order to study the external color of the fried battered <b>squid</b> <b>rings</b> revealed no differences in color due to the number of fryings. A study of the color of the battered <b>squid</b> <b>rings</b> at various frying times and temperatures showed significant differences for both variables. Although there was some degradation in the oil after 20 fryings, appearing as a slight darkening, it did not affect the final color of the fried, battered <b>squid</b> <b>rings.</b> Paper no.

40|$|An HTS SQUID {{is a high}} {{sensitive}} magnetic sensor. In recent years, the HTS SQUID is widely used in various applications. In some applications, high robustness with respect to magnetic noise is required to realize stable operation at outside of a magnetic shielding room. The target {{of this paper is}} a directly coupled HTS dc-SQUID magnetometer. To enhance the robustness of the SQUID magnetometer, use of a superconducting thin film shield has been proposed. The magnetic field directly penetrating the <b>SQUID</b> <b>ring</b> causes the change of the critical current of Josephson junction, and then the SQUID magnetometer transitions into inoperative state. In order to confirm the magnetic shield effect of the superconducting film shield, electromagnetic field simulation with 3 D edge finite element method was performed.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{concentrates}} on the interactions between circuit systems operating in the quantum regime. The main thrust of this work {{involves the use of}} a new model for investigating the way in which different components in such systems behave when coupled together. This is achieved by utilising the matrix representation of quantum mechanics, in conjunction with a number of other theoretical techniques (such as Wigner functions and entanglement entropies). With these tools in place it then becomes possible to investigate and review different quantum circuit systems. These investigations cover systems ranging from simple electromagnetic (cm) field oscillators in isolation to coupled <b>SQUID</b> <b>rings</b> in more sophisticated multi-component arrangements. Primarily, we look at the way <b>SQUID</b> <b>rings</b> couple to em fields, and how the ring-field interaction can be mediated by the choice of external flux, #PHI#_x, applied to the <b>SQUID</b> <b>ring.</b> A lot of interest is focused on the transfer of energy between the system modes. However, we also investigate the statistical properties of the system, including squeezing, entropy and entanglement. Among the phenomena uncovered in this research we note the ability to control coupling in <b>SQUID</b> <b>rings</b> via the external flux, the capacity for entanglement between quantum circuit modes, frequency conversions of photons, flux squeezing and the existence of Schroedinger Cat states.

These devices are currently strong candidates for many applications in quantum technologies. The weak link brings with it a non-linearity such that semi-classical models of this system can exhibit chaotic dynamics. For many similar systems an application of the correspondence principle together with the inclusion of environmental degrees of freedom through a quantum trajectories approach can be used to effectively recover classical dynamics.
