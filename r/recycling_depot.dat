These programmes include Leaf-It Depots, Chin-In Depots, a Backyard Composting programme and Winnipeg also have seven general use <b>recycling</b> <b>depots</b> around the city. The net cost of current recycling programme depends on the market rates for the recycled materials {{and the level of}} funding received under Provincial regulation. Over past 15 years, Winnipeg City has recycled more than 700 million kg of waste through the Manitoba Product Stewardship Corporation (MPSC), which pays 80% of the net cost of the recycling service.|$|R
50|$|This long-standing {{collaborative}} {{project has been}} successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers, it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums. The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of <b>recycling</b> <b>depots</b> next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site, Residencial Nova Chocolatão, linked to the garbage-collection process of the city (an example of linking the sub-domains of ‘emission and waste’ and ‘organization and governance’); and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community. The Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement. This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements.|$|R
50|$|Electronics {{companies}} are constantly {{coming out with}} new technologies, rendering old models obsolete. These older technologies {{can be sent to}} <b>recycling</b> <b>depots</b> for proper dismantling; however, there is a large component of technology that gets shipped overseas to less developed countries for inexpensive, labour-intensive recycling. From the mid-1990s until about 2001, it is estimated that some 50 to 80 percent of the electronics collected for recycling in the western half of the United States was being exported for dismantling overseas, predominantly to China and Southeast Asia. This scrap processing is quite profitable due to an abundant workforce and cheap labour. Proper disposal and recycling of these electronics is difficult, labour-intensive, and therefore expensive. As a result, large quantities of the waste are shipped overseas to places where the labour is cheap and the environmental laws are lax.|$|R

30|$|The {{government}} has intentions {{to limit the}} use of plastic in local packaging and increase composting, {{in an effort to}} reduce the amount of waste destined for landfills which will be complimented by the city opening new landfill sites in the Doro, Dertu- Mojo, Bole and YekaAbado districts distributed across the city. Recycling remains limited but is likely to increase with the establishment of central <b>recycling</b> <b>depots</b> for metal and plastic. There is limited citywide waste collection. Instead city neighbourhoods (“kebeles”) are responsible for collecting rubbish in partnership with private companies, but collection costs remain high. As for policy Addis Ababa does not encourage proper waste management by citizens and fails to impose measures such as bans on littering and making waste dumping illegal [4]. On the other hand, Addis Ababa fares fairly well in the collection and disposal of special waste as it has facilities to deal with chemical and pharmaceutical waste.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s in Manitoba, {{a group of}} {{citizens}} and environmental activists held meetings at Westminister Church in Winnipeg to share concerns {{about the amount of}} waste that was then going to landfill. On February 14, 1985, they founded the Recycling Council of Manitoba (RCM) with the goal of promoting recycling. Members of the Council included individuals, schools, recycling groups and municipal officials in communities across the province of Manitoba. The new organization held a number of special recycling events, which proved overwhelmingly popular with city residents. Subsequently, the Council set about creating ongoing <b>recycling</b> <b>depots</b> in various locations around Winnipeg, such as community centres. Much of the work of collecting, sorting and shipping the recyclables was done by volunteers. The group also met with City of Winnipeg and Manitoba provincial officials to urge establishment of a permanent recycling (blue box) program for Winnipeg. In 1989, the Recycling Council of Manitoba helped form the Manitoba Recycling Action Committee to promote the idea of producer responsibility in Manitoba. In short, in Manitoba as elsewhere across Canada, the movement for municipal solid waste recycling was led by citizens. The Recycling Council {{played a key role in}} demonstrating not only the practicality of recycling, but also the strong public demand for it. By 1996, with a Waste Reduction and Prevention Act in place provincially and a new crown entity (the Manitoba Product Stewardship Corporation) in position to administer beverage container levies collected at retail, members of the Recycling Council voted to change the name to Resource Conservation Manitoba (sticking with the RCM initials).|$|R
5000|$|Ecology Action was {{launched}} on Earth Day in 1970 as an all-volunteer, unmanned <b>recycling</b> donation <b>depot</b> for bottles and cans. Forty years later, {{the organization has}} become a leader in California’s sustainability program design and development with active programs focused on driving behavior change in water conservation, energy management, and alternative transportation. The organization persevered through the conservative backlash of the 1980s—when the state froze over {{half a million dollars}} of their grant contracts—and the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Despite these setbacks, Ecology Action’s sustainability programs have helped over 20,000 California residents and business owners save millions of gallons of water and reduce energy consumption by half a million kilowatt hours each year.|$|R

40|$|John Wynne’s Installation for 300 speakers, player {{piano and}} vacuum cleaner {{is at once}} monumental, minimal and immersive. It uses sound and sculptural {{assemblage}} to explore and define architectural space and to investigate the borders between sound and music. The piece has three interwoven sonic elements: the ambient sound of the space {{in which it is}} installed, the notes played by the piano, and a computer-controlled soundtrack consisting of synthetic sounds and gently manipulated notes from the piano itself. Because none of these elements are synchronised with each other, the composition will never repeat. The music punched into the paper roll is Franz Léhar’s 1909 operetta Gypsy Love, but the mechanism has been altered to play at a very slow tempo and the Pianola modified to play only the notes which most excite the resonant frequencies of the gallery space in which it is installed. Sound moves through the space on trajectories programmed using a 32 -channel sound controller, creating a kind of epic, abstract 3 -D opera in slow motion. Originally developed during Wynne's AHRC-funded 'Soundtrap' residency at Beaconsfield gallery, a former Victorian ‘ragged school’ in South London, this piece draws on notions of obsolescence and nostalgia, combining early 20 th century technology and culture with a vast collection of discarded hi-fi speakers found on the streets of London and Berlin and in <b>recycling</b> <b>depots</b> in both cities. These disparate components are brought together through contemporary digital technology which not only distributes the sound but also controls the (found) vacuum cleaner which in turn drives the Pianola. The piece is site-specific, but it also carries traces of its own history: some of the synthetic sounds were created in response to the light industrial ambience of the work’s original location, some in response to its new site in the Saatchi Gallery. The mountainous formation of speakers, inspired by the recycling plant from which some of the speakers were rescued, functions both visually and as a platform for the projection of sound, creating, in the words of writer Brandon LaBelle, ‘a soft balance between order and chaos, organization and its rupture’...|$|R
50|$|An on-site Household Hazardous Waste depot {{collected}} paint, batteries, pesticides, {{cleaning agents}} and {{other hazardous waste}} in small (residential) quantities. A general <b>recycling</b> <b>depot,</b> to which residents and businesses could bring appliances (refrigerators, stoves, washing machines, etc.), corrugated cardboard, drywall, scrap metal and tires for recycling operated at the site, as did a tire <b>recycling</b> <b>depot.</b> The facility also had a yard waste drop-off area, from which the operators would transport material for composting in large outdoor windrows on a site north of the landfill, at the Avondale Composting Site. It also accepted waste brought by residents of households in York Region, but building contractors abused the privilege by bringing numerous small loads to the landfill, prompting {{the imposition of a}} tipping fee in 1990 for pickup trucks and small trailers. Commercial haulers were charged $18 per tonne in 1988, and $97 per tonne in 1990.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the enthusiasm for {{recycling}} that swept the nation following Earth Day (1970), many communities set up recycling programs that required householders to drive their cans and glass bottles to a <b>recycling</b> <b>depot,</b> sort the glass bottles by color, and throw them into large metal containers.

5000|$|The Oak Bay Green Committee (OBGC) is a {{community}} grassroots volunteer organization in Oak Bay, British Columbia. It was formed in early 2005 after a developer cut down a venerable beech tree in South Oak Bay. Neighbors were so upset {{by the loss of}} the tree and the lack of comprehensive tree protection bylaws in the municipality that they lobbied Oak Bay Mayor and Council members to create better tree protection bylaws. The OBGC's initial activism stemmed from the belief that mature trees of all species, on public and private land, need better stewardship from the community. After almost two years of community groups, individuals, the mayor, and council working together, Oak Bay Municipality adopted Tree Protection Bylaw 4326 on August 21, 2006. The OBGC continues to promote awareness of the importance of having an urban forest in the community. Although the OBGC formed as an ad hoc committee working for better tree protection bylaws, the OBGC decided to continue on as a local environmental group and work on other community-based environmental initiatives. Other OBGC projects include community school visits, Oak Bay Library environmental displays, a sewage treatment alliance, a soft plastic <b>recycling</b> <b>depot,</b> community climate change awareness, and a [...] "no engine idling" [...] campaign. OBGC works in conjunction with St. Philip's Anglican Church and Pacific Mobile Depots.|$|E
5000|$|Episode 3 - Days 7-10 (September 28) - After Geoff spends another $500 on {{a garbage}} bin (now leaving them with $3500) to address Ron's concerns, {{a trip to}} an {{electronics}} <b>recycling</b> <b>depot</b> by Anthony and Jean-Marc yields nine identical computer monitors, giving Jean-Marc the idea to hang the monitors as a showpiece for the room. While Jean-Marc works on them, Geoff takes Gordie and Anthony to task for not getting the junk they desperately need, being behind schedule on many fronts. This irks the two freecyclers, as the [...] "freecycling to spec" [...] needed for this job contrasts with the traditional method of freecycling renovation (freecycling to hoard supplies, and starting work only after the necessary materials are found). Nevertheless, freecycling trips by {{the two of them}} nets the crew some old plumbing that the crew can reuse for their shower, most (but not all) of the kitchen cabinetry they need, as well as a bathtub that, after Geoff declares it to be unusable (due to the rusted drain {{and the fact that they}} have an existing tub), Michelle repurposes as a sofa. Because they are behind schedule, Geoff, behind the rest of the team's back, commissions a tiler to help tile the bathroom for $1200. In the end, despite being pleased with Jean-Marc's nine-monitor display, Ron is visibly concerned that the work is behind schedule, and the problem is compounded when he orders the teardown of a bedframe that Cam and Ross had taken half a day to build.|$|E
5000|$|Episode 5 - Days 14-18 (October 12) - A {{mistake in}} the budget {{calculations}} forces Geoff to admit to the team they only have $1100 left. To raise everyone's spirits, the team head to Toronto Pearson International Airport, to an old storage facility named [...] "Fort Knox" [...] containing the parts {{that could not be}} recycled from the old Terminal 1 when the new Terminal 1 was built. However, the team, Jean-Marc most of all, as his [...] "high-end home theatre" [...] consists of an old television, can't find the necessary parts they need (though they do not leave empty-handed). Even as Jean-Marc is at a loss at what to do (now lacking the budget to buy {{their way out of the}} problem), Geoff decides to push his crew harder, creating a concrete countertop when they could not freecycle one. Still, the dire situation is creating a tense working environment, especially between Geoff and the freecyclers with a growing list of needed items and slim pickings with each garbage run, to the point where Geoff tells the freecyclers that they would be [...] "the goats" [...] if the project fails. Desperate for needed parts, Geoff has Michelle spend $300 of what they have left to buy things they need (including $169 for a new mattress, which offends Gordie as he believed he could find one for free). The team have another competition to make light fixtures out of old lights, while Cam finishes the boardroom table from the old church pews and Jean-Marc returns to the electronics <b>recycling</b> <b>depot</b> in the hopes of finding a better TV for their home theater. To his surprise, he finds a brand-new fully functional television there. However, the news is not all good: because of another accounting gaffe, the $300 purchase was actually a $500 purchase, and, combined with the $500 to remove the dumpster bin outside, the team has less than $100 left. Geoff asks Ron for more money when he visits, but Ron adamantly refuses and leaves without seeing the progress made. Geoff tells the team the bad news, but the team is confident they can complete the project without any more money and assure Geoff they can finish on time.|$|E

We live in a time with an ever increasing focus on sustainability, climate changes and the well being of our planet is taking priority and an unavoidable influence in our daily lives. The project strives to increase the awareness of an exchange centre situated inside a local recy- cling depot on Vermlandsgade in Copenhagen. Through the heightened awareness we hope to increase the flow of re-usable items passing through the exchange centre. The increased flow of items ought to lengthen the lifespan of daily life items and decrease {{the amount of waste}} ending up in the nearby <b>recycling</b> <b>depot.</b> In order to do so we aim to map out potential users of the exchange centre, whom are already roaming around the <b>recycling</b> <b>depot</b> and thereby be able to target the appropriate audience with the intention of making them aware of the existence of the exchange centre and thus increasing the user base of the centre. The developed solution to the problem is a mix of posting of signs on containers as well as the introduction of signs and messages on staff uniforms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the creation of}} interactive, educational activity pods at an education centre at a <b>recycling</b> <b>depot.</b> The project originated from a new waste management contract between Cheshire West and Chester Council and May Gurney (now Keir Waste Management), which included the provision of educational facilities. Representatives from May Gurney and the council’s waste management team approached the Faculty of Education & Children’s Services looking for input into the proposed education centre {{to be set up}} in Winsford, Cheshire. An already existing module on Education for Sustainable Development was modified to enable trainee teachers on a specialist global learning route of an undergraduate programme to devise and create interactive exhibits and activities for the Centre. Although a quite unique opportunity to create learning resources about recycling issues, the process described in the paper illustrates ways in which higher education, the private sector and local authorities can co-operate effectively for mutual benefit and the benefit of learners. Trainees’ ideas also illustrated ways in which the, sometimes quite abstract, concepts of Education for Sustainable Development can be translated into engaging activities with implications at local and more global levels...|$|E
