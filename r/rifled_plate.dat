50|$|Match 33 - Service <b>Rifle</b> Falling <b>Plates</b> is a four-competitor, {{elimination}} heat match {{where the}} team commences at the 300 metre firing point, runs {{down to the}} 200 metre firing point and engages 10 12 inch X 12 inch steel falling plates. The first team to shoot all the plates down wins the heat.|$|R
5000|$|The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) and the {{enhanced}} SAPI plate for the US DOD generally has this form. [...] Because {{of the use}} of ceramic <b>plates</b> for <b>rifle</b> protection, these vests are 5-8 times as heavy on an area basis as handgun protection. The weight and stiffness of rifle armor is a major technical challenge. The density, hardness and impact toughness are among the materials properties that are balanced to design these systems. While ceramic materials have some outstanding properties for ballistics they have poor fracture toughness. Failure of ceramic plates by cracking must also be controlled. [...] For this reason many ceramic <b>rifle</b> <b>plates</b> are a composite. The strike face is ceramic with the backface formed of laminated fiber and resin materials. The hardness of the ceramic prevents the penetration of the bullet while the tensile strength of the fiber backing helps prevent tensile failure. Examples of rifle resistant outer vests include the Interceptor body armor and the Improved Outer Tactical Vest.|$|R
50|$|Ceramics such as alumina, {{boron carbide}} and silicon carbide {{have been used}} in {{bulletproof}} vests to repel small arms <b>rifle</b> fire. Such <b>plates</b> are known commonly as trauma plates. Similar material is used to protect cockpits of some military aircraft, because of the low weight of the material.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic plates (also {{known as}} trauma plates) are {{commonly}} used as inserts in soft ballistic vests. Most ceramic plates used in body armor provide National Institute of Justice Type III protection, allowing them to stop <b>rifle</b> bullets. Ceramic <b>plates</b> are a form of composite armor. Insert plates may also be manufactured from steel or {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene.|$|R
25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most <b>rifle</b> cartridges, <b>plated</b> bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.|$|R

5000|$|The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is {{a ceramic}} trauma plate {{used by the}} United States Armed Forces. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a {{ballistic}} vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest {{as well as the}} Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available [...] "plate carriers". The Kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9Ã—19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher-velocity <b>rifle</b> rounds, SAPI <b>plates</b> are needed.|$|R
5000|$|The CCI Stinger was {{the first}} hyper-velocity [...]22 LR cartridge, and {{provided}} {{a significant increase in}} velocity and energy over standard rimfire rounds. The Stinger case is longer than that of the long rifle (about [...]71 in versus [...]595 in for the long <b>rifle),</b> but the <b>plated</b> hollow point bullet is lighter and shorter at , giving the same overall length as the long rifle cartridge. (This longer case can cause ejection problems in some guns.) A powder with a slower burning rate is used to make the most use of the length of a rifle barrel. Most [...]22 long rifle powders increase velocity up to about 19 in of barrel length; the powder used in the Stinger increases velocity up to the longest [...]22 barrel length tested by the NRA, 26 in.|$|R
2500|$|In AO Wondai on 13 January 8 Platoon C Company 9 RAR {{contacted}} two Viet Cong at 09:15, {{killing one}} and capturing an AK-47 and a pack. Soon after B Company discovered an unoccupied camp and captured {{a quantity of}} equipment including a 60mm mortar and base <b>plate,</b> <b>rifles</b> and ammunition. Several hours later A Company located a disused camp and a bunker system, uncovering grenades and explosives. Eight bodies were also discovered, and they were {{believed to have been}} killed during the contact three days before. Meanwhile, even with 1 RAR nearing the end of its tour of duty it was committed to Operation Goodwood once more, and was tasked with ambushing communist lines of communication and conducting reconnaissance-in-force operations if required. On 13 January Bennett moved to establish FSB Margaret [...] east of Tam Phuoc in Bien Hoa province, located in AO Kilcoy immediately west of AO Wondai. That morning at 07:30 C Company commenced the fly-in, securing the fire support base while Support Company and the 102nd Field Battery departed Nui Dat by road. B Company subsequently flew-in to FSB Chestnut to secure the area for the road convoy until it was called forward to FSB Margaret, and was followed by A and D Companies which were air-lifted by helicopter. The Australians then commenced an operation to search part of the Rung Sat, locating a number of small camps among the mangroves and swamps. At last light 6 Platoon B Company 1 RAR contacted three Viet Cong, and the next morning one body and an AK-47 were discovered. In AO Moose, the 2nd ARVN Brigade had concluded operations on 15 January and was relieved in place by A Brigade of the ARVN Marine Regiment, with the 1st Marine Battalion occupying FSB Kathleen and 5th Marine Battalion occupying FSB Barbara.|$|R
