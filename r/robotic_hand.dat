Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing {{in a room full of}} mirrors. Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E

While there, the Emperor implores Luke to join the dark side by {{appealing}} to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, which leads to Vader dueling with Luke once again. Realizing that Leia is Luke's twin sister, Vader threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Furious, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his father's <b>robotic</b> <b>hand.</b> The Emperor orders Luke to kill Vader and take his place. Luke refuses, however, and the Emperor tortures him with Force lightning. Moved by Luke's pleas for help, Vader throws the Emperor down the Death Star's reactor core to his death; he is mortally wounded by the Emperor's lightning in the process. After asking Luke to remove his mask, the redeemed Anakin Skywalker tells his son that there was good in him after all before he dies. Luke escapes the Death Star with his father's remains, and ceremonially burns them in a pyre. Anakin's spirit reunites with those of Obi-Wan and Yoda to watch over Luke and his friends as the Rebels celebrate the Death Star's destruction and the fall of the Empire.|$|E

Borrowing the terminology from software engineering, {{there is a need for}} middleware solutions to control the <b>robotic</b> <b>hands</b> independently from their specific kinematics, and focusing only on the manipulation tasks. To simplify and generalize the control of <b>robotic</b> <b>hands</b> we take inspiration from studies in neuroscience concerning the sensorimotor organization of the human hand. These studies demonstrated that, notwithstanding the complexity of the hand, a few variables are able to account for most of the variance in the patterns of configurations and movements. The reduced set of parameters that humans effectively use to control their hands, known in the literature as synergies, can represent the set of words for the unified control language of <b>robotic</b> <b>hands</b> provided that we solve the problem of mapping human hand synergies to actions of the <b>robotic</b> <b>hands.</b> In this work we propose a mapping designed in the manipulated object domain in order to ensure a high level of generality with respect to the many dissimilar kinematics of <b>robotic</b> <b>hands.</b> The role of the object is played by a virtual sphere, whose radius and center position change dynamically, and the role of the human hand is played by a hand model referred to as “paradigmatic hand,” able to capture the idea of synergies in human hands.

2500|$|Chell then {{travels through}} {{the bowels of}} the Enrichment Center, battling natural hazards and further turrets until she reaches GLaDOS's chamber, where the final {{encounter}} occurs. In this encounter Chell dislodges [...] "personality cores" [...] (each also voiced by McLain, {{with the exception of the}} final core, which is voiced in a guttural fashion by Mike Patton) and incinerates them. During the battle, it is revealed that before the events of Portal, GLaDOS released a neurotoxin into the Enrichment Center (revealed to occur on Take Your Daughter to Work Day in the sequel), which resulted in the surviving scientists installing a morality core to prevent further incidents. After the cores are incinerated, the room is sucked into a vortex leading to the surface and GLaDOS is destroyed. Originally the game ended with a fade to black leaving Chell on the surface. This ending was however replaced in a later patch to the game to a new one (to set up for Portal 2) in which an unconscious Chell is dragged away by the party escort robot (a character referenced earlier in the game). The final scene shows a room filled with more personality cores that begin to light up and a <b>robotic</b> <b>hand</b> puts out a candle on a cake.|$|E

The second element is the exploitation of a particular kinematic features of the human hand, i. e. the thumb opposition. The architecture is tested with two simulated <b>robotic</b> <b>hands</b> having different kinematic features and engaged in rotating spheres, cylinders, and cubes of different sizes.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} novel {{algorithms}} and interfaces, arising from inspection and {{comprehension of the}} human nature. In the first part I deal with new mechanical designs and concepts for building and controlling <b>robotic</b> <b>hands.</b> In particular I show how the sensorimotor synergies of the human hand can be useful not only for controlling but also for building <b>robotic</b> <b>hands,</b> suggesting novel design paradigms. Despite the synergy model is useful for designing and controlling <b>robotic</b> <b>hands,</b> it is incomplete to explain the hand behavior during grasp (both for humans and robots). To solve this problem, it is needed to consider compliant articulations introducing the "soft synergies" concept. Consequently, the compliance and the soft synergies lead to the concepts of muscle and mechanical impedance. Thus, {{in the second part}} of this thesis I present an observer for estimating the time varying mechanical impedance of a Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA), i. e. a novel kind of actuator whose performances and capabilities are very close to the human muscles. Another important feature, both for human and <b>robotic</b> <b>hands,</b> is the sense of touch. Indeed in the third and last part of this thesis, I deal with the haptics and haptic interfaces. I show two new haptic devices with their applications on humans.
