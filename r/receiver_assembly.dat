50|$|In general, {{adapting}} an AR-style {{rifle to}} the new cartridge only requires {{the replacement of the}} barrel, bolt, magazine & muzzle device (if applicable) of the 5.56 mm-chambered rifle; but to further streamline and simplify the conversion process many parts manufacturers sell complete upper <b>receiver</b> <b>assemblies</b> chambered for 6.8 SPC alongside their conversion kits focusing on the key individual parts. While a complete 6.8 SPC assembly is a somewhat more expensive route, the conversion of an existing 5.56 mm/.223 rifle to 6.8 SPC using a complete upper assembly takes less than a minute on an AR-style rifle without the need for specialized tools or skills. In contrast, when swapping out the individual component parts, a significant level of gunsmithing experience, special tools, and time are generally required to detach the barrel from the rifle's upper receiver and the gas system, and conversely those same needs are required for the reassembly of the upper receiver with the new 6.8 SPC barrel. Also, there is the issue of having to readjust the sights if a new barrel is placed on an existing upper receiver.|$|R

50|$|Lower Receiver: When the SPR {{program was}} still just an upper <b>receiver</b> <b>assembly</b> (and not a {{complete}} rifle), Crane assembled all of its prototypes using either M16A1 or M4A1 lower receivers, because the full auto trigger group in these lower receivers provided a consistent pull while the more common 3-round burst trigger groups didn't. It is unknown whether this pattern continued as the rifle evolved. There is also some issue about whether, when the Navy type-classified the weapon, Precision Reflex Incorporated (PRI) began assembling the rifles themselves. While a number of trigger options were tried in the end, the Knight's Armament Company (KAC) 2-stage trigger was finally decided upon as the standard.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{contactless}} {{energy transfer}} (CET) desktop application is presented. The CET desktop uses {{a matrix of}} hexagon spiral windings embedded underneath its surface, to transfer power to CET enabled consumer electronics devices placed on the table. To improve efficiency and limit stray magnetic fields, clusters of only three primary coils, located closest to the receiving devices, are excited. The coils are excited with out-of-phase currents to further reduce stray magnetic fields. Due {{to the design of}} the CET desktop the power transfer efficiency is not constant but varies throughout the surface of the table. Using the design and evaluation process presented in this paper, different secondary coil configurations can be designed and evaluated to find topologies best suited for different electronic devices.
