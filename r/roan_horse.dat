2500|$|Just {{as there}} is white {{patterning}} specifically associated with the leopard complex, there {{is a type of}} progressive roaning that is unrelated to graying out or true roan. Horses with coat patterns within the leopard complex are known for their mystifying coat changes. This unusual characteristic is due at least in part to leopard roaning, also called [...] "varnish roaning." [...] While the gray gene only affects the hair, some horses with the Lp gene will progressively lose pigment in both the skin and hair as they age. Also unlike graying out, the leopard spots are not affected by this roaning process. Neither are the [...] "bony prominences" [...] strongly affected. As a varnish <b>roan</b> <b>horse</b> lightens, the leopard spots indistinguishable {{from the rest of the}} coat become visible. Some horses without any dense white patterning at birth seem to spontaneously develop into white, leopard-spotted horses with maturity. Varnishing is more common among Appaloosa horses, and less common among Norikers and Knabstruppers, whose breed associations find it undesirable.|$|E

2500|$|Some <b>roan</b> <b>horses</b> {{have more}} white hair than others, and even {{individual}} horses may look lighter or darker {{based on the}} season and their coats may vary from year to year. While roan is always present at birth, the soft first coat of newborn foals may not show the white hairs well. Some <b>roan</b> <b>horses</b> get darker with age. Generally, roans appear to have more white hair when they have their short summer coats and darker when they have their winter coats. These peculiar tendencies of roans led to the Icelandic word for roan, which translates as [...] "always changing color." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Roan</b> <b>horses</b> often develop {{patches of}} solid (dark) {{hair on the}} roan {{sections}} of their bodies wherever there has been any scratch or damage to underlying skin, even if only slight. These are sometimes called [...] "corn marks" [...] or [...] "corn spots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you must}} throw down the whip,' {{answered}} the horse. And in the twinkling {{of an eye}} the whip was changed into a broad river. When the old man got up to it he urged the <b>roan</b> <b>horse</b> into the water, but as the water mounted higher and higher, the magic flame which gave the magician all his power grew smaller and smaller, till, with a fizz, it went out, {{and the old man}} and the <b>roan</b> <b>horse</b> sank in the river and disappeared. When the prince looked round they were no longer to be seen.|$|E

6000|$|It {{being so}} early in the year--but how mild and sweet a day--there were few {{occupants}} of the coach at Axminster. As I had once made a (frequently broken) vow to do at once what scared me, I asked to be perched up on the box beside the lean, brick-faced driver. Thus giddily exalted above his three cantering <b>roan</b> <b>horses,</b> we bowled merrily along. With his whip he pointed out to me every [...] "object of interest" [...] as it went floating by--church and inn, farm and mansion.|$|R
5000|$|Unrelated {{patterns}} may {{be confused}} with Bend-Or spots. Some <b>roan</b> <b>horses</b> have patches of darker hairs called [...] "corn marks" [...] or [...] "corn spots." [...] While these resemble Bend-Or spots, they are linked to solid-colored hair growing in over minor cuts or scratches to the skin, and thus the underlying genetic cause appears to be unrelated. Another pattern seen primarily in some gray horses is dappling, the presence of darker hairs in round shapes against a lighter hair coat. However, dapples are an intermediate stage of the graying process, and will only last a few years.|$|R
60|$|Another day, hot and breathless. A deserted farmhouse, large, {{with many}} {{outbuildings}} and an orchard, {{standing in a}} clearing. From the Woods, on a <b>roan</b> <b>horse,</b> carbine across pommel, rode the young man with the quick black eyes. He breathed with relief as he gained the house. That a fight had taken place here {{earlier in the season}} was evident. Clips and empty cartridges, tarnished with verdigris, lay on the ground, which, while wet, had been torn up by the hoofs of horses. Hard by the kitchen garden were graves, tagged and numbered. From the oak tree by the kitchen door, in tattered, weatherbeaten garments, hung the bodies of two men. The faces, shriveled and defaced, bore no likeness to the faces of men. The <b>roan</b> <b>horse</b> snorted beneath them, and the rider caressed and soothed it and tied it farther away.|$|E
60|$|The great <b>roan</b> <b>horse,</b> which I rejoiced to see once more, was {{somewhat}} thin, {{for he had}} lacked water like the rest, but throughout the siege he had been well tended by Sihamba and Zinti, and fed with green corn, and since that morning he had drunk all he would, so that now he was strong again and fit to run.|$|E

5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and <b>roaning.</b> <b>Horses</b> with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation.

Sometimes this designation includes the bay family: bay, seal brown, buckskin, bay dun, silver bay, perlino, amber champagne, and bay <b>roan.</b> <b>Horses</b> with a black-based coat may also have added spotting patterns including leopard patterns seen on Appaloosas and the pinto coloring known as piebald.|$|R

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the magician {{returned to his}} palace, which he found in smouldering ruins. In vain he called for his servant.

5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and <b>roan</b> <b>horses.</b> Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair. The cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, {{while the rest of the}} cells are unaffected.|$|R
