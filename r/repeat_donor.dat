40|$|Recruiting safe, {{volunteer}} blood donors requires understanding {{motivations for}} donating and {{knowledge and attitudes}} about HIV. We surveyed 1, 600 persons presenting for blood donation at a large blood bank in Sao Paulo, Brazil using a self-administered, structured questionnaire, and classified motivations into three domains as well as categorizing persons by HIV test-seeking behavior. Motivations, in descending order, and their significant associations were: ""altruism``: female gender, volunteer donor and <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> status; ""direct appeal``: female gender, <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> status and age 21 - 50 years; ""selfinterest``: male gender, age under 20 years, first-time donor status and lower education. HIV test-seekers {{were more likely to}} give incorrect answers regarding HIV risk behavior and blood donation and the ability of antibody testing to detect recent HIV infections. Altruism is the main motivator for blood donation in Brazil; other motivators were associated with specific demographic subgroups. HIV test-seeking might be reduced by educational interventions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In Brazil nationally {{representative}} donor data are limited on {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) prevalence, incidence, and residual transfusion risk. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze HIV data obtained over 24 months by the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II program in Brazil. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donations reactive to third-and fourth-generation immunoassays (IAs) were further confirmed by a less-sensitive (LS) IA algorithm and Western blot (WB). Incidence was calculated for first-time (FT) donors using the LS-EIA results and for repeat donors with a model developed to include all donors with a previous negative donation. Residual risk was projected by multiplying composite FT and <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> incidence rates by HIV marker-negative infectious window periods. RESULTS: HIV prevalence among FT donors was 92. 2 / 105 donations. FT and <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> and composite incidences were 38. 5 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 25. 651. 4), 22. 5 (95 % CI, 17. 6 - 28. 0), and 27. 5 (95 % CI, 22. 0 - 33. 0) per 100, 000 person-years, respectively. Male and community donors had higher prevalence and incidence rates than female and replacement donors. The estimated residual risk of HIV transfusion transmission was 11. 3 per 106 donations (95 % CI, 8. 4 - 14. 2), which could be reduced to 4. 2 per 106 donations (95 % CI, 3. 2 - 5. 2) by use of individual-donation nucleic acid testing (NAT). CONCLUSION: The incidence and residual transfusion risk of HIV infection are relatively high in Brazil. Implementation of NAT will not be sufficient to decrease transmission rates to levels seen in the United States or Europe; therefore, other measures focused on decreasing donations by at-risk individuals are also necessary.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In France, blood {{donations}} {{found to}} be positive {{for the presence of}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) are further tested to detect recent infections (≤ 180  days) using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA-RI) developed in 2002. The characteristics of recently infected donors, estimates of HIV- 1 incidence, and the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV- 1 are presented, in both first-time and repeat donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the 1027 donations {{found to be}} HIV- 1 –positive between 1992 and 2006, a total of 459 could be retrospectively tested with the EIA-RI. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the donor characteristics associated with recent infection. Incidence rates and residual risk obtained with the EIA-RI were compared to classical cohort estimates derived from <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> histories. RESULTS: Of the 459 HIV- 1 –positive donors studied, 105 (22. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 19. 2 - 27. 0) were identified as recently infected. Factors independently associated with recent infection were <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4. 0; 95 % CI, 2. 4 - 6. 9) and non-B subtypes (AOR, 2. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 3. 6). Incidence decreased from 4. 3 (95 % CI, 1. 9 - 9. 4) in 1992 through 1994 to 1. 3 (95 % CI, 0. 6 - 2. 8) per 105 in 2004 through 2006 in first-time donors and from 3. 2 (95 % CI, 2. 0 - 5. 0) to 0. 8 (95 % CI, 0. 4 - 1. 4) per 105 in repeat donors. Incidence and residual risk estimates were similar to those obtained with the classical cohort method. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the EIA-RI can be used to estimate HIV- 1 incidence in a population with low HIV incidence. The estimated HIV- 1 incidence in the blood donor population confirms the extremely low risk (1 in 3, 350, 000 donations) of HIV-infected blood donations entering the blood supply in France...|$|E

Donors who made at least one whole blood donation in 2007 were followed for 2 years using a large multicenter research database. Donation frequency, interdonation intervals, and their association with donor demographics, status, and type of donation were examined among three large blood centers in Brazil, two in the southeast {{and one in the}} northeast. In 2007, of 306, 770 allogeneic donations, 38. 9 % came from 95, 127 first-time donors and 61. 1 % from 149, 664 <b>repeat</b> <b>donors.</b> Through December 31, 2009, a total of 28. 1 % of first-time donors and 56. 5 % of <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> had donated again. Overall, the median interdonation interval was approximately 6 months. Among men it was 182 and 171 days for first-time and <b>repeat</b> <b>donors,</b> and among women, 212 and 200 days. Predictors of return behavior among first-time donors were male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1. 17; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 13 - 1. 20), community donation (OR, 2. 26; 95 % CI, 2. 20 - 2. 33), and age 24 years or less (OR, 0. 62 - 0. 89 for donors ≥ 25 years).

40|$|Background: Blood {{mobilization}} {{and collection}} agencies worldwide are challenged with blood donor recruitment and retention. When {{the demand for}} blood exceeds collection, there is inadequacy of supply and safety of the blood is also compromised. This challenge varies in severity between developed and developing countries. The median blood donation rates per 1000 population are 36. 4 in high-income countries, 11. 6 in middle-income countries and 2. 8 in low-income countries. The World Health organization (WHO) African Regional Strategy, adopted in 2001, focuses on recruitment of low risk regular voluntary donors. But, even though blood from Voluntary Non-Remunerated Blood Donors (VNRBD) is safer than Family Replacement Donors (FRD), {{there is evidence that}} blood from first time VNRBD is not safer than FRD, and that only repeat donations provide improved blood safety. Therefore in developing models to increase repeat blood donations from existing donors, {{it is important to understand}} what will encourage the first time donor, whether VNRBD or FRD, to donate again, and the <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> to continue donating...|$|E
40|$|Background & AimsClinical {{cases of}} viral infections {{possibly}} involving the {{transfusion of blood}} components are systematically investigated. MethodsSerological and molecular markers of hepatitis B virus were used including HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, HBV DNA, and viral load. Full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. ResultsAn acute HBV infection was diagnosed in {{the mother of a}} 16 -month-old daughter who had been transfused at age three weeks with one quarter of a regular red cell concentrate (RCC). The <b>repeat</b> <b>donor</b> of the index donation was free of HBV markers in two previous donations but seroconverted to anti-HBc and anti-HBs 3 months post-donation of a unit containing only low level of HBV DNA. One other newborn recipient of the same RCC was asymptomatically HBV infected. A third newborn recipient whose mother had been HBV vaccinated and carried moderate level of anti-HBs was not infected. Full length nucleotide sequence identity between HBV strains from the mother and the two infected transfusion recipients provided evidence of the transfusion origin of all three infections in the absence of donor sequence. ConclusionsReverse vertical HBV transmission was likely the result of casual mother contact with a baby carrying extremely high viral load. The blood products intended to immunodeficient newborn should be submitted to more thorough viral testing considering their increased susceptibility to infections...|$|E

Objectives: To evaluate the {{incidence of}} vaso-vagal reaction (VVR) among whole blood donors. Methods: This prospective, observational study {{was done in the}} department of transfusion medicine in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University from 01 - 04 - 2008 to 31 - 03 - 2009. Total 19553 blood donors were observed for vaso-vagal reaction. Results: The incidence of vaso-vagal reaction was 0. 37 %, in male 0. 33 % and in female it was 0. 67 %. Female donors were significantly more prone to develop vasovagal reaction (p= 0. 001). 78. 8 % of donors were first time donor and 28. 8 % were <b>repeat</b> <b>donor.</b> The clinical character of the symptoms according to frequency was- Sweating (86. 3 %), Nausea/ Vomiting (80. 8 %), Pallor (67. 1 %), Dizziness (39. 7 %), Loss of consciousness and fainting, increased rate of respiration (30. 1 %), anxiety presented (16. 4 %) and vertigo (1. 4 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of blood donor selection, this study reports risk profiles of donors with transfusion-transmissible infections as obtained by ongoing surveillance, 1995 through 2003, in the Netherlands.

At posttest counseling, a physician interviewed donors to clarify possible sources of infection. RESULTS: A total of 167 <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> and 404 new donors were interviewed: 33 with HIV, 123 with HCV, 279 with HBV, 21 with HTLV, and 112 with syphilis antibodies. Most HBV, HCV, and HTLV infections were among new donors (80, 85, and 67 %), whereas most HIV infections were among <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> (79 %). Nearly 25 percent of the donors did not report factors at screening that would have deferred them from donating blood. At posttest interviews, new donors with HCV often reported injecting drug use (19 %). <b>Repeat</b> <b>donors</b> with HIV often reported male-to-male sex (8 / 26, 31 %). CONCLUSION: A significant level of deferrable behavioral risks was found among donors with confirmed transfusion-transmissible infections that persist despite current donor selection. Reporting such behavior at initial donor selection would have eliminated a substantial part of the infections found. This study argues against relaxing the existing donor deferral of persons practicing male-to-male sex, given their significant proportion of HIV infections among <b>repeat</b> <b>donors.</b> Systematic surveillance of risk factors among infected blood donors provides ongoing information about the effectivity of donor selection and is recommended to evaluate and optimize blood policie...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the incidence (including associated donor characteristics and time trends) of HIV infection among <b>repeat</b> blood <b>donors</b> and {{to estimate the}} risk of HIV transmission from blood transfusion in Montreal and in Canada as a whole. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Montreal Centre Blood Transfusion Service. PARTICIPANTS: People who donated blood at least twice after Nov. 1, 1985, and at least once from Apr. 1, 1989, to Mar. 31, 1993. INTERVENTION: Blood was screened for HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and results were confirmed by Western blot analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence density (the incidence rate per person-time) of HIV infection among <b>repeat</b> blood <b>donors</b> by sex, age group and region of residence, and incidence density and risk among first-time donors and for Canada as whole. RESULTS: There were 200, 196 eligible donors and 432, 631 person-years (PY) of observation. From 1989 to 1993, there were 18 HIV seroconversions among <b>repeat</b> <b>donors.</b> The crude incidence density was 3. 3 per 100, 000 PY (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 8 to 5. 4 per 100, 000 PY); it was 4. 9 per 100, 000 PY among men and 0. 61 per 100, 000 PY among women. Age-specific incidence per 100, 000 PY was 2. 5 among those 12 - 29 years of age, 5. 1 among those 30 - 49, 2. 9 among those 40 - 49, and 1. 4 among those 50 and older. Based on an estimated mean "window period" (from when a donor's blood is capable of transmitting HIV until detectable antibody appears) of 25 days, the current risk of HIV infection from <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> in the window period is estimated at 1 in 440, 000. Inclusion of blood units from first-time donors produces an overall risk of 1 in 390, 000 (95 % CI 1 in 250, 000 to 655, 000). The estimated risk per blood unit in Canada {{as a whole is}} 1 in 913000 (95 % CI 1 in 507, 000 to 2, 050, 000).

40|$|Background: Voluntary blood {{donation}} is not satisfactory all over India. In India, about 55 % of donation is through voluntary non-remunerated blood donors (VNRBD). However, {{about one third}} already motivated blood donors are deferred due to stringent screening criteria, either temporarily or permanently. The temporarily deferred donors {{could be a good}} source of {{blood donation}} after deferral period. Aims: The present study is carried out to know retrieval of blood donors those who are deferred temporarily. Design: The present study is carried out in the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre of Western India. All donors screened as per the guideline and deferred donors are categorized as temporary and permanently deferred donors. Materials and Methods: From temporarily deferred donors, reason for deferral is considered. As per reason of deferral, time duration for recalling the donor is defined. Based on this, donor is called back to donate again. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test is applied. Result: A total of 33 % donors were deferred either temporarily or permanently. In the <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> (5. 32 %) deferral rate was significantly higher than first time (1. 32 %) donors. Significant female preponderance was observed (15. 05 % vs 2. 51 %).

RESULTS [...] Overall HIV prevalence was 11. 0 % in first time donors and 2. 1 % in <b>repeat</b> <b>donors.</b> In the first seven months of 1991, 29 HIV antibody positive (27 HIV 1, 1 HIV 2, 1 dually reactive) donors with a seronegative unit of blood earlier in the year were identified; 26 had donated blood eight weeks or less before their estimated dates of seroconversion and may have been infectious (minimum rate 26 / 5831 (4. 5 / 1000 potentially infected units)). Estimated incidence of infection in <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> was 1. 2 - 2. 5 %. Laboratory test insensitivity would result in an estimated 1. 1 / 1000 false negative units from first time donors and 0. 2 / 1000 units from regular donors. The overall rate of potentially infected units (all donors, seroconversions, and errors) was estimated at 5. 4 - 10. 6 / 1000. CONCLUSIONS [...] The risk of HIV infection from a single unit of blood remains substantial (5. 4 - 10. 6 / 1000 units). To prevent infection from blood transfusion in areas of high incidence and prevalence of HIV all but absolutely essential transfusions should be avoided, and donors with low incidence of HIV infection should be selected...|$|R
40|$|Background: Detection of {{specific}} antibodies to Treponema pallidum in serum is correlated with present or past Syphilis. The study aimed {{to know the}} seroprevalence of syphilis among blood donors in relation to age, sex, type of donation and times of donation. Methods: A total of 24, 000 blood donors were screened to detect the presence {{of specific}} antibodies against T. pallidum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to standard test kit protocol. Initially reactive samples were reconfirmed by repeat testing and repeatedly reactive samples were considered seropositive for Syphilis. Results: The seroprevalence of specific antibodies to T. pallidum among blood donors was found 0. 42 % (95 % CI= 0. 3 - 0. 5 %). There was an increasing trends of syphilis as {{the age of the}} donors increased (Cochrane-armitage test, P 0. 05), in first time donors was 0. 36 % and in <b>repeated</b> <b>donors</b> was 0. 48 % (P> 0. 05), among volunteer donors was 0. 41 % and among replacement donors was 0. 50 % (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Replacement {{donors are}} more likely than {{volunteer}} donors to have positive or abnormal tests for transfusion-transmissible disease. In an effort to increase the donor pool, workers sought to identify a safer replacement-donor subgroup that may be acceptable for routine donations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a retrospective review and cohort study, the replacement-donor effect was separated from the new-donor effect. The relative effect the replacement donor has on the risk of transfusion-transmissible diseases, donor retention, and frequency of returning donations was then quantified by comparison against the effect of <b>repeat</b> volunteer <b>donors.</b> RESULTS: The replacement donor had 3. 1 times the risk and 0. 72 times the donor retention rate and made 0. 81 times as many returning donations as the <b>repeat</b> volunteer <b>donor.</b> The figures for the new-donor effect were similar. The two risks were additive, making a new replacement donor particularly hazardous. If replacement donations only from <b>repeat</b> replacement <b>donors</b> were considered, the donor risk and the number of donations per returning donor were made comparable to those for the general (combined) volunteer donor. CONCLUSION: The negative effect of the replacement donor is similar in magnitude to that of the new volunteer donor. A replacement-donation program targeting <b>repeat</b> replacement <b>donors</b> has an acceptable risk profile and may be a valuable adjunct to the collection of blood from general volunteer donors...|$|R
40|$|Background : Voluntary non-remunerated <b>repeat</b> blood <b>donors</b> are {{perceived}} to be safer than the first time blood donors. This study was planned for follow-up of previous hepatitis C virus (HCV) test results of anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reactive <b>repeat</b> blood <b>donors.</b> The aim was to suggest a protocol for re-entry of the blood donors who are confirmed HCV negative by nucleic acid test (NAT) and recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). A group of <b>repeat</b> voluntary <b>donors</b> were followed retrospectively who became reactive on a cross sectional study and showed HCV reactivity while donating blood regularly. Material and Methods: A total of 51, 023 voluntary non remunerated blood donors were screened for anti-HCV ELISA routinely. If anybody showed positivity, they were tested by two ELISA kits (screening and confirmatory) and then confirmed infection status by NAT and or RIBA. The previous HCV test results of <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> reactive by anti-HCV ELISA were looked back from the records. Data of <b>donors</b> who were <b>repeat</b> reactive with single ELISA kit (in the present study) were analyzed separately from those reactive with two ELISA kits (in the present study). Results: In this study, 140 (0. 27 &#x 0025;) donors who were reactive by anti HCV ELISA were included. Out of them, 35 were <b>repeat</b> voluntary <b>donors</b> and 16 (11. 43 &#x 0025;) were reactive with single ELISA kit. All 16 donors were reactive by single ELISA kit occasionally in previous donations. Their present ELISA positive donations were negative for HCV NAT and RIBA. A total of 19 (13. 57 &#x 0025;) donors were reactive with two ELISA kits. In their previous donations, the donors who were reactive even once with two ELISA kits were consistently reactive by the same two ELISA kits in their next donations also. Conclusion: Donor sample reactive by only single ELISA kit may not be considered as infectious for disposal as they were negative by NAT and or RIBA. One time ELISA positivity was found probably due to ELISA kit specificity and sensitivity. Donors reactive with two ELISA kit should be discarded as there is a high positivity with NAT/ RIBA. However, donors reactive by two ELISA kits and negative by NAT and RIBA should be followed up and may not be deferred permanently...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} 6 -month deferral due to low hemoglobin (Hb) on the subsequent donation patterns of Australian whole blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort study of the donation patterns of all whole blood donors deferred for low Hb during a 2 -month period compared with donors who were not deferred. Donations 3 years after eligibility to give blood were recorded. Analysis of proportion returning, time to return, and frequency of donation was performed using logistic regression, survival analysis, and negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Among first-time donors, 20. 9 % of low Hb–deferred donors returned during the follow-up period versus 69. 9 % of those not deferred. Among <b>repeat</b> <b>donors,</b> 64. 0 % of deferred donors returned versus 91. 0 % of those not deferred. Temporary deferral delayed time to first return (p < 0. 001), reduced frequency of donation (2. 4 donations per donor before deferral compared to 1. 1 per donor in first year of follow-up), and increased the likelihood of dropping out in later years of follow-up. However, if a donor returned promptly once eligible and gave more donations in the first year, the negative impact on future donation patterns was diminished. High frequency of attendance before deferral was the strongest predictor of time to return and future donation frequency. CONCLUSION: Deferral for low Hb had a strong effect on first-time and <b>repeat</b> <b>donors.</b> This study highlights the influence of strong donation habits on return after deferral and the importance of encouraging donors to return promptly once eligible.

40|$|Background—It is {{important}} to understand donor return behavior. Converting first time <b>donors</b> to become <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> is essential for maintaining an adequate blood supply. Methods—Characteristics of 241, 552 whole blood (WB) donations from first time (FT) and <b>repeat</b> (RPT) <b>donors</b> who donated in 2008 at the 5 blood centers in China were compared. A subset of 54, 394 WB donors who donated between January 1 and March 31, 2008 were analyzed for their return behavior in 2008 following the index donation using logistic regression. Results—Of all donations, 64 % was from FT donors. Donors with self-reported previous donations tended to be male, older, married, donated larger volume (≥ 300 mL), and were heavier in weight. Among donors who donated from January to March, 2008, 14 % returned for subsequent WB donations by the end of 2008. The number of previous donations and blood collection location were the two strongest predictors for making subsequent donations. Donors with 1, 2 – 3 and more than 3 previous donations were 3. 7, 5. 7, and 11. 0 times more likely to return than FT donors. Those who donated in a blood collection vehicle were 4 times more likely to return than those who donated at a blood center. Being female, younger and of a lower education level (...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} profile of blood donors in respect to {{the period of the}} first {{donation}} and their return pattern to the public blood bank of Recife. Method: A retrospective study was performed of the data of 363 donors input to the Blood Bank System Database in the period from January 1, 1998 to June 13, 2008. In the analysis, the median number of donations by gender, age and schooling years were evaluated, as well as the association of {{the time of the first}} donation with the gender, age and Rh factor. Additionally, the return pattern of 261 of these donors (excluding 100 first time donors and two for lack of precision as to the date of return) was evaluated. Results: Approximately 77. 1 % were men, of whom 40. 5 % were from 25 to 34 years old, 47. 7 % had completed high school and 54 % donated spontaneously. The median number of donations was higher among older men (p = 0. 000). The participation of women increased in this period (30. 6 %) compared to 1998 - 2000 (4. 8 %), even so most first-time donors were men (p = 0. 003). Of those who donated five or more times, 43. 8 % returned for the next donation at an interval of less than six months. More men than women were <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> (p = 0. 011). Conclusions: the great majority of <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> (with a time interval between the last two donations of 13 months or less) is still not close to the maximum possible number of annual donations. It is essential to focus on this group who are potentially more receptive to increasing the effectiveness of recruitment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: National Blood Service Zimbabwe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) risk management strategy includes screening and discarding of first-time donations, which are collected in blood packs without an anticoagulant (dry pack). To evaluate the impact of discarding first-time donations on blood safety the HIV prevalence, incidence, and residual risk in first-time and repeat donations (wet packs) were compared. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donor data from 2002 to 2010 were retrieved from a centralized national electronic donor database and retrospectively analyzed. Chi-square {{test was used to}} compare HIV prevalence with relative risk (RR), and the RR point estimates and 95 % confidence interval (CI) are reported. Trend analysis was done using Cochran-Armitage trend test. HIV residual risk estimates were determined using published residual risk estimation models. RESULTS: Over the 9 years the overall HIV prevalence estimates are 1. 29 % (n = 116, 058) and 0. 42 % (n = 434, 695) for first-time and repeat donations, respectively. The overall RR was 3. 1 (95 % CI, 2. 9 - 3. 3; p < 0. 0001). The overall mean residual transmission risk of HIV window phase donations in first-time was 1 : 7384 (range, 1 : 11, 308 - 1 : 5356) and in <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> it was 1 : 5496 (range, 1 : 9943 - 1 : 3347). CONCLUSION: The significantly high HIV prevalence estimates recorded in first-time over repeat donations is indicative of the effectiveness of the HIV risk management strategy. However, comparable residual transmission risk estimates in first-time and <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> point to the need to further review the risk management strategies. Given the potential wastage of valuable resources, future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness and utility of screening and discarding first-time donations...|$|R
40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in Brazilian blood transfusion therapy {{with a growing}} number of scientific publications, an increased number of <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> and a decline in serological ineligibility, a lack of conformity in the application of pre-transfusion tests that may compromise transfusion safety is still observed at transfusion agencies in the fringes of the blood transfusion therapy system. Additionally, although high rates of platelet transfusion refractoriness and significant rates of alloimmunization have been demonstrated in the international literature, few Brazilian centers have been concerned with the study of platelet alloimmunization and even fewer centers have evaluated the efficacy of platelet concentrate transfusion. As more than one million Brazilians, including many <b>repeat</b> blood <b>donors,</b> are listed in the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (Redome), why not grant transfusion therapy services access to the HLA typing of these blood and marrow donors after obtaining their consent? And why not make use of the Redome data to evaluate the HLA compatibility of donors for alloimmunized patients who are candidates for bone marrow transfusion and who have already been typed? These measures, together with the identification of ABO and HPA antigens, will permit a complete assessment of platelet immunology, will guarantee the transfusion safety of this blood component, and will put Brazil at the same level as the so-called developed countries in terms of transfusion medicine...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{effectiveness of}} various donation incentive programs may vary by demographics and first time or repeat status. Attitudes towards future incentives {{were obtained from}} 2, 897 whole blood donors among 5, 357 allogenic donors who return a questionnaire (54. 08 % response rate). Majority were first time donors 67. 59 % (1, 958) with 32. 41 % (939) <b>repeated</b> <b>donor.</b> Majority {{of the respondents were}} male 68. 52 % (1, 985), female 31. 48 % (912). Responses to incentives were compared between first time and <b>repeat</b> whole blood <b>donors.</b> Incentives most likely to encourage donation return among all 2, 897 whole blood respondents were blood screening test (B.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{screening}} blood donations {{with advanced}} technologies and improved donor screening, {{the risk of}} transfusion-transmitted infections persists. This risk is mainly due to blood donations collected during the window period. A precise estimate of the transfusion risk of viral infection will help {{to determine the effect}} of new and current safety measures and to prioritize and allocate limited resources. Therefore, we estimated the risk of transfusion-transmitted viral infection in blood donations collected in Korea from 2000 to 2010. Methods Blood donations collected at 16 blood centers were tested for HIV, HCV, and HBV to estimate the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted viral infection. The residual risk was calculated in two-year periods using the incidence/window model. The incidence rates for HIV/HCV and the confirmed positive rate for HIV/HCV in first-time and <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> were compared. Results The residual risks for HIV in 2004 / 2005 and 2009 / 2010 were 1 in 1, 080, 244 and 1 in 1, 356, 547, respectively. The risks for HCV in 2000 / 2001 and 2009 / 2010 were 1 in 81, 431 and 1 in 2, 984, 415, and the risks for HBV in 2000 / 2001 and 2009 / 2010 were 1 in 45, 891 and 1 in 43, 666. These estimates indicate that the residual risks for HCV in Korea have declined 36. 6 -fold, and those for HIV and HBV have not improved significantly, compared to previous estimates. The odds ratios for HCV and HBV positivity in first-time <b>donors</b> compared to <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> were 11. 8 and 19. 6, respectively. Conclusions The residual risk of HCV declined over the last decade due to improved screening reagents, implementation of the nucleic acid amplification test, and tight application of strict donor selection procedures. Current residual risk estimates for HIV and HCV in Korea are extremely low, but the risk for HBV is still high; therefore, urgent measures should focus on decreasing the residual risk of HBV. Despite the introduction of more sensitive assays in blood screening, several other factors may influence the actual residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. A continuous monitoring of residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infection is crucial in managing blood safety. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to outline the {{serological}} profile of hepatitis C among blood donors seen at the Uberaba Regional Blood Center, Hemominas Foundation, over the last 14 years. The frequency of hepatitis C was compared between first-time and <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> and the epidemiological characteristics of those with positive and indeterminate ELISA anti-HCV (third and fourth generation) were analyzed based on the donor histories kept in the archives of the Uberaba Regional Blood Center. The serological ineligibility rate was 0. 3 %, with higher prevalence in the group of first-time donors. We did not find any significant differences regarding age, skin color, marital status or place of residence between eligible and ineligible donors; however, the frequency of positive serology was higher among men. The lower (0. 3 %) rate of ineligibility due to hepatitis C that was observed at the Uberaba Regional Blood Center, in relation to most Brazilian blood centers, is probably due to the large number of <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> (83. 3 %). This reinforces the importance of achieving donor commitment for increasing transfusion safety. O objetivo deste estudo foi traçar o perfil sorológico para a hepatite C nos doadores de sangue do Hemocentro Regional de Uberaba/Fundação Hemominas nos últimos 14 anos, comparando a sua ocorrência em doadores iniciais e de retorno e analisando as características epidemiológicas daqueles com ELISA anti-HCV (terceira e quarta geração) positivo e indeterminado, a partir dos históricos dos doadores nos arquivos do Hemocentro Regional de Uberaba. A inaptidão sorológica encontrada foi de 0, 3 %, com maior ocorrência no grupo de doadores iniciais. Não encontramos diferenças significativas quanto à idade, cor da pele, estado civil e local de residência entre os aptos e os inaptos, porém a ocorrência de sorologia positiva foi maior nos homens. A menor prevalência de inaptidão para hepatite C (0, 3 %) no Hemocentro Regional de Uberaba, em relação à maioria dos hemocentros do país, é provavelmente devido ao grande (83, 3 %) número de doadores de repetição, reforçando assim a importância da fidelização do doador para o aumento da segurança transfusional...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Individuals may donate {{blood in}} order to {{determine}} their infection status after exposure to an increased infection risk. Such test-seeking behaviour decreases transfusion safety. Instances of test seeking are difficult to substantiate as donors are unlikely to admit to such behaviour. However, manifestation in a population of <b>repeat</b> <b>donors</b> may be determined using statistical inference. Materials and Methods: Test-seeking donors would be highly motivated to donate following infection risk, influencing the timing of their donation. Donation intervals within 2005 – 2014 of all Dutch blood donors who acquired syphilis (N = 50), HIV (N = 13), HTLV (N = 4) or HCV (N = 2) were compared to donation intervals of uninfected blood donors (N = 7 327 836) using the Anderson–Darling test. We adjusted for length bias as well as for age, gender and donation type of the infected. Additionally, the power of the proposed method was investigated by simulation. Results: Among the Dutch donors who acquired infection, we found only a non-significant overrepresentation of short donation intervals (P = 0 · 54). However, we show by simulation that both relatively short and long donation intervals among infected donors can reveal test seeking. The power of the method is > 90 % if among 69 infected donors > 35 (51 %) are test seeking, or if among 320 infected donors > 90 (30 %) are test seeking. Conclusion: We show how statistical analysis may be used to reveal the extent of test seeking in <b>repeat</b> blood <b>donor</b> populations. In the Dutch setting, indications for test-seeking behaviour were not statistically significant. This may, however, be due to the low number of infected individuals...|$|R

Additionally, text messaging reminders have been shown to be as effective as phone reminders in increasing patient attendance at outpatient appointments. Finally, text messaging has been shown to be useful for managing self-care such as smoking cessation, monitoring asthmatic symptoms, and diabetes control. We investigated whether offering the use a text message reminder to donors would increase attendance at donation events, demonstrating that text messaging can be an effective tool in maintaining a pool of blood donors.
