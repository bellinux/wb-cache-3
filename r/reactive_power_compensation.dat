Though DSTATCOMS are ideal solutions for such systems, {{they are not}} popular {{because of the cost}} and complexity of control involved. Phase wise balanced <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> <b>compensations</b> are required for fast changing loads needing dynamic power factor correcting devices leading to terminal voltage stabilization. Static Var Compensators (SVCs) remain ideal choice for such loads in practice due to low cost and simple control strategy. These SVCs, while correcting power factor, inject harmonics into the lines causing serious concerns about quality of the distribution line supplies at PCC. This paper proposes to minimize the harmonics injected into the {{distribution system}}s by the operation of TSC-TCR type SVC used in conjunction with fast changing loads at LV distribution level.

The procedure used to develop the models is similar to the procedure used to develop linear power flow models of transmission lines, which have been widely used in optimization problems of operation planning and system expansion. The steady state non-linear load flow equations are approximated by linear equations relating the voltage amplitude and currents. The approximations of the linear equations are based on the high relationship between line resistance and line reactance (ratio R/X), which is valid for power distribution networks. The performance and accuracy of the models are evaluated through comparisons with the exact results obtained from the solution of the load flow using two test networks: a hypothetical network with 23 nodes and a real network with 217 nodes.
