5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, <b>river</b> <b>forecast</b> products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

There are many forecasting techniques used for <b>river</b> flow <b>forecasting.</b> This study proposed a hybrid model based {{on a combination of}} two methods: Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model, referred to as the SOM-LSSVM model for <b>river</b> flow <b>forecasting.</b> The hybrid model uses the SOM algorithm to cluster the entire dataset into several disjointed clusters, where the monthly river flows data with similar input pattern are grouped together from a high dimensional input space onto a low dimensional output layer. By doing this, the data with similar input patterns will be mapped to neighbouring neurons in the SOM's output layer. After the dataset has been decomposed into several disjointed clusters, an individual LSSVM is applied to <b>forecast</b> the <b>river</b> flow. The feasibility of this proposed model is evaluated with respect to the actual river flow data from the Bernam River located in Selangor, Malaysia. The performance of the SOM-LSSVM was compared with other single models such as ARIMA, ANN and LSSVM. The performance of these models was then evaluated using various performance indicators. The experimental results show that the SOM-LSSVM model outperforms the other models and performs better than ANN, LSSVM as well as ARIMA for <b>river</b> flow <b>forecasting.</b> It also indicates that the proposed model can forecast more precisely, and provides a promising alternative technique for <b>river</b> flow <b>forecasting...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} (<b>river)</b> <b>forecasting,</b> but {{also includes a}} study on stormwater treatment. Using forecasts for decision-making is complicated by their inherent uncertainty. An interview-based study qualitatively and a survey empirically investigate forecast use in emergency management. Emergency managers perceive uncertainty as a given {{rather than as a}} problem. To cope with the uncertainty, decision-makers gather as much information as possible; forecasts are only one piece of information among many. For decision-making, emergency managers say that they rely more on radar than on <b>river</b> <b>forecasting.</b> However, forecasts {{play an important role in}} communication with the public, because they are the official interpretation of the situation. Emergency managers can add a lot of value to those forecasts by combining them with local knowledge, but might not do so because of accountability concerns. Forecasts must have value to emergency managers, because those with more work experience rely more on them than those without. Another study further develops the application of quantile regression to generate probabilistic <b>river</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Compared to existing research, this study includes a larger number of river gages; includes more independent variables; and studies longer lead times. Additionally, it is the first to apply this method to the U. S. American context. It was found that the model has to be customized for each river gage for extremely high event thresholds. For other thresholds and across lead times, a one-size-fits-all model suffices. The model performance is robust to the size of the training dataset, but depends on the year, the river gage, lead time and event threshold that are being forecast. An additional study considers the robustness of stormwater management to the amount of runoff. Impervious surfaces, such as roads and parking lots, can increase the amount of runoff and lead to more pollution reaching streams, rivers, and lakes. Best Management Practices (BMPs) reduce the peak discharge into the storm sewer system and remove pollutants such as sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen from the stormwater runoff. Empirically, it is found that BMP effectiveness decreases sooner, steeper and deeper with increasing sizes of storm events than assumed in current computer models...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Multi-Layer Feed-Forward Neural Network (MLFFNN) {{is applied}} {{in the context of}} <b>river</b> flow <b>forecast</b> combination, where a number of rainfall-runoff models are used {{simultaneously}} to produce an overall combined <b>river</b> flow <b>forecast.</b> The operation of the MLFFNN depends not only on its neuron configuration but also on the choice of neuron transfer function adopted, which is non-linear for the hidden and output layers. These models, each having a different structure to simulate the perceived mechanisms of the runoff process, utilise the information carrying capacity of the model calibration data in different ways. Hence, in a discharge forecast combination procedure, the discharge forecasts of each model provide a source of information {{different from that of the}} other models used in the combination.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{develops}} and applies hybrid models combining wavelet packet decomposition and data-driven {{models for}} <b>forecasting</b> <b>river</b> stage and investigating their accuracy. The hybrid models are wavelet packet-based {{artificial neural network}} (WPANN) and wavelet packet-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (WPANFIS). Wavelet packet decomposition splits an input time series into approximation and detail components, and the decomposed time series are used as inputs to artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for WPANN and WPANFIS models, respectively. The forecasting performances of WPANN and WPANFIS models are {{compared with those of}} ANN and ANFIS models. Based on performance evaluation indexes and graphical comparison, the WPANN and WPANFIS models produce better performance than ANN and ANFIS models in terms of model efficiency, and WPANFIS-coif 18 model is also found to yield the best performance among all other models. Therefore, wavelet packet decomposition improves the accuracy of ANN and ANFIS models for <b>forecasting</b> <b>river</b> stage.

40|$|Little {{verification}} of hydrologic forecasts {{has been conducted}} to date, and therefore {{little is known about}} the skill of hydrologic forecasts. This dissertation presents a verification study of <b>river</b> stage <b>forecasts</b> with lead-times up to three days for sixteen locations in the United States for a period spanning the past decade. The verification metrics from this limited sample indicate that the below flood stage forecasts are skillful, and so are the day 1 above flood stage forecasts. However, by day 3, the longer lead-time, above flood stage forecasts appear to have little skill (when compared with simple persistence). Further, they have not improved during the period of record despite a number of forecast process improvements. A path to improving the forecasts is suggested, via a new approach to selecting enhancements to the hydrologic forecast process. In support of this method, two fundamental building blocks of a robust verification program are presented: a method to pinpoint sources of skill in forecasts, and a standardized process for verifying forecasts. One element of a complete verification system is a process to determine why forecasts behave as they do. Forecasters need to be able to determine what causes a forecast to be good and what causes it to be bad. Therefore, an operationally implementable method for conducting this type of verification analysis is described and demonstrated. The method is used to evaluate the influence of model calibration, model initial conditions, and precipitation forecasts on the skill of single-valued (deterministic) <b>river</b> <b>forecasts.</b> A second important element of any forecast process, is a well defined, standard verification methodology. This dissertation proposes a standard verification system for deterministic <b>river</b> <b>forecasts</b> as a foundation for future discussions and for development of a well accepted set of verification practices for hydrologic forecasts. The proposed standards account for the needs of users, forecasters, scientists and administrators and are designed to be easily implemented within the constraints of an operational system...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>River</b> flow <b>forecasting</b> is {{important}} in reservoir operation and water allocation to different uses such as irrigation. In this paper, a <b>river</b> flow <b>forecasting</b> model is developed based on Principal Component Regression (PCR) analysis using some earth data such as precipitation, river discharge, snow water equivalent, climate signals as well as snow cover area extracted from NOAA-AVHRR satellite images. Satellite data were related to period of 1989 to 2004 and were downloaded via Satellite Active Archive (SAR) and about 3 - 4 images per month were processed to determine SCA. To distinct snow from land, albedo data of channel 2, temperature data of channel 4, and channel 3 data were used, and to separate snow and cloud, channel 3 and channel 4 data were applied. Furthermore, to separate composite pixels of 2 or 3 phenomena, a linear mixing model was developed. The proposed model was applied {{to one of the}} Zayande-rood river inflow tributaries to the Zayande-rood River in Iran. In the proposed model, <b>river</b> flow is <b>forecasted</b> for three periods in a year.
