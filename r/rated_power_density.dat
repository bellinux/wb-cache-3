Supercapacitors can be divided into electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors according to the charge storage mechanism.

It utilizes orientation of UWB and tries to get enough route information and guarantee reliable dissemination to all nodes in the network. Simulation results show that proposed protocol outperforms DSR and SPIN protocols.

40|$|With {{the success}} of {{wireless}} technologies, standard wireless technologies are envisioned for the deployment in industrial environments as well. The ultra-wideband (UWB) radio is focused on more deeply for its advantages. Compared with the conventional wireless communication technology, UWB has its unique characteristics such as wider band, higher speed <b>rate,</b> lower <b>power</b> spectrum <b>density</b> (PSD) and stronger antijamming etc. The frameworks of network are described for UWB ad-hoc industrial network. A position based routing strategy is presented. The new routing strategy utilizes an act of orientation of UWB and tries to get sufficient route information {{to set up a}} dynamic routing list. The validity of the strategy is presented by simulation. The results show that the routing strategy can decrease the network loading caused by route discovery. The performance of new routing strategy is better than dynamic source routing (DSR). IEE...|$|R
40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{are commonly used}} in portable electronics, and {{the rapid growth of}} mobile technology calls for an improvement in battery capabilities. Reducing the particle size of electrode materials in synthesis is an important strategy for improving their <b>rate</b> capability and <b>power</b> <b>density</b> (which is the capacity at high rates). Using biological materials as a template during synthesis allows us to achieve this, improving synthesis methods. Utilizing biological materials makes it possible to synthesize nano-scale particles, and using the M 13 virus has shown to be an early solution. The addition of conductive material, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT or CNT), also improves the conductivity of the electrode, further improving the battery's rate capabilities (Lee et al., 2009). In this study, our goal is to improve the conductivity of the LIB battery cathode using M 13 -carbon nanotube complexes. by Melanie Chantal Adams. Thesis (S. B.)
