40|$|The {{confusion}} reigning between superficies {{ownership and}} <b>real</b> <b>servitude</b> is tenacious. There is one case that illustrates {{this state of}} uncertainty better than any other: it involves the difficulty of qualifying networks made up of electric lines, telephone lines and water, gas and drainage conduits. This paper examines {{a case in which}} the qualifying of a telephone line was the main point at issue. Both the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal qualified the said line as being a servitude. This author does not accept such qualification. For him, the telephone line is apiece of surface property to which attach accessorily various servitudes...|$|E

50|$|Following {{this change}} in the legal basis for title conditions, the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 was passed, reconstituting the {{mechanics}} of how new <b>real</b> burdens and <b>servitudes</b> could be created. These two Acts, together with a third Act (the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004), commenced on 28 November 2004.|$|R
60|$|All {{these were}} marks of a <b>real</b> and grievous <b>servitude.</b> The Great Charter was made not {{to destroy the}} root, but to cut short the {{overgrown}} branches, of the feudal service; first, in moderating, and in reducing to a certainty, the reliefs, which the king's tenants paid on succeeding to their estate according to their rank; and secondly, in taking {{off some of the}} burthens, which had been laid on marriage, whether compulsory or restrictive, and thereby preventing that shameful market, which had been made in the persons of heirs, and the most sacred things amongst mankind.|$|R
5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative covenant). In real property law, the term real covenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as <b>servitudes.</b> <b>Real</b> covenant law in the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|R
60|$|It {{is a law}} of nature, {{that whoever}} is {{necessary}} {{to what we have}} made our object, is sure, in some way, or in some time or other, to become our master. All this, however, is submitted to, in order to avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people. For it seems to be laid down as a maxim, that a king has some sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects: that all who are pleasing to them, are to be of course disagreeable to him: that as soon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people, it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours. None are considered as well?wishers to the crown, but those who advised to some unpopular course of action; none capable of serving it, but those who are obliged to call at every instant upon all its power for the safety of their lives. None are supposed to be fit priests in the temple of government, but the persons who are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary. Such is the effect of this refined project; such is ever the result of all the contrivances, which are used to free men from the servitude of their reason and from the necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evident interests. These contrivances oblige them to run into a <b>real</b> and ruinous <b>servitude,</b> in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attended with advantage.|$|R
60|$|An opinion prevails, that greatness {{has been}} more than once advised to submit to certain condescensions towards individuals, which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation. For the meanest and most {{dependent}} instrument of this system knows, that there are hours when its existence may depend upon his adherence to it; and he takes his advantage accordingly. Indeed it is a law of nature, that whoever is necessary to what we have made our object is sure, in some way, or in some time or other, to become our master. All this however is submitted to, in order to avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people. For it seems to be laid down as a maxim, that a king has some sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects: that all who are pleasing to them, are to be of course disagreeable to him: that as soon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people, it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honors. None are considered as well-wishers to the crown, but those who advise to some unpopular course of action; none capable of serving it, but those who are obliged to call at every instant upon all its power for the safety of their lives.
