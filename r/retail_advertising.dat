2500|$|One of {{the unique}} aspects of retail {{promotions}} is that two brands are often involved; the store brand and the brands {{that make up the}} retailer's product range. Retail promotions that focus on the store tend to be ‘image’ oriented, raising awareness of the store and creating a positive attitude towards the store and its services. Retail promotions that focus on the product range, are designed to cultivate a positive attitude to the brands stocked by the store, in order to indirectly encourage favourable attitudes towards the store itself. [...] Some <b>retail</b> <b>advertising</b> and promotion is partially or wholly funded by brands and this is known as co-operative (or co-op) advertising.|$|E

Since these costs are sunk {{at the moment of}} trade, buyers may refrain from incurring them for fear of later opportunism on the part of sellers. It is found that the use of many common selling formats can be explained in terms of their ability to alleviate this problem.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{connection}} of two aspects: <b>retail</b> and <b>advertising</b> and to provide general overviews. To foreshadow expected changes in the consumer's behaviour and establish how important the role advertisement constitutes. Research is also focused on direct influence of advertisement on customers. This thesis is composed of both a theoretical and a practical part. The first two chapters of the theoretical part represent a description of basic information about <b>advertising</b> and Czech <b>retail</b> situation. To reach a complex overview on <b>advertising</b> from the <b>retail</b> customer's side, the third chapter of the theoretical part concentrates on the connection of these aforementioned sections. Furthermore, what kind of marketing communication strategies the Czech retail chains most frequently use and in which areas most often incur the most expenses.

40|$|While online {{consumers}} are less concerned than traditional consumers about firm location, {{they may be}} more concerned about unobservable quality and, to signal this, online retailers rely more on advertising than traditional retailers. Imperfect price competition may arise because of vertical product differentiation, incomplete consumer awareness, and near-perfect information exchange between retailers. This paper evaluates alternative theories of competition and market structure in online <b>retailing.</b> <b>Advertising,</b> product development, and revenue data for the online book market reveal that consumers respond to advertising and website spending rather than low prices. As the market size expanded, during 1997 – 2001, these endogenous sunk costs escalated and there was no major new entry. Advertising-to-sales ratios and market-concentration ratios are much higher than for traditional bookselling. Using price and demand information for individual books over a number of weeks, we find counter-cyclical and cross-sectional price variation inconsistent with perfect price competition...|$|R
