5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing.

In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC.

5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rates}} of the leading causes of death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in <b>research</b> <b>studies,</b> an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
