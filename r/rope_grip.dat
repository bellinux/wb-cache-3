40|$|Cases of {{familial}} {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (fALS; a neurodegenerative disorder) {{have been}} reported in which the gene for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) was mutated. Several studies with the fALS mutant CuZnSOD in transgenic mice and cells showed that the fALS mutations act through an as yet undefined dominant gain-of-function mechanism. Wild-type CuZnSOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide (O 2 ⨪) but also produces hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with H 2 O 2 as substrate. Two laboratories have recently demonstrated that the •OH production ability was preferentially enhanced by the fALS mutant CuZnSOD, suggesting that this might be the function gained in fALS. In this study, we used transgenic CuZnSOD (Tg-CuZnSOD) mice with elevated levels of CuZnSOD to determine whether overexpression of wild-type CuZnSOD was also associated with increased •OH production and impaired muscle function. Enhanced formation of •OH was detected, by spin trapping, in brain and muscle extracts of the Tg-CuZnSOD mice. Three independently derived Tg-CuZnSOD lines showed muscle abnormalities, reflected by altered electromyography (EMG) and diminished performance in the <b>rope</b> <b>grip</b> test. After treatment with paraquat (PQ), a widely used herbicide and O 2 ⨪-generating compound, muscle disability significantly deteriorated in Tg-CuZnSOD mice but not in control mice. The results indicate that elevated levels of CuZnSOD cause indigenous long-term oxidative stress leading to impairment of muscle function. These findings may provide valuable clues about the concurred role of indigenous oxidative stress and exogenous agents in the etiology of sporadic ALS and several other neurodegenerative diseases in which a specific subset of neurons is affected...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{findings}} show that the sensory-motor areas underlying finger movement {{play a critical role}} in numerical cognition. Given these links between embodied action perspectives and numerical concepts, we suggest that observing certain types of actions should have an effect on the selection and the production of numerical responses. Therefore, the present study assessed whether observing finger, hand or mouth movements were able to influence a random number generation task, and how the influence effect moderated for the different kinds of movements. The experimental task required that participants randomly produced a number between 1 and 10 after they first perceived an action stimulus of either closing or an opening finger, hand and mouth grip movement, or they perceived stimuli color changes (a control comparison condition). The results revealed that random number production was influenced by the prior presentation of the finger movements, whereby observing a closing finger grip movement led participants to produce more small than large numbers than in the baseline condition, while observing an opening finger grip movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. For one of the hand movement (i. e., <b>rope</b> <b>grip)</b> conditions, the number production was not influenced. For the other hand movement (i. e., tennis ball grip) conditions, the closing movement induced participants to produce more small than large numbers. Finally, in the mouth movement condition, the observation of the mouth opening movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. Taken together, these results showed that some of the characteristics of the observed finger, hand and mouth grip movements appeared to automatically prime the number generation task. The findings are discussed in terms of the functional and neural mechanisms that might explain the effect, and support the view that number semantics might be grounded on sensory-motor mechanisms...|$|E

50|$|Pocket Theology: Appearing in the 1999 group {{exhibition}} Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies & Delusion in Beijing, {{curated by}} Wu Meichun and Qiu Zhije. A long coiling <b>rope</b> was <b>gripped</b> by a severed, decomposing arm which was suspended by a meat hook. This display {{was held in}} a small room in the basement that was being rented by a group of Chinese artists who organize the exhibition. Viewers were forced to walk over the rope which filled the entire space.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} case, passengers {{grab hold of}} the rope and are pulled along while standing on their skis or snowboards and sliding up the hill. The grade of this style of rope tow is limited by passenger grip strength {{and the fact that}} pulleys cannot be used. Metal handles can however be attached to the <b>rope</b> to help <b>grip.</b>|$|R
50|$|This 4½ was {{equipped}} with a canvas top stretched over a lightweight Weymann body. The hood structure was very light but with high wind resistance (24 Hours Le Mans rules between 1924 and 1928 dictated {{a certain number of}} laps for which the hood had to be closed). The steering wheel measured about 45 cm in diameter and was wrapped with solid braided <b>rope</b> for improved <b>grip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hanmer Springs Ski Area, {{located on}} Mount Saint Patrick, South Island, New Zealand is a club skifield 17km (about 35 minutes' drive) {{from the town}} of Hanmer Springs. It has New Zealands longest Poma lift at over 800m, a {{nutcracker}} rope tow and a new beginners fixed <b>grip</b> <b>rope</b> tow, giving access to trails rated as 10% beginner, 60% intermediate and 30% advanced. Elevation is 1769m {{at the top of the}} field with 52ha of ski terrain (310m vertical elevation).|$|R
50|$|Unlike Doppelmayr, the Poma grips {{are single}} position. In such method, they are pressed down, which opens the jaws to detach the chair, {{and then the}} jaws close and the spring is released. The process is {{reversed}} for attachment. This design allows grip force to be measured as the grip travels through the contour, and for the lift {{to come to a}} stop before the grip is reattached to the haul <b>rope</b> if insufficient <b>grip</b> force is detected. Unlike Doppelmayr lifts that check grip force while a grip and carrier are leaving the terminal, most Poma detachable lifts are not built to operate in reverse because a grip force failed grip can be brought to a halt within the terminal.|$|R
50|$|About {{forty-five minutes}} after takeoff from Kinshasha, at an {{altitude}} of 10,000 ft, the cargo door of the Ilyushin Il-76 suddenly opened, sucking out many passengers from the aircraft. Several people were clinging to ropes, bags and netting on the interior wall of the plane. Survivors described the scene as chaotic, with people screaming and flew onto the opened door. Several people who were sleeping at the time were awakened by other passenger's scream. They also claimed that the plane suddenly tilted to the left and right, causing more people to sucked out from the plane. Several people that had clung onto <b>ropes</b> lost their <b>grips</b> and sucked out to their deaths. A secured truck on the cargo hold may have saved many lives as it may have acted like a barrier.|$|R
40|$|Angelman {{syndrome}} (AS) is a childhood-onset neurogenetic disorder {{characterized by}} functionally severe developmental delay with mental retardation, deficits in expressive language, ataxia, appendicular action tre-mors and unique {{behaviors such as}} inappropriate laughter and stimulus-sensitive hyperexcitibility. Most cases of AS are caused by mutations which disrupt expression of maternal UBE 3 A. Although some {{progress has been made}} in understanding hippocampal-related memory and learning aspects of the disorder using Ube 3 a deficient mice, the numerous motoric abnormalities associated with AS (ataxia, action tremor, dysar-thria, dysphagia, sialorrhea and excessive chewing/mouthing behaviors) have not been fully explored with mouse models. Here we use a novel quantifiable analysis of fluid consumption and licking behavior along with a battery of motor tests to examine cerebellar and other motor system defects in Ube 3 a deficient mice. Mice with a maternally inherited Ube 3 a deficiency (Ube 3 am 2 /p 1) show defects in fluid consumption behavior which are different from Ube 3 am 2 /p 2 mice. The rhythm of fluid licking and number of licks per visit were significantly different among the three groups (m 2 /p 2, m 2 /p 1, m 1 /p 1) and indicate that not only was fluid consumption dependent on Ube 3 a expression in the cerebellum, but may also depend on low levels of Ube 3 a expression in other brain regions. Additional neurological testing revealed defects in both Ube 3 am 2 /p 1 and Ube 3 am 2 /p 2 mice in <b>rope</b> climbing, <b>grip</b> strength, gait and a raised-beam task. Long-term observation of fluid consumption behavior is the first phenotype reported that differentiates between mice with a maternal loss of function versus complete loss of Ube 3 a in the brain. The neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying mouse fluid consumption defects specifically associated with maternally inherited Ube 3 a deficiency may reveal important new insights into the pathobiology of AS in humans...|$|R
40|$|A way {{to measure}} muscle {{activity}} is through electromyography (EMG) analysis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine, via EMG, which triceps exercise elicited the most muscle activation, and which could be defined as the most effective triceps exercise. Fifteen female college students (20 - 24 years old) volunteered and completed this study. On the first day of testing, a one-repetition max (1 RM) was determined for the following exercises: triceps kickbacks, overhead triceps extensions, bar pushdowns, <b>rope</b> pushdowns, closed <b>grip</b> bench press and lying barbell triceps extensions. Dips and triangle push-ups were excluded, as those exercises use body weight as resistance. During the second testing session, subjects performed two, 6 -second isometric contractions to determine a maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Subjects performed one set of seven repetitions for each of the eight exercises. Subjects lifted 70 % of their 1 RM. For the combined EMG values of the entire movement (average of the long head and lateral head), there was not a significant difference between the triangle push-up, kickbacks, and dips. Similarly, for both the long and lateral heads, there was not a significant difference between the triangle push-up, kickbacks, or dips. There was a significant difference (p <. 05) between the long and lateral muscle activation during the rope pushdowns, bar pushdowns and lying barbell triceps extensions. This study concludes that triangle pushups were the best triceps exercise, although kickbacks and dips were equally effective in targeting the triceps brachii muscle...|$|R
5000|$|In each case, cables are {{attached}} to a hitch plate {{on top of the}} cab or may be [...] "underslung" [...] below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to {{the opposite end of the}} cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. [...] "Traction" [...] is provided to the <b>ropes</b> by the <b>grip</b> of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.|$|R
