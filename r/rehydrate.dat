5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even <b>rehydrate</b> by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog can travel far {{in a single}} day or night; {{distances}} of 1.0 to 1.5km have been recorded. Tagging experiments have shown that some can move up to 3km in total, and that some travel several kilometres from the closest breeding habitat. However, the species evidently tends to return to or remain at an identified site, provided the habitat stays appropriate for its needs, or else it will move away. The green and golden bell frog also favours areas with the greatest habitat complexity, and as such, this is a core component of habitat-based strategies to protect the species. In general, the frogs stay within areas of 100–700m2 The frog is well equipped for survival on land. It can <b>rehydrate</b> by absorbing moisture through its ventral skin, and evaporative water loss occurs at a rate, indicative of a watertight skin. very low Some have been observed up to 400m from the nearest body of water.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to <b>rehydrate.</b> The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
40|$|The {{respiration}} {{rates of}} fresh and <b>rehydrated</b> rough rice under unsteady atmospheric conditions were {{measured by the}} pouch method, and quality attributes and amino acid content were also examined. Respiration rates of both fresh and <b>rehydrated</b> rough rice were greatly repressed under conditions of increase in C 02 and decrease in 02 concentrations at 20 and 30 'C.

Survival of the natural flora was determined after the meat was freeze-dehydrated and <b>rehydrated</b> {{at room temperature for}} 30 min and 50, 85, and 100 C for 10 min. Total counts of bacteria in the <b>rehydrated</b> samples {{were determined}} during storage of the meat at 4, 22, and 37 C until spoilage odor was detectable. Meat samples were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, then dried, <b>rehydrated,</b> and stored at the same temperatures. Numbers of surviving organisms in the inoculated samples were determined with use of both selective and nonselective media. Representative genera surviving the various rehydration treatments were determined. Approximately 32 % of the bacteria in the meat survived during dehydration and rehydration at room temperature. Many numbers and types of vegetative bacteria also survived rehydration at 50 C. When meat was <b>rehydrated</b> at 85 or 100 C, the initial count was less than one per gram. The only organisms isolated from samples <b>rehydrated</b> at 85 or 100 C were of the genus Bacillus. S. aureus in inoculated samples survived dehydration and rehydration at 60 C. Storage of all <b>rehydrated</b> samples at 4 C gave a good shelf life (18 or more days). The study indicates that freeze-dehydrated meat should be produced with adequate microbiological control and that such meat should be <b>rehydrated</b> in very hot water...|$|R

Intermediate moisture fruits are suitable for direct consumption compared to dry fruits and can be directly used in the production of various products such as bakery products, dairy products and candies. Aim {{of this study is to}} compare the pectin methyl esterase (PME) activity of intermediate moisture figs which causes softening of the texture and to compare their microbial stability after 3 months storage period. For this purpose, dried figs were <b>rehydrated</b> in 30 and 80 ° C water until they reach 30 % moisture content. <b>Rehydrated</b> samples were stored for 3 months at + 4 °C. Results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the control samples and the samples <b>rehydrated</b> at 80 °C according to the total viable counts. At the end of the storage period, results of residual PME activity in control samples was 24. 1 μmol COOH min- 1 g- 1, while it was found 17. 4 μmol COOH min- 1 g- 1 in samples <b>rehydrated</b> at 80 °C. As a result rehydration conducted at 80 °C provided 28 % reduction in PME activity compared to the control samples <b>rehydrated</b> at 30 °C, although it did not affect the microbial load significantly after storage. </span...|$|R

Per New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) rules, opposing lightweight fighters must weigh within 7 pounds of one another. Having not yet completed his own official weigh-in, Alves' opponent Jim Miller (who {{was within the}} designated lightweight limit) was able to <b>rehydrate</b> and officially weigh in over the limit himself, at 157.6 lbs, allowing the bout to proceed as catchweight. NYSAC and UFC officials indicated that Alves must not weigh more than 173 lbs {{the day of the}} fight, or it would be cancelled. As a result of missing the original designated weight, Alves was fined 20% of his purse, which went to his opponent.|$|E
25|$|Intertidal {{organisms are}} also {{especially}} prone to desiccation {{during periods of}} emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation {{in the same way}} as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to <b>rehydrate</b> and recover after periods of severe desiccation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{displacements}} (~96% of LDD, 64% of RDD) resolve {{with medical}} management that includes fluids (oral or intravenous) to <b>rehydrate</b> {{the horse and}} soften any impaction that may be present. Systemic analgesics, antispasmodics, and sedation are often used to keep the horse comfortable during this time. Horses with left dorsal displacement are sometimes treated with exercise and/or phenylephrine—a medication that causes contracture of the spleen and may allow the bowel to slip off the nephrosplenic ligament. At times anesthesia and a rolling procedure, in which the horse is placed in left lateral recumbency and rolled to right lateral recumbency while jostling, {{can also be used}} to try to shift the colon off of the nephrosplenic ligament. Displacements that do not respond to medical therapy require surgery, which generally has a very high success rate (80–95%).|$|E

30|$|DMSO {{afforded the}} best {{conversion}} of glycerol {{probably due to}} a better desorption of the product from the hydrophilic surface of the catalyst. Different catalysts including calcined (mainly Lewis basic sites) or <b>rehydrated</b> (mainly Bronsted basic sites) materials were tested. Optimum activities were obtained using <b>rehydrated</b> catalysts, suggesting a more important contribution of Bronsted basic sites in the observed enhancement of catalytic performance. The high performance of the <b>rehydrated</b> hydrotalcite supported on α-Al 2 O 3 led to a higher GDC yield. Increasing Mg vs Al (Mg/Al molar ratio of 4 instead 2) quantities provided improved glycerol conversion but decreased catalyst stability, a fact that was attributed {{to the presence of}} an extra MgO(H) phase in the catalyst [24].|$|R
25|$|Aphids passively feed on sap of phloem {{vessels in}} plants, {{as do many}} of their fellow members of Hemiptera such as scale insects and cicadas. Once a phloem vessel is punctured, the sap, which is under pressure, is forced into the aphid's food canal. Occasionally, aphids also ingest xylem sap, which is a more dilute diet than phloem sap as the {{concentrations}} of sugars and amino acids are 1% {{of those in the}} phloem. Xylem sap is under negative hydrostatic pressure and requires active sucking, suggesting an important role in aphid physiology. As xylem sap ingestion has been observed following a dehydration period, aphids are thought to consume xylem sap to replenish their water balance; the consumption of the dilute sap of xylem permitting aphids to <b>rehydrate.</b> However, recent data showed aphids consume more xylem sap than expected and they notably do so when they are not dehydrated and when their fecundity decreases. This suggests aphids, and potentially, all the phloem-sap feeding species of the order Hemiptera, consume xylem sap for another reason than replenishing water balance.|$|E
25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to <b>rehydrate</b> and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{normally}} require {{free access}} to all the fresh, clean water they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time. However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. [...] But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30–90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process. [...] A hot horse will properly <b>rehydrate</b> while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked. [...] Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.|$|E
