60|$|This imprudent, <b>rash</b> <b>conduct</b> cost a {{great many}} their lives who had with great care and caution shut {{themselves}} up and kept retired, as it were, from all mankind, and had by that means, under God's providence, been preserved through all the heat of that infection.|$|E
60|$|The day was beautiful, {{the scene}} was fair, the spot indeed was one which {{rendered}} the performance of gracious offices to Sybil doubly sweet. She ever begged of the Lady Superior {{that she might be}} her minister to the cottages up Dale. They were full of familiar faces. It was a region endeared to Sybil by many memories of content and tenderness. And as she moved along to-day her heart was light, and the natural joyousness of her disposition, which so many adverse circumstances had tended to repress, was visible in her sunny face. She was happy about her father. The invasion of the miners, instead of prompting him as she had feared to some <b>rash</b> <b>conduct,</b> appeared to have filled him only with disgust. Even now he was occupied in a pursuit of order and peace, counselling prudence and protecting the benevolent.|$|E
60|$|Columbus {{remained}} {{in the city of}} Granada upwards of nine months, endeavoring to extricate his affairs from the confusion into which they had been thrown by the <b>rash</b> <b>conduct</b> of Bobadilla, and soliciting the restoration of his offices and dignities. During this time he constantly experienced the smiles and attentions of the sovereigns, and promises were repeatedly made him that he should ultimately be reinstated in all his honors. He had long since, however, ascertained the great interval that may exist between promise and performance in a court. Had he been of a morbid and repining spirit, he had ample food for misanthropy. He beheld the career of glory which he had opened, thronged by favored adventurers; he witnessed preparations making to convey with unusual pomp a successor to that government from which he had been so wrongfully and rudely ejected; in the meanwhile his own career was interrupted, and as far as public employ is a gauge of royal favor, he remained apparently in disgrace.|$|E

"I {{had long}} determined," [...] he said, [...] "that if you ran counter to my wishes, and persisted in your {{infatuated}} affection for that scapegrace, I should remove you to some secluded spot, {{where you might}} reconsider your conduct and form better resolutions for the future. This country house answered the purpose admirably, and as an old servant of mine, Mrs. Jorrocks, chanced to reside in the neighbourhood, I have warned her that at any time I might come down and should expect to find things ready. Your <b>rash</b> and heartless <b>conduct</b> has, however, precipitated matters, and we have arrived before her preparations were complete. Our future arrangements will therefore be less primitive than they are at present. Here you shall remain, young lady, until you show signs of repentance, and of a willingness to undo the harm which you have done." ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>rash</b> {{and foolish}} <b>conduct</b> {{of the people}} went so far, that the ministers took notice to them of it, and laid before them both the folly and danger of it; and this checked it a little, so that they grew more cautious. But it had another effect, which they could not check: for as the first rumor had spread, not over the city only, but into the country, it had the like effect; and the people were so tired with being so long from London, and so eager to come back, that they flocked to town without fear or forecast, and began to show {{themselves}} in the streets {{as if all the}} danger was over. It was indeed surprising to see it; for though there died still from a thousand to eighteen hundred a week, yet the people flocked to town as if all had been well.|$|R

I will not at present trouble you by describing how. It is enough, that I alone, of all people living, know all the sides of the story, those from whom I collected it having each only a partial knowledge which confuses them and points to nothing. One person knows of your early engagement and its sudden termination; another, of the reason of those strange meetings at inns and coffee-houses; another, of what was sufficient to cause all this, and so on. I know what fits one and all the circumstances like a key, and shows them to be the natural outcrop of a rational (though rather <b>rash)</b> line of <b>conduct</b> for a young lady. You will at once perceive how it was that some at least of these things were revealed to me.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} and {{risk factors for}} herpes zoster have been studied in cross-sectional and cohort studies, although most such {{studies have been conducted}} in Western countries. Evidence from Asian populations is limited, and no cohort study has been conducted in Asia. We are conducting a 3 -year prospective cohort study in Shozu County in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan to determine the {{incidence and}} predictive and immunologic factors for herpes zoster among Japanese. Methods: The participants are followed for 3 years, and a telephone survey is conducted every 4 weeks. The participants were assigned to 1 of 3 studies. Participants in study A gave information on past history of herpes zoster and completed health questionnaires. Study B participants additionally underwent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) skin testing, and study C participants additionally underwent blood testing. If the participants develop herpes zoster, we evaluate clinical symptoms, measure cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity using venous blood sampling, photograph skin areas with <b>rash,</b> <b>conduct</b> virus identification testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation from crust sampling, and evaluate postherpetic pain. Results: We recruited 12 522 participants aged 50 years or older in Shozu County from December 2009 through November 2010. The participation rate was 65. 7 % of the target population. Conclusions: The present study is likely to provide valuable data on the incidence and predictive and immunologic factors for herpes zoster in a defined community-based population of Japanese.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyse the clinical and epidemiological data from human parvovirus B 19 cases in a six-year study of <b>rash</b> diseases <b>conduct</b> in an urban area in Brazil (Niter√≥i city area, State of Rio de Janeiro). A total of 673 patients with acute rash diseases were seen at two primary health care units and at a general hospital. A clotted blood sample was collected from all subjects at the time of consultation. Forty-nine per cent (330 cases) of the patients were negative for dengue, rubella and measles IgM or for low avidity IgG to HHV- 6. Of these 330, 105 (31. 8 %) were identified as IgM positive to parvovirus B 19 by using an antibody capture EIA. During the study period, three distinct peaks of parvovirus infection were detected, suggesting that the disease appears to cycle in approximately 4 - 5 years. B 19 infection was characterized by variable combinations of fever, flu-like symptoms, arthropathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Frequency of fever and arthropathy was substantially higher in adults, 75 % [chi 2 (1 D. F.) = 11. 39, p = 0. 0007] and 62. 5 % [chi 2 (1 D. F.) = 29. 89, p = 0. 0000], respectively. "Slapped-cheek" appearance and reticular or lace-like rash were seen in only 30. 1 % of the children. No adult presented this typical rash. The lack of the typical rash pattern in a large proportion of parvovirus B 19 and the similarity of clinical manifestations to other rash diseases, specially to rubella, highlight the difficulty of diagnosing B 19 infection on clinical grounds alone...|$|R
40|$|High doses in Tg. rasH 2 {{carcinogenicity}} studies are usually {{set at the}} maximum tolerated dose (MTD), although this dose selection strategy has not been critically evaluated. We analyzed the body weight gains (BWGs), mortality, and tumor response in control and treated groups of 29 Tg. <b>rasH</b> 2 studies <b>conducted</b> at BioReliance. Based on our analysis, {{it is evident that}} the MTD was exceeded at the high and/or mid-doses in several studies. The incidence of tumors in high doses was lower when compared to the low and mid-doses of both sexes. Thus, we recommend that the high dose in male mice should not exceed one-half of the estimated MTD (EMTD), as it is currently chosen, and the next dose should be one-fourth of the EMTD. Because females were less sensitive to decrements in BWG, the high dose in female mice should not exceed two-third of EMTD and the next dose group should be one-third of EMTD. If needed, a third dose group should be set at one-eighth EMTD in males and one-sixth EMTD in females. In addition, for com-pounds that do not show toxicity in the range finding studies, a limit dose should be applied for the 26 -week {{carcinogenicity studies}}...|$|R
