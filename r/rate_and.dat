5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> the future spot rate.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the pass through effect related to volatility in nominal exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> {{the consumer price}} index as well as the import price index of Taiwan in this paper. The monthly data series ranges from 1981 to 2009. Results indicate that time varying volatility in nominal exchange rates is higher than that of consumer prices. The conditional covariance of nominal exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> consumer prices is negative; however, the conditional covariance of nominal exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> import prices is positive. Both of these conditions were established over long durations. Patterns in the co-movement of nominal exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> consumer prices soared during the Asian economic crisis in 1997; however, patterns in the co-movement of nominal exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> consumer prices tumbled during the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2007.

Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> penetration.|$|E
