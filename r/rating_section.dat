40|$|An {{extensive}} academic vocabulary {{in science}} {{is a critical}} component required for students' abilities to construct their own conceptual understandings about how things work in the natural and designed worlds. While science curriculum reformers use hands-on, minds-on scientific investigations to form the heart of science learning for young children, the acquisition of science vocabulary is also {{an essential part of}} the process of science learning. Words allow students to communicate their ideas to others and "make sense" of the world. Words are the representations of experiences and ideas about students' experiences within the world. Despite the importance of vocabulary acquisition, little research has been done on methods for teaching primary students academic science vocabulary. The purpose of this study was to explore how professional development alters primary grade teachers' abilities to incorporate vocabulary instruction during science lessons. The solution explored in this record of study was to develop and assess the effectiveness of a self-designed model for professional learning preparing teachers in primary grades to teach academic science vocabulary. This model included four and a half hours of professional learning, a pre- and post- vocabulary questionnaire, four classroom observations including instructional support and coaching, post-observation conversations, one interview per participant, and one group discussion. The study took place over a four-month period. Participants included three kindergarten teachers and three second-grade teachers, and took place in a rural public primary school near San Antonio, Texas. The researcher used a mixed methods approach to investigate teachers' subsequent use of vocabulary instruction methods in their own classes while teaching science. Quantitative data were collected from teachers' responses to the Science Vocabulary Questionnaire (SVQ). Additionally, the rating scale on the Science Classroom Observation Worksheet (SCOW) was used to generate a scaled score. Qualitative data included teachers' open-ended responses from the SVQ, observational notes entered on the Rationale for <b>Rating</b> <b>section</b> on the SCOW, teachers' responses to post-observation interview questions, and teachers' responses during the informal group discussion. Analyses of the data revealed five out of six teachers implemented suggested methods of teaching academic science vocabulary during their science lessons. Furthermore, four of the six teachers consistently improved their practices of teaching vocabulary instruction after each individual professional development sessions. In the teachers? final remarks regarding their professional development experiences, five out of six teachers stated they believed the individualized model of professional support was more effective than whole group professional development. Results from this exploratory study provide preliminary evidence associating the professional development model the researcher developed with teachers' improved used of vocabulary instruction during science lessons...|$|E

This study {{examined}} hospital characteristics and hospital population {{risk factors and}} their associations with hospital-specific cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> in Washington State. METHODS. Data were obtained from 1987 birth certificates. The study population included all hospitals that had 12 or more singleton live births. RESULTS. Hospital-specific cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> varied from 0 % to 43 % and were positively associated with proprietary ownership, size of delivery service, and the proportions of women who had complications or high-birthweight infants. The proportion of women who had late prenatal care was inversely associated with cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates.</b> Although proprietary hospitals had higher cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates,</b> their patient populations were lower risk than patients of public or teaching hospitals.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} (a) {{trends in}} the cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> in Alberta from April 1979 to March 1988, (b) the contribution of different primary indications to the overall increase in the cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> and (c) {{trends in the}} cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> by residence of the mother. DESIGN: Retrospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Women who gave birth in acute care hospitals in Alberta during the study period. Indications for cesarean section were defined by a hierarchic classification system. Geographic regions were identified according to the mother's residence. MAIN RESULTS: The crude cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> increased from 13. 2 to 17. 3 per 100 deliveries between 1979 - 80 and 1987 - 88. Previous cesarean section accounted for 54 % of the increase, breech presentation for 17 %, fetal distress for 17 % and dystocia for 10 %. The contribution of previous cesarean section {{was due to the}} substantial {{increase in the number of}} women presenting with a previous cesarean section. The cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> among women who had previously had the procedure decreased from 96. 7 % in 1979 - 80 to 84. 6 % in 1987 - 88.

Less {{is known about}} the relationship between payment source and cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> within public and private hospitals. Methods: We analyzed the 1998, 2003, and 2008 rounds of a nationally representative household survey (PNAD), which includes type of delivery, where it took place, and who paid for it. We construct cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> for various categories, and perform logistic regression to determine the relative importance of independent variables on cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> for all births and first births only. Results: Brazilian cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> were 42 percent in 1998 and 53 percent in 2008. Women who delivered publicly funded births in either public or private hospitals had lower cesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> than those who delivered privately financed deliveries in public or private hospitals. Multivariate models suggest that older age, higher education, and living outside the Northeast region all positively affect the odds of delivering by cesarean section; effects are attenuated by the payment source–hospital type variable for all women and even more so among first births.

In this study, we aimed to analyse the contribution of specific obstetric populations to changes in caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates,</b> by using the Robson classification in two WHO multicountry surveys of deliveries in health-care facilities. The Robson system classifies all deliveries into one of ten groups {{on the basis of}} five parameters: obstetric history, onset of labour, fetal lie, number of neonates, and gestational age. Methods: We studied deliveries in 287 facilities in 21 countries that were included in both the WHO Global Survey of Maternal and Perinatal Health (WHOGS; 2004 – 08) and the WHO Multi-Country Survey of Maternal and Newborn Health (WHOMCS; 2010 – 11). We used the data from these surveys to establish the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> per country. Countries were stratified according to Human Development Index (HDI) group (very high/high, medium, or low) and the Robson criteria were applied to both datasets. We report the relative size of each Robson group, the caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> in each Robson group, and the absolute and relative contributions made by each to the overall caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate.</b> Findings: The caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> increased overall between the two surveys (from 26 · 4 % in the WHOGS to 31 · 2 % in the WHOMCS, p= 0 · 003) and in all countries except Japan. Use of obstetric interventions (induction, prelabour caesarean section, and overall caesarean section) increased over time. Caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rates</b> increased across most Robson groups in all HDI categories. Use of induction and prelabour caesarean section increased in very high/high and low HDI countries, and the caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> after induction in multiparous women increased significantly across all HDI groups. The proportion of women who had previously had a caesarean section increased in moderate and low HDI countries, as did the caesarean <b>section</b> <b>rate</b> in these women.
