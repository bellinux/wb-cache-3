25|$|Magnetostratigraphy is {{also used}} to {{determine}} age. This technique uses the pattern of magnetic polarity zones of CRBG layers by comparison to the magnetic polarity timescale. The samples are analyzed to determine their characteristic <b>remanent</b> magnetization from the Earth's magnetic field at the time a stratum was deposited. This is possible as magnetic minerals precipitate in the melt (crystallize), they orient themselves with Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of electrical charges produces {{a magnetic field}} (see electromagnetism). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced <b>remanent</b> magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically, where faults, ore bodies, or ground water offers a less resistive path. One theory suggests that lodestones, natural magnets encountered in ancient times, were created in this manner.|$|E
500|$|The past {{magnetic}} field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that {{can carry a}} permanent magnetic moment. This <b>remanent</b> magnetization, or remanence, can be acquired {{in more than one}} way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is [...] "frozen" [...] in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the {{magnetic field}} as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called detrital <b>remanent</b> magnetization.|$|E

50|$|Natural <b>remanent</b> {{magnetization}} (NRM) is {{the permanent}} magnetism {{of a rock}} or sediment.

Natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization forms the basis of paleomagnetism and magnetostratigraphy.|$|E
50|$|Spin glasses {{differ from}} {{ferromagnetic}} materials {{by the fact}} that after the external magnetic field is removed from a ferromagnetic substance, the magnetization remains indefinitely at the <b>remanent</b> value. Paramagnetic materials differ from spin glasses {{by the fact that}}, after the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization rapidly falls to zero, with no <b>remanent</b> magnetization. The decay is rapid and exponential.|$|E
50|$|Magnetofossils are {{not only}} being studied for their paleoenvironmental or paleoclimatic indicators. As {{mentioned}} above, magnetofossils hold a <b>remanent</b> magnetization when they are formed. That is, the magnetite (or greigite) aligns {{in the direction of}} the geomagnetic field. The magnetite crystals can be thought of as being a simple magnet with a north and south pole, this north-south orientation aligns with the north-south magnetic poles of the Earth. These fossils are then buried within the rock record. Researchers can examine these rock samples in a <b>remanent</b> magnetometer where the effects of Earth's current magnetic field is removed, to determine the <b>remanent,</b> or initial, magnetization of the rock sample when it was formed. In knowing the orientation of the rock in-situ and the <b>remanent</b> magnetization, researchers can determine the Earth's geomagnetic field at the time the rock was formed. This can be used as an indicator of magnetic field direction, or reversals in the Earth's magnetic field, where the Earth's north and south magnetic poles switch (which happen on average every 450,000 years).|$|E

5000|$|Paleomagnetists are {{interested}} in the primary natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization (NRM) in a rock, acquired when the rock was originally formed. Viscous <b>remanent</b> magnetization is regarded as noise. Any component of the NRM that is {{in the direction of the}} present Earth's field is suspect because it may have been acquired since the last geomagnetic reversal. Fortunately, VRM is often removed by the first steps in a stepwise thermal demagnetization of the NRM.|$|E
5000|$|When an {{organism}} dies the magnetosomes become trapped in sediments. Under the right conditions, primarily if the redox conditions are correct, the magnetite {{can then be}} fossilized and therefore stored in the sedimentary record. [...] The fossilization of the magnetite (magnetofossils) within sediments contributes largely to the natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization of the sediment layers. The natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization is the permanent magnetism remaining in a rock or sediment after it has formed.|$|E

50|$|When the {{external}} magnetic field is removed, the magnetization of the spin glass falls rapidly to a lower value known as the <b>remanent</b> magnetization.|$|E
50|$|Some {{kinds of}} {{remanence}} are undesirable {{and must be}} removed before the useful remanence is measured. One is isothermal <b>remanent</b> magnetization (IRM), which {{as a component of}} NRM induced through exposing a particle to a large magnetic field, causing the field to flip its lower coercivity magnetic moments to a field-favored direction. A commonly cited mechanism of IRM acquisition is through lightning strikes. Another is viscous <b>remanent</b> magnetization (VRM), a remanence acquired when the rock sits in the Earth's field for long periods.|$|E

50|$|In a third process, {{magnetic}} grains grow during chemical reactions, {{and record}} {{the direction of the}} magnetic field {{at the time of their}} formation. The field is said to be recorded by chemical <b>remanent</b> magnetization (CRM). A common form of chemical <b>remanent</b> magnetization is held by the mineral hematite, another iron oxide. Hematite forms through chemical oxidation reactions of other minerals in the rock including magnetite. Redbeds, clastic sedimentary rocks (such as sandstones) are red because of hematite that formed during sedimentary diagenesis. The CRM signatures in redbeds can be quite useful and they are common targets in magnetostratigraphy studies.|$|E

50|$|Samples {{are first}} {{analyzed}} {{in their natural}} state to obtain their natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization (NRM). The NRM is then stripped away in a stepwise manner using thermal or alternating field demagnetization techniques to reveal the stable magnetic component.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetization}} in the surveyed rock is a {{vector sum}} of induced and <b>remanent</b> magnetization:The induced magnetization of many minerals {{is the product}} of the ambient magnetic field and their magnetic susceptibility :Some susceptibilities are given in the table.|$|E
50|$|Surprisingly, {{the sum of}} the two {{complicated}} {{functions of}} time (the zero-field-cooled and <b>remanent</b> magnetizations) is a constant, namely the field-cooled value, and thus both share identical functional forms with time, at least in the limit of very small external fields.|$|E
50|$|Another kind of {{laboratory}} remanence is anhysteretic remanence or anhysteretic <b>remanent</b> magnetization (ARM). This is induced by exposing a magnet {{to a large}} alternating field plus a small dc bias field. The amplitude of the alternating field is gradually reduced to zero to get an anhysteretic magnetization, and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The anhysteretic magnetization curve is often close {{to an average of}} the two branches of the hysteresis loop, and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field. ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology and to the acquisition of natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization in rocks.|$|E
50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a <b>remanent</b> core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the <b>remanent</b> magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an H bridge drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|E
50|$|Results of the {{individual}} samples are analyzed by removing the natural <b>remanent</b> magnetization (NRM) to reveal the DRM.
