40|$|International audienceGlobal {{manufacturing}} increasingly faces decision {{challenges of}} how to better manage the dependencies between different activities that take place either locally or across different locations. Co-ordination decision making not only <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{information to be provided}} in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time, but also <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> level of support from models for decision analysis and decision evaluation. Furthermore, the alignment of co-ordination decisions with a global firm's global environment and its operations performance has been identified as crucial to the firm's success, but remains a challenge to decision makers. This paper proposes an integrated decision support system (IDSS) that can facilitate manufacturing managers to make more efficient and effective global co-ordination decisions. A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis and assessment functions has been provided through the system's four key components (a Global Context Modeller, a Multi-Criteria Scoring Modeller, a Configurator and a Co-ordinator). The evaluation of the decision system has been undertaken through a case study within the automotive industry, which demonstrates the applicability of the system to providing decision support for realistic global manufacturing co-ordination problems...|$|R
40|$|Although spatial {{critical}} points (saddle {{points and}} extrema––minima and maxima) are mathematically well-defined, it is non-trivial to detect them on an arbitrary discrete grid. Discretising a continuous method {{as well as}} a straightforward discrete neighbourhood based method do not guarantee to return all critical points. Although not all image analysis tasks <b>require</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> amount ofcritical point in mutual relations, it is obviously an advantage to know that all critical points are found. Furthermore, some methods do <b>require</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> amount of saddle points in relation to the extrema.
