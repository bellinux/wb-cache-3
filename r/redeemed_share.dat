50|$|Hedge {{funds are}} {{typically}} open-ended and actively managed. However, investors can typically <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> only monthly or less frequently (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually).|$|R

50|$|Redemption Fee — {{another type}} of fee that some funds charge their {{shareholders}} when they sell or <b>redeem</b> <b>shares.</b> Unlike a deferred sales load, a redemption fee is paid to the fund (not to a Stockbroker) and is typically used to defray fund costs associated with a shareholder's redemption.|$|R
5000|$|Unit {{investment}} trusts (UITs) {{are issued}} {{to the public}} only once, when they are created. UITs generally have a limited life span, established at creation. Investors can <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> directly with the fund at any time (similar to an open-end fund) or wait to redeem them upon the trust's termination. Less commonly, they can sell their shares in the open market.|$|R
50|$|As an {{open-ended}} company the manager must create shares when money is invested and <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> as requested by shareholders. As with other collective investments, ICVCs' main {{function is to}} make money for the shareholders. This is achieved via investing in different asset classes such as equities, fixed-interest investments, and property. By using economies of scale they facilitate access to professional investment management for small investors.|$|R
50|$|Open-end fund (or {{open-ended}} fund) is {{a collective}} investment scheme which can issue and <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> at any time. An investor will generally purchase {{shares in the}} fund directly from the fund itself {{rather than from the}} existing shareholders. It contrasts with a closed-end fund, which typically issues all the shares it will issue at the outset, with such shares usually being tradable between investors thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{advantages}} of closed-end funds over their open-ended cousins are financial. CEFs {{do not have}} to deal with the expense of creating and <b>redeeming</b> <b>shares,</b> they tend to keep less cash in their portfolio, and they need not worry about market fluctuations to maintain their [...] "performance record". So if a stock drops irrationally, the closed-end fund may snap up a bargain, while open-ended funds might sell too early.|$|R
40|$|ETFs are {{designed}} to track a particular underlying index. As these 2 ̆ 2 baskets 2 ̆ 2 of securities are traded, excessive demand or supply of shares can cause a disparity between {{the price of the}} ETF and the underlying value of securities held. However, because of the ability of large institutions to trade directly with the ETF firm to create and <b>redeem</b> <b>shares,</b> arbitrage keeps prices in line. See article here, WSJ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{this article}} {{uses the term}} [...] "NAV" [...] for simplicity, in reality a {{performance}} fee would be charged by reference to the NAV per share (being the net asset value divided {{by the number of}} shares in issue). The NAV will fluctuate as investors subscribe for and <b>redeem</b> <b>shares,</b> whereas the NAV per share will only fluctuate as the underlying investments increase or decrease in value, making the latter the appropriate measure for calculating a performance fee.|$|R
50|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} of Nam Tai purported to amend the articles of association such that where any shareholder owes an unpaid judgment debt to the company, the company was entitled to <b>redeem</b> the <b>shares</b> of that shareholder and set-off the redemption proceeds against the judgment amount. Having done this, on 18 December 1998 Nam Tai purported to <b>redeem</b> the <b>shares</b> which had been charged to the Bank of China and set-off the proceeds against the judgment debt originally awarded to the Irish government.|$|R
50|$|Net {{asset value}} is most {{commonly}} used {{in the context of}} open-end funds. Shares and interests in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by the fund to each new investor and redeemed by the fund when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> and interests at a price calculated by reference to the NAV of the fund, with the intention that new investors receive a fair proportion of the fund and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion of the fund's value in cash.|$|R
5000|$|The third step, titled [...] "Trading Among Farmers", {{involves}} more far-reaching change to Fonterra's capital structure. The co-operative {{would no longer}} be obliged to issue or <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> at a price established via an independent valuation process. Instead, farmers would buy or sell shares among themselves at market prices through a farmer-only share trading market. This would have the effect of making Fonterra shares permanent capital, providing the co-operative with more confidence to invest in long-term projects without fear that some of its share capital might be needed to fund redemptions in future years.|$|R

50|$|A {{share is}} also a way of pricing sales charges (loads) on mutual funds in the United States. In an A share, the sales load is up front, {{typically}} at most 5.75% of the amount invested. In contrast is the B share {{that does not have}} an upfront charge, but instead has higher ongoing expenses {{in the form of a}} higher 12B-1 fee, and a contingent deferred sales charge that only applies if the investor <b>redeems</b> <b>shares</b> before a specified period. The maximum A share sales load is decreased for larger investment amounts as a volume discount.|$|R
50|$|On 12 December 2008 (the {{day after}} Mr Madoff's arrest) Shell applied to <b>redeem</b> its <b>shares</b> in Fairfield Sentry. However, no {{redemption}} payment was received and, {{six days later}} (on 18 December 2008), the directors of Fairfield Sentry effectively suspended share redemptions.|$|R
5000|$|A key goal of {{the capital}} {{structure}} changes was to stop {{large amounts of money}} washing in and out of Fonterra’s balance sheet each year as milk production fluctuates. Under the previous structure, farmers matched their shareholding with their milk production by owning one co-operative share for each kilogram of milksolids (kgMS) produced annually. [...] If their milk production dropped in any season, they could <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> back to the co-operative, which was required to buy the shares back off them. Consequently, Fonterra faced the risk of losing large amounts of share capital through redemptions during times of declining milk production. [...] For instance, after milk production fell during the 2007/08 drought, Fonterra had to pay out $742 million of share capital to farmers via redemptions.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the global economic crisis, investors have flocked to bond funds, and especially corporate bond funds, viewing them as the “safest” vehicles for their capital. However, bond funds are subject to fragilities originating from the first-mover advantage problem: when investors cash out, the cost of compensating them amplifies the funds’ price decline, making it costlier for other investors to remain. Moreover, three other conditions—general market illiquidity, lower fund liquidity, and the prevalence of retail investors—accentuate the financial fragility of corporate bond funds. Academic research shows that when corporate bond fund managers have to trade illiquid corporate bonds after investors <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> en masse, the subsequent demand shock in the secondary bond market results predictably in significant negative effects to the real economy. This brief looks at the fragility of corporate bond funds and offers policy options to combat these conditions and mitigate their wider effects. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|The shares were in turn {{being used}} by Opes Prime to provide {{collateral}} for its financing position with ANZ Bank. Riqueza was unable to provide replacement collateral to Opes Prime so Opes Prime was unable to <b>redeem</b> the <b>shares</b> from ANZ Bank. As a result, Riqueza could not return the shares to Leveraged Capital and it could not return them to Norm Seckold.|$|R
25|$|In {{the course}} of the investigation, it emerged that Bank Leu was {{involved}} in half of the purchases. Two of Guinness' directors signed under-the-table agreements in which Bank Leu subsidiaries in Zug and Lucerne bought 41million Guinness shares. Guinness secretly promised to <b>redeem</b> the <b>shares</b> at cost, including commissions. To fulfill its end of the bargain, Guinness deposited $76million with Bank Leu's Luxembourg subsidiary.|$|R
25|$|ETFs {{are similar}} in many ways to {{traditional}} mutual funds, except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks on a stock exchange through a broker-dealer. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or <b>redeem</b> their individual <b>shares</b> at net asset value (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and <b>redeem</b> ETF <b>shares</b> directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind, with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in the basket of assets.|$|R
5000|$|Closed-end {{funds are}} traded on exchanges {{and in that}} respect they are like {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs), but there are important differences between these two kinds of security. The price of a closed-end fund is completely determined by the valuation of the market, and this price often diverges substantially from the NAV of the fund assets. In contrast, the market price of an ETF trades in a narrow range very close to its net asset value, because the structure of ETFs allows major market participants to <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> of an ETF for a [...] "basket" [...] of the fund's underlying assets. This feature could in theory lead to potential arbitrage profits if the market price of the ETF were to diverge substantially from its NAV. The market prices of closed-end funds are often 10% to 20% higher or lower than their NAV, while the market price of an ETF is typically within 1% of its NAV. Since the market downturn of late 2008 a number of fixed income ETFs have traded at premiums of roughly 2% to 3% above their NAV.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992Two capital {{reductions}} within J.E. Ekornes AS {{were carried}} out during 1992. At the Annual General Meeting on June 29 the share capital of NOK 72,073,880 was written down to NOK 0. This capital reduction was used to cover losses {{which could not be}} covered in any other way. The capital reduction was achieved by <b>redeeming</b> the <b>shares.</b> The Ekornes family's subordinated loan of NOK 2,700,000 was converted into shares. After this, the new share capital amounts to NOK 2,052,000. At the company's Annual General Meeting on October 5, 1992 it was agreed to write down the share capital of NOK 2,052,000 as well. This capital reduction was also achieved by <b>redeeming</b> the <b>shares.</b> At the same time as this latest capital reduction, 1,026,000 new shares were issued in the company, each with a nominal value of NOK 1. These shares constituted the company's share capital as of December 31, 1992. The Ekornes Group showed a profit {{for the first time since}} 1984. The number of employees was 786 at the end of year.|$|R

Suppose further that later that month the fund reinvests a dividend distribution into your account, purchasing 5 new shares. Because of this wash sale (even though it was inadvertent), the loss attributable to an amount equal to the distribution would be disallowed.|$|R

The interest on them {{was obtained from the}} Pozzolanic companies paying dividends to Loftway, which in turn paid dividends to Westpac. The capital was repaid after the float when the Peabody trust lent $8.6 million from the float proceeds to Loftway in order for it to <b>redeem</b> Westpac's <b>shares.</b> That loan was subsequently forgiven by the trust.|$|R
40|$|Under {{federal income}} tax regulations, {{employer}} securities (such as convertible preferred stock) that are held by participants in an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and that are not readily tradeable on an established market must include a put option. The put option is a right to demand that the sponsor <b>redeem</b> <b>shares</b> of employer stock held by the participant {{for which there is}} no market for an established cash price. The employer may have the option to issue marketable securities for all or a portion of that option rather than to pay cash. The provisions of the ESOP may permit the ESOP to substitute for the sponsor as buyer of the employer stock; however, in no case can the sponsor require the ESOP to assume the obligation for the put option. Copyright © 1989, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 1 The issue is, in a leveraged ESOP, if securities subject to a put option are classified outside of permanent equity, whether any of the debit in the equity section of the sponsor's balance sheet (sometimes described as loan to ESOP or deferred compensation) should be similarly classified.

50|$|Leffler came up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} mutual funds with daily redeemability and continuous issuing of shares at the current net asset value of the fund (NAV). On March 21, 1924, Leffer started the first mutual fund, Massachusetts Investors Trust. Initially, the fund was offering new shares continuously to investors without redemption - Investors were able to <b>redeem</b> their <b>shares</b> starting from September. Leffler also started another fund, Incorporated Investors on November 23, 1925 along with a group of Bostonians.|$|R
