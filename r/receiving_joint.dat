5000|$|In early 1904, Governor Brodie {{recommended}} Nichols for {{the position}} of Territorial Secretary. President Theodore Roosevelt made the nomination on March 30, 1904. [...] As secretary, Nichols became {{a leader in the}} fight against Arizona and New Mexico <b>receiving</b> <b>joint</b> statehood. Beyond that he is credited for the satisfactory performance of his duties and was widely respected. Unlike most of Arizona's secretaries, Nichols did not seek advancement to the position of governor. When Governor Brodie recommended Nichols to become his successor in 1908, Nichols declined to take the position. Nichols' given reason was that the territory would soon face a political battle over how mines were taxed and he was poorly suited to lead the fight. He also declined a second term as secretary and instead left office {{at the end of his}} term on April 1, 1908.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{imitation}} abilities of children with autism that require intersubjective interaction with the person modeling the action. The relationships between these types of imitation with other developmental skills were also examined. Results showed that {{during the same time}} point, children that were better at intersubjective imitation tended to be better at joint attention, joint engagement and theory of mind. Joint engagement was also found to be a predictor of success with intersubjective imitation across time. The results also showed that receiving a treatment that focused on joint engagement increased the likelihood of doing better on intersubjective imitation tasks. The findings suggest that joint engagement may be a mediator between <b>receiving</b> <b>joint</b> engagement-based treatment predicting success with intersubjective imitation. Future studies should verify the potential mediator effect found in this study...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} disease activity {{around and}} during pregnancy and pregnancy outcome {{in women with}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) considering antiphospholipid antibody status. Moreover, differences between first and consecutive pregnancies were examined. Methods. Pregnancies[*]>[*] 16 weeks gestation of SLE patients <b>receiving</b> <b>joint</b> care from rheumatologists and gynecologists in two tertiary centers in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2015 were included. Disease activity, flare rate, and pregnancy outcomes and complications were assessed. Results. Ninety-six women (84 % Caucasian) with 144 pregnancies were included. The median SLE(P) DAI score was 2 before, during, and after pregnancy. Flare rates were 6. 3 %, 20. 1 %, and 15. 3 %, respectively. Severe hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, intrauterine fetal death, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational age infants occurred in 18. 1 %, 4. 1 %, 32. 7 %, and 14. 8 %, respectively. Complication rates were similar {{in the first and}} consecutive pregnancies. Half of the women did not experience any pregnancy complication whereas 42. 7 % developed a complication during all pregnancies. Mean number of pregnancies was 2. 4 and live births 1. 7. Conclusion. In this SLE population with low disease activity, pregnancy complications were present irrespective of antiphospholipid antibody status. Furthermore, there were no differences in complication rates between the first and consecutive pregnancies as seen in healthy mothers. This information is useful for patient counseling...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} revision {{and mortality}} rates of 4668 patients undergoing primary total hip and knee replacement between 1989 and 2007 at a University Hospital in New Zealand. The mean {{age at the}} time of surgery was 69 years (16 to 100). A total of 1175 patients (25 %) had died at follow-up at a mean of ten years post-operatively. The mean age of those who died within ten years of surgery was 74. 4 years (29 to 97) at time of surgery. No change in comorbidity score or age of the patients <b>receiving</b> <b>joint</b> replacement was noted during the study period. No association of revision or death could be proven with higher comorbidity scoring, grade of surgeon, or patient gender. We found that patients younger than 50 years {{at the time of}} surgery have a greater chance of requiring a revision than of dying, those around 58 years of age have a 50 : 50 chance of needing a revision, and in those older than 62 years the prosthesis will normally outlast the patient. Patients over 77 years old have a greater than 90 % chance of dying than requiring a revision whereas those around 47 years are on average twice as likely to require a revision than die. This information can be used to rationalise the need for long-term surveillance and during the informed consent process...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} whether physical therapy interventions predicted meaningful short-term improvement in physical health for patients diagnosed with sciatica. Subjects. We examined data from 1, 804 patients (age: X 52. 1 years, SD 15. 6 years; 65. 7 % female, 34. 3 % male) who had been diagnosed with sciatica and who had completed an episode of out-patient physical therapy. Methods. Principal components factor analy-sis was used to define intervention categories from specific treatments applied during the plan of care. A nested-model logistic regression analysis identified intervention categories that predicted meaningful improvement in physical health. Meaningful improvement was defined as a change of 14 or more points on the Physical Component Scale- 12 (PCS- 12) summary score. Results. Twenty-six percent (n 473) of patients had a meaningful improvement in physical health. Improve-ment was more likely in patients <b>receiving</b> <b>joint</b> mobility interventions (odds ratio [OR] 2. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 5 – 4. 4) or general exercise (OR 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 2. 0). Patients who received spasm reduction interventions were less likely to improve (OR 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 60 – 0. 98). Discussion and Conclusion. Physical therapists should emphasize the use of joint mobility interventions and exercise when treating patients with sciatica, whereas interventions for spasm reduction should be avoided.

40|$|Since {{research}} got underway at the German Maritime Museum in 1971, {{this institution}} has been publishing the research results (including numerous dissertations), primarily of external scientists, in its series Schriften des Deutschen Schiffahrtsmuseums. A closely interlocked relationship with external research was thus achieved and further intensified in 1975 by {{the establishment of}} the scientific editorial department and the publishing of the Deutsches Schiffahrtsarchiv. Written material concerning the exhibitions and the general museum work are conveyed to a broader public in the form of museum guides, brochures and the semi-annual journal Deutsche Schiffahrt, published by the endowment association. The series of scientific treatises, which has grown to comprise nearly sixty volumes, is produced according to high standards of quality. This circumstance and the annual publication of the scientific journal {{in the form of a}} yearbook since 1980 were essential factors leading to the inscription of the German Maritime Museum on the Blue List of institutions <b>receiving</b> <b>joint</b> federal and state funding, as well as to its status as a national museum and its excellent international reputation. In the 1990 s the museum’s publication programme was enhanced by a documentary series, in which above all first-hand reports from the realm of navigation are published at varying intervals. The editorial department, which now has a staff of three, also oversees publications appearing independently of the various museum series. All in all, the editorial activities have become continually more complex - with regard to contents and conception alike - in the course of the past thirty years, while being compelled to respond to increasingly rapid technical developments. Audio books are already being produced, for example, and the first online publications are presently in the preparation stage. The increasing technicalisation of production processes has led, however, to an enormous rise in production costs, taking place at a rate which cannot easily be compensated. In view of the fact that, in this day and age, the value of scientific work is often measured primarily according to its cost/benefit ratio, the editorial department has thus come under considerable financial pressure. What is more, it is confronted with new tasks, tasks of a kind that could never have been foreseen in 1971, when Detlev Ellmers provided the impulse for the publication of a regularly appearing scientific monograph series...|$|E
