5000|$|The INEF {{system works}} {{based on its}} own pre-defined scoring function. In {{order to get the}} {{membership}} of the INEF the student, researcher, innovators, awardees and anyone who wanted to get the INEF membership must get the minimum score. Each of the 10 aforementioned categories have its own regulation and scoring function which is discussed in detail at the INEF website.For examples even though every student can apply to be considered for the 10th category but only a few of them will be considered for this category. The same as other categories the scoring function of the 10th is very detailed and a very brief minimum <b>requirements</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> in the system is as follow: 10-1 BSc students: GPA above 85% or the 1st ranked student, recommendation from two professors, and having {{at least one of the}} following: a- At least one paper in ISI or ISC journals based on INEF regulations. b. Having an effective and significant role in solving an issue or an Applied research with national importance approved based on INEF regulations. 10-2 MSc students: GPA at BSc above 80% and MSc above 85% or the 1st ranked student, recommendation from professors and having at least one of the following: a- Published Paper in ISI or ISC indexed journals based on INEF regulations b- Having an effective role in a theory based on INEF regulations [...] c- Having an effective and significant role in solving an issue or an Applied research with national importance confirmed by the related university and approved based on INEF regulations. 10-3 PhD students: GPA at MSc. and PhD above 85%, Excellent score from PhD thesis, recommendation from professors, and fulfilling at least one of the following: a- Having at least 3 Published or final accepted Papers executed from their PhD thesis in ISI or ISC indexed journals based on INEF regulations. b- Having an effective role in a theory based on INEF regulations c- Having an effective and significant role in solving an issue or a Applied research with national importance confirmed by the related university and approved based on INEF regulations.|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{environment in which}} long daycare centres <b>are</b> required <b>to</b> operate {{plays a key role}} in determining what early childhood professionals do and how they go about doing it. This paper reports findings from a state-wide survey undertaken in New South Wales, Australia, which shows how early childhood professionals position themselves on four key aspects of the {{regulatory environment}}: the premises underlying regulatory requirements; its perceived support of them as professionals to provide quality care; how state regulations and the national accreditation system impact upon their daily practice; and the way these audit systems affect their professional esteem. Implications for job satisfaction are discussed. The paper concludes by asserting that regulatory <b>requirements</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> in terms of their contribution to structural, process, contextual and work environment dimensions of quality. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Software {{systems are}} {{becoming}} {{an integral part}} of everyday life influencing organizational and social activities. This aggravates the need for a socio-technical perspective for requirements engineering, which allows for modelling and analyzing the composition and interaction of hardware and software components with human and organizational actors. In this setting, alternative <b>requirements</b> models have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> and selected finding a right trade-off between the technical and social dimensions. To address this problem, we propose a tool-supported process of requirements analysis for socio-technical systems, which adopts planning techniques for exploring the space of requirements alternatives and a number of social criteria for their evaluation. We illustrate the proposed approach {{with the help of a}} case study, conducted within the context of an EU project...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In digital preservation, {{a common}} {{approach}} for preservation actions <b>is</b> the migration <b>to</b> standardized formats. Full {{validation of the}} results of such conversion processes <b>is</b> required <b>to</b> ensure authenticity and trust. This process of quality assurance is a key obstacle to achieving scalability for large volumes of content. In this article, we address the quality assurance process for the preservation of born-digital photographs and validate conversions of raw image formats into standard formats such as Adobe Digital Negative. To achieve this, we rely on a systematic planning framework. We classify <b>requirements</b> that have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> according <b>to</b> their measurement needs. We extend an existing measurement framework using a combination of tools, image similarity algorithms, and purpose-built plugins. By combining metadata extraction, image rendering and comparison, and perceptual-level quality assurance, we evaluate the feasibility of automating the core part of quality assurance that is often the most costly part of preservation processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Lymphatic {{filariasis}} or {{more commonly}} known as elephantiasis disease has infected more than 120 million people in 80 countries; and more than 40 million of them <b>are</b> unable <b>to</b> work, in addition to disruption of aesthetic values. The problem faced by almost all people in combating this infectious disease is delayed diagnosis. The sufferers do not realize {{that they have been}} infected with this disease. A specific and accurate method of early detection is therefore needed. 99 m Tc-labeled Diethylcarbamazine-citrate (99 m Tc-DEC) has been successfully prepared. However, as part of the discovery and development of new drugs, the fulfillment of pharmaceutical and safety <b>requirements</b> have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated.</b> Physico-chemical aspects such as stability, purity levels, and other pharmaceutical requirements, as well as pharmacokinetic studies and route of administration, <b>are</b> important parameters <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied. The stability test showed that after seven months of storage, a preparation in a dry kit retains an efficiency of labeling and a purity level of more than 90 % and its physico-chemical and biological characteristics remained steady. Biodistribution test in Wistar rat showed that the greatest accumulation occurred in the lymphatic system, especially in the popliteal glands and in lumbar and mesenteric lymph nodes. Imaging with a gamma camera after intradermal and intravenous injections to the experimental animals resulted in a positive image that showed 99 m Tc-DEC accumulation in the target organ. The results of this innovation <b>are</b> expected <b>to</b> contribute significantly to improving public health, particulary in early detection of filarial infections. In addition, this result <b>is</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a concrete contribution to the program of "The Global Goal of Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis as a Public Health Problem by the Year 2020 ‚Äù...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{is firmly}} {{established}} {{as part of}} rural development policymaking in the EU. A <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>is</b> {{set out in the}} Rural Development Regulation, the legal basis for spending EU funds on agreed aspects of rural development, which also stipulates the process <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used. Member States are responsible for ensuring that independent "ex ante," mid-term and "ex post" evaluations are carried out for each seven-year Rural Development Programme (RDP), but with inputs from the Commission, notably on common evaluation questions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in all countries. Such a heavily structured system has both advantages and disadvantages. Consistency of approach enables synthesis of evaluation results at the EU level and provides a degree of quality control. However, it constrains the ability of evaluators to pursue issues which may be of importance locally or to other stakeholders. Technical details, especially the timing of evaluation stages, also diminish the ability to learn from past programmes. Data availability remains an important issue. Nevertheless, our experience is that it is both possible and important to learn from evaluating RDPs, not only to measure their apparent achievements, but also to enhance the quality of the policy process, at all levels.

40|$|In Western Australian schools, student subject {{selection}} during Year 10 {{determines the}} future career path {{to which students}} aspire. Subjects offered in Year 11 and Year 12 Upper School studies are classified as Tertiary Entrance score Subjects or certificate of Secondary Education subjects, and students are {{given the opportunity to}} select six subjects which may comprise all Tertiary Entrance score Subjects, all Certificate of Secondary Education Subjects, or a combination of both. Law is classified as a Certificate of Secondary Education subject. It is the student 2 ÃÜ 7 s intention to study Law that is the focus of this research project. The major objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the influence of the factor Law as a Tertiary Entrance Score subject on student selection of Law, and to assess the extent of influence other subjective norms may exert on student subject selection of Law. The project required the establishment of a pilot study group in School A to develop and refine an instrument based upon Likert 2 ÃÜ 7 s Summated Ratings Scale. The questionnaire was formulated through student/research interview trialled within the pilot school. Results of the instrument were examined, further interviews conducted and changes to the questionnaire made in preparation for the major study in School B. The major study involved 275 respondents and utilised the SAS computer programme for analysis. The questionnaire instrument has <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> for validity and reliability The results of the study indicate students support a change to the subject classification of Law from Certificate of Secondary Education Subject to Tertiary Entrance Score Subject. The subjective norms elicited and displayed in the subject selection behaviours of students in this study have special significance for school administrators. The data collected <b>was</b> prior <b>to</b> the introduction of the Andrich Report (1989). In 1991 this report will ensure those students seeking tertiary entrance select a minimum of 4 Tertiary Entrance Score Subjects out of a maximum of 6 subjects. The tertiary entrance requirement during this study was 3 Tertiary Entrance Score Subjects. The impact of students selecting subjects for tertiary entrance is evident in this study in relation to selecting the subject Law.
