25|$|There was a {{high degree}} of {{political}} and civil corruption in the region in the 1920s and 1930s. The mainstream newspapers hardly mentioned what was going on, as any outlet that published articles critical of the status quo was threatened. Some small tabloid newspapers attempted to report what was going on, but <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> quickly became targets. Howard Guilford of the Twin City Reporter was shot and killed on September 6, 1934. A decade later the paper lost another reporter when Arthur Kasherman was killed on January 22, 1945.|$|E
25|$|In late September 2001, VOA aired {{a report}} that {{contained}} brief excerpts of an interview with then Taliban leader Mullah Omar Mohammad, along with segments from President Bush's post-9/11 speech to Congress, an expert in Islam from Georgetown University, and comments by {{the foreign minister of}} Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. State Department officials including Richard Armitage and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views. In response, <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> argued for the VOA's editorial independence from its governors. VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the University of Oregon's Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism.|$|E

25|$|During the World War II period, the American Jewish {{community}} was bitterly and deeply divided and {{was unable to}} form a common front. Most Jews from Eastern Europe favored Zionism, which saw a return to their historical homeland as the only solution; this had the effect of diverting attention from the persecution of Jews in Germany. German Jews were alarmed at the Nazis but were disdainful of Zionism. Proponents of a Jewish state and Jewish army agitated, but many leaders were so fearful of an antisemitic backlash inside the U.S. that they demanded that all Jews keep a low public profile. One important development was the sudden conversion of most (but not all) Jewish leaders to Zionism late in the war. The Holocaust was largely ignored by American media as it was happening. <b>Reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> largely did not believe the atrocity stories coming out of Europe.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Erdely {{stood by}} her story, stating: [...] "I am {{convinced}} {{that it could not}} have been done any other way, or any better." [...] But on December 5, 2014, Rolling Stone published an online apology, stating that there appeared to be [...] "discrepancies" [...] in the accounts of Erdely's sources and that their trust in the accuser was misplaced. A subsequent tweet sent by Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana offered further comment on Erdely's story: [...] "e made a judgement—the kind of judgement <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> make every day. And in this case, our judgement was wrong." [...] On December 6, Rolling Stone updated the apology to say the mistakes in the article were the fault of Rolling Stone and not of its source, while noting that [...] "there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account".|$|E

NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata stated [...] "The survey doesn't recognize the psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on American Indian and Alaska Natives. It is not respectful to {{who we are as}} Native people. This poll still doesn't make it right." [...] The Native American Journalists Association issued a statement calling the publication of the poll, and the reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical. [...] "The <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful, racist mascots.

Funded by former Soviet dissident Pyotr Vins, now a businessman in the USA, the prize is administered by the Glasnost Defence Foundation in Moscow. The prize [...] "for journalism as an act of conscience" [...] has been won over the years by famous journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya and young <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> working far from Russia's media capital, Moscow.

2500|$|Some {{attributed}} {{the drop in}} circulation to the increasing availability of alternate methods of obtaining news, such as the Internet, cable TV and radio.

Still others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995. Willes, the former president of General Mills, was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> as The Cereal Killer.|$|E

It shortly followed that with the revelation that Google CEO Eric Schmidt had an apparently open marriage and had joined a church (as documented on a Web page in Google's cache) with a girlfriend. The point of these articles was that the <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> who covered Silicon Valley {{were well aware of}} these relationships and their potential impact on Google's stock price and brand reputation. [...] But they had tacitly agreed not to report them in order to curry favor with Google staff.

2500|$|Lee underestimated his new foe, {{expecting him}} to be a day late and a {{division}} short, like Hooker. Lee was blinded for a week by the failure of Jeb Stuart's cavalry to provide timely reconnaissance. [...] "Where on earth is my cavalry?" [...] he kept asking every day. In fact Stuart was miles away sacking a mule-drawn supply train. Stuart had trouble finding Lee; he solved his intelligence problem by reading a Philadelphia newspaper that accurately reported Lee's location. The news was a day old, however, and Stuart, slowed down by booty, did not arrive at Gettysburg until July 2. The Confederates were often aided by uncensored newspaper reports of the movements of Union forces. Hooker tried to censor the newspapers, but <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> evaded his restrictions and the South often had accurate reports of Union strength.|$|E
2500|$|In The Hollywood Reporter, Rooney {{wrote that}} Ephron {{presents}} an [...] "entertaining salute to the tabloid newspaper business" [...] and [...] "smartly enlists a garrulous crew of <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> <b>editors</b> {{to serve as}} the oral-history vessel for her nostalgic look back". Rooney judged that the play was [...] "Directed with warmth and vitality by George C. Wolfe, it’s performed with relish by a dynamic cast of pros, piloted by an uncharacteristically rough-edged Tom Hanks." [...] Rooney described the play as unexceptional, cursory and simple, despite its intelligent writing, engrossing and often funny dialogue and commented that: [...] "Brimming with testosterone and grit, it’s an unabashed celebration of male camaraderie, swaggering ambition and competitiveness." [...] Kumar, writing in The Independent, was disappointed in the play’s depth and Hanks’s acting, but thought that Courtney B. Vance’s portrayal of Hap Hairston, who was one of McAlary’s editors was a highlight.|$|E
