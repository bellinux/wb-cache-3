40|$|A {{system is}} {{provided}} for determining tracking error in a propeller or rotor driven aircraft by determining {{differences in the}} aerodynamic loading on the propeller or rotor blades of the aircraft. The system includes a microphone disposed relative to the blades during the <b>rotation</b> <b>thereof</b> so as to receive separate pressure pulses produced by each of the blades during the passage thereof by the microphone. A low pass filter filters the output signal produced by the microphone, the low pass filter having an upper cut-off frequency set below the frequency at which the blades pass by the microphone.

40|$|A screw-released roller brake {{including}} an input drive assembly, an output drive assembly, {{a plurality of}} locking sprags, a mechanical tripper nut for unlocking the sprags, and a casing therefor. The sprags consist of three dimensional (3 -D) sprag members having pairs of contact surface regions which engage respective pairs of contact surface regions included in angular grooves or slots formed in the casing and the output drive assembly. The sprags operate to lock the output drive assembly to the casing to prevent <b>rotation</b> <b>thereof</b> in an idle mode of operation. In a drive mode of operation, the tripper is either self actuated or motor driven and is translated linearly up and down against a spline and at the limit of its travel rotates the sprags which unlock while coupling the input drive assembly to the output drive assembly so as to impart a turning motion thereto in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{innovations}} {{are typically}} hidden and often identified {{by means of}} a-priori economic reasoning. Under multivariate Gaussian model innovations there is no loss measure available to distinguish between particular identifying restrictions and <b>rotations</b> <b>thereof.</b> Based on a non Gaussian copula distribution framework, this paper proposes a loss statistic {{that can be used}} to discriminate between alternative identifying assumptions on the basis of higher order moment characteristics. The merits of Moment Targeted Structural Innovations are illustrated by means of Monte Carlo simulations and real data applications to bivariate systems of US stock prices and total factor productivity and of international breakeven inflation rates...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{innovations}} in multivariate dynamic systems are typically hidden and often identified {{by means of}} a-priori economic reasoning. Under multivariate Gaussian model innovations there is no loss measure available to distinguish alternative orderings of variables or, put differently, between particular identifying restrictions and <b>rotations</b> <b>thereof.</b> Based on a non Gaussian framework of independent innovations, a loss statistic is proposed in this paper that allows to discriminate between alternative identifying assumptions {{on the basis of}} nonparametric density estimates. The merits of the proposed identification strategy are illustrated by means of a Monte Carlo study.

40|$|Pb-based, complex perovskites and {{compositions}} at phase {{boundaries in}} solid solutions exhibit intermediate structures between established displacive variants. The most high-profile {{example is the}} intermediate monoclinic structure in Pb(Zr(x) Ti(1 -x)) O(3) (PZT), which occurs because of frustration between displacive variants with different polarization vectors. However, examples are also given in which intermediate structures may also be stabilized in solid solutions between displacive variants whose order parameters are dominated by strain, amplitude of octahedral <b>rotation,</b> or combinations <b>thereof.</b> In solid solutions such as PZT, the frustration is compositionally driven across the phase boundaries. However, in complex perovskites such as PbSc(1 / 2) Ta(1 / 2) O(3), PbCo(1 / 2) W(1 / 2) O(3), and PbIn(1 / 2) Nb(1 / 2) O(3), the type of intermediate structure {{is related to the}} degree of B-site cation order, which may be modified by thermal treatment. Depending on the degree of order and the size difference of the B-site cations, either incommensurate modulations, mixed antipolar/polar order, or antipolar order may be observed...|$|R
40|$|A vehicle {{simulation}} is surface-interacting if {{the state}} of the vehicle (position, velocity, and acceleration) relative to the surface is important. Surface-interacting simulations perform ascent, entry, descent, landing, surface travel, or atmospheric flight. Modeling of gravity is an influential environmental factor for surface-interacting simulations. Gravity is the free-fall acceleration observed from a world-fixed frame that rotates with the world. Thus, gravity is the sum of gravitation and the centrifugal acceleration due to the world s rotation. In surface-interacting simulations, the fidelity of gravity at heights above the surface is more significant than gravity fidelity at locations in inertial space. A surface-interacting simulation cannot treat the gravity model separately from the world model, which simulates the motion and shape of the world. The world model's simulation of the world's <b>rotation,</b> or lack <b>thereof,</b> produces the centrifugal acceleration component of gravity. The world model s reproduction of the world's shape will produce different positions relative to the world center for a given height above the surface. These differences produce variations in the gravitation component of gravity. This paper examines the actual performance of world and gravity/gravitation pairs in a simulation using the Earth...|$|R
40|$|Although {{fundamental}} {{types of}} fluvial meander-bend transformations – expansion, translation, <b>rotation,</b> and combinations <b>thereof</b> – are widely recognised, {{the relationship between}} the migratory behaviour of a meander bend, and its resultant accumulated sedimentary architecture and lithofacies distribution remains relatively poorly understood. Three-dimensional data from both currently active fluvial systems and from ancient preserved successions known from outcrop and subsurface settings are limited. To tackle this problem, a 3 D numerical forward stratigraphic model – the Point-Bar Sedimentary Architecture Numerical Deduction (PB-SAND) – has been devised as a tool for the reconstruction and prediction of the complex spatio-temporal migratory evolution of fluvial meanders, their generated bar forms and the associated lithofacies distributions that accumulate as heterogeneous fluvial successions. PB-SAND uses a dominantly geometric modelling approach supplemented by process-based and stochastic model components, and is constrained by quantified sedimentological data derived from modern point bars or ancient successions that represent suitable analogues. The model predicts the internal architecture and geometry of fluvial point-bar elements in three dimensions. The model is applied to predict the sedimentary lithofacies architecture of ancient preserved point-bar and counter-point-bar deposits of the middle Jurassic Scalby Formation (North Yorkshire, UK) to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of PB-SAND in modelling 3 D architectures of different types of meander-bend transformations. PB-SAND serves as a practical tool with which to predict heterogeneity in subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs and water aquifers...|$|R
