The present work is about the study of crossbar tyres of the passenger car type in rolling conditions. Measurements were made on a crossbar tyre loaded on a rotating drum and acceleration signals were recorded on the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> for both the tangential and normal directions. The measurement situation was also modelled using a deterministic three-dimensional contact model. Comparisons between measurements and calculations show satisfactory results {{when it comes to}} pitching frequencies and global shapes of the acceleration signals.

40|$|Prediction of tyre/road noise {{has been}} one of the most {{challenging}} research fields within acoustics for the last twenty years. In particular, it has been difficult to achieve an accurate description of the road and rolling tyre contact, which is crucial for the estimation of tyre/road noise. In this paper, a three-dimensional contact model for the tyre/road interaction in rolling conditions is described, validated and illustrated by means of calculations. The contact model is formulated in the time domain for non-linearity reasons. It calculates the dynamic radial contact forces, the local deformation due to roughness indenting, and the normal forced vibrations of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure.</b> The contact problem is solved using an elastic half-space, the road is assumed rigid. The tyre response is described by Greens functions calculated with a tyre model, a pre-tensioned orthotropic Kirchhoffs plate on a stiffness bedding.

40|$|For the {{modelling}} of {{the dynamic}} behaviour of tyres material data are required. Depending {{on the character of}} the model these will have different quality. Modelling with global structures such as beams or plates, representative data for the global bending stiffness, global mass etc. are needed. These data do not represent the details of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> but the combined properties of the structure. Therefore {{it is not possible to}} cut out samples of the tyre and determine the global material properties by measurements on these samples. Consequently it is necessary to estimate the material parameter by measurements carried out on the complete tyre. Results from such measurements will be related to the model used for the tyre (e. g. ring model, orthotropic plate, etc.). The material data obtained in such way are consequently a function of both the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> and the model, which is used to update the data. A method for experimental collection of global material data for tyres has been developed.

40|$|Rolling resistance, noise generation, {{and wear}} are all {{determined}} by the interaction process between the rolling automotive vehicle tyre and the road. A deep understanding of the interaction process is needed for optimisation aiming at reducing these effects. Details in the tyre/road contact interface are considered in the presented work; non-linear contact stiffness and adherence forces at the interface are investigated and modelled. A description of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> and especially its tread layer is required for contact modelling. The dynamic responses of smooth and patterned passenger-car tyres are experimentally investigated. Experimental results are used to validate a high-frequency tyre model based on the elastic field equations, which includes the local deformation of the tread. The separation process when tyre tread blocks are rapidly separated from road surfaces is investigated in an experiment. This process is described {{with the aid of}} the total contact force and noise generation. Based on the experimental results, a model for the adherence force as a function of load, load duration, and unloading rate is proposed. Optimisation of the tyre/road interaction including interfacial details requires time-domain contact models including a wide range of length-scales. The strategy is to divide the contact problem into different ranges of length-scales. A model based on statistical description of the contact geometry is used on the smallest length-scales. A tread block in contact with the road surface is modelled on intermediate length-scales, and on the largest length-scales is a contact model of the complete <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> rolling over the road surface. The two latter models use a numerical time-domain contact formulation with a discretised contact geometry. These three models are connected via constitutive relations between contact pressure and relative displacements, incorporated as non-linear springs between the contact elements.

40|$|Tyre/road {{noise is}} the main {{contributor}} to road traffic noise at speeds above 40 km/h for passenger cars and above 70 km/h for heavy trucks. Research {{has been carried out}} during the last thirty years in order to understand and quantify the generation mechanisms responsible for tyre/road noise. However, there is still substantial work remaining until tyre/road noise can be reduced substantially if at all. The work presented in this thesis concerns the modelling the tyre/roads interaction and the resulting vibrations of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure.</b> The model is supposed to calculate the time varying forces when the road roughness is indenting the tyre tread during rolling. To achieve this, a contact model is developed, implemented and validated against measurements. The contact model is formulated in the time domain and considers a three-dimensional contact. An elastic half-space is used as a tool to describe the deformation of the tyre tread, and an iterative algorithm is utilised in order to solve the contact problem for each time step of the calculation. In parallel, an alternative quasi-three-dimensional contact model is also presented. Good agreement of calculated and measured tyre vibrations is found for different tyres and road surfaces. Additionally to the tyre vibrations air-pumping is included in the model {{in the form of the}} local deformations of the tyre tread due to road roughness indenting at the contact patch. The local deformation is believed to be a main contributor to tyre/road noise about 1 kHz. In this work, the local deformation is calculated from the deformation of the elastic half-space used for the contact problem. Preliminary qualitative results shows that the sound radiated due to local deformation dominates above 1 - 2 kHz whereas the sound radiated by the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> vibrations dominates below 1 - 2 kHz. The model developed in this thesis is used to study the coupling between vibration pattern on the tyre and radiated sound. It is shown, that mainly the low order modes are contributing to the radiation and that the coupling between modes with respect to the radiated sound is essential...|$|R
40|$|For {{most modern}} cars at normal driving speeds, tyre/road {{interaction}} {{is a major}} source to the exterior as well as interior vehicle noise. The interaction between a tyre and a road surface generates <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> vibrations, leading to sound radiation into the surrounding air, and to dynamic forces acting on the wheel hub. These forces are transmitted via the suspension system to the car body, resulting in sound radiation into the passenger compartment. To reduce the exterior and interior noise produced by rolling tyres, a deep understanding is required of the physics involved in the excitation, transmission and radiation of <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> vibrations. The focus of this thesis is on modelling of the vibrations on a rolling tyre and their relation to the sound radiation and the forces acting on the wheel hub. To be specific, state-of-the-art simulation tools, involving a tyre model, tyre/road contact model and radiation model, are used to first identify the modes on a tyre responsible for the radiation of sound during rolling. It was found that in the critical frequency range around 1000 Hz, where maximum radiation occurs, the radiation is mainly due to low-order modes. These modes are not {{the ones with the}} strongest excitation around 1 kHz, but have high enough radiation efficiency to dominate the sound radiation. The tyre model is then modified to incorporate the air-cavity and wheel, and used in connection with the contact model to simulate the forces acting on a blocked hub during rolling. It was found that the transmission is strongly influenced by three modes: the radial semi-rigid body mode on the tyre, the first mode inside the fluid cavity and a wheel mode. Further, the spectra of the hub forces are concentrated to the low-frequency range (up to say 250 Hz). Finally, the thesis is also concerned with the extension of an existing contact model for tyre/road interaction to encompass the tangential contact forces. The model is first validated towards an alternative contact formulation found in the literature. Thereafter, a minor parametric study is conducted to see the influence of rolling speed, road surface roughness and longitudinal slip ratio on the total radial and tangential contact force...|$|R
40|$|Recently, tyre-reinforced {{unsealed}} pavements {{had been}} constructed {{in a number}} of sites throughout Australia.

This paper presents the results of preliminary study to confirm these expectations through experimental testing and finite element analyses. In the experimental testing, a box test was used to investigate the performance of a model unsealed pavement, <b>reinforced</b> with a <b>tyre.</b> Surface and subsurface measurements indicate that the tyre and base aggregate worked together and acted as a flexible foundation.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of rolling resistance {{is essential for}} a more environmentally friendly road transportation sector. Both tyre and road design can be utilised to reduce rolling resistance. In both cases a reliable simulation tool is needed which is able to quantify the influence of design parameters on the rolling resistance of a tyre rolling on a specific road surface. In this work a previously developed tyre/road interaction model is extended to account for different tread patterns and for losses due to small-scale tread deformation. Calculated contact forces and tyre vibrations for tyre/road interaction under steady-state rolling are used to predict rolling losses in the tyre. Rolling resistance is calculated {{for a series of}} different tyre/road combinations. Results are compared with rolling resistance measurements. The agreement between simulations and measurements is generally very good. It is found that both the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> and small-scale tread deformations contribute to the rolling losses. The small-scale contribution depends mainly on the road roughness profile. The mean profile depth of the road surface is identified to correlate very well with the rolling resistance. Additional calculations are performed for non-traditional rubberised road surfaces, however, with mixed results. This possibly indicates the existence of additional loss mechanisms for these surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Traffic is a {{major source}} of green house gases. The {{transport}} field stands for 32 % of the energy consumption and 28 % of the total CO 2 emissions, where road transports alone causes 84 % of these figures. The energy consumed by a car traveling at constant speed, is due to engine ineffiency, internal friction, and the energy needed to overcome resisting forces such as aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. Rolling resistance plays a rather large role when it comes to fuel economy. An improvement in rolling resistance of 10 % can yield fuel consumption improvements ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 % for passenger cars and light trucks and 1. 5 to 3 % for heavy trucks. The objective of this thesis is to estimate the power consumption in the tyres. To do this a car tyre is modeled with waveguide finite elements. A non-linear contact model is used to calculate the contact forces as the tyre is rolling on a rough road. The contact forces combined with the response of the tyre is used to estimate the input power to the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure,</b> which determines {{a significant part of the}} rolling resistance. The tyre model accounts for: the curvature, the geometry of the cross-section, the pre-stress due to inflation pressure, the anisotropic material properties and the rigid body properties of the rim. The model is based on design data. The motion of the tyre belt and side wall is described with quadratic anisotropic, deep shell elements that includes pre-stress and the motion of the tread on top of the tyre by quadratic, Lagrange type, homogenous, isotropic two dimensional elements. To validate the tyre model, mobility measurements and an experimental modal analysis has been made. The model agrees very well with point mobility measurements up to roughly 250 Hz. The eigenfrequency prediction is within five percent for most of the identified modes. The estimated damping is a bit too low especially for the antisymmetric modes. Above 500 Hz there is an error ranging from 1. 5 dB up to 3. 5 dB for the squared amplitude of the point mobility. The non proportional damping used in the model is based on an ad hoc curve fitting procedure against measured mobilities. The contact force predictions, made by the division of applied acoustics, Chalmers University of Technology, are based on a non-linear contact model in which the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> is described by its flexibility matrix. Topographies of the surface are scanned, the tread pattern is accounted for, and then the tyre is ’rolled’ over it. The contact forces are inserted into the tyre model and the response is calculated. The dissipated power is then calculated through the injected power and the power dissipated within each element. Results are promising compared to literature and measurements. QC 20101112 </p...|$|R
40|$|Most {{traditional}} tyre models {{concern the}} low and middle frequency ranges. For improved accuracy in tyre/road interaction models {{it is necessary}} to include higher frequencies. Often only the radial direction is included, although the tangential direction may be important, especially studying stick slip motion in the contact between tyre and road surface. Designing accurate and efifcient models requires insight into the behaviour of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> at higher frequencies to make the models as complete as necessary without creating tools that are computationally too costly. To add insight to this area, experimental studies were done on four different tyres with the same internal design but with different tread patterns. Point mobilities were measured and compared with two different tyre models, a two-layer plate model based on the elastic field equations and an orthotropic plate model. The results of this study underline the importance of the local deformation when there are forces that act with small excitation areas on the tread. Adequate consideration of the tread properties in the tyre/road interaction models is thus of extreme importance to obtain the correct local contact force distribution. This is most important for the tangential driving point mobility. Tread patterns are shown mainly to modify the flexural stiffness in comparison to smooth tyres, while block resonances are not expected to be located in the frequency range in which tyre/road noise is important...|$|R
40|$|The tyre cavity {{resonance}} {{has been}} identified as a tonal noise that can be clearly heard inside the vehicle cabin which contributes to the increased level of annoyance. Tyre cavity resonance was analytically studied using impedance compact mobility matrix and statistical energy analysis. Both methods were then combined to form a hybrid analysis which is useful for a vibroacoustic system with material and manufacturing variations (such as tyre) in the mid-frequency range. Mid-frequency range is often defined as the range where they are too high for finite element analysis but too low for statistical energy analysis in order to obtain accurate results. The hybrid solution was shown to be advantageous to Monte Carlo method. The analytical results were supported by the results calculated from vibroacoustic software (VAOne), statistical energy analysis software (AutoSEA) and data from experimental modal tests as well as speaker-microphone response tests. Countermeasure using a multilayer trim attached onto the tyre inner surface was also presented. From the comparison between the analytical, finite element simulation and experimental data results, the tyre cavity resonance characteristics from the assumed physical model and actual tyre showed correlation to strong coupling condition. This study provides a better insight into the coupling condition of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> and cavity {{that could be used to}} understand and solve the problem.

40|$|By {{combining}} {{an advanced}} linear tyre model based on Wave Guide Finite Elements {{with a state}} of the art non-linear and transient contact model it is possible to simulate a tyre rolling on a rough surface. The surface is characterised by roughness scans in parallel tracks along the rolling direction. As output one obtains the time varying contact forces. Based on these contact forces the post-processing allows for calculating for instance the vibrations of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure,</b> the input power through the contact into the tyre (which represents the rolling resistance) or the forces at the hub. Today there is still a lack of understanding how different tyre design parameters influence these rolling resistance and ore tyre/road noise generation. This lack of understanding is a clear hinder for the development of low noise tyre with low rolling resistance. Therefore the intention {{of this paper is to}} contribute to the clarification of this question by investigating which parts of the tyre vibration (expressed as modes and/or waves) are responsible for the sound radiation during rolling? From simple analysis of wave speed on tyre-like structures such as rings or plates, it was rather soon understood that the radiation efficiency of most of the free waves is too low to explain the radiated sound power from rolling tyres. The only exceptions are waves with mainly in-plane motion. However due to the curvature of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> there is a strong coupling between in-plane motion and out of plane motion. Kim and Bolton [1] suggested that these fast waves are potential significant radiators at higher frequencies. However these waves are difficult to excite. In the paper a slick tyre rolling on an ISO and a rough surface is simulated. Based on the calculated contact forces in the time domain the amplitudes of the modes excited during rolling are determined as function of frequency. A boundary element model is then applied to predict the sound pressure level on a reference surface around a tyre placed on rigid ground as function of the modal composition of the tyre vibrations. By taking into account different modes when calculating the vibrational field as input into the boundary element calculations, it is possible to identify individual modes or groups of modes of special relevance for the radiated sound power. The results show that mainly low-order modes with relative low amplitudes but high radiation efficiency in the frequency range between 800 and 1200 Hz are responsible for the radiated sound power at these frequencies, while those modes which are most strongly excited in that frequency range during rolling are irrelevant for the radiated sound power. This fact is in good agreement with earlier hypothesis suggested in [2]. It is also very essential when focusing on the design of quieter tyres. References [1] Y. J. Kim, J. S.

A study of coupled tyre-cavity structural-acoustic system using impedance compact mobility matrix is presented in this paper. This method offers a better physical interpretation and numerical prediction about a coupled tyre-cavity system than previous models. It can calculate the sound pressure inside the tyre cavity as well as the tread wall vibration velocity at the same time. The analytical results have been verified by the results of the VAOne vibro-acoustic model. The VAOne software was also validated by the results from a case study of a rectangular box-cavity system in previous literature. From the analytical calculation, the tyre cavity coupling modal frequency is found to be split into two close resonance frequencies if the tyre structural natural frequency is close to the fluid cavity resonance frequency.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the "green" tyre, silica is more and more used as a <b>reinforcing</b> filler in <b>tyre</b> applications. Silica when compared to carbon black, strongly reduces the rolling resistance of a tyre, which in turn leads to a lower fuel consumption of the car. The disadvantage of the use of silica is the mixing problem in introduces. Due to its polar surface, silica is difficult to mix with a hydrocarbon rubber. The solution for this problem lies in the use of a coupling agent, which shields the polar silica surface on one hand and reacts with the rubber matrix on the other hand. The coupling agent most commonly used ofr these applications in industry is bis(triethoxy-silylpropyl) tetrasuphide (TESPT). The reaction of this coupling agent with the silica surface has been extensively studied by different authors. It is now widely accepted, that one silanol group of the coupling agent after hydrolysis reacts with a silanol group on the silica surface in a primary reaction. This primary reaction is followed by a secondary reaction in which the remaining silanol groups of the coupling agent react with silanol groups of neighbouring coupling agents. The reaction of the coupling agent with the rubber matrix however, has not been studied to such an extent as the reaction with the silica surface and is still not completely understood. The objective of the research was to investigate the reaction of the coupling agent with the rubber matrix, in an attempt to better understand the reinforcement mechanism for silica-filled rubbers. The interaction between silica and rubber via the coupling agent was studied using three different coupling agent systems: variations on TESPT, silane-accelerator combinations and thiophosphoryl compounds. Their effects on processing as well as on dynamic mechanical properties were investigated. 1 H NMR relaxation measurements were used to obtain additional information concering the interaction between rubber and silica filler in presence and absence of a coupling agent. The coupling agent systems selected for investigation were synthesised and characterised. Variations of TESPT were easy to synthesise, while the sysntehsis of silane-accelarator combinations and of thiphosphoryl compounds was more complicated. Fortunately, at least one coupling agent for each selected system could be syntehs 8 ised. The influence of these different coupling agent systems on properties of a silica <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre</b> tread compound was studied. The effect of the sulphur- and carbon chain length of a silane coupling agent showed the importance of the existence of a rubber-reactive functional group in a coupling agent. The length of the sulphur chain of a silane coupling agent like TESPT has a strong influence on the processing behaviour of a silica <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre</b> tread compound, especially on scorch safety. Decreasing the sulphur rank of TESPT from four to two, results in a better scorch safety and therefore a broader processing window, while final properties are comparable to a TESPT reference compound when correction for the reduced amount of sulphur is applied in the curing package. For a sulphur free coupling agent an increase in the length of the carbon chain improves the processing behaviour. Less energy is consumed during mixing when the length of the carbon chain is increased. The Payne effect, which is comonly interpreted as a measure for filler dispersion, is lower for a sulphur free silane, indicating a better filler dispersion. Mechanical properties however, fail when compared to a TESPT reference compound. When sulphur correction is applied in the curing package the tensile properties improve due to an increase in crosslink density, but remain inferior to TESPT. The fact that a sulphur free silane with an equimolar amount of sulphur added to the curing package, still shows inferior tensile properties, compared to TESPT, can be interpreted as the effect of the absence of a chemical link between silica filler and rubber via the coupling agent. In teh presence of a rubber-reactive group in the form of sulphur built-in into the coupling agent, there is a strong indication of the formation of a rubber-to-filler link via the coupling agent. Triethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazole disulphide (TESBD) was investigated as a compound containing a silane and an accelarator functionality. A silica <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre</b> tread compound containing TESBD shows a lower Payne effect, thus indicating a better filler dispersion. The accelerator built into TESBD turns out to be too slow to act as an accelerator for the curing reaction, which is also reflected in inferior mechanical properties of the compound containing TESBD when compared to TESPT. A small amount of amine in the form of DPG turns out to be sufficient to release the accelerator part of TESBD, resulting in properties grossly comparable to TESPT. Diisopropylthiophosphoryltriethoxysilylpropyl monosulphide (DIPTESM) was studied as a coupling agent containing a thiophosphoryl group. The Payne-effect of a DIPTESM-containing silica-reinforced tyre tread compound is far inferior to the TESPT reference compound. This high Payne-effect indicates a less pronounced shielding of the silica surface for DIPTESM, resulting in an inferior silica dispersion compared to the TESPT reference, which is also reflected in the mechanical properties. The release of teh thiophosphoryl accelerator part turns out to be not effective enough to result in an appreciable corsslinking density. Addition of an extra amount of accelerator is still necessary in order to obtain properties comparable to the TESPT reference. The indication above that a rubber-to-filler link is formed via the coupling agent is based on differences in mechanical properties, but could still not be convincingly proven with the techniques applied there. 1 H_NMR T 2 relaxation, which {{has proved to be a}} successful technique for the study of rubber-filler interactions, was therefore used to investigate interactions between Natural Rubber (NR) and pure as well as grafted silica. Different amounts of immobilised NR were found, depending on grafting material on the silica and grafting density. Based on the results described above a lower amount of immoblised NR was expected for a grafting material without a rubber-reactive group, propyltriethoxy silane (PTES). Indeed, using 1 H NMR relaxation measurements, a lower proportion of immobilised NR is found for the PTES-grafted silica. A highter proportion of immobilised NR is measured for the silane-accelerator combination TESBD when compared to TESPT, by 1 H NMR relaxation. The better overall properties of the silane-accelerator combination TESBD compared to TESPT can be interpreted as the result of a higher affinity of TESBD towards the rubber matrix when compared to TESPT. This then explains the higher amount of immobilised NR found for TESBD-grafted silica, when compared to the TESPT-grafted silica. The results of 1 H NMR relaxation point towards the formation of a strong physical or chemical network around the silica surface. Based on the 1 H NMR relaxation measurements no conclusion can be drawn either whether the network is physical or chemical in nature. The effects of the different silane coupling agents investigated, indicate the formation of a chemical network. Admittedly, all techniques add more or less evidence and none of them is fully conclusive. Combining all results gathered it may be stated that they all point to a chemical rather than a physical bond of the coupling agent to the rubber molecule, whereby it forms a chemical bridge between the polar silica and apolar rubber...|$|R
40|$|A new analytical–physical tyre {{model for}} which the {{paternity}} has to be ascribed to Professor Giuseppe Capone was developed at the Department of Mechanical Engineering for Energetics at Naples University ‘Federico II’ {{with the support of}} the Bridgestone Technical Centre Europe. The whole model allows to obtain the road–tyre interactions so it can be used in vehicle dynamic simulations. The model has been named Ph. An. Ty. M. H. A., acronym of ‘PHysical ANalytical TYre Model for Handling Analysis’ and it includes the normal, longitudinal and lateral tyre–road interaction. Considering that Ph. An. Ty. M. H. A. is an analytical ‘deductive’ model, it is necessary to develop it starting just from the normal interaction, described in this paper, and then the other ones will be described in future papers. In fact, the normal interaction, i. e. the relationship between the normal load and the normal deflection, influences the tangential (longitudinal plus lateral) one, which determines the vehicle handling behaviour. The parameters used in this model are physical and geometrical so they can be measured on the real tyre. This property allows to better understand the tyre–road interaction mechanism. The tyre behaviour is modelled by analytical expressions based on equilibrium conditions and geometrical relations. To reproduce the experimental normal interaction and the pressure distribution, once the tyre geometrical quantities are known, it is necessary to identify some parameters, related to the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure,</b> by a comparison with the experimental data. Moreover, the predictive ability of the whole model, combined with a vehicle model, is very careful in analysing the vehicle handling...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{investigation}} into the modelling and simulation of an aircraft tyre and wheel assembly in finite element environment. The finite element simulations basing on aircraft tyre test and operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from tyre and the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different <b>tyre</b> <b>structures,</b> which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 radial ply aircraft test tyre and its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna. The finite element models have been validated with either industrial standardised simulation results or experimental data. Basing on the validated models, simulations that duplicating static test and dynamic operational scenarios have been developed. The researches have provided knowledge in comparing single and double bead tyre designs with respect to wheel loading mechanisms. The computational model also allowed manufacturers to assess the performance and safety criteria of a particular tyre at its design stage. The development of such models would add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing...|$|R
40|$|For vehicle at normal driving {{conditions}} and speeds above 30 - 40 km/h the dominating external noise source {{is the sound}} generated by the tyre and road interaction. Previous measurements have shown {{that there is a}} strong correlation between the radiated sound pressure and the vibrations of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> for frequency below approximately 1 kHz. The tyre vibration is also the main source of noise inside many vehicles in this frequency range. It is thus important to develop simple tools that predict the tyres behaviour in this frequency range. The tyre is modelled as an elemental system, which permits the analysis of the low frequency tyre response when excited by distributed stochastic forces in the contact patch. Although the contact mechanism is generally non-linear, it is assumed here that the tyre is compliant enough for the whole of the contact patch to remain of the same width and to be always in touch with the road. A linear model can then be used to calculate the contact forces from the road roughness and thus calculate the resulting radial velocity of the tyre. A spectral density matrix, derived from a road roughness model, describes the velocities and is used to calculate the expectation of the tyre’s kinetic energy and its sound power radiation. In the first instance a simple two-dimensional model will be used with a Winkler bedding model of the contact patch to predict the power spectral density of the tyre vibration at different road speeds. This model {{can also be used to}} provide an initial estimate of the potential effect of various active control strategies for reducing the tyre vibrations. In particular an optimised feed-forward control formulation can be used to calculate the potential effect of various types of actuators, by calculating the optimal performance with different distributions of secondary force...|$|R

40|$|The road {{transportation}} sector places a severe {{burden on the}} environment {{in the form of}} CO 2 emissions and road traffic noise. Both of these environmental prob- lems can be related to car and truck tyres. In spite of this, {{there is a lack of}} suitable simulation tools for the prediction of rolling noise and rolling resistance and the investigation of the relevant physical processes behind these two quanti- ties. The purpose of this thesis is to establish a simulation framework which allows for the exploration of the underlying physical processes for rolling resistance and rolling noise. For this, an acoustical tyre/road interaction model aimed at calcu- lating rolling noise is extended and combined with a module for the calculation of rolling losses. The proposed tool consists of a waveguide finite element model of the tyre, which is combined with a non-linear three-dimensional tyre/road contact model to simulate the structural dynamics of a tyre rolling under steady-state con- ditions on a real road. Rolling resistance is calculated based on the input power into the tyre while the velocity field on the tyre surface is used to determine the radiated sound pressure based on a boundary element method. Tyre vibrations, rolling noise and/or rolling resistance are calculated for different car and truck tyres and a wide selection of road surfaces. There is good agreement with mea- surements for both quantities, making this the first tool which can be successfully used for the simulation of both rolling resistance and rolling noise. The method is especially suitable for extended parameter studies because of its numerical ef- ficiency. A number of important research questions are investigated. It is shown that rolling resistance can be split into two parts: one part originating from the large-scale <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> deformations, and another part arising from small-scale tread indentations which are highly dependent on road surface texture. An inves- tigation of the free wave propagation on a truck tyre indicates that the structural differences between car and truck tyres lead to some differences in the vibrational behaviour. Additionally, it is investigated how well a certain road surface section is represented by a limited number of road surface scans. It is shown that for most applications and surfaces a minimum number of scan lines from different sample locations are needed if simulation results should be representative of the whole surface...|$|R

40|$|Galileo {{images of}} the Tyre Macula region of Europa at {{regional}} (170 m/pixel) and local (approx. 40 m/pixel) scales allow mapping and understanding of surface processes and landforms. Ridged plains, doublet and complex ridges, shallow pits, domes, "chaos" areas. impact structures, tilted blocks and massifs, and young fracture systems indicate a complex history of surface deformation on Europa. Regional and local morphologies of the Tyre region of Europa suggest that an impactor penetrated through several kilometers of water ice tc a mobile layer below. The surface morphology was initially dominated by formation of ridged plains, followed by development of ridge bands and doublet ridges, with chaos and fracture formation dominating {{the latter part of}} the geologic history of the Tyre region. Two distinct types of chaos have been identified which, along with upwarped dome materials, appear to represent a continuum of features (domes-play chaos-knobby chaos) resulting from increasing degree of surface disruption associated with local lithospheric heating and thinning. Local and regional stratigraphic relationships, block heights, and the morphology of the <b>Tyre</b> impact <b>structure</b> suggest the presence of low-viscosity ice or liquid water beneath a thin (severa 1 kilometers) surface ice shell at the time of the impact. The very low impact crater density on the surface of Europa suggests that this thin shell has either formed or been thoroughly resurfaced in the very recent past...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is devoted to the}} study of mechanism of tyre force generation and its influence on handling dynamics of ground vehicles. The main part of the work involves the development of tyre models for use under steady-state and transient operating conditions. The general capability of these models is assessedin a full vehicle simulation environment. The interaction between tyre and vehicle dynamics is critically evaluated and the observed vehicle behaviour is related to the inherent characteristics of different tyre models. In the field of steady-state tyre modelling, two versions of a numerical tyre model are developed. The modelling procedure is carried out in accordance with the viscoelastic properties of rubber, which influence the mechanical properties of the <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> and {{play a significant role in}} the determination of friction in the tyre contact patch. Whilst the initial simple version of the tyre model assumes a parabolic pressure distribution along the contact, a later more elaborate model employs a numerical method for the calculation of the actual normal pressure distribution. The changes in the pressure distribution as a result of variations in the rolling velocity and normal load influence mainly the levels of self-aligning moment, whilst the force characteristics remain practically unaffected. The adoption of a velocity dependent friction law explains the force generating behaviour of tyres at high sliding velocities. The analysis is extended to the area of transient tyre behaviour with the development of a tyre model appropriate for the study of transient friction force generation within the contact patch. The model incorporates viscoelasticity and inertial contributions, and incorporates a numerical stick-slip law. These characteristics are combined together for the successful simulation of transient friction force generation. The methodologies developed for the modelling of transient friction and steady-state tyre force generation are combined and further extended in order to create a generic transient tyre model. This final model incorporates a discretised flexible viscoelastic belt with inertia and a separate fully-dynamic discretised tread, also with inertia and damping, for the simulation of actual prevailing conditions in the contact patch. The generic tyre model appears to be capable of performing under a variety of operating conditions, including periodic excitations and transient inputs which extend to the non-linear range of tyre behaviour. For the evaluation of the influence of the aforementioned tyre models on the handling responses of a vehicle, a comprehensive vehicle model is developed, appropriate for use in handling simulations. The two versions of the steady-state models and the generic transient model are interfaced with the vehicle model, and the response of the vehicle to a step-steer manoeuvre is compared with that obtained using the Magic Formula tyre model. The comparison between the responses is facilitated by the definition of a new measure, defined as the non-dimensional yaw impulse. It is found that the transience involved in tyre behaviour may largely affect the response of a vehicle to a prescribed input. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Two wastes {{from the}} tyre {{recycling}} industry - the fibers used as <b>reinforcing</b> material and <b>tyre</b> crumbs - were pyrolyzed in two ovens of different configuration. Blends {{with a low}} rank coal and a bituminous waste were also prepared to modify {{the composition of the}} oils obtained from the pyrolysis of the tyre wastes. Elemental analysis, calorific value, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography were used to determine the oil composition. A comparative study taking into account the configurations of the ovens and the raw materials was carried out. The oils produced in the rotary oven were found to be more aromatic and to have lower oxygen contents. Depending on the type of oven and the material used in the co-pyrolysis process it is possible to obtain a fuel-oil with a specific heating value and sulfur content. It is also possible to obtain oil with more than 20 % limonene and 20 % BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene). The amount of aliphatics can be increased by including a coal in the pyrolysis process and the amount of aromatics can be increased by co-pyrolysis with a bituminous waste. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: The {{disposal}} of waste tyres has facing major problems in India. The growing problem of waste tyre disposal in the India can be alleviated if new recycling routes can be found for the surplus tyres. It is estimated that 1. 2 billions of waste tyre rubber produced globally in a year. It is estimated that 11 % of postconsumer tyres are exported and 27 % are sent to landfill, stockpiled or dumped illegally and only 4 % is used for civil engineering projects. Hence efforts {{have been taken to}} identify the potential application of waste tyres in civil engineering projects. In this essence, our present study aims to study the use of waste tyre rubber as tension reinforcement in beam. 6 numbers of beams were cast 3 of them are 10 mm x 15 mm flat size scrap tyre rubber as reinforcement instead of steel in tension zone and other with conventional steel. The experiments were carried out to determine flexural behavior of waste <b>tyre</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete beam on 28 days.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an initial Finite Element (FE) based modelling investigation aimed at supporting {{the development of}} 'smart' tyre or intelligent tyre technologies. Physical tests carried out with a stationary (non-rolling) and rolling experimental tyre are used to enhance understanding of tyre behaviour in the contact patch and validate the modelling methodology. Simulation results with the explicit FE package LS-DYNA are then used to characterise the internal stresses and strains at several positions in the tyre tread. Two separate FE models are developed to simulate the stationary and rolling tyre behaviour at the macroscopic level. The models differ only {{with respect to the}} mesh density in the circumferential direction, the mesh through the cross section is identical. The complex <b>tyre</b> <b>structure</b> is represented as a rubber and reinforced rubber composite, and the mesh specification and the material descriptions used in the models are discussed. The structural behaviour of the stationary experimental tyre under normal load is simulated. The inflation of the tyre, the wheel fit and the normal loading against the horizontal surface are represented. Simulation results are also presented when a subsequent longitudinal or lateral load is applied to the stationary tyre. These analyses were conducted to determine the longitudinal and lateral tyre stifffiesses, respectively. The predicted normal load-deflection characteristics and contact patch dimensions (length and width) are compared with a reasonable degree of success to those obtained in the full-scale physical tests. The longitudinal and lateral simulations also appear to give realistic tyre stiffnesses. The contact patch dimensions give a good trend-wise agreement, but the length and width are greater than the experimental measurements. A parametric study is carried out and this disparity is related to a deficiency in the performance of the contact algorithms. It is concluded that it not straightforward to accurately predict contact patch behaviour, and therefore the internal transient stresses and strains in a rolling tyre in absolute terms. However, the good trend-wise agreement suggests that the modelling methodology should be capable of predicting internal transient responses which are related to the 'actual' deformations in the contact region. To simulate the rolling tyre behaviour on flat bed and drum surfaces, consideration is given to the inflation of the tyre, the wheel fit, the normal loading and the rotation of the tyre. Numerical instabilities are found to occur and these are related to imperfections inherent in version 950 d of the code. This version was, at the time, the most up to date release. The current release is version 960 and it does not contain many of the imperfections in the earlier version. Thus, the flat bed simulation is repeated using the current version. The predicted contact patch stresses are presented and a reasonable correlation is achieved with the experimental data. The internal stresses and strains are then characterised at a number of selected positions in the tread region. These stresses and strains are discussed in context with the development of smart tyre technologies and are useful as a guide to the most appropriate location for an in-tyre sensor (or sensors) ...|$|R
