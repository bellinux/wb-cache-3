25|$|The dates {{presented}} are as {{given by}} Reed. A correspondent in issue 137 of Traction magazine reports some inaccuracies in these dates. For example, the correspondent claims to have seen 828 Magnificent throughout June 1971 and on 4 July 1971 to have seen it hauled dead by NBL type 2 no. 6326 with fire damage and presumed to be heading for withdrawal at Newton Abbot depot. 831 Monarch worked the 16:05 Exeter St David's to Barnstaple service and 17:55 return on 6 October 1971, three days after its supposed withdrawal. 826 Jupiter hauled 808, D819, D822 and 868 on a Newton Abbot to Bristol service on 10 October 1971, being requisitioned at Exeter on its return run to haul the 16:05 Barnstaple service owing to a severe locomotive shortage. 812 is {{claimed to have been}} in use long after 3 November 1971 and although 810 Cockade was withdrawn on 4 November 1971 it was reinstated on the 7th. On that same day, the correspondent notes 814 in use to power a convoy of 832 and 812 to Plymouth Laira depot where 814 was finally withdrawn, with 812 remaining in traffic. The situation with 832 is unclear because of its transfer to the technical department at Derby. The final four Warships of either kind (Class 42 or 43) in BR traffic were thus 810, 812, 821 and 824. 812 was in use on express passenger duties as late as 28 November 1972, over a year since its purported withdrawal. The last four locomotives were officially removed from capital stock on 3 December 1972; 821 Greyhound hauled an afternoon Bristol to Plymouth parcels train on that day, being almost certainly the last BR Warship-hauled <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lady Windsor Colliery {{closed on}} 26 March 1988, and after removal of stockpiled coal, the last mineral train ran on 20 May 1988; on 15 October 1988 an enthusiasts' special train ran to Lady Windsor, the last <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train</b> on the line.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the first}} part of their railway to Nylstroom was still being built, the PPR {{employed}} the Portuguese on construction work and general service. The locomotive had the honour to haul the first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train</b> between Pretoria and Nylstroom in July 1898.|$|E
50|$|Kitsons {{were busy}} during World War I but trade dropped {{off in the}} 1920s. The {{experimental}} Kitson-Still 2-6-2T steam diesel hybrid locomotive, combining steam power with internal combustion, was tested on the London and North Eastern Railway between York and Hull. This hauled <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>trains</b> for the LNER but Kitson's {{could not afford to}} develop it into a commercially viable form. The high research and development costs contributed to the demise of Kitson's.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>revenue-earning</b> tilting Shinkansen <b>train</b> was the N700 series, {{introduced}} in 2007.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{operated}} two <b>revenue-earning</b> freight <b>trains</b> in May 2007 which carried 6-metre-long pipes from Kidderminster to the Severn Trent water handling {{plant at}} Trimpley. Carriage by road of such long pipes {{would have been}} difficult because of the narrow roads in the immediate area of Trimpley.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was returned}} to Sydney in 1912 and in 1914 was shifted to Goulburn, where it hauled trains to Queanbeyan. On 25 May 1914 locomotive 1210 hauled the first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train</b> into Canberra. This was the coal train that served the main Canberran electricity generation station.|$|E
50|$|ETL's {{first major}} {{operation}} began in 2010 when, ETL's newly refurbished Class 86/7s, 86701 and 86702, entered traffic on 15 October 2010. Two {{days later the}} pair hauled their first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train,</b> a private charter for First GBRf from Newcastle to London on 17 October. They later went on to work in Winter 2009/2010 as the Royal Mail standby services and had several operations as the Network Rail's standby icebreaker locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 2 August 1886. The two {{ends of the}} line met at Otaihanga on 27 October, and the last spike was driven at a public {{ceremony}} by Governor William Jervois on 3 November 1886 before {{more than a thousand}} people. The first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train,</b> a stock train from Longburn to Johnsonville with 355 sheep and 60 head of cattle had run on 30 October.|$|E
50|$|The {{approval}} of the Board of Trade inspecting officer was required to open the line for passenger traffic, {{and there were a}} succession of shortcomings in the arrangements at Maesaraul and on the Cowbridge Railway. Nevertheless, by 16 January 1865 a Taff Vale engine was run through from Pontypridd to Cowbridge and a <b>revenue-earning</b> mineral <b>train</b> ran through on 30 January 1865. The Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway was passed for passenger traffic on 29 August 1865.|$|R
50|$|No 6024 {{was bought}} for £4,000 in 1974, but, {{like many of}} the other {{remaining}} locomotives, was missing significant components, including: its double-chimney (currently fitted to No. 6000); piston, connecting and eccentric rods; and its slide-bars had been cut through.The 36th locomotive to be rescued from Barry, No. 6024 was moved to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at Quainton Road. After 16 years, including the creation of the Club100 funding initiative, on 2 February 1989, No. 6024 moved again under its own power. Re-commissioned on 26 April 1989 by HRH the Duke of Gloucester, in October 1989 the engine was moved by low-loader from Quainton Road to the Birmingham Railway Museum, from where it completed its mainline test runs. On 15 April 1990, it resumed its mainline career hauling <b>revenue-earning</b> passenger <b>trains.</b>|$|R
2500|$|R761, {{operated}} by Steamrail Victoria, and R707, {{operated by}} 707 Operations Incorporated, are both operational. Both locomotives have since restoration {{in the mid-1980s}} hauled many special passenger trains for enthusiasts to various destinations on Victoria's remaining [...] network. Prior to the privatisation of V/Line in the 1990s, {{it was not uncommon}} to see R 707, 761 or 766 hauling normal <b>revenue-earning</b> V/Line passenger <b>trains</b> as a crew training exercise. R 707 has been named [...] "City of Melbourne" [...] in preservation.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train</b> ran on 17 March 1851 over a short {{section of}} line to Kinneil Iron Works; {{the line was}} still {{in the hands of the}} {{contractor}} at this time. However the line between Bo'ness High Junction and Bo'ness Harbour opened fully in early August 1851, with the low level line being opened on 22 December 1851. In the intervening period, all through traffic travelled via the E&GR connections, including the backshunt there. for goods and mineral traffic only.|$|E
50|$|One {{month after}} {{finishing}} the 'farewell special', Clan Line {{was bought by}} the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society from BR for the sum of £3,850. The Group had wanted 35022 Holland America Line, but it was sent to Barry to be scrapped before they could purchase it, so the Group purchased Clan Line instead. (35022 Holland America Line would eventually be preserved and is now owned by Royal Scot Locomotive & General Trust.) Clan Line {{was one of the}} first preserved locomotives to participate in steam specials, and in 1974 hauled its first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train</b> in preservation from Basingstoke to Westbury.|$|E
5000|$|The next section, Paremata to Paekakariki, proved {{difficult}} - {{it included}} six tunnels built against a steep cliff face, {{and a large}} swamp outside a township {{to be known as}} Plimmerton. Rails reached Pukerua Bay in 1885, where a temporary tramway was constructed below No. 13 tunnel to allow goods and passengers to be transhipped to a stagecoach to Foxton. Material for the construction of the tunnels between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay were unloaded at a makeshift wharf constructed in Brendan's Bay. Meanwhile, rails were within two miles of Waikanae in the north by 25 September, with a service from Otaki connecting the two railheads. The laying of the line from Pukerua Bay to Paekakariki was completed on 4 October 1886, and on 27 October the lines from Waikanae and Paekakariki met at Otaihanga. The first <b>revenue-earning</b> <b>train,</b> a stock train from Longburn to Johnsonville with 355 sheep and 60 head of cattle, was on 30 October.|$|E
