5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down and two at the Cincinnati 24-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Cincinnati committed an offsides penalty, giving the Hokies fiveyards and a first down. From the Bearcats' 19-yard line, Taylor completed a two-yard pass. On the next play, Taylor attempted to <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> with the ball, but fumbled before recovering the loose football. Now facing third down, Taylor scrambled 18yards to the goal line for Virginia Tech's first touchdown of the game. The extra point kick by Keys was good, and with 13:00 remaining in the quarter, the game was tied at 7–7.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} started advancing {{towards the}} village, the 8th Squadron on the left, and the 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> {{while the rest}} of the squadron covered them. The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade and ran out of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's covering force reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, decided to call it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they turned back and also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|Under new Head Coach Wim Jansen, Celtic had to {{negotiate}} two qualifying rounds {{to qualify for}} the first round proper of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Welsh Inter Cabel-Tel were comfortably disposed of 8–0 on aggregate, but the next qualifying round against Tirol Innsbruck proved more difficult. An abysmal first leg performance in Austria was salvaged only by a late Alan Stubbs free kick, Celtic losing 21 on the night but netting a valuable away goal. The return match in Glasgow was an exciting see-saw affair. Celtic twice took the lead in the first half, only for Innsbruck to equalise on each occasion, their second goal an own goal by Henrik Larsson just before half-time. Goals in the second half from Simon Donnelly and Craig Burley put Celtic ahead on aggregate, but Gernot Krinner's header on 82 minutes levelled the tie on aggregate and gave the Austrians the advantage because of the away goals rule. But Celtic responded with three minutes to go, Wieghorst showed excellent skill in the penalty box to control Donnelly's knockdown before shooting in. With the match going into injury time and the tie poised on a knife-edge, Larsson went on a mazy <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> before passing to Burley who scored from close range to clinch a 63 win on the night to progress on aggregate. Celtic were then drawn against Liverpool in the first round proper.|$|E

25|$|Players can {{run with}} the ball in any {{direction}} they want. However they cannot use a teammate to obstruct the opposition. This occurs when they run around or into {{one of their own}} players and in the process prevent a defender from tackling them. Defending teams can also run anywhere they want {{as long as they do}} not start from an offside position. Offside lines are behind the last foot at a ruck, maul or tackle or five and ten metres back from scrums and lineouts respectively. If the ball is kicked, players from the kicking team cannot <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> until they have been passed by the kicker or someone behind the kicker.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{originally}} featured two vehicles, each with three rows of four seats and one row of three seats {{for a total}} of 15 riders per vehicle. Both vehicles were built to only <b>run</b> <b>forward.</b> After the ride was refurbished in 2010, new [...] "streamlined" [...] vehicles with the Superman logo were introduced. The new vehicles were designed with low-profile sides to enhance the open-air feeling. Although they are wider, the row of the three seats in the older vehicle was reduced to two, resulting in a lower total of 14 riders per vehicle. Both of the new trains were configured to run backwards, though they were designed to <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> as well. It was reported that the park would eventually run one side forward to give riders a choice, but both trains have remained facing backward.|$|E

500|$|Magness-Blake {{said one}} of the most {{dangerous}} parts of Thunder's job is at the beginning of the game when he leads the team onto the field, as there are cheerleaders ahead of him waving their pom-poms and a team of excited football players behind him. Ann Judge has also remarked about the team getting [...] "amped up" [...] with energy and excitement as Thunder leads them onto the field, explaining that [...] "To him, amped up means danger." [...] On one occasion, a person walked out unexpectedly in front of Thunder as he was leading the players onto the field. [...] Thunder stopped immediately, averting a potentially dangerous situation. Another unexpected event occurred in 2014 during Super Bowl XLVIII when the pyrotechnics display was supposed to have been executed before Thunder led the team out but it went off unexpectedly during his run. [...] Thunder responded to the situation with aplomb, continuing to <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> onto the field, though he performed flying lead changes with each explosion.|$|E
500|$|The Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory {{created the}} r-CLIPER (rainfall {{climatology}} and persistence) model {{to act as}} a baseline for all verification regarding tropical cyclone rainfall. [...] The theory is, if the global forecast models cannot beat predictions based on climatology, then there is no skill in their use. [...] There is a definite advantage to using the forecast track with r-CLIPER because it could be run out 120hours/5days with the forecast track of any tropical cyclone globally within a short amount of time. [...] The short range variation which uses persistence is the Tropical Rainfall Potential technique (TRaP) technique, which uses satellite-derived rainfall amounts from microwave imaging satellites and extrapolates the current rainfall configuration forward for 24hours along the current forecast track. [...] This technique's main flaw is that it assumes a steady state tropical cyclone which undergoes little structural change with time, which is why it is only <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> for 24hours into the future.|$|E
500|$|The battle {{commenced}} in {{the early}} morning with several assaults on the Confederate left flank by the I Corps and the XII Corps. [...] After these failed, the II Corps, including the Irish Brigade, was called upon to assault a position near the Confederate center known as the [...] "Sunken Road" [...] or [...] "Bloody Lane." [...] The trench-like road afforded the Confederates a strong defensive position. [...] Just after 9a.m., Maj. Gen. Israel B. Richardson's division, with the Irish Brigade in the lead, moved toward the Sunken Road. [...] Meagher envisioned the delivery of a few volleys from the brigade followed by an impetuous charge. [...] As the Irish Brigade advanced up the crest toward the Sunken Road, it took heavy fire from the Confederates. [...] The progress of the brigade was slowed by a sturdy split rail fence. [...] When Meagher asked for volunteers to <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> and take it down, Corporal Samuel C. Wright of the 29th sprang forward with several others. [...] Wright recalled that many were shot down before they reached the fence and, as [...] "one would grasp a rail, it would be sent flying out of his hands by rifle shots." [...] The dash back to the lines was just as dangerous. [...] Cpl. Wright was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery at Antietam. [...] He would, over the course of successive battles, be wounded five times and reported dead twice. [...] Despite his travails, he survived the war.|$|E

500|$|While Montgomery {{was making}} his advance, Arnold {{advanced}} with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at {{the northern end of}} the lower town. [...] They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected. [...] However, as the advance party moved around the Palace Gate, heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them. [...] The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders' fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to <b>run</b> <b>forward.</b> They advanced down a narrow street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade. [...] As he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade, Arnold received a deep wound in the leg from a musket ball that apparently ricocheted, and was carried to the rear after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan. Under Morgan's command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town. A British force of 500sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city. With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10am.|$|E

Ottoman reinforcements were also seen by the ANZAC Mounted Division headquarters at Neby Kunda and reported to the attacking regiments.

2500|$|The Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14–17 July) {{was planned}} as a joint attack by XV and XIII Corps, whose troops would {{assemble}} in no man's land in darkness and attack at dawn after a five-minute hurricane bombardment. Haig was sceptical {{of the plan}} but eventually accepted the views of Rawlinson and the corps commanders, Lieutenant-General Henry Horne and Lieutenant-General Walter Congreve. Preparatory artillery bombardments began on 11 July and {{on the night of}} [...] British troops advanced stealthily across no man's land, which in parts was [...] wide, to within [...] of the German front line and then crept forward. At [...] the hurricane bombardment began and the British began to <b>run</b> <b>forward.</b> On the right flank, the 18th (Eastern) Division (Major-General Ivor Maxse), captured Trônes Wood in a subsidiary operation and the 9th (Scottish) Division (Major-General William Furse) was repulsed from Waterlot Farm but on the left got into Delville Wood. The 21st, 7th and 3rd Division on the left (northern) flank, took most of their objectives. By mid-morning [...] of the German second position had been captured, cavalry had been sent forward and the German defenders thrown into chaos.|$|E
2500|$|Full-backs usually {{position}} themselves several metres behind the back line. They field any deep opposition kicks {{and are often}} {{the last line of}} defence should an opponent break through the back line. On attack, they can enter the back line, usually near the centres or wings, with the aim of providing an extra person and overlapping the defending players. Three of the most important attributes of a good full-back are good catching ability under a high kick, the ability to punt the ball a long distance with accuracy and the speed and skill to join in back line attacking moves, especially counter-attacks. The full-back is the player most likely to field the high ball or [...] "up and unders" [...] kicked by the opposition. Good hands are needed to ensure the ball is caught cleanly to deny the opposition the chance to regain possession. As the full-back will inevitably catch the ball deep in their own territory with little support from their own players, they should either kick the ball downfield or <b>run</b> <b>forward</b> to link up with their backs to start a counter-attack. If the full-back kicks the ball out, the opposition have the line-out whereas if they start a counter-attack they have a number of options.|$|E
