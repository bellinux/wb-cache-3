50|$|One of {{the future}} {{activities}} of the institute will be to investigate nerve cells and their connections in the cerebral cortex {{that are responsible for}} the reception and processing of signals from the sense organs, (i.e. smell, sight, and taste) with the use of molecular genetic, physiological and imaging techniques. Scientists are particularly interested in the nature of synapses, the contact points between nerve cells in the neural network. How information is stored and retrieved in synapses, how new synapses are formed, and how superfluous synapses are removed are all topics of investigation. Research will involve the development of new genetic engineering techniques, so that the activity of the key molecules involved in <b>rapid</b> <b>information</b> transmission between nerve cells by the synapses can be regulated. There are plans to miniaturise multiquantum microscopy and improve the level of penetration to measure activity in the cerebral cortex of freely moving mice.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the processing of}} verbal and nonverbal auditory stimuli using an event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study to reveal the neural underpinnings of <b>rapid</b> temporal <b>information</b> processing and it's relevance during speech perception. In the context of a clustered sparse-temporal fMRI data collection eight right-handed native German speakers performed: (i) an auditory gap detection task; and (ii) a CV syllable discrimination task. A tone perception task served as a nontemporal control condition. Here we aimed to research to what extent the left hemisphere preferentially processes linguistically relevant temporal information available in speech and nonspeech stimuli. Furthermore, we sought to find out as to whether a left hemisphere's preference for linguistically relevant temporal information is specifically constrained to verbal utterances or if nonlinguistic temporal information may also activate these areas. We collected haemodynamic responses from three time points of acquisition (TPA) with varying temporal distance from stimulus onset to gain an insight on the time course of auditory processing. Results show exclusively left-sided activations of primary and secondary auditory cortex associated with the perception of <b>rapid</b> temporal <b>information.</b> Furthermore, the data shows an overlap of activations evoked by nonspeech sounds and speech stimuli within primary and secondary auditory cortex of the left hemisphere. The present data clearly support the assumption of a shared neural network for <b>rapid</b> temporal <b>information</b> processing within the auditory domain for both speech and nonspeech signals situated in left superior temporal areas...|$|R
