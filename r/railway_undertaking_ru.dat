40|$|A {{freight wagon}} {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} enterprise resources of a <b>railway</b> <b>undertaking</b> (<b>RU)</b> or an operator in the setting of a highly competitive transport market. Therefore as a primary concern anyoperator aims for an efficient fleet management, which is a necessary condition of the positive financial results of the enterprise. This paper emphasizes the importance of an effective information tool for managing the wagon fleet, based on the precise transport orders, wagon positions, and a network-wide coverage. Then it introduces IS ÚDIV as an example of a successful implementation of this tool within the environment of ČD Cargo with positive effects for its productivity. At the same time, it underlines the significance of a fundamental technological process reengineering in the field of the dispatching control, which is a necessary prerequisite of the successful implementation...|$|E

The first section to be completed was the 51.4 km section from P'yŏngsan to Chihari, which was opened to traffic in 1962, whilst the rest of the route, 89.9 km from Chihari to Sep'o Ch'ŏngnyŏn, was opened in October 1972.|$|R

50|$|Edward Betts's first <b>railway</b> <b>undertaking</b> was to {{supervise}} {{the building of the}} Dutton Viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway for Hugh McIntosh under George Stephenson as engineer. After the death of McIntosh in 1840, William Betts & Sons—the family firm now named for Edward and his father—gained contracts on the South Eastern Railway for stretches that included the Marsden-Ashford line, Maidstone Branch, and the Saltwood tunnel. They also obtained large contracts on behalf of David McIntosh for the Midlands County Railway, whereby the Betts family relocated to Leicester, and for the Manchester-Birmingham Railway. After that, Betts continued to gain contracts, especially in the Chester area.|$|R

30|$|The act stipulating railway {{reconstruction}} {{from natural}} disaster has a so-called “deficit contingency.” In case an operator {{as a company}} faces a series of operational deficits in three years prior to a disaster, the state and prefecture (or municipality) aid 50 % of the reconstruction costs. A new rule is set so that {{the reconstruction of the}} publicly-owned rail infrastructure is fully publicly financed. However, if an infrastructure owner as a company generates profits in the last years, the state aid is not provided. As the <b>railway</b> <b>undertaking</b> in charge of (2) and (3) do not make such deficits in the previous years thanks to income generated from Tokyo and Shinkansen, no state or prefectural aid was provided.|$|R
