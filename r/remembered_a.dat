5|$|Berg's third book Lindbergh, {{a highly}} {{anticipated}} biography of aviator Charles Lindbergh {{was published in}} 1998, becoming a New York Times Best Seller, and winning the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. In 2003 Berg published Kate <b>Remembered,</b> <b>a</b> biography-cum-memoir about his friendship with actress Katharine Hepburn that received mixed reviews. His biography of Woodrow Wilson was published in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Carte {{became the}} {{business}} {{manager of the}} Royalty Theatre, {{under the direction of}} his client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's La Périchole. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He <b>remembered</b> <b>a</b> libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called Trial by Jury. Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, Cox and Box, had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for Trial by Jury. Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. Trial by Jury, a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning La Périchole, and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, The Vendor of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan <b>remembered</b> <b>a</b> promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E

Within three years of her birth, Lucille had moved with her parents from Jamestown to Anaconda, Montana, and later to Trenton. While DeDe Ball was pregnant with her second child, Frederick, Henry Ball contracted typhoid fever and died in February 1915.

25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects.

Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

But it was the Oscar-nominated script for Teacher's Pet (1958) for which they are best <b>remembered,</b> <b>a</b> film about a self-made {{newspaper}} editor Clark Gable who has a love-hate relationship with journalism teacher Doris Day. The film almost did not get made since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday that producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

[...] Impressed with his first exposure to lithography, and frustrated with the lack of opportunities to have his cartoons published, Bengough asked himself, [...] "Why not start a weekly comic paper with lithographed cartoons?" [...] His brother Thomas <b>remembered</b> <b>a</b> somewhat different story in which Bengough first began distributing copies of his cartoons on the street.

500|$|In September 1868, {{together}} with his legal team, the Claimant went to South America to meet face-to-face with potential witnesses in Melipilla who might confirm his identity. He disembarked at Buenos Aires, ostensibly to travel to Valparaíso overland and there rejoin his advisers who were continuing by sea. After waiting two months in Buenos Aires he caught a ship home. His explanations for this sudden retreat—poor health and the dangers from brigands—did not convince his backers, many of whom withdrew their support; Holmes resigned as his solicitor. Furthermore, on their return his advisers reported {{that no one in}} Melipilla had heard of [...] "Tichborne", although they <b>remembered</b> <b>a</b> young English sailor called [...] "Arturo".|$|E
500|$|When Dickens {{was young}} he lived near a tradesman's {{premises}} with the sign [...] "Goodge and Marney", {{which may have}} provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner. For the chained Marley, Dickens had <b>remembered</b> <b>a</b> visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by—seeing fettered prisoners. For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written. The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.|$|E

However, Yentob had no great enthusiasm for Our Friends in the North, as he <b>remembered</b> <b>a</b> meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that Our Friends in the North was about [...] "post-war social housing policy." [...] As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce Our Friends in the North personally. George Faber was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC.

500|$|From 1998 to 2000, Berg wrote Kate <b>Remembered,</b> <b>a</b> biography-cum-memoir {{detailing}} his 20-year {{friendship with}} the Hollywood actress Katharine Hepburn. The book was published on July 11, 2003, only 12 days after Hepburn's death. It spent 11 weeks on the New York Times Nonfiction Best Seller list, but received uneasy critical response. In The New York Times, Robert Gottlieb called it an [...] "odd and unsettling book [...] a sense of exploitation", and gossip columnist Liz Smith, a friend of Hepburn's, called Berg [...] "vain and narcissistic", and declared the book [...] "elf-promoting fakery....Hepburn would have despised it and his betrayal of her friendship." [...] Berg responded in a written statement, {{saying that he was}} [...] "truly shocked at Liz Smith's professional behaviour — or, more accurately, her lack thereof" [...] in [...] "her personal assault on my reputation, one that stops just short of character assassination".|$|E

[...] ("I have loved, does it mean that I have stolen?"). The song was converted into a ghazal and subsequently recorded. At that time, since there was no technology to provide for the reverberation of sound heard in the song, Naushad had Mangeshkar sing the song in a studio bathroom. Some sources state that a chorus of a hundred singers supported singer Mohammed Rafi for the song [...] "Ae Mohabbat Zindabad", though other sources place the number at a thousand.|$|E
