40|$|Two {{methods of}} added {{resistance}} calculation are briefl y presented, one developed by Faltinsen, {{and the other}} by Salvesen. Both {{are based on the}} Salvesen, Tuck and Faltinsen linear strip theory, as they use it to defi ne the wave induced motions. The fi rst one obtains the added resistance by direct pressure integration, while the second one involves the potential fl ow solution. Also, as a third method, an empirical approximation of the Salvesen method for the short wave lengths region is included. The calculations of added resistance due to waves were performed according to the chosen methods for four different ships: two containerships, a bulk carrier and a <b>ro-ro</b> <b>vessel.</b> The results are presented graphically, with the comparison to experimental results for the available cases...|$|R
