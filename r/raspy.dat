5|$|The next {{scenes were}} the El Rancho nightclub scenes {{and the scene}} in which Susan {{attempts}} suicide. Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For these scenes Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give her voice a harsh, <b>raspy</b> tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and <b>raspy</b> and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, <b>raspy,</b> or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
50|$|In {{this series}} the {{personality}} {{differences between the}} two are more pronounced, with Chip as the responsible, no-nonsense leader and Dale as the goofy, laid back free spirit. Additionally, they wear clothes in this series which reflect their personalities; Chip wears a leather jacket and fedora (much like Indiana Jones), while Dale wears a Hawaiian shirt (much like Magnum, P.I.). Also, Corey Burton gave Dale a slightly <b>raspier</b> voice not heard in any incarnations before.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} called a [...] "...high-energy radio-rock {{with a taste for}} ‘80s flash..." [...] by Altpress writer Matt Crane and stated that the music video {{promoting}} the song [...] "feels like a night out in Vegas—at one of the cheap casinos". Crane also believes {{that as a result of}} Worsnop's vocal strain from performing with his former band Asking Alexandria it has enabled him to sing with more <b>raspier</b> 'rock' vocals.|$|R
50|$|Faithfull's {{immediately}} preceding albums, Dreamin' My Dreams and Faithless, {{had been}} in a relatively gentle folk or country and western style. Broken English was a radical departure, featuring a contemporary fusion of rock, punk, new wave and dance, with liberal use of synthesizers. After years of cigarette smoking, Faithfull's voice was in a lower register, far <b>raspier,</b> and had a more world-weary quality than in the past that matched the often raw emotions expressed in the newer songs.|$|R
5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained <b>raspy</b> throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
25|$|Voice {{difficulties}}, {{such as a}} <b>raspy</b> voice, a {{voice that}} is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.|$|E
25|$|Hart had a {{noticeable}} accent {{which included a}} very <b>raspy</b> voice and unique way of speaking which he was well known for, according to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter so is Hart the most imitated man in professional wrestling, with practically everyone in the industry having tried a Stu Hart impersonation.|$|E
50|$|He {{also has}} an optimistic and easygoing {{personality}} that others usually find appealing, {{and he does not}} appear to stay depressed or downbeat for very long. He is quite modest, and this often works to his advantage when compared to the other, often more egotistical and aggressive, characters on the series. Zack's voice also gets <b>raspier</b> as the series progresses. In the episodes Voices of Authority and Atonement, Zack reveals his ongoing irritation with finding uniforms that fit properly.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Michael Toland of The Austin Chronicle {{described the}} album as [...] "one boot in balmy progressive folk {{and the other}} in frigid black metal" [...] with [...] "some of its prettiest, most haunted acoustic textures and heaviest, <b>raspiest</b> roars". Kim Kelly of Spin stated that the band's [...] "blackened sound" [...] is [...] "more pronounced than ever" [...] while describing the production as [...] "impeccable: Agalloch have never sounded so rich, so full".|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on May 12, 2016 that Anselmo would be fronting a new band, Scour, with members from Pig Destroyer (John Jarvis), Cattle Decapitation (Derek Engemann), Animosity (Chase Fraser) and Strong Intention (Jesse Schobel). The band's debut EP was released July 15, 2016 on Anselmo's label Housecore Records, featuring six songs all below 3 minutes in length. The band is stylistically black metal, {{with the exception}} of Anselmo's use of lower growling instead of the higher, <b>raspier</b> vocals commonly associated with the genre.|$|R
25|$|Black metal, {{also related}} to thrash metal, has emerged at the same time, with many black metal bands taking {{influence}} from thrash metal bands such as Venom. Black metal continued deviating from thrash metal, often providing more orchestral overtones, open tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, shrieked or <b>raspy</b> vocals and pagan or occult-based aesthetics to distinguish itself from thrash metal. Thrash metal with stronger punk elements is called crossover thrash. Its overall sound is more punk-influenced than traditional thrash metal, but has more heavy metal elements than hardcore punk and thrashcore.|$|E
25|$|Silk is {{produced}} by several insects, but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars {{has been used for}} textile manufacturing. There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level. Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects such as webspinners and <b>raspy</b> crickets produce silk throughout their lives. Silk production also occurs in Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges. Other types of arthropod produce silk, most notably various arachnids such as spiders.|$|E
25|$|To achieve proper {{intonation}} {{and sound}} quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings {{tends to be}} quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a <b>raspy</b> tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called shimming. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.|$|E
5000|$|Female mallard ducks {{make the}} classic [...] "quack" [...] sound while males make a similar but <b>raspier</b> sound that is {{sometimes}} written as [...] "breeeeze", but despite widespread misconceptions, most species of duck do not [...] "quack". In general, ducks make {{a wide range}} of calls, ranging from whistles, cooing, yodels and grunts. For example, the scaup [...] - [...] which are diving ducks [...] - [...] make a noise like [...] "scaup" [...] (hence their name). Calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls.|$|R
50|$|In November 1989, {{five months}} after the release of No One Can Do It Better, Curry was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. Driving home from a party, he fell asleep at the wheel and his car veered off the freeway. Curry, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown out the rear window, slamming face first into a tree. His injuries required 21 hours of plastic surgery, and he spent 2½ weeks in the hospital. He couldn't speak for about a month, and he was left with a different, <b>raspier</b> voice.|$|R
5000|$|Spencer Owen, {{writing for}} Pitchfork Media, {{felt that this}} album [...] "represents a venture into actual melody, at least more so than they've {{attempted}} before", likening the result to a [...] "malfunctioning machine that suddenly becomes aware of its existence." [...] Tiny Mixtapes' Tamec explained that the [...] "closest comparison for this music is an arrhythmic Don Caballero with someone moaning and gasping over top of it.". John Fail writing for Fakejazz writes that vocalist Al Johnson has [...] "created another impenetrable mess of words, delivered {{in a voice that}} gets <b>raspier</b> with each record." ...|$|R
25|$|Vysotsky {{accompanied}} {{himself on}} a Russian seven-string guitar, with a <b>raspy</b> voice singing ballads of love, peace, war, everyday Soviet life and of the human condition. He was largely perceived {{as the voice of}} honesty, at times sarcastically jabbing at the Soviet government, which made him a target for surveillance and threats. In France, he has been compared with Georges Brassens; in Russia, however, he was more frequently compared with Joe Dassin, partly because they were the same age and died in the same year, although their ideologies, biographies, and musical styles are very different. Vysotsky's lyrics and style greatly influenced Jacek Kaczmarski, a Polish songwriter and singer who touched on similar themes.|$|E
25|$|The Smoker is a boil-covered {{creature}} with six long tongues that it uses to ensnare and drag a survivor back to himself. It may then either attack the survivor directly, allow the horde to attack him, {{or leave the}} survivor suspended over a cliff or roof-edge. The Smoker only releases its victim if a teammate shoves the ensnared survivor, if the tongue is shot, the survivor is killed, or upon the Smoker's death, which results in an explosion that leaves a vision-obscuring cloud. Smokers have <b>raspy</b> voices and frequently wheeze and cough, presuming {{that they may have}} been an avid smoker before becoming an Infected. A 2-note low piano cue signals the Smoker.|$|E
25|$|The male's song {{consists}} of short pleasant warbling strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles. The individual phrases may go like tu-tu-krr-pree-pree or trr-turit trr-turit.... To announce {{that it has}} become aware of someone straying into its territory – be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal – it gives long shrill <b>raspy</b> whistles like trrii(u) or (t')kwiiet. To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like trüü(t). These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as chlie(p), gihrrr, kwä or wuut. These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship. The song becomes softer and more warbling as the male shows the female around his territory, and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing fluting tli-tli, prrr trills and kwiw...püh calls.|$|E
5000|$|The Edge plays {{electric}} guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on [...] "40" [...] and [...] "Race Against Time") and lap steel guitar. Detailed gear diagrams of The Edge's U2 guitar rig for the 1981 [...] "October" [...] Tour and the 1983 [...] "War" [...] Tour are well-documented. Key to {{his signature}} sound are {{the use of}} modulated delays, namely a Korg SDD-3000 delay unit made in the early 80's, {{as well as a}} special Herdim guitar pick, which Edge holds upside down to expose the [...] "dimples" [...] when hitting the guitar strings to achieve a <b>raspier</b> chime.|$|R
5000|$|Moore {{was a heavy}} smoker, which contributed {{his voice}} growing <b>raspier</b> over the years. Even as he aged and sported graying hair, he {{continued}} to be a popular figure. He kept busy, hosting the 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 10 p.m. newscasts and producing periodic hour-long documentaries under the name The Moore Report, for which the station won many prestigious accolades. 1984's [...] "Hollow Victory: Vietnam Under Communism" [...] won a George Foster Peabody Award. The documentary was made after the station spent {{a year and a half}} negotiating a 35-day visa to visit the country.|$|R
5000|$|At times, {{the only}} edge {{comes from the}} 47-year-old singer's voice, now <b>raspier</b> than ever. However, hairs are invited to stand up on necks during Silence, which begins as the sort of exquisitely {{assembled}} song about loneliness that David McAlmont, say, would kill for, before somehow turning into a scarf-waving anthem. The other standout is Weight of My Mistakes, which mixes contemplative lyrics with an upbeat tune so catchy it requires surgical removal. However, elsewhere, there's too much polished, overwrought, formulaic slop, with You Get Me's line about a [...] "beautiful song you've heard a million times" [...] containing more than a hint of irony.|$|R
25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright <b>raspy</b> timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E
500|$|The golden white-eye makes {{a variety}} of calls. The song is a long <b>raspy</b> warble, {{rendered}} as [...] "séé mé-can you séé mé-I can séé yóú-can you séé mé". The species also makes rasping shorter calls and whistles when in flocks and in flight. Chicks give plaintive whistles when begging for food from adults.|$|E
500|$|Bob Peterson as Roz, a slug-like monster with a <b>raspy</b> voice {{reminiscent}} of Selma Diamond's who administrates for Scarefloor F where Sulley, Mike, and Randall work. At {{the end of}} the movie, it is revealed that Roz is [...] "agent number 1" [...] of the CDA, and has worked undercover at Monsters, Inc. {{for two and a half}} years.|$|E
5000|$|This vocal {{mechanism}} {{has been}} only recently elucidated and shown {{to be similar to}} the chant practiced in Tibet by the Gyuto monastery and other Buddhist orders. [...] There are two types of Kargyraa: Dag (mountain) and Xovu (steppe). The Dag style is deeper and has more nasal effects, while Xovu is <b>raspier</b> and sung at a higher pitch with more throat tension and less chest resonance. [...] There are also the distinctive kargyraa styles of Vladimir Oidupaa and Albert Kuvezin, the latter also bearing the name kanzat. This is sometimes described as the howling winds of winter or the plaintive cries of a mother camel after losing her calf.|$|R
2500|$|Gunnar Graps' singing {{style was}} {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} style James Hetfield of Metallica used to have, which was essentially trying to sing from the throat to produce a <b>raspier</b> sound. A very busy schedule contributed {{to the development of}} his signature rasp. It was not uncommon for Graps to perform even 3 shows per day and 25 days in a month. He was still able to produce very high notes, as is evident from his songs and Jesus Christ Superstar song [...] "Gethsamen", which is included on the Gunnar Graps – Eesti kullafond 4. He is known to have trained his voice by yelling at walls; he usually did it before going on stage.|$|R
50|$|Weiland's {{vocal and}} musical style {{proved to be}} versatile, {{evolving}} constantly throughout his career. At the peak of Stone Temple Pilots' success {{in the early to}} mid-1990s, Weiland displayed a deep, baritone vocal style that was initially closely compared to that of Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder. However, as STP continued to branch out throughout its career, so did Weiland's vocal style. The band's third album, Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop, had Weiland singing in a much higher, <b>raspier</b> tone to complement the band's more 60's rock-influenced sound on that album. Later albums showcased Weiland's influences ranging from bossa nova on Shangri-La Dee Da to blues rock and classic rock on the band's 2010 self-titled album.|$|R
500|$|According to musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was not {{comfortable}} with being recorded for posterity and tried {{to shy away from}} it. On an apparently separate visit from the one related above, Block asked the composer to play something on a piano or at least say something. Tchaikovsky refused. He told Block, [...] "I am a bad pianist and my voice is <b>raspy.</b> Why should one eternalize it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Real is Queen's only {{record with}} a Parental Advisory label. The album departs from the lyrical content characterizing Queen's musical style, {{detailing}} hood life in Puerto Rico and love. It alternates musically between reggaetón and hip hop, experimenting with electronica, funk, dancehall, pop, R, and acoustic ballads. The wide range of styles and musical exploration earned Real [...] mainly positive reviews from critics. Many praised Queen's <b>raspy</b> vocals and production quality, whilst others criticized the lack of [...] instrumentation.|$|E
500|$|The session {{featuring}} Gaye led to {{an argument}} between the producer and singer. Whitfield wanted Gaye to perform the song in a higher key than his normal range, a move that had worked on David Ruffin during the recording of the Temptations' hit, [...] "Ain't Too Proud to Beg". The mixture of Gaye's <b>raspy</b> vocals and the Andantes' sweeter harmonies made Whitfield confident {{that he had a}} hit; however, despite approval from Motown's Quality Control Department, Gordy blocked the release.|$|E

5000|$|A {{prototype}} {{version of}} Grover appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in a Christmas Eve appearance in 1967. This puppet had greenish-brown fur {{and a red}} nose. He also had a <b>raspier</b> voice, and was played a bit more unkempt than Grover would later behave. The monster {{was referred to as}} [...] "Gleep", a monster in Santa's workshop. He later made a cameo appearance in The Muppets On Puppets in 1968 with the Rock and Roll Monster. In 1969, clad in a necktie, he appeared in the Sesame Street Pitch Reel in the board room sequences. During the first season of Sesame Street, the character was nicknamed [...] "Fuzzyface" [...] or [...] "The Hairy One", though neither would be used for his actual name.|$|R
