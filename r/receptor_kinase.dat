5|$|The {{receptor}} for AtPep1 {{has been}} identified as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 nano-molar (nM) concentrations and the receptor saturates at 1nM. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} AtPEPR1 receptor has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in A. thaliana which includes the receptor for another peptide hormone CLAVATA3. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with AtPEPR1 allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response. BRI1-associated <b>receptor</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in A. thaliana, which has been proposed to function as an adaptor protein that is required for the proper functioning of other RLKs. Yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that AtPEPR1 and its closest analog, AtPEPR2, interact with BAK1.|$|E

To address the need for cell-based assays for screening and studying the selectivity of Trk kinase modulators, we developed high-throughput cell-based assays for Trk <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> using nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) betalactamase reporter lines stably expressing full length human Trk kinases.

40|$|A {{key feature}} of innate {{immunity}} {{is the ability}} to recognize and respond to potential pathogens in a highly sensitive and specific manner. In plants, the first layer of defense is induced after recognition by pattern recognition receptors of microbe-associated molecular patterns. This recognition elicits a defense program known as pattern-triggered immunity. Pathogen entry into host tissue is a critical early step in causing infection. For foliar bacterial pathogens, natural surface openings such as stomata, are important entry sites. Stomata in contact with bacteria rapidly close and can thus restrict bacterial entry into leaves. The molecular mechanisms regulating stomatal closure upon pathogen perception are not yet well understood. Plant lectin <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> are thought to play crucial roles during development and in the adaptive response to various stresses. Although the function of most plant lectin <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> is still not clear, a role for this kinase family in plant innate immunity is emerging.

40|$|In metazoans, <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> control many {{essential}} processes {{related to}} {{growth and development}} and response to the environment. The <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> in plants and animals are structurally similar but evolutionarily distinct and thus while most animal <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> are tyrosine <b>kinases</b> the plant <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> are classified as serine/threonine kinases. One of the best studied plant <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> is BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI 1), which functions in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Consistent with its classification, BRI 1 was shown in early studies to autophosphorylate in vitro exclusively on serine and threonine residues and subsequently numerous specific phosphoserine and phosphothreonine sites were identified. However, several sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation have recently been identified establishing that BRI 1 is a dual-specificity kinase. This raises the paradox that BRI 1 contains phosphotyrosine but was only observed to autophosphorylate on serine and threonine sites. In the present study, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine (and presumably serine) residues is a post-translational modification, ruling out a co-translational mechanism that could explain the paradox. Moreover, we show that in general, autophosphorylation of the recombinant protein appears to be hierarchal and proceeds in the order: phosphoserine > phosphothreonine > phosphotyrosine. This may explain why tyrosine autophosphorylation was not observed in some studies. Finally, we also show that the juxtamembrane domain of BRI 1 is an activator of the kinase domain, and that kinase specificity (serine/threonine versus tyrosine) can be affected by residues outside of the kinase domain. This may have implications for identification of signature motifs that distinguish serine/threonine kinases from dual-specificity kinases...|$|R

While the interaction between integrin and <b>receptor</b> tyrosine <b>kinases</b> originally was thought of as uni-directional and supportive, recent studies indicate that integrins have additional, multi-faceted roles in cell signaling.

In addition, developmentally relevant <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases</b> have different interactions dependent upon whether located at the PD PM or the cellular PM.

40|$|Early {{conception}} of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and <b>receptor</b> tyrosine <b>kinase</b> (RTK) signaling pathways was that each represented distinct and linear modules that converged on downstream targets, such as p 42 /p 44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

40|$|SummaryPlants use <b>receptor</b> <b>kinases,</b> such as FLS 2 and EFR, to {{perceive}} bacterial pathogens and initiate innate immunity. This immunity is often suppressed by bacterial effectors, allowing pathogen propagation. To counteract, plants have evolved disease resistance genes that detect the bacterial effectors and reinstate resistance.
