5|$|The Know Nothings' main {{political}} issue was nativism, but Daniels remained {{focused more on}} prohibition. In 1857, he promoted a law permitting the local option, which would let individual counties in the state chose whether to enact prohibition of alcohol within their borders, {{but it did not}} pass. That year he was elected to a four-year term in the Maryland Senate. He resigned part-way through his term, in 1858, to practice law in Baltimore. Two years later, he married Ellen Young Guiteau, daughter of a Congregational minister. By 1864, Daniel had joined the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> <b>That</b> year, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention, which produced the Maryland Constitution of 1864.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Ulysses S. Grant began on March 4, 1869, {{when he was}} inaugurated as the 18th President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office {{in the aftermath of}} the Civil War, and he presided over much of the Reconstruction Era. A Republican, Grant became president after defeating Democrat Horatio Seymour in the 1868 presidential election. He was reelected in 1872 in a landslide victory, overcoming a split in the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the formation of the Liberal Republicans, which nominated Horace Greeley to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican Rutherford B. Hayes after the contested 1876 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|Pinchot {{launched}} {{a series of}} public attacks to discredit Ballinger and force him from office in {{what became known as}} the Pinchot–Ballinger controversy. That episode hastened the split in the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> led to the formation of the Progressive Party, of which Pinchot and his brother were top leaders.|$|E
50|$|When the Spanish Civil War broke out, {{he joined}} the army and asked {{to be sent to}} the front as a soldier.

50|$|As Fagot {{loved his}} farming land as well {{homeland}} he became intensely interested in politics. His {{love for his}} people led him to found a new political party: Partido Popular Ponceño. Through his party he formed a coalition between the Socialist and <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> <b>that</b> led him to winning the 1924 elections and become mayor of Ponce.|$|R
25|$|On 12 September 1956, he {{established}} and became chairman of <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> was in direct conflict with Muslim League, mainly due to disagreement {{on the idea}} of republicanism and conservatism. Unable to keep the substantial pressure on Mirza's Republic Party eventually led the Muslim League's successful demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Muhammad Ali on 12 September 1956.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its white middle class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities from the evangelical Christian vote (including Southern pockets of traditionalist Roman Catholics as in South Louisiana), which had been nonpolitical before 1980. The national Democratic Party's support for liberal social stances such as abortion drove many former Democrats into a <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> was embracing the conservative views on these issues. Conversely, liberal Republicans in the northeast began to join the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1969, Rove entered the University of Utah, on a $1,000 scholarship, as a {{political}} science major and joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Through the University's Hinckley Institute of Politics, he got an internship with the Utah <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> <b>That</b> position, and contacts from the 1968 Bennett campaign, helped him land a job in 1970 on Ralph Tyler Smith's unsuccessful re-election campaign for Senate from Illinois against Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson III.|$|E
50|$|The two Folha {{newspapers}} criticized {{mainly the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> <b>that</b> monopolized power back then; the newspapers campaigned for social improvement. The company {{was involved in}} founding the Democratic Party, an opposition group. However, in 1929, Olival Costa, by then sole proprietor of the Folhas, mended his fences with the São Paulo Republicans, and broke his links to opposition groups connected to Getúlio Vargas and his Aliança Liberal.|$|R

25|$|In 1892, Taylor was {{positioned}} {{to play a}} major role as an Independent Republican. He, along with Frederick Douglass and Charles Ferguson, carried recommendations from Black Independent Republicans to the Platform Committee of the National <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> <b>That</b> committee rejected all of their recommendations, and Taylor, in response, published a scathing “National Appeal, addressed to the American Negro and the Friends of Human Liberty.” That “Appeal” effectively ended any role that he might have hoped to play within the state or national party.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of a compromise government between the more right wing Liberals and the more moderate conservatives, as manifested in the constitutional monarchy, the lack of development and further notable reforms in the country led the more left wing Liberal party, made up mostly of middle class partisans, to reformulate its policy objectives. Thus was born a <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> advocated radical liberal reforms such as universal suffrage, the end of the privileges of the Catholic Church and rents given to the nobles, and above all, the overthrow of a political elite discredited by its corruption and incompetence. The country went into debt and was increasingly dependent on the northern provinces of the country. The humiliation of submitting to the ultimatum of 11 January 1890 issued by Great Britain, an allied nation, was undoubtedly a cathartic episode. Britain demanded that Portugal surrender what are now Zambia and Zimbabwe and abandon its plans to acquire lands in this part of Africa that it needed to connect Angola and Mozambique.|$|E
500|$|Seward gave a major {{speech on}} January 12, 1861. By then, {{he was known}} to be Lincoln's choice as Secretary of State, and with Lincoln staying silent, it was widely {{expected}} that he would propound the new administration's plan to save the Union. Accordingly, he spoke to a crowded Senate, where even Jefferson Davis attended despite Mississippi's secession, and to packed galleries. He urged the preservation of the Union, and supported an amendment such as the one he had introduced, or a constitutional convention, once passions had cooled. [...] He hinted that New Mexico Territory might be a slave state, and urged the construction of two transcontinental railroads, one northern, one southern. [...] He suggested the passage of legislation to bar interstate invasions such as that by John Brown. Although Seward's speech was widely applauded, it gained a mixed reaction in the border states to which he had tried to appeal. Radical Republicans were not willing to make concessions to the South, and were angered by the speech. Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, a radical, warned that if Lincoln like Seward ignored the Republican platform and tried to purchase peace through concessions, he would retire, as too old to bear the years of warfare in the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> would result.|$|E

50|$|The {{elections}} were historic for the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> in <b>that</b> it captured {{the majority of}} both chambers of the Alabama Legislature {{for the first time}} in 136 years. The <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> also swept all statewide races on the 2010 ballot.|$|R
2500|$|On May 25, 2006, Boehner {{issued a}} {{statement}} defending his agenda and attacking his [...] "Democrat friends" [...] such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters [...] "have a choice between a <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 interview, Wallace {{said that}} he planned to vote for Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential election, commenting, [...] "He's a good man. His wife is a born-again Christian woman and I believe he is too." [...] He also {{revealed}} that he had voted for George H. W. Bush, another Republican, in 1992. His son, George Wallace Jr., officially switched from the Democratic to the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> same year. Wallace himself declined to officially identify as either a Republican or a Democrat. But he added, [...] "The state is slowly going Republican because of Clinton being so liberal." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, the {{transition}} from traditional party conventions to the modern presidential primary was still in progress, and only sixteen states and the District of Columbia held primaries for the 1964 election. Despite Johnson's very real doubts about running, his candidacy was never in question to the general public. Indeed, in several states, [...] "unpledged delegates" [...] was the only option on the ballot for the Democratic primary. Amid a <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>that</b> struggled to find a candidate and the protests of African Americans over civil rights, the Democratic primaries received relatively scant national attention outside Wallace's entry into the race.|$|E

In 2013, the Senate passed the bill with 68 votes. Flake described why he believed that it had been possible to create a bipartisan group of senators to address immigration problems. He said: [...] "Pretty quickly we determined that everybody around that table wanted to do this. We weren't looking to score political points." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although both major {{political}} parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American colors of red, white, and blue in their marketing and representations, since election night 2000, blue has become the identifying color for the Democratic Party, while red has become the identifying color for the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> <b>That</b> night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: blue states for Al Gore (Democratic nominee) and red states for George W. Bush (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party. This is contrary to common practice outside of the United States where blue is the traditional color of the right and red {{the color of the}} left. For example, in Canada, red represents the Liberals, while blue represents the Conservatives. In the United Kingdom, red denotes the Labour Party and blue symbolizes the Conservative Party. Blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts—ActBlue, BuyBlue, BlueFund, as examples—and by the party itself in 2006 both for its [...] "Red to Blue Program", created to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the midterm elections that year, and on its official website.|$|E

6000|$|When {{we speak}} of coercion, we do not mean violence, but only the {{assertion}} of constituted and acknowledged authority. Even if seceding States could be conquered back again, {{they would not be}} worth the conquest. We ask only for the assertion of a principle which shall give the friends of order in the discontented quarters a hope to rally round, and the assurance of the support {{they have a right to}} expect. There is probably a majority, and certainly a powerful minority, in the seceding States, who are loyal to the Union; and these should have that support which the prestige of the General Government can alone give them. It is not to the North nor to the <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> the malcontents are called on to submit, but to the laws and to the benign intentions of the Constitution, as they were understood by its framers. What the country wants is a permanent settlement; and it has learned, by repeated trial, that compromise is not a cement, but a wedge. The Government did not hesitate to protect the doubtful right of property of a Virginian in Anthony Burns by the exercise of coercion, and the loyalty of Massachusetts was such that her own militia could be used to enforce an obligation abhorrent, and, as there is reason to believe, made purposely abhorrent, to her dearest convictions and most venerable traditions; and yet the same Government tampers with armed treason, and lets I dare not wait upon I would, when it is a question of protecting the acknowledged property of the Union, and of sustaining, nay, preserving even, a gallant officer whose only fault is that he has been too true to his flag. While we write, the newspapers bring us the correspondence between Mr. Buchanan and the South Carolina [...] "Commissioners;" [...] and surely never did a government stoop so low as ours has done, not only in consenting to receive these ambassadors from Nowhere, but in suggesting that a soldier deserves court-martial who has done all he could to maintain himself in a forlorn hope, with rebellion in his front and treachery in his rear. Our Revolutionary heroes had old-fashioned notions about rebels, suitable to the straightforward times in which they lived,--times when blood was as freely shed to secure our national existence as milk-and-water is now to destroy it. Mr. Buchanan might have profited by the example of men who knew nothing of the modern arts of Constitutional interpretation, but saw clearly the distinction between right and wrong. When a party of the Shays rebels came to the house of General Pomeroy, in Northampton, and asked if he could accommodate them,--the old soldier, seeing the green sprigs in their hats, the badges of their treason, shouted to his son, [...] "Fetch me my hanger, and I'll accommodate the scoundrels!" [...] General Jackson, we suspect, would have accommodated rebel commissioners in the same peremptory style.|$|E
