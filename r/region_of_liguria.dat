5|$|Alboin moved west in his march, invading the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liguria</b> (north-west Italy) and {{reaching}} its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3, 569, {{only to find}} it already abandoned by the vicarius Italiae (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with {{the administration of the}} diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius Italiae to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.|$|E
25|$|The Alpinorum and Ligurum cohorts were {{originally}} raised {{from the many}} small tribes that inhabited the western Alps, i.e. the later provinces of Alpes Graiae, Alpes Cottiae Alpes Maritimae and {{the western part of}} Raetia. Alpini appears to be a generic term for natives of the northwestern Alps i.e. the western part of Raetia and the Alpes Graiae (those of the eastern Alps appear to be called Montani). Ligures in its broad sense included all the Ligurian peoples of NW Italy, SE Gaul and the western Alps, including inhabitants of the eponymous <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liguria,</b> which Augustus designated the IX regio (administrative district) of Italia. The latter, however, were by this time Roman citizens, and would have been recruited into the legions. The Ligurum cohorts, therefore, would have been recruited from the Alpine Ligures, who were peregrini (non-citizens) i.e. the inhabitants of the Alpes Cottiae and Alpes Maritimae.|$|E

25|$|The Ligures {{are said}} to {{have been one of the}} oldest populations in Italy and Western Europe, {{possibly}} of Pre-Indo-European origin. According to Strabo they were not Celts, but later became influenced by the Celtic culture of their neighbours, and thus are sometimes referred to as Celticized Ligurians or Celto-Ligurians. Their language had affinities with both Italic (Latin and the Osco-Umbrian languages) and Celtic (Gaulish). They primarily inhabited the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liguria,</b> Piedmont, northern Tuscany, western Lombardy, western Emilia-Romagna and northern Sardinia, but are believed to have once occupied an even larger portion of ancient Italy as far south as Sicily.

40|$|An extreme event, {{which caused}} the {{absolute}} maximum in the yearly peak discharge time {{series of the}} Dora Baltea River (Aosta Valley) for the period 1925 - 1995 together with the absolute maximum of hourly rainfall at Genoa, is analysed. The storm affected the Italian <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liguria</b> and northwestern Piedmont in September 1993. Synoptic scale "forcing", orographic effect, above normal sea surface temperatures and convection are considered as main meteorological factors contributing to the hydrogeological "disaster". On {{the basis of the}} examined case, nature and "scale" of the various factors involved are discussed, including the possible feedbacks of convection (either dynamic or thermodynamic). Finally some considerations about the development of a warning system for these extreme events are presented...|$|R
