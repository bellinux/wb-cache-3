25|$|The {{above-mentioned}} dishes {{have developed}} a distinctively Argentine nuance. That is why, for example, Argentine pasta includes {{a wide variety of}} dishes ranging from spaghetti, fusiles (fusilli), ñoquis (gnocchi), <b>ravioli,</b> cintas (pasta ribbons), and lasagne to the Argentine-made sorrentinos, agnolottis (agnolotti), canelones (cannelloni), and fetuchines (fetuchini).|$|E
25|$|Daria got {{its first}} {{popularity}} {{thanks to the}} advertising campaign, in which five billboards in St. Petersburg and two in Moscow showed an image of female buttocks covered with flour and the caption Your favorite pelmeni!. In another commercial there was a phrase From these raviolek you’ll get stomach cramps, which caused <b>Ravioli</b> company dissatisfaction. In return they used a phrase Daria, shoo! in their advertisement campaign.|$|E
25|$|Unique {{city and}} {{regional}} cuisine reflecting various immigrant groups include toasted <b>ravioli,</b> gooey butter cake, provel cheese, the slinger, the Gerber sandwich, the St. Paul sandwich, and St. Louis-style pizza, featuring thin crust and provel cheese. Some St. Louis chefs have begun emphasizing use of local produce, meats and fish, and neighborhood farmers' markets {{have become increasingly}} popular, {{as well as one}} downtown. Artisan bakeries, salumeria, and chocolatiers also operate in the city.|$|E
25|$|Pelmeni {{and other}} frozen foods were {{produced}} under {{the brand name}} Daria, named after the daughter of Oleg Tinkoff. A Greek called Athanasius, who distributed <b>ravioli</b> production equipment in Russia, gave Tinkoff this idea while in the sauna. Production was launched in early 1998 in Peterhof and in the beginning it made products under the trademark Smak under license from Andrey Makarevich company. After the conflict with the licensor, the brand name changed to Smak St. Petersburg. Economic crisis was the reason to create its own brand: the new brand helped increase the market share. The new plant, which opened in December 1998, {{at the site of}} a former Technoshock warehouse on Predportovaya street in St. Petersburg, originally produced only Daria. In addition, Tinkoff made products under the brands of Tolsty kok, Dobry product and Tsar-batyushka.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of unusual dishes, Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson's simple, modern {{interpretation}} of Italian classics. Among the most popular dishes is the quail egg <b>ravioli,</b> which has been on the menu since day one. [...] Considered the restaurant's signature dish, it consists of a single <b>ravioli</b> stuffed with quail egg yolk and laced with truffle butter. [...] Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce, and many dishes feature organic ingredients. [...] However, The Local Beet (a website that promotes eating locally grown food) questioned Schwa's commitment to the principle, noting the use of out-of-season strawberries and peas. Most dishes are served with purées.|$|E
500|$|After Schwa closed, {{about ten}} {{different}} Chicago restaurant owners {{offered to help}} Carlson get back on his feet. Carlson declined their help, but reopened Schwa four months later in mid-February 2008, {{thanks in part to}} a cash infusion from his father. [...] He hired an additional chef, allowing him to focus more of his attention on the dining room. The menu was redone, with only the three most popular dishes – the quail egg <b>ravioli,</b> the jellyfish pad Thai, and the [...] "pine cone" [...] dessert – returning. [...] The decor was also tweaked. [...] Customers with old, unfulfilled reservations were given the opportunity to try the new Schwa before new reservations were accepted.|$|E

The rest of the book follows the basic pattern of the earlier works, with chapters on soups, fish, meat, vegetables and sweets, {{with the addition of}} extra subjects relevant to Italian food, pasta asciuta, <b>ravioli</b> and gnocchi, rice, and Italian wine.

500|$|Unlike its two predecessors, Mediterranean Food and French Country Cooking, David's Italian Food (1954) drew {{little from}} {{anything}} {{she had already}} written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the manuscript. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her prose, and interspersed the recipes with her own essays and introductions to the various sections.

500|$|Michael Winner {{visited the}} {{restaurant}} {{a couple of}} days after opening for The Times while dining with Michael Caine. Winner found that the hotel's entrance to the restaurant was still under refurbishment, and that the service was sub par with items being dropped by their waiter. Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course of pot roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes with parsley, [...] "as good a main course as I have ever eaten, and I had the sense to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood." [...] He called the desserts [...] "to die for", and stole Caine's dessert to eat in addition to his own. John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of <b>ravioli</b> of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit. He referred to the desserts as [...] "red-fruit heaven".|$|E

2500|$|It {{was praised}} {{as early as}} 1348 in the {{writings}} of Boccaccio; in the Decameron, he invents a 'mountain, all of grated Parmesan cheese', on which 'dwell folk that do nought else but make macaroni and <b>ravioli,</b> and boil them in capon's broth, and then throw them down to be scrambled for; and hard by flows a rivulet of Vernaccia, the best that ever was drunk, and never a drop of water therein.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Pelmeni {{belong to}} the family of dumplings.

They are not {{dissimilar}} to Chinese potstickers, Tibetan mo-mo and Italian <b>ravioli,</b> as well as the Manti of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz cultures. [...] The main difference between pelmeni and other kinds of dumplings is in their shape and size — the typical pelmen' is roughly spherical and is about 2 to 3cm in diameter, whereas most other types of dumplings are usually elongated and much larger.|$|E
2500|$|One of Foley's {{earliest}} acting roles was in 1996. Shortly {{before he}} left for Stamford, Foley appeared in Atlanta filmmakers Barry Norman and Michael Williams' short subject Deadbeats as [...] "Bird", an armed robber turned debt collector. One of Foley's first TV guest appearances was as a wrestler on USA Network's short-lived action-comedy G vs E. He also featured prominently in the documentary Beyond the Mat. Foley, as Mankind, also starred in a series of commercials for Chef Boyardee's beef <b>ravioli.</b> He appeared in the Insane Clown Posse vehicle Big Money Hustlas as Cactus Sac, which was basically the same character as his Cactus Jack persona.|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times {{describes}} Carlson's cooking {{style as}} [...] "New American", but Carlson himself prefers the description [...] "unstressed food." [...] "What's {{most important is}} that everyone ... has an incredible time," [...] he says. [...] One of Carlson's favorite cooking techniques is to make ingredients that people normally would not tolerate into something palatable. [...] He is known to combine ingredients in bizarre ways, such as pairing oysters with oatmeal and raisins. Despite these wild dishes, Carlson is {{perhaps best known for}} his simplistic, modern interpretations of classic Italian dishes. His quail egg <b>ravioli</b> is considered his signature dish. [...] The one element that ties all Carlson's dishes together is fat. [...] "Fat carries flavor really well," [...] he explains.|$|E
2500|$|Pasta is also {{widespread}} in the Southern Cone, as well {{most of the rest}} of Brazil, mostly pervasive in the areas with mild to strong Italian roots, such as Central Argentina, and the eight southernmost Brazilian states (where macaroni are called macarrão, and more general pasta is under the umbrella term massa, literally [...] "dough", together with some Japanese noodles, such as bifum rice vermicelli and yakisoba, which also entered general taste). The local names for the pasta are many times varieties of the Italian names, such as ñoquis/nhoque for gnocchi, ravioles/ravióli for <b>ravioli,</b> or tallarines/talharim for tagliatelle, although some of the most popular pasta in Brazil, such as the parafuso ("screw", [...] "bolt"), a specialty of the country's pasta salads, are also way different both in name and format from its closest Italian relatives, in this case the fusilli.|$|E
2500|$|Common restoranes or restaurantes and rotiserias (grill restaurants) nearly {{anywhere}} in Argentina today serve (into the small hours) quickly prepared meals {{that in the}} course of the 20th century came to be known as minutas, [...] "short-order dishes." [...] Some of the dishes included in the category of minutas are milanesas, churrascos, bifes (beefsteaks), escalopes, tallarines, ravioles (<b>ravioli),</b> ñoquis (gnocchi), although some are very typical of locations that sell food: [...] "bifes" [...] and [...] "milanesas" [...] are served [...] "a caballo" [...] ("on horseback", with fried egg on top), [...] "milanesa completa" [...] (a milanesa with two fried eggs and French fries), [...] "revuelto Gramajo", [...] "colchón de arvejas" [...] (an omelette made with peas), [...] "suprema de pollo" [...] (chicken supreme, usually breaded as a milanesa), matambres, [...] "lengua a la vinagreta" [...] (pickled tongue), and [...] "sandwiches" [...] (sandwiches de miga) are made with sliced white bread, rather than, say, rolls.|$|E
2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create <b>ravioli,</b> tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E
2500|$|Pumpkins {{that are}} still small and green may be eaten {{in the same way}} as squash or zucchini. [...] In the Middle East, pumpkin is used for sweet dishes; a {{well-known}} sweet delicacy is called halawa yaqtin. In South Asian countries such as India, pumpkin is cooked with butter, sugar, and spices in a dish called kadu ka halwa. Pumpkin is used to make sambar in Udupi cuisine. In Guangxi province, China, the leaves of the pumpkin plant are consumed as a cooked vegetable or in soups. In Australia and New Zealand, pumpkin is often roasted in conjunction with other vegetables. In Japan, small pumpkins are served in savory dishes, including tempura. In Myanmar, pumpkins are used in both cooking and desserts (candied). The seeds are a popular sunflower seed substitute. In Thailand, small pumpkins are steamed with custard inside and served as a dessert. In Vietnam, pumpkins are commonly cooked in soups with pork or shrimp. In Italy, it can be used with cheeses as a savory stuffing for <b>ravioli.</b> Also, pumpkin can be used to flavor both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.|$|E
