40|$|Spatial {{dependency}} of paraspinal muscle {{activity was}} assessed using a new two-dimensional MMG recording system. MMG signals were detected over {{the left and right}} paraspinal muscles of 10 volunteers using a grid of 12 accelerometers. During two separate trials subjects maintained a 20 degrees flexed position and held loads that ranged from 0 to 15 kg (in 2. 5 kg increments) for 20 s; and 7. 5 kg for 6 min. Maps of absolute and normalised (with respect to initial <b>values)</b> average <b>rectified</b> <b>value,</b> <b>mean</b> power frequency, variance and skewness of the power spectral density were obtained from the two-dimensional MMG recordings. For both the short duration and sustained contractions, the MMG absolute average <b>rectified</b> <b>value,</b> <b>mean</b> power frequency, variance and skewness depended on accelerometer location (P < 0. 05), while, {{with the exception of the}} skewness (P < 0. 05), normalised values did not. These results demonstrate both inhomogeneous MMG absolute activity and homogeneous MMG normalised activity in paraspinal muscles for short duration and sustained contractions. Moreover, the effect of accelerometer location on spectral variables confirmed the limited validity of general relationships between MMG spectral changes and motor unit recruitment strategies. This study underlines the importance of using multiple recording sites when assessing back muscle activity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Limited knowledge is available on doses received indirectly by organs, during diagnostic procedures. In the present study, the radiation dose to the lens of the eyes was measured from various Computerized Axial Tomography protocols for head and trunk imaging. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure organ doses in an anthropomorphic Rando Alderson phantom. The unwanted (non-useful) radiation doses delivered to the eye lens during Computerized Axial To-mography examination of head, facial bone, orbits, abdomen, chest, pelvis, neck, nasopharynx, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and sacroiliac joint were as-sessed. The following results are obtained: head scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 74 mGy; facial bone scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 03 mGy; orbital scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 61. 51 mGy; abdomen scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 76 mGy; chest scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 03 mGy; pelvis scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; neck scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 1. 81 mGy; nasopharynx scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 8. 56 mGy; cervical spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 6. 15 mGy; lumber spine scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 46 mGy; and sacroiliac joint scans, <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> 0. 35 mGy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{extended}} <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> E(r, s;x, y) play {{an important}} role in theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and theory of inequalities, and even in the whole math-ematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. Its study is not only interesting but important, both because most of the two-variable <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are special cases of E(r, s;x, y), and because it is challenging to study a function whose formulation is so indeterminate. In this expositive article, we summarize the recent main results about study of E(r, s;x, y), including definition, basic properties, monotonicities, compar-ison, logarithmic convexities, Schur-convexities, generalizations of concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>values,</b> applications to quantum, to theory of special functions, to es-tablishment of Steffensen pairs, and to generalization of Hermite-Hadamard’s inequality. 1. Definition and expressions of the extended <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> The histories of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> and inequalities are long [9]. The <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are related to the <b>Mean</b> <b>Value</b> Theorems for derivative or for integral, which are the bridge between the local and global properties of functions. The arithmetic-mean-geometric-mean inequality is probably the most important inequality, and certainly a keystone of the theory of inequalities [2]. Inequalities of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> are one of the main parts of theory of inequalities, they have explicit geometric meanings [14]. The theory of <b>mean</b> <b>values</b> plays an important role in the whole mathematics, since many norms in mathematics are always means. 1. 1.
