40|$|Fattening {{pheasants}} for {{the production}} of quality meat is a relatively recent development. With its high protein and low fat content, meat <b>of</b> <b>pheasant</b> is a highly nutritious food whose value exceeds that of broiler chickens meat. Despite the fact that the intensive rearing <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> has developed relatively quickly in recent years, information on the fattening capabilities and slaughter values <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> is often insufficient in the current literature. The length of the fattening period also differs in the literature and reported from 13 to 20 weeks while highest weight gains <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> to occur between 4 and 12 weeks of age. Growth <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> is also reflected in the weight and dimensions of internal organs, crop, oesophagus, gizzard and intestine grow up to 12 weeks of age, after which they develop their physiological ability. The structure, weight and length of the digestive tract and other internal organs <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> depend on housing system, gender and nutrition. Relatively few investigations were conducted to determine the influence of feed additives on fattening performance <b>of</b> <b>pheasants.</b> One <b>of</b> the possibilities is the use of humic acids in nutrition pheasant.

Based on the research conducted in our country and abroad, {{we have come to}} the conclusion that heteracidosis, along with coccidiosis, syngamosis, and ascaridiosis present one of the most significant parasite diseases in these birds. Heteracidosis in pheasants is caused by Heterakis isolonche and H. gallinarum.

40|$|In Italy the {{maintenance}} {{and the increase}} <b>of</b> wild <b>pheasant</b> populations is mainly obtained in small-Protected Areas (PA) suitable for wildlife reproduction. In these areas {{a part of the}} resident population is regularly captured and transferred to the hunting zones in the winter time. The aim of the study is to determine the right number <b>of</b> <b>pheasant</b> to be removed from this protected area without causing damage and thus maintaining a balance in the resident population. Since 2000, flush counts census were conducted in 30 PAs in the Florence province during the summer time (post-reproduction period), using dogs experienced at rooting out the pheasants. We made estimates for each PA in the number of adult males, adult females and sexually undifferentiated young pheasants. We calculated post-reproduction density and the ratios of young/adults and males/females. These parameters were used to construct a model to predict the pheasants catches in the next winter. The study showed that the minimum census surface covered must be more than 9 % of the total area studied. Smaller coverage gave biased estimations <b>of</b> <b>pheasant</b> numbers to be caught. The best generic model, to be used for surfaces between 297 and 1385 ha, located in Mediterranean habitats, was the following: total number <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> to be captured and relocated = - 10. 3 + 0. 15 *total number <b>of</b> female <b>pheasants</b> estimated in the protected area + 0. 14 * total number <b>of</b> young <b>pheasants</b> estimated in the protected area + 0. 04 *total surface of the protected area (R 2 = 0. 48) ...|$|R

Killed and untreated bodies <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> were stored hanging in an air-conditioned chamber at a cold temperature (5 ± 1  °C). The pheasant bodies were subjected to microbiological analysis and identification of isolated microorganisms whose decarboxylase activity was detected. The production of biogenic amines and polyamines was determined by means of HPLC after pre-column derivatisation with dansylchloride. The total number of microorganisms in all parts <b>of</b> the <b>pheasant</b> bodies as well as the number of psychrotrophic bacteria, enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria was increasing during storage (P < 0. 05). A total of 127 strains of bacteria from the pheasant bodies were isolated and identified. Production of at least one biogenic amine was found in vitro in 107 isolates. Three strains were found to produce four biogenic amines—histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine. Production of phenylethylamine, tryptamine, spermidine and spermine in the isolated bacteria was not detected. Within all the biogenic amines detected in the analysed samples <b>of</b> <b>pheasant</b> bodies, the lowest concentration was found in histamine and the highest one in tyramine and cadaverine. The amount of BA detected in the individual parts <b>of</b> <b>pheasant</b> bodies was increasing during the storage period.

The experimental feeding <b>of</b> both <b>pheasant</b> and broiler chickens proceeded {{for a period of}} 42 days at the identical conditions employing the same diet and rearing technology. Muscles were analysed for the content of following amino acids: Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Pro, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, His, Lys, and Arg. The results show that the levels of most amino acids in thigh and breast muscles <b>of</b> <b>pheasants</b> (related to dry matter content) were significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in broiler chickens. In 42 -day-old birds, the levels of individual amino acids in breast muscles (related to 100 % of dry matter content) ranged from 8. 02 to 127. 32 g. kg - 1 in pheasant chickens and from 19. 77 to 110. 33 g. kg - 1 in broiler chickens while the corresponding average values in thigh muscles ranged from 14. 77 g. kg - 1 to 132. 77 g. kg - 1 in pheasant chickens and from 14. 02 g. kg - 1 to 93. 53 g. kg - 1 in broiler chickens.
