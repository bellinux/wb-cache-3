5|$|PEARL {{brought a}} {{specialty}} coffee expert to Rwanda, who {{put them in}} touch with a seller, Louisiana-based Community Coffee, to help market Maraba. They sent samples to Louisiana, and in June 2002 a representative from Community visited Maraba. Rwandan president Paul Kagame was also present, as the government placed great importance on the project. Community purchased an 18,000kilogram (40,000lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram. The beans were transported to Louisiana, where they were roasted and blended into one of the company's gourmet coffees. This was the first direct contract between an American <b>roaster</b> and an African coffee cooperative.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the drum <b>roaster</b> in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler allowed {{for the creation of}} very dark, roasted malts, contributing to the flavour of porters and stouts. Its development was prompted by a British law of 1816 forbidding the use of any ingredients other than malt and hops. Porter brewers, employing a predominantly pale malt grist, urgently needed a legal colourant. Wheeler's patent malt was the solution.|$|E

25|$|Many {{who believe}} fair trade coffee is {{insufficient}} utilize the direct trade model, {{which allows for}} more control over quality concerns, farmer empowerment, and sustainability issues. It also is valuable in harboring closer farmer to <b>roaster</b> business relationships, which can ultimately increase {{quality of life and}} profits for coffee growers and buyers alike. However, direct trade is a new concept that is only utilized by for profit businesses like Counter Culture Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee and therefore has no third party certification.|$|E

2500|$|The dry {{roasting}} process employs {{either the}} batch or continuous method. In the batch method, peanuts are heated {{in large quantities}} in a revolving oven at about 426.6℃. Next, the peanuts in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at 160℃ for about 40 to 60 minutes. This method is good to use when the peanuts differ in moisture content. In the continuous method, a hot air <b>roaster</b> is employed. [...] The peanuts pass through the <b>roaster</b> whilst being rocked to permit even roasting. [...] A photometer indicates the completion of dry roasting. [...] This method is favoured by large manufacturers since it can lower the rate of spoilage and requires less labor.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers <b>Roasters,</b> an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers <b>Roasters</b> {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. <b>Roasters</b> immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with <b>Roasters</b> and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the roasted chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers <b>Roasters,</b> claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until <b>Roasters</b> purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994.

2500|$|Braising {{pans and}} {{roasting}} pans (also known as braisers and roasters) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space {{to cook a}} roast (chicken, beef or pork). They typically have two loop or tab handles, and may have a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy gauge metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on a cooktop following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay <b>roaster</b> [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major upgrade}} {{to the plant}} {{took place in the}} period after 1950, {{following}} General Director O. T. Jarlsby's ten-year plan. Production was eased throughout the period by increased access to lumber and higher demand. The Anker Mill was rebuilt to produce paperboard. A new lumber cleaning mill opened in 1951, followed by a new central furnace the following year, a pyrite <b>roaster</b> and lumber chopper in 1953 and a new beater in 1954. Tistedalsfoss II Power Station and a spirit factory with an annual production of [...] opened in 1955. A hydrocyclone facility for the sulfite pulp mill, new 10,000 tonne oil tanks and a calcium carbonate management facility for the paper mill were taken into use two years later. A new warehouse was completed in 1958 and the bleaching site expanded the year after. The ten-year plan ended with the expansion of the conditioning facility for the paper mill and expansion of the sulfite pulp mill in 1960. In addition a series of minor upgrades and modernizations were carried out throughout the 1950s, such as extending the paper machines. From 1956 operations ran around-the-clock.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, a major {{redevelopment}} {{occurred in}} Ivy City when the Hecht's warehouse {{began to be}} renovated into apartments and retail space. The project began to move in December 2007, when Patriot Properties, a real estate development firm based in Philadelphia, purchased the warehouse for $78.5 million ($ in [...] dollars). Patriot Properties said it would convert the property into a big-box store. But the Great Recession forced these plans to be rescinded. The bank foreclosed on the property in early 2011, and the loan was purchased by Douglas Development, a privately held local real estate development firm. In January 2014, Douglas Development president Douglas Jemal announced plans to convert the warehouse into a 300-unit apartment building. Jemal said his company would also construct more than 1,000 new parking spaces and add [...] of retail space to the ground floor. Construction began on the parking garage in January 2014, and MOM's Organic Market became the retail space's first anchor tenant. A second major anchor tenant, local bicycle shop BicycleSPACE, moved into the retail space in February 2015, Nike, Inc. opened its first store in D.C. in the retail space on April 3, and Planet Fitness became the fourth anchor on April 20, 2015. Jemal also won a commitment from Mindful Restaurants owner Ari Gejdenson to open three restaurants (one of them serving Italian cuisine) in a [...] space at Hecht's. The redevelopment of the Hecht's Warehouse and addition of retail led Compass Coffee, a local coffee bean <b>roaster</b> with its own small chain of coffee shops, {{to build a new}} coffee roasting factory at 1401 Okie Street NE in April 2015. In May 2015, restaurant and bar entrepreneur Joe Englert and real estate investor Langdon Hample purchased 1240 Mount Olivet Road NE for $1.1 million ($ in [...] dollars).
