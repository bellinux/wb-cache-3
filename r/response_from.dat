40|$|The {{influence}} of mesh coarseness in the structural reliability is evaluated. The objectives are {{to describe the}} alternatives and to demonstrate their effectiveness. The results show that special mapping methods can be developed by using: (1) deterministic structural <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> a fine (convergent) finite element mesh; (2) probabilistic distributions of structural <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> a coarse finite element mesh; (3) {{the relationship between the}} probabilistic structural <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> the coarse and fine finite element meshes; and (4) probabilistic mapping.

40|$|In some earlier work, semi-analytic {{methods were}} {{proposed}} to predict echo <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> point-like targets [1] and normally aligned flat-bottomed holes in solids (FBH) [2]. A new, more general formulation {{has recently been}} developed (hereafter, the “elastic model” [3]), capable of predicting <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> defects of arbitrary shape. In this paper, theoretical predictions using the new model are compared with experimentally measured echo <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> tilted FBH’s, where the hole bottom is tilted relative to the transducer axis. A related study [4] has already been presented in which experimental echo <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> tilted disks immersed in a fluid were compared with results predicted by an earlier model [5]. In that earlier model, mode conversion was not taken into account and only compression waves were considered (the “acoustic model”) ...|$|R

5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E

40|$|Background: Formative {{feedback}} {{that encourages}} self-directed learning in large class medical teaching {{is difficult to}} deliver. This study describes a new method, blueprinted feedback, and explores learner’s responses to assess its appropriate use within medical science teaching. Methods: Mapping summative assessment items to their relevant learning objectives creates a blueprint {{which can be used}} on completion of the assessment to automatically create a list of objectives ranked by the attainment of the individual student. Two surveys targeted medical students in years 1, 2 and 3. The behaviour-based survey was released online several times, with 215 and 22 <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> year 2, and 187, 180 and 21 <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> year 3. The attitude-based survey was interviewer-administered and released once, with 22 <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> year 2 and 3, and 20 <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> year 1. Results: 88 - 96...|$|R

The video received a positive <b>response</b> <b>from</b> critics for displaying various colors and intricate routines performed by Brown and several dancers. The song won three awards at the 2011 BET Awards for Best Collaboration, Viewer's Choice and Video of the Year. Several artists have covered the song and released their own remixes, including Karmin, Justin Bieber, Trey Songz and Da Brat.|$|E

They also initiated a {{hearts and minds}} campaign, named the Aldeamentos Programme, which was a forced relocation program. But on November 9, 1972, FRELIMO – not numbering more than 8,000 fighters – launched a large offensive in Tete Province. The <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the Portuguese military was fierce, leading to reprisal attacks {{in an attempt to}} unbalance the local population's continuing faith in FRELIMO.|$|E
