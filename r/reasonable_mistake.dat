40|$|Part I of {{this article}} {{discusses}} the principle that mistake or ignorance {{of the law is}} no excuse. It is settled law that no one can defend against a criminal charge on the grounds that he did not intend to flout the law and, at worst, made only a <b>reasonable,</b> honest <b>mistake</b> as to what he was free to do. Part II examines several areas in which the law does precisely the opposite by repeatedly manifesting a willingness to forgive <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistakes</b> by one or more actors {{in the criminal justice system}}. Part III then asks whether the developments discussed in Part II justify reconsidering the doctrine set forth in Part I that a mistake of law should not serve as an excuse to a crime. As I explain there, the Supreme Court’s recent and oft-stated rationale for its willingness to forgive mistakes made by actors in the criminal justice system militates strongly in favor of allowing private parties to assert a mistake-of-law defense. If the law is willing to countenance <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistakes</b> that government officials make, it also should be willing to forgive the <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistakes</b> that the rest of us make. And if that is true, then it is time to re-examine the hoary mistake-of-law doctrine...|$|R

40|$|This study {{introduces}} and evaluates a {{new method}} for teaching Computer Aided Design (CAD), to complement existing {{teaching and learning}} methods. It also introduces a novel method of assessment of CAD knowledge, whereby students themselves generate an online demonstration, talking through their approaches and techniques to develop a CAD model of their own. The rationale was to present a clear means of assessing student understanding, to encourage the students to apply their skills to their own design work {{and to create a}} community of learning where students share ideas, tips, and experiences and can learn from each other. Camtasia Studio 5 was used to capture video demonstrations of Rhinoceros 3. 0 and Solidworks 2007 3 D modelling. This was done by the tutor to complement traditional teaching methods and by students as an assessed activity. Various technical guidelines for the videos were provided for resolution, window size, verbal presentation tips and microphone settings. Recommendations on structure, discursive points, suitable content and alternative approaches were also made. Students responded well to the relaxed nature of the tutor demonstrations, accepting <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistakes</b> and appreciating the ability to be creative in their own work. This helped to overcome the initial fear of a live recording. The communal learning approach also provided a means to improve students’ attention to detail and their critical evaluation of different modelling approaches...|$|R

In this context—widely unstable but quite regular in its general scheme—the shipowners may have enough competencies and information to take logical and consistent decisions about ship purchasing and chartering. Yet, why do they periodically make mistakes? The analysis of shipowners’ behaviour provides a <b>reasonable</b> answer: <b>mistakes</b> incur when they ignore or undervalue the market trends, following their personal intuition or even unwisely imitating their competitors. The analysis of the Handysize segment among the bulk shipping business offers a significant example {{of the lack of}} timeliness in shipowners’ behaviour: after a long period of disregard, operators began to notice the opportunities of this market niche and they are now heavily investing in minor units. Maybe it’s not too late, but the market has already changed and only a few brave—or lucky—shipowners took advantage of the magic moment...|$|R
40|$|We develop polynomial-time online {{algorithms}} {{for learning}} disjunctions while trading off {{between the number}} of mistakes and the number of “I don’t know ” answers. In this model, we are given an online adversarial sequence of inputs for an unknown function of the form f(x 1, x 2, [...] ., xn) = ∨ i∈S xi, and for each such input, we must guess “true”, “false”, or “I don’t know”, after which we find out the correct output for that input. On the algorithm side, we show how to make at most εn mistakes while answering “I don’t know ” at most (1 /ε) 2 O(1 /ε) n times, which is linear for any constant ε> 0 and polynomial for some(ε = c / lg) lg n. Furthermore, we show how to make O n mis-log log n log n takes while answering “I don’t know ” O(n 2 log log n) times. On the lower bound side, we show that any algorithm making o(n / log n) mistakes must answer “I don’t know ” a superpolynomial number of times. By contrast, no previous lower bounds were known, and the best previous algorithms (by Sayedi et al. who introduced the model) either make at most 1 3 n mistakes while answering “I don’t know ” O(n) times with linear running time per answer, or make O(n / log n) mistakes while answering “I don’t know ” O(n 2) times with exponential running time per answer. Our lower bound establishes optimality of the latter mistake bound, assuming a polynomial number of “I don’t know”s. The running time of our algorithms (per answer) are (1 /ε) 2 O(1 /ε) n and Õ(n 3), respectively, whereas the first previous algorithm mentioned above makes many mistakes, and the second one requires Θ(2 n) time per answer.

50|$|Most jurisdictions use {{criminal}} and civil systems in parallel, making the political judgment on how infrequently to use the criminal law to maximise the publicity of those cases that are prosecuted. While others enact specific legislation covering health and safety, and product safety issues which lay down general protections for the public and for the employees. The difficulty of proving a mens rea is avoided in the less serious offences by imposing absolute, strict liability, or vicarious liability which does not require proof that the accused knew or could reasonably have known that its act was wrong, and which does not recognise any excuse of honest and <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistake.</b> But, most legislatures require some element of fault, either by way of an intention to commit the offence or recklessness resulting in the offence, or some knowledge of the relevant circumstances. Thus, companies are held liable when the acts and omissions, and {{the knowledge of the}} employees {{can be attributed to the}} corporation.

[...] The {{reason for this is that}} the Court described a need for a class of offence that had a lower standard to convict than True Crimes but was not as harsh as Absolute Liability offences. As opposed to the first category of offences in which the accused is presumed innoncent, offences of strict liability presses a presumption of negligence on the accused. The burden of proving that the accused acted as a diligent person rests on his shoulders and must be demonstrated by preponderance of evidence.|$|E

5000|$|Scholars {{who write}} that Pribina was an {{independent}} ruler {{also say that}} his principality was united with Moravia after he was exiled from his homeland.

According to Marsina, the inhabitants of Pribina's principality who [...] "definitely were aware of their difference from the Moravian Slavs" [...] preserved their [...] "specific consciousness" [...] even within Great Moravia, which contributed {{to the development of the}} common consciousness of the ancestors of the Slovak people. Pribina was not an independent ruler, but Duke Mojmir of Moravia's lieutenant in Nitra, according to Vlasto. He says that Pribina's attempts to achieve independence led to his exile. The identification of [...] "Nitra" [...] with [...] "Nitrava" [...] is not universally accepted by scholars. Imre Boba and Charles Bowlus are among the scholars who challenged that identification. Imre Boba says, the Humanist historian, Johannes Aventinus, who identified Nitrava (granted along with Brno and Olomouc by Louis the German, according to Aventinus) with Nitra, because Nitrava was in [...] "Hunia or Avaria", to the south of Bavaria. He also says that the Latin term [...] "locus Nitrava" [...] could not refer to a city. According to his view, none of the modern names of Nitra (Slovak Nitra, Hungarian Nyitra and German Neutra) could develop from a [...] "Nitrava" [...] form. Boba's linguistic approach is not compliant with onomastic research which suggests that Nitra was the primary form of the place name and [...] "Nitrava" [...] is only the secondary name; both forms were recorded already in the 9th century. The Czech historian Dušan Třeštík, who says that the association of Nitra with Nitrava cannot be challenged, writes that the latter form developed from the name of the Nitra River, which fits well into the system of Indo-European toponyms; other rivers with similar names are not known. Charles Bowlus also rejects the identification of Nitrava with Nitra, because the latter town was only annexed by Moravia during the reign of Svatopluk, years after Pribina's expulsion, according to a letter that Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg and his suffragans wrote around 900. According to Třeštík, the content of the letter can be explained as a <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistake</b> of its compilators who knew that the territory was in the past a separate realm different from Moravia.|$|E
40|$|On 16 June 2004, the High Court of Australia {{decided in}} Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30 that the defence of honest and <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistake</b> of fact {{cannot be used}} {{on the basis that}} a {{commission}} of a strict liability offence was induced by the provision of misleading advice from a government agency.

40|$|Chapter 2 of the Australian Commonwealth Criminal Code codifies {{the general}} {{principles}} of criminal liability. All federal criminal offences, {{whether or not}} they appear in the substant 6 ive chapters of the Code, are subject to its provisions. Chapter 2 is based on article 2 of the American Model Penal Code and the equivalent general part of the UK Draft Criminal Code. It is, however, a more completely articulated statement of the elements of liability than either of its predecessors. This paper examines the relationship between physical and fault elements in chapter 2. It takes a Benthamite view of its provisions. Though chapter 2 was conceived as a legislative restatement of common law principles of criminal justice it can be expected to play a more significant role as a manual of instructions for the expression of legislative intentions. Chapter 2 enables the legislature to reclaim from courts the authority to define the grounds of criminal liability. There remain, however, areas of uncertainty resulting from the mismatch between the articulate clarity of most chapter 2 provisions and others that envisage the exercise of unstructured judicial discretion. Two issues in particular are discussed: liability for ulterior intentions and the effect of error or ignorance of law on criminal responsibility. The paper proposes enactment of a defense of <b>reasonable</b> <b>mistake</b> of law as a supplement to chapter 2. It concludes with an expression of hope that Australian criminal law theory might be based on a more unified consideration of legisprudence and common law...|$|E

If the Court, in fact, follows Herring 2 ̆ 7 s logic and extends that rule to all searches, the Court will have adopted a rule without precedential support.

40|$|After {{the passage}} of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{advocacy}} of de jure segregation quickly ceased to be an acceptable position within American political discourse. The speed of the political shift left figures who had openly supported de jure segregation with a political problem: how would they explain their former support for a position which had rapidly become not only discarded, but actively disreputable to have held? This study explores the responses to this dilemma through a series of case studies, highlighting different characteristic approaches that various figures took. George Wallace is examined {{as an example of a}} politician who tried [...] although less effusively than is commonly believed [...] to apologize for his former position. Strom Thurmond is examined as an example of a politician who, to the greatest extent possible, took refuge in silence about his former political stances. Robert Bork, whose opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act became infamous during the hearings about his nomination to the Supreme Court, is considered as someone who wrote off his former position as a technical (and therefore <b>reasonable)</b> <b>mistake.</b> The case of Herman Talmadge is used as an example of a politician who took refuge in a thin veneer of technical denials. Political commentator William F. Buckley's inconsistent and evasive answers present yet another strategy. And one politician who refused to accede to the new political consensus, Lester Maddox, is used to explore what happened to those who failed to shift with the times. A final chapter explores the attempts of later self-identified conservatives to grapple with the oft-overlooked roots of the conservative movement's political successes in segregationist ideology and Jim Crow's former supporters...|$|E
