40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to test the}} effectiveness of two treatment modalities for adolescent residents of the Intermediate Care Facility at St. Anthony, Idaho. The study was conducted at the Intermediate Care Facility (ICF) at St. Anthony, Idaho. The St. Anthony ICF is a separate yet distinct part of the Youth Services Center in the same area. The participants {{of this study were}} 20 emotionally disturbed adolescents who were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (10 participants in each group). The participants of both groups were shown to be homogeneous with regards to severity of emotional disturbance, family background, race, sex, age, and offense leading to institutionalization. Both groups of subjects were observed for 7 days during both base line and data line observation periods by pairs of trained observers. These observers monitored the frequency of occurrence of nine specific misbehaviors which fell into three general categories of behavior, i. e., category one: passive-withdrawal, category two: overt-hostility, and, category three: manipulation. The reliability between pairs of observers for base line and data line observation period ranged between. 82 and. 98. During the 6 -week treatment phase of the study, one group of subjects (E 1 group) received intensive individual, group, <b>recreational</b> and vocational <b>therapy,</b> while the second experimental group (E 2 group) received intensive individual, group, <b>recreational</b> and vocational <b>therapy</b> coupled with self monitoring plus a 5 -day training in the recognition of inappropriate behaviors. Both the E 1 and E 2 group participants showed a significant overall decrease in the frequency of misbehaviors for all three categories combined when each group was considered separately on base line and data line observations. However, when the three general categories were considered separately for each experimental group, the E 1 group participants showed a significant reduction in only one of the three categories [...] category one, passive-withdrawal. Whereas, the E 2 group participants showed a significant reduction in the frequency of misbehavior in all three categories when base line and data line frequencies were compared. When the E 1 group is compared with the E 2 group for the greatest amount of reduction of misbehaviors after treatment, the treatment modality applied to the E 2 group was significantly more effective in reducing the frequency of misbehavior than was the treatment modality which was applied to the E 1 group participants. The results of this study seem to indicate that for this sample, a treatment modality which combines intensive individual, group, <b>recreational</b> and vocational <b>therapy</b> with self-monitoring plus training in the recognition of inappropriate behaviors is significantly more effective in reducing the frequency of misbehaviors than is a treatment which employs only intensive individual, group, <b>recreational</b> and vocational <b>therapy</b> techniques...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{perform a}} {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature regarding hippotherapy in children with cerebral palsy. MethodThe research in Medline and Cochrane Library databases was performed using the keywords “Equestrian therapy”, “Riding for the disabled”, “Hippotherapy”, “Equine-movement therapy”, “Therapeutic horse (back) riding”. The methodological quality of the articles was assessed using four levels of evidence and three guideline grades (A: strong B: moderate C: poor). ResultSix prospective randomized controlled studies confirm the level of evidence of hippotherapy and/or instructor-directed <b>recreational</b> horseback riding <b>therapy</b> (HBRT) in children with cerebral palsy with grade B. Hippotherapy and/or HBRT in children with cerebral palsy contributes to improve motor function, symmetry of muscle contraction, spasticity, posture and walking. Ten prospective no randomized studies confirm the level with grade C for balance, motor coordination, lumbo-pelvic flexibility, walking speed, and social behavior. ConclusionThe level of evidence of hippotherapy in children with cerebral palsy is moderate (no grade A studies and six grade B studies) ...|$|R
