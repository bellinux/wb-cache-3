To {{enhance the}} {{comprehension}} {{on the internal}} rule of microstructure evolvement and quality-controlled relativity, the microstructure during the induction reheating of billets and die casting of parts was systematically investigated. According to general structure observation and aided analysis of some computer simulations, the quantitative relationships between microscopic morphology (including solid fraction and grain shape) and formation state was minutely discussed. The experimental results showed that liquid and solid phase in semi-solid slurry had different filling tendency, fluid velocity of liquid phase {{in the area of}} high filling speed was relative quick and easy to flow into far area and corner. Solid particles far from gate possessed fine and <b>round</b> <b>grain.</b> Moreover, the structure configuration of original billets markedly affected forming process; billets with fine and <b>round</b> <b>grain</b> were required for the die-castings of complex shape and thin thickness. In the case of the big change in shape and thickness of die-castings, the design of gating system and the control of plunger speed should be so properly carried out as to avoid unequal distribution of solid and liquid phase in die-casting part as soon as possible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{far as the}} Differential Cryptanalysis {{of reduced}} <b>round</b> <b>Grain</b> v 1 is concerned, the best results were those {{published}} by Knellwolf et al. in Asiacrypt 2011. In an extended version of the paper, it was shown {{that it was possible}} to retrieve (i) 5 expressions in the Secret Key bits for a variant of Grain v 1 that employs 97 rounds (in place of 160) in its Key Scheduling process using 227 chosen IVs and (ii) 1 expression in Secret Key bits for a variant that employs 104 rounds in its Key Scheduling using 235 chosen IVs. However, the second attack on 104 rounds, had a success probability of around 50 %, which is to say that the attack worked for only around one half of the Secret Keys. In this paper we propose a dynamic cube attack on 105 <b>round</b> <b>Grain</b> v 1, that has a success probability of 100 %, and thus we report an improvement of 8 rounds over the previous best attack on Grain v 1 that attacks the entire Keyspace. We take the help of the tool ∆GrainKSA, proposed by Banik at ACISP 2014, to track the differential trails induced in the internal state of Grain v 1 by any difference in the IV bits, and we prove that a suitably introduced difference in the IV leads to a distinguisher for the output bit produced in the 105 th round. This, in turn, helps determine the values of 6 expressions in the Secret Key bits...|$|E

This implies that the plasma erupts during the ion beam interaction with the coatings with poor thermal conductivity, and the micro-cracks were produced in the cooling process.

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} in {{the form}} of finely ground limestone is a material that has found its application {{in a wide range of}} industries, in the chemical, rubber, agricultural, and paper industries, is used for desulfurization of boilers and other. In civil engineering, ground limestone is used for the production of building materials, plaster and mortar mixtures, as a filler in concrete mixtures, in road construction, and as an essential component of mastic asphalt. This paper deals with examining the modification of the properties of finely ground limestone by the tumbling agglomeration method. It has been shown that the components of concrete with a <b>round</b> <b>grain</b> have a positive effect on the pumping of concrete in comparison with an elongated grain or the rough surface of crushed stone. The experiments will be carried out on a granulation plate using a variety of granulation liquid.

40|$|Due to {{increasingly}} strict {{environmental regulations}} regarding extraction of gravel the concrete industry {{need to reduce}} the use of gravel {{and replace it with}} crushed aggregates in concrete. Gravel is very suitable for concrete because of its <b>round</b> <b>grain</b> shape with a smooth surface and very often also a suitable particle size distribution. Crushed aggregates very often have a more flake grain shape and higher content of fine particles. The characteristic of crushed aggregates depends on parameters such as; type of rock, crushing method and degree of refinement. With a suitable rock type and by choosing the right crushing setup it is possible to produce crushed aggregates for concrete. The use of VSI crushers may improve the grain shape but is not always necessary. In case of very high content of fines an air classifier can be used to reduce the filler content (or by washing). Concrete consists of cement, water, aggregates and very often also additional materials and admixtures. Replacing gravel with crushed aggregate as a direct 1 : 1 substitute might be difficult because of the grain shape of crushed aggregates and its higher fine content. Very often mix-design adjustments are required to achieve the same concrete properties as with gravel and to ensure the fresh concrete workability it might be needed to increase the cement paste. For environmental and concrete technical reasons, it is desirable to substitute gravel with crushed aggregates without increasing the cement paste and to succeed, it requires some kind of refinement of the hard rock. When choosing crush methods to improve the properties of the crushed aggregates decisions always include economic considerations and it is necessary to understand how varying degrees of processing effect the concrete properties. This include a need for test methods that makes it possible to determine if a crushed material is good enough for concrete. This master thesis aims to investigate if it is possible to determine if a crushed aggregate is suitable for concrete by using some practical and simple aggregate test methods. Aggregates with different degree of refinement has been used in the study; conventional crushed and materials processed with a VSI and an air classifier. Fine aggregates 0 / 4 mm and also the properties of the fines, particles smaller than 0, 25 mm, {{have a major impact on}} the concrete workability so focus in this investigation is crushed aggregates smaller than 4 mm. The results from this work show that there are correlations between the outcomes from aggregate tests and from concrete tests and that it is possible to assess if a crushed material is suitable for concrete without carry out a large scale concrete tests. It is difficult to assess a material with only one single aggregate test method but a combination of two tests methods describes well how the material will behave in a concrete. Important when producing crushed aggregates for concrete is the particle shape and the particle size distribution. These two parameters are important for how the material affects the concrete properties and aggregate test methods that can describe these parameters are desirable.

X-ray powder diffraction data and thermal cmwes show clearly the presence of hydrated halloysite, and on closer examination de-hydrated halloysite and {{a small amount of}} montmorillonite can be detected.

The variation of the degree of crystatlinity of the hydrated halloysite and of the kinds and amounts of accessory clay minerals, and the variation of the shapes of the particles observed in the electron micrographs are generally related to each other. Hydrated halloysite of a relatively well ~ sort generally co-exists with halloysite (dehydrated) and consists of elongated crystals having sharp edges; <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> are composed entirely of these fibrous crystals.

40|$|The {{authors have}} been engaged in the linkage {{analysis}} of rice plants, Oryza sativa L., by the conventional genetic method and reciprocal translocation method. Through the coordination of these two approach, ten linkage groups have been assigned to the relevant chromosomes (Table 1). In the previous paper, linkage groups corresponding to the chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 4 were described. In this paper, the correspondence of the chromosomes 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 to the linkage groups was presented. Twenty nine kinds o f reciprocal translocation homozygote (Table 2) and twenty one marker genes (Table 3) were used in this study. The following seven genes, described newly by the authors, were contained among these genes (Tables 4 - 10). dl: A gene for drooping leaf. Midrib of leaf blade and sheath are poorly developed, so cross sections of the basal part of seedling show round shape (Fig. 1). ch: A gene for chlorina. sp: A gene for short panicle. Primary rachis in the lower part of panicles degenerated (Fig. 3). tri: A gene for triangular hull.

Small and <b>round</b> <b>grain,</b> lax panicle (Fig. 5). The reciprocal translocation homozygotes were crossed with the linkage testers, and F_ 2 segregations for marker genes and for fertility were examined. The results were shown in Table 11. The recombination values between marker genes and interchanged points were estimated by the maximum likelihood method and the data were shown in Tables 13, 16, 21, 23 and 25. Results of linkage analysis by the conventional genetic method were shown in Tables 12, 14, 15, 17 - 20, 22 and 24. In these cases, recombination values between marker genes were also estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The conclusions obtained are as follows: 1) The eleventh linkage group, to which bc, dl and ch belong, is corresponded to chromosome 5, and the order of arrangement of these genes and the interchanged points is RT 4 - 5 -bc-(RT 4 - 5) -RT 2 - 5 -RT 3 - 5 -(RT 2 - 5) -dl-RT 5 - 9 -ch (Fig. 6). 2) The first linkage group, to which wx, dp_ 1, C, ws and Cl belong, is corresponded to chromosome 6, and the order of arrangement is wx-dp_ 1 -RT 6 - 11 -C-ws-Cl-RT 6 - 8 -RT 6 - 7 -(RT 6 - 8) (Fig. 8). 3) The tenth linkage group, which consist of tri, bl_ 1, d_w and gh_ 2, is corresponded to chromosome 8, and arrangements of tri-RT 7 - 8 a-RT 3 - 8 b-bl_ 1 -(RT 3 - 8 b) -RT 1 - 8 -RT 8 - 10 a-d_w-RT 7 - 8 b-gh_ 2 and tri-RT 8 - 10 b-bl_ 1 -RT 6 - 8 -RT 8 - 10 a-d_w-RT 3 - 8 a-gh_ 2 -(RT 3 - 8 a) are considered (Fig. 9). 4) The eighth linkage group, of which members are la and sp, is corresponded to chromosome 9, and these genes and the interchanged points are arranged in an order of RT 9 - 10 -la-RT 7 - 9 -RT 5 - 9 -sp-(RT 5 - 9) (Fig. 7). 5) The fourth linkage group, of which members are d_ 6, g and Rc, is corresponded to chromosome 10, and they are arranged in a order of RT 6 - 10 -d_ 6 -g-RT 8 - 10 a-Rc-RT_ 1 - 10 -RT 8 - 10 b (Fig. 10). 6) The second linkage group, which contains d 2, PI, I_g, Ph, Pr and d_ 11, is corresponded to chromosome 11, and they are arranged in a order of d_ 2 -RT 3 - 11 b-Pl-RT 10 - 11 _a-lg-RT 6 - 11 -Ph (RT 6 - 11) -(RT 3 - 11 a) -Pr-RT 3 - 11 a-d_II-RT 1 - 11 (Fig. 11). 相互転座をもちいたイネの連鎖分析を行ない, 10 の染色体に対応する連鎖群を明らかにしたが,ここでは,染色体 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 についてのべた. 1. 新たに記載された遺伝子は,たれ葉遺伝子dl,黄緑葉遺伝子ch,三角籾遺伝子tri,黄褐籾遺伝子Sh 2,矮性白笹型矮性遺伝子d_w,短穂遺伝子spおよび信金愛国型矮性遣伝子d_ 11 である. 2. bcとdl,dlとchはそれぞれ組換価 42. 1 ％, 49. 2 ％で連鎖し,dl,chはbcとともに第XI連鎖群を構成する. また,位置関係はbc-dl-chである. 3. 染色体 5 には第XI連鎖群が対応し,染色体上の遺伝子および転座点の配列順序はRT 4 - 5 -bc-(RT 4 - 5) -RT 2 - 5 -RT 3 - 5 -(RT 2 - 5) -dl-RT 5 - 9 -chである. 4. 染色体 6 にはwx,dp_ 1,C,ws,Clの属する第I連鎖群が対応し,染色体上の遺伝子および転座点の配列順序はwx-dp_ 1 -RT 6 - 11 -C-ws-Cl-(RT 6 - 8) -RT 6 - 7 -RT 6 - 8 である. 5. bl_ 1 はtriと組換価 22. 7...|$|E

The geotextile-reinforced sands present higher strength and axial strain at failure than the unreinforced sands. The strength of reinforced sands increases with decreasing sand grain size, with increasing number of geotextile layers and is affected by the grain shape of sand, since it was observed that reinforced sands with subangular grains attain higher strength values than the reinforced sands with <b>rounded</b> <b>grains.</b> The triaxial compression tests yielded bilinear failure envelopes for all geotextile-reinforced sands...|$|R

3000|$|Based {{on their}} overall general shape, grains {{returned}} by Hayabusa from Itokawa have been {{divided into two}} main groups: angular and rounded (Tsuchiyama et al. 2011, Tsuchiyama et al. 2013). The presence of angular grains {{on the surface of}} Itokawa was not unexpected. However, the presence of <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> is a surprise. The presence of rounded rock or minerals in any geological setting on a planet indicates a geologically high-energy environment - one that is or was actively moving material resulting in mechanical weathering, which must be more than a one-time event in order to turn angular <b>grains</b> into <b>rounded</b> ones. Mechanical weathering of rocks or minerals is a differential process that in part depends on characteristics such as composition of the material {{and in the case of}} rocks the level of their lithification. Such geologically high-energy environments on planetary surfaces are produced by wind- or water-dominated geological settings, even ice-dominated such as glacial movement. However, on an airless body such as Itokawa, weathering of material on surfaces cannot be the product of movement of any kind of fluid, particularly on the surface of bodies. Whatever mechanism or combination of mechanisms produced the <b>rounded</b> <b>grains,</b> the young CRE ages of the returned grains indicate that they were formed or exposed near the surface relatively recently and science must explain their existence. We thus pose two questions directly related to the <b>rounding</b> of <b>grains</b> on airless bodies such as Itokawa: (1) What geologically high-energy environments exist or existed that could physically weather rock to produce <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> on the surface of an asteroid? (2) Does the overall physical shape and characteristics of the Itokawa particles constrain the dynamical evolution of Itokawa and, by extension, other asteroids? [...]...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{material}} properties of 26 granular analogue {{materials used in}} 14 analogue modelling laboratories. We determined physical characteristics such as bulk density, grain size distribution, and grain shape, and performed ring shear tests to determine friction angles and cohesion, and uniaxial compression tests to evaluate the compaction behaviour. Mean grain size of the materials varied between c. 100 and 400 μm. Analysis of grain shape factors shows that the four different classes of granular materials (14 quartz sands, 5 dyed quartz sands, 4 heavy mineral sands and 3 size fractions of glass beads) can be broadly {{divided into two groups}} consisting of 12 angular and 14 <b>rounded</b> materials. <b>Grain</b> shape has an influence on friction angles, with most angular materials having higher internal friction angles (between c. 35 ° and 40 °) than rounded materials, whereas well-rounded glass beads have the lowest internal friction angles (between c. 25 ° and 30 °). We interpret this as an effect of intergranular sliding versus rolling. Most angular materials have also higher basal friction angles (tested for a specific foil) than more rounded materials, suggesting that angular grains scratch and wear the foil. Most materials have an internal cohesion in the order of 20 – 100 Pa except for well-rounded glass beads, which show a trend towards a quasi-cohesionless (C < 20 Pa) Coulomb-type material. The uniaxial confined compression tests reveal that <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> generally show less compaction than angular grains. We interpret this {{to be related to the}} initial packing density after sifting, which is higher for <b>rounded</b> <b>grains</b> than for angular grains.
