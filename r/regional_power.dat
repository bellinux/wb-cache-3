5|$|In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775-76. Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major <b>regional</b> <b>power,</b> partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre's regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir's successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.|$|E
40|$|Book abstract: <b>Regional</b> <b>Powers</b> and <b>Regional</b> Orders {{presents}} a re-examination and re-conceptualization {{of the concept}} of 'region' and its function within power and order systems. Utilising a comparative and case study approach, the volume examines 'new' <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> such as Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa. These territories as <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> are novel phenomenon in the field of international politics and even more so in the field of international relations. The book focuses on the emerging role of these new <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> within their respective region, and asks how other members of these regions cope with and react to that role. <b>Regional</b> <b>Powers</b> and <b>Regional</b> Orders will be of interest to students and scholars of international and <b>regional</b> politics and <b>power,</b> and international relations...|$|R
40|$|Much {{of recent}} {{international}} relations literature argues conflicts to achieve or to frustrate regional dominance {{will become more}} virulent in the future. In this context we examine different approaches in international relations theory regarding the role and importance which they attribute to <b>regional</b> <b>powers.</b> We discuss diverse concepts of power and theoretical approaches that address the topics of power relations and power hierarchies in international politics. Marking differences as well as common grounds with the more traditional concept of "middle powers", we sketch an analytical concept of <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> adequate for contemporary international relations research. The paper concludes with reflections {{on the relationship between}} <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> and <b>regional</b> integration and a short discussion of the analytical value of the concept of cooperative hegemony for the study of <b>regional</b> <b>powers.</b> International Relations, <b>Power,</b> <b>Power</b> Transition, <b>Regional</b> <b>Powers,</b> Middle Powers, Cooperative Hegemony...|$|R

5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a <b>regional</b> <b>power.</b> In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E
5|$|K'inich B'aaknal Chaak was enthroned in 688, {{twenty years}} after Ruler 2, and reigned for twenty-seven years. During his reign he {{restored}} Toniná's power {{with a number of}} military victories over Palenque, and his reign was dominated by the struggle against the rival city for <b>regional</b> <b>power.</b> Ballcourt 1, the larger of Toniná's two ballcourts, was dedicated in 699 to celebrate three victories over the city's arch-rival. The ballcourt originally had six sculptures of bound captives, all vassals of the enemy Palenque king from the Usumacinta region. The date of the king's death is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the rulers of Copán before the {{founding}} of a new dynasty with its origins at Tikal in the early 5thcentury AD, although the city's origins {{can be traced back}} to the Preclassic period. After this, Copán became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> in the southern Maya region, although it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state Quirigua in 738, when the long-ruling king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat (Cauac Sky). Although this was a major setback, Copán's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> {{towards their}} own regions is often volatile {{in the developing}} world, which leads to unstable integration processes. This article argues that this volatility is due to limited intra-regional gains from regional integration in developing regions, which implies that the behaviour of <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> is constrained by extra-regional economic interests. When regional integration is not in conflict with extra;regional interests, <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> provide <b>regional</b> leadership. However, when extra-regional interests are in conflict with <b>regional</b> integration, <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> become <b>regional</b> Rambos. This argument is illustrated with the two examples of Brazil's behaviour in Mercosur and South Africa's behaviour in SADC. Both <b>regional</b> <b>powers</b> provided leadership during some periods of the regional integration processes, but became Rambos when important extra;regional interests were at stake. This damaged regional integration processes in South America and Southern Africa considerably...|$|R

5|$|Religious peace {{came with}} the {{emergence}} of the Macedonian dynasty in 867, as well as a strong and unified Byzantine leadership; while the Abassid empire had splintered into many factions after 861. Basil I revived the Byzantine Empire into a <b>regional</b> <b>power,</b> during a period of territorial expansion, making the Empire the strongest power in Europe, with an ecclesiastical policy marked by good relations with Rome. Basil allied with the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II against the Arabs, and his fleet cleared the Adriatic Sea of their raids.|$|E
5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant <b>regional</b> <b>power.</b> Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E

Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus {{to return to his}} homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus ceased to be a <b>regional</b> <b>power.</b> Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{influence}} of the Church during the Middle Ages gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built {{in and around the}} city; notably Aarhus Cathedral was initiated in the late 12thcentury by the influential bishop Peder Vognsen. In 1441, Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed {{as far back as the}} 12thcentury. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.|$|E
5|$|When Chandrabhanu {{embarked}} on a second invasion of the south, the Pandyas came to {{the support of the}} Sinhalese king and killed Chandrabhanu in 1262 and installed Aryacakravarti, a minister in charge of the invasion, as the king. When the Pandyan Empire became weak due to Muslim invasions, successive Aryacakravarti rulers made the Jaffna kingdom independent and a <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> to reckon with in Sri Lanka. All subsequent kings of the Jaffna Kingdom claimed descent from one Kulingai Cakravarti who is identified with Kalinga Magha by Swami Gnanaprakasar and Mudaliar Rasanayagam while maintaining their Pandyan progenitor’s family name.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus {{emerged from}} the {{conflict}} as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece. After his victory in Argos, Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as tyrant {{of the city and}} appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities. His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon. On his journey north to Macedon, Antigonus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of Chalcis and Eretria on the important island of Euboia with the outcome being that he further consolidated his power in Greece. The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient. Angered by Macedon's supremacy and full of ambition, Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis, most notably Athens. In the resulting Chremonidean War, Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> again until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later.|$|E

After recapture of {{the bulk of the}} Republic of Serb Krajina (the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia) in Operation Storm in August 1995, the HV shifted its focus to western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The shift was motivated by a desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border, establish Croatia as a <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal of gaining control over western Bosnia and the city of Banja Luka—the largest city in the Bosnian Serb-held territory.|$|E

40|$|Various {{concepts}} ascribe {{key roles}} to emerging non-OECD countries in regional and global politics.

Because of the different impacts of different <b>regional</b> <b>powers,</b> which are categorized in this paper using typologies of hegemony, the logic of international relations varies from one region to another. From a theoretical point of view, this means that international relations theories have to make region-specific adaptations. <b>regional</b> <b>powers,</b> hegemonic stability, geopolitics, regionalization...|$|R

5|$|European {{colonial rule}} in the Congo {{began in the late}} 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by his country's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. The Luba Empire, the largest <b>regional</b> <b>power</b> in the Kasai region, was annexed into the new state in 1889. By the turn of the century, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E
