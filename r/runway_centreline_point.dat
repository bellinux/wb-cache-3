5000|$|On August 3, 1978, a Boeing 707 {{registered}} as CC-CCX was approaching Ministro Pistarini International Airport in thick fog when it struck trees {{in a gentle}} descent, some 2500 metres short of the runway threshold and 300 metres {{out of line with}} the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> All 63 people on board the aircraft survived the accident.|$|R

50|$|At high altitudes, {{there is}} plenty of space for recovery. But during the final approach, when the {{airplane}} is close to the ground, a stall-spin accident is often fatal. A common cause of this accident is to enter a skidding turn in the airfield traffic pattern on the turn from base leg to final approach, unconsciously using excessive rudder in an attempt to tighten the turn and avoid overshooting the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b>|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{approach}} {{surveillance radar}} (ASR or SRA) {{is a type}} of radar instrument approach provided with active assistance from air traffic control. The only airborne radio equipment required for radar approaches is a functioning radio transmitter and receiver. The radar controller vectors the aircraft to align it with the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> The controller continues the vectors to keep the aircraft on course until the pilot can complete the approach and landing by visual reference to the surface.|$|R
25|$|After {{successfully}} transporting {{the patient}} from Tingwall Airport in the Shetland Islands to Inverness, the pilot, nurse, and physician were {{returning to their}} home base in Tingwall. There was a strong and gusting right crosswind at the runway. The pilot's approach procedure required him to make right turns to line up with the runway. However, these right turns obscured the pilot's view of the runway, and when the pilot made his final right turn, the aircraft had been blown {{to the left of}} the runway, too far to make a safe landing. The pilot executed a go-around procedure and attempted another approach. Again, the aircraft was blown far {{to the left of the}} <b>runway</b> <b>centreline,</b> and during the final approach turn, the aircraft lost a great deal of altitude, striking the ground 1.5km short of the runway and approximately 0.3km to the left of the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> The AAIB determined that nighttime visibility of the airport environment was inadequate, especially during right crosswind conditions, and recommended the Tingwall Airport add additional ground lighting to aid pilots' ability to acquire the runway during nighttime approaches.|$|R
5000|$|... 11 or 12 October 2001, a Swearingen SA.226TC Metro II Perimeter Flight 962 {{arrived at}} Shamattawa on a MEDIVAC flight {{to pick up}} a patient. It was night and the {{aircraft}} was coming into runway 01 too fast and too high so the crew performed a missed approach. Flying {{to the left of the}} <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> the aircraft hit some tress and came to rest in some muskeg. There were three people on board, both pilots were killed and the third person required hospitalization.|$|R
25|$|Singapore Airlines also {{issued a}} {{statement}} {{after the release of}} the ASC report. In their statement, Singapore Airlines reiterated the points brought up by the Singapore investigators and added that air traffic control (ATC) did not follow their own procedure when they gave clearance for SQ006 to take off despite ATC's not being able to see the aircraft. Singapore Airlines also clarified that the paravisual display (PVD) was meant to help the flight crew maintain the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> in poor visibility, rather than to identify the runway in use.|$|R
50|$|The landing continued, but manual braking did not {{commence}} {{until the}} aircraft was over 1,600 metres down the runway. Then the plane proceeded to hydroplane and skid {{its way down}} the runway, departing substantially from <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> Company standard operating procedure mandated that idle reverse thrust {{should be used for}} landings and that flaps should be set at 25 degrees, not the maximum of 30 degrees. The combination of flaps 25, no auto-braking, no reverse thrust, a high and fast approach, a late touch down, poor Cockpit Resource Management, and the standing water on the runway led to a runway overshoot.|$|R
40|$|Two {{multisensor}} system architectures for navigation and guidance of small Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are presented and compared. The main objective {{of our research}} is to design a compact, light and relatively inexpensive system capable of providing the required navigation performance in all phases of flight of small UA, with a special focus on precision approach and landing, where Vision Based Navigation (VBN) techniques can be fully exploited in a multisensor integrated architecture. Various existing techniques for VBN are compared and the Appearance-Based Navigation (ABN) approach is selected for implementation. Feature extraction and optical flow techniques are employed to estimate flight parameters such as roll angle, pitch angle, deviation from the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and body rates...|$|R
50|$|Lorenz had a {{range of}} about 30 mi, enough for blind-landing but {{not good enough for}} bombing raids over the UK. This could be {{addressed}} by using more powerful transmitters and highly sensitive receivers. In addition the Lorenz beams were deliberately set wide enough that they could be easily picked up at some distance from the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline,</b> but this meant their accuracy at long ranges was fairly limited. This was not a problem for blind landing, where the distance covered by the fan-shaped beams decreased as the aircraft approached the transmitters, but for use in the bombing role this would be reversed, and the system would have maximum inaccuracy over the target.|$|R
40|$|Road {{tracking}} is {{a promising}} technique {{to increase the}} efficiency of road mapping. In this paper an improved road tracker, based on cooperation between angular texture signature and template matching, is presented. Our tracker uses parabola to model the road trajectory and to predict the position of next road <b>centreline</b> <b>point.</b> It employs angular texture signature to get the exact moving direction of current road <b>centreline</b> <b>point,</b> and moves forward one predefined step along the direction to reach a new position, and then uses curvature change to verify the new added road point whether right enough. We also build compactness of angular texture signature polygon to check whether the angular texture signature is suitable to be used to go on tracking. When angular texture signature fails, least squares template matching is then employed instead. Cooperation between angular texture signature and template matching can reliably extract continuous and homogenous ribbon roads on high resolution remotely sensed imagery. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{crew was}} then {{handed over to}} the holding and tower controllers, and was cleared for descent to 600 m, before {{entering}} the turn to the final approach. Whilst performing the turn, the <b>runway</b> extended <b>centreline</b> was overshot. After eliminating the deviation, the crew started descending the aircraft along the glide slope, following the approach pattern.|$|R
5000|$|Flight 357 then {{commenced}} {{its initial}} descent at 07:42 UTC and was cleared to 3.500 ft. It then descended to 500 ft. The crew {{then tried to}} align the aircraft with the runway. The First Officer asked the Captain [...] "Can you make it to land from that position?" [...] An observer on the cockpit also suggested going on the downwind; presumably to re-position the aircraft for landing on runway 05. However, {{there was no response}} at all from the Captain and the approach was continued for runway 23. The left turn was very steep and it took the aircraft {{to the left of the}} <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and a right correction was applied. The observer had to shout a warning [...] "Watch the wing" [...] as the wings could have struck the ground on the final approach. The crew were still struggling with the plane's control to align it with the runway.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the accident the aircraft took off from London Heathrow Airport at 15:16 GMT on a non-scheduled positioning flight to Nutts Corner Airport in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where it was due to pick up the UK government Minister of Supply Aubrey Jones and a group of journalists, who had been attending the opening of a research building for Short & Harland Ltd in Belfast. [...] An hour-and-a-half later, with low cloud and rain at Nutts Corner, the aircraft commenced its approach to land from the east on runway 28. As the aircraft neared the runway it veered right of the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> Less than 3/4 mi from the eastern end of the runway the crew carried out a go-around, but the aircraft crashed about 1000 ft {{to the left of the}} far end of the runway. The accident killed all five crew and the two passengers (a BEA official and his wife) on board, and the aircraft was destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Whenever braking {{actions are}} issued they are informing pilots that the {{aircraft}} maximum crosswind limits {{may have to}} be reduced on that runway because of reduced surface friction (grip). This should alert pilots that they may experience lateral/directional control issues during the landing roll-out. In a crosswind the pilot tacks into wind to make allowances for the sideways force that is being applied to the aircraft. This sideways force occurs as the wind strikes the aircraft's vertical fin causing the aircraft to weathercock or weathervane. This manifests itself as an angular displacement of the fuselage relative to the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> This angular displacement is known as drift angle. Just before or upon initial ground contact the pilot must re-align the fuselage to zero the drift angle (i.e. correct it to parallel with the <b>runway's</b> <b>centreline).</b> This re-alignment is accomplished using the rudder flight control surface. As the wheels make contact with the runway surface {{there are a lot of}} side forces and torsion placed on the tyres due to them countering the weathervane effect which continues to try to act upon the aircraft. A combination of the tyres inherent strength and the action of the runway surface friction with the tyres ensure that the pilot can continue to keep the aircraft aligned with the runway as the aircraft decelerates during the landing roll. If however the surface friction is diminished because of contamination then this may upset the balance of forces resulting in insufficient directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. To ensure this does not occur there is a pro-rata reduction in the aircraft's crosswinds limits, which in turn limits the sideways forces acting on the aircraft, thus ensuring sufficient directional control. This is the explanation for approach and landing; for takeoff the converse is true. The rudder applies a force to counter the crosswind forces as the aircraft accelerates down the runway. At the same time the tyres are accommodating these forces through sidewall torsion, and giving grip with the runway surface. As the aircraft transitions from a ground vehicle to a flying vehicle rudder input is stopped by the pilot and the aircraft will weathervane. The subsequent drift angle will allow the aircraft to fly on a straight course.|$|R
5000|$|... 31 May 1974 - East West Airlines Flight 752/753, {{operated}} by a Fokker F-27, was scheduled to fly from Sydney to Orange, Bathurst and back to Sydney. The flight was uneventful until approach to Bathurst; the first officer made a late decision to change from landing on runway 17 to runway 35 due to a light shower in the approach path. On late final the aircraft drifted {{to the left of}} the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and with rain increasing and moderate turbulence the pilot ordered a go-around just prior to the runway threshold. The aircraft impacted the runway 1240 m past the runway 35 threshold and slid on the ground for 625 m tearing the starboard engine from the wing. It was determined following investigation that during the climb, performance of the aircraft was adversely affected by an unpredictable encounter with a large change in the horizontal wind component, and an associated downdraft, at a height too low to effect recovery. There were no serious injuries however the aircraft was written off.|$|R
50|$|The {{co-pilot}} later acknowledged this message. It was {{the last}} communication with the ATC. As the landing gear retracted, the pitch angle of the two propellers simultaneously reached a value that {{is lower than the}} minimum values for flight. This setting caused the aircraft's speed and altitude to decrease rapidly. Few seconds later, the left engine and the right engine stopped, and the flight data recorders ceased functioning. The first impact marks are found on the south edge of the road RN1. They represent the two main landing gears and the fuselage tail cone. The left wing tip scratched across the road before hitting an embankment at {{the north side of the}} road RN1. Both wheels and blades came off from the aircraft. The aircraft bounced. At this point, the empennage and part of the right wing broke away, the aft portion of the fuselage turned around to the right and the aircraft came to rest 25 meters further away. At 09:05:42 (local tine),the aircraft disappeared from the radar screen. It was immediately found that the aircraft had crashed in a field seven hundred meters to the north of <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The aircraft, {{registered}} [...] {{had been}} chartered by Arrowsmith Holidays Ltd and had left Palma de Mallorca at 5:00 am, carrying holidaymakers {{back from the}} Balearic Islands to Manchester Airport. The approach controller vectored it towards the ILS {{as soon as it}} reached the Congleton NDB, but the pilots were apparently unable to put the aircraft on the extended <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and called an overshoot. As the aircraft was making a second approach to the airport, the No. 3 and 4 engines suddenly cut out over the town of Stockport. The No. 4 propeller was feathered, but No.3 kept windmilling. The aircraft became uncontrollable and crashed at 10:09 am local time in an open area between buildings close to the town centre. Despite the crash occurring in a densely populated area, there were no fatalities on the ground. Members of the public and police risked harm to save twelve people from the mangled debris, but within minutes the wreckage was entirely engulfed in flames, killing those remaining on board who had survived the impact.Because it was a Sunday and people were not at work the accident drew a large crowd, estimated at around 10,000, hampering the rescue organisations.|$|R
25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|R
50|$|Hamilton International is {{designed}} for use by large airplanes on overseas flights, and includes a 10006 x 200 ft asphalt <b>runway</b> with <b>centreline</b> lighting for low-visibility operations, and a smaller 6010 x 150 ft asphalt runway. It is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

The airport also hosts the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum. Hamilton can see cargo operations with very large aircraft such as the more commonly seen Antonov An-124 or an occasional Boeing 747. Because of this Hamilton has developed a niche community of aircraft spotters.|$|R
40|$|Several crosswind-related {{incidents}} {{show that}} landing under heavy crosswind conditions {{can be challenging}} for pilots and may {{pose a threat to}} aviation or at least lead to higher pilot workload and/or irregularities in operations. For transport aircraft the common approach technique for crosswind landings is the so-called crabbed approach with wings level and a windward heading correction. This technique requires alignment of the aircraft with the runway prior to touchdown in order to keep lateral loads of the landing gear and tyres as low as possible and to maintain the controllability on ground after touchdown. The German Aerospace Center Institute of Flight Systems has used the idea of steerable main gears and developed a crosswind landing assistance system. During approach all gear struts are automatically aligned with the runway so that no decrab manoeuvre is required. On ground the assistance system uses each steerable landing gear, differential braking, and the aerodynamic control surfaces to control and stabilise the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft is automatically aligned with the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and the still existing crab angle is slowly reduced. A simulator study with pilots in the loop using a model of a typical medium range transport aircraft was conducted in order to evaluate the benefits of such a landing technique. The study revealed that not only the aircraft controllability could be improved by landing in crabbed motion under strong crosswind conditions, but that the side forces acting on the landing gear can be reduced significantly as well. It was also shown that the use of steerable main landing gears is able to enlarge the spectrum of autoland operations, which is relatively limited at present in terms of maximum allowable crosswinds. All together the system has shown to be able to improve flight safety, lower the risk of weatherrelated delays due to go-arounds or diversions, and it also reduces structural loads on the landing gear during touchdown and landing...|$|R

50|$|In 1977, studies began into {{converting}} redundant commercial VC10s into aerial refuelling tankers; the RAF subsequently {{issued a}} contract to British Aerospace to convert five former BOAC VC10s and four former East African Airways Super VC10s, designated VC10 K2 and VC10 K3 respectively. During conversion, extra fuel tanks were installed in the former passenger cabin; these increased the theoretical maximum fuel load to 85 tons/77 tonnes (K2) and 90 tons/82 tonnes (K3), the Super VC10's fin fuel tank making the difference. In practice, the fuel load was capped by the maximum take-off weight before the tanks were full. Both variants featured a pair of wing-mounted refuelling pods and a single <b>centreline</b> refuelling <b>point,</b> known as a Hose Drum Unit (HDU), installed in the rear freight bay; nose-mounted refuelling probes were also fitted.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} complex flowfields found in combustion, {{it is often}} {{necessary}} to acquire an instantaneous overall view of the flowfield.

This technique offers advantages over other PIV methods in that the absolute velocity vector direction is known and data processing requirements are reduced. A method for calculating the mean exposure from particles on colour film, based on Mie scattering theory, is developed. A technique optimized for analysis of two-colour PIV images is described. Two-colour PIV is demonstrated in the wake of a noncombusting n-heptane fuelled bluff-body burner, which presented a suitably complex flowfield including counter-rotating recirculation zones and <b>centreline</b> stagnation <b>points.</b> To complement these results, mean velocities obtained with LDA are also presented.
