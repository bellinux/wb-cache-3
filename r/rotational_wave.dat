50|$|The {{spectra of}} centrosymmetric {{molecules}} exhibit alternating line intensities due to quantum state symmetry effects, since {{rotation of the}} molecule by 180° about a 2-fold rotation axis is equivalent to exchanging identical nuclei. In carbon dioxide, the oxygen atoms of the predominant isotopic species 12C16O2 have spin zero and are bosons, so that the total wavefunction must be symmetric when the two 16O nuclei are exchanged. The nuclear spin factor is always symmetric for two spin-zero nuclei, so that the rotational factor must also be symmetric which is true only for even-J levels. The odd-J rotational levels cannot exist and the allowed vibrational bands consist of only absorption lines from even-J initial levels. The separation between adjacent lines in the P- and R- branches is close to 4B rather than 2B as alternate lines are missing. For acetylene the hydrogens of 1H12C12C1H have spin ½ and are fermions, so the total wavefunction is antisymmetric when two 1H nuclei are exchanged. As is true for ortho and para hydrogen the nuclear spin function of the two hydrogens has three symmetric ortho states and one antisymmetric para states. For the three ortho states, the <b>rotational</b> <b>wave</b> function must be antisymmetric corresponding to odd J, and for the one para state it is symmetric corresponding to even J. The population of the odd J levels are therefore three {{times higher than the}} even J levels, and alternate line intensities are in the ratio 3:1.|$|E
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{the paper}} to present a new point of view on {{rotational}} elasticity in a nonlinear setting using orthogonal matrices. The proposed model, in the linear approximation, can be compared to the well known equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An appropriate kinetic energy is identified and we present a dynamical model of rotational elasticity. The propagation of elastic waves in such a medium is studied and we find two classes of <b>waves,</b> transversal <b>rotational</b> <b>waves</b> and longitudinal <b>rotational</b> <b>waves,</b> both of which are solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations. For certain parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be greater than the longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are identified where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases the potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the <b>rotational</b> <b>waves</b> to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the coupled system.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports a}} study of nonadiabatic (field-free) molecular alignment for linear molecules. The measurements were performed by measuring photoelectron ionization yields and white-light generation. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation, the dynamics of <b>rotational</b> <b>wave</b> packets of the molecules created by a linearly and/or circularly polarized pump pulse were measured by the electron photoionization yields that are produced by a delayed femtosecond probe beam. The photoelectron yields were measured as a function of the linearly polarized probe pulse delay for linearly and/or circularly polarized pump pulses, and revivals of the <b>rotational</b> <b>wave</b> packet were observed in N 2, O 2, CO 2, CO, and C 2 H 2 gases. The measured revival structures were compared to the quantum mechanically calculated time dependency of molecular alignment ((cos 2 ?)) parameter after the aligning (pump) pulse. The rotational constants of the molecules were also obtained by fitting the theoretically calculated alignment parameter to the measured data. The measured revival structures and rotational constants inferred from the measured data are in good agreement with the calculated results. The second part of the dissertation focuses on evolution of nonadibatic molecular alignment in nitrogen by measuring white-light generation. Again a linearly polarized pump pulse produced a molecular alignment which was measured via its nonlinear interaction effects by a variably delayed filament-producing probe pulse. The induced <b>rotational</b> <b>wave</b> packet was mapped as a function of the angular orientation difference between the polarization directions of the femtosecond pump and probe pulses.

Such movements are manifested by geological processes on the Earth and correlate with geophysical fields of the Earth.

It is shown that the geomedium has typical rheid properties [Carey, 1954], specifically an ability to flow while being in the solid state [Leonov, 2008]. Within the framework of the rotational model with a symmetric stress tensor, which is developed by the authors [Vikulin, Ivanchin, 1998; Vikulin et al., 2012 a, 2013], such movement of the geomedium may explain the energy-saturated state of the geomedium and a possibility of its movements in the form of vortex geological structures [Lee, 1928].   The article discusses the gravity wave detection method based on the concept of interactions between gravity waves and crustal blocks [Braginsky et al., 1985].

40|$|A new {{approximate}} Riemann solver for {{the equations}} of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with an isothermal {{equation of state}} is presented. The proposed method of solution draws on the recent work of Miyoshi and Kusano, {{in the context of}} adiabatic MHD, where an approximate solution to the Riemann problem is sought in terms of an average constant velocity and total pressure across the Riemann fan.
