40|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} demonstrate promising {{potential for}} skin friction reduction in naval and hydrodynamic applications. Recent developments of superhydrophobic surfaces aiming for scalable applications use random distribution of roughness, such as spray coating and etched process. However, most of previous {{analyses of the}} interaction between flows and superhydrophobic surfaces studied periodic geometries that are economically feasible only in lab-scale experiments. We conduct direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows over randomly patterned interfaces considering a range of texture widths w^+≈ 4 - 26, and solid fractions ϕ_s= 11 % to 25 %. Slip and no-slip boundary conditions are implemented in a pattern, modeling the presence of gas-liquid interfaces and solid elements. Our results indicate that slip of <b>randomly</b> <b>distributed</b> textures under turbulent flows are about 30 % less than those of surfaces with aligned features of the same size. In the small texture size limit w^+≈ 4, the slip length of the <b>randomly</b> <b>distributed</b> textures in turbulent flows is well described by a previously introduced Stokes flow solution of <b>randomly</b> <b>distributed</b> shear-free holes. By comparing DNS results for patterned slip and no-slip boundary against the corresponding homogenized slip length boundary conditions, we show that turbulent flows over <b>randomly</b> <b>distributed</b> posts can be represented by an isotropic slip length in streamwise and spanwise direction. The average pressure fluctuation on gas pocket {{is similar to that of}} the aligned features with the same texture size and gas fraction, but the maximum interface deformation at the leading edge of the roughness element is about twice larger when the textures are <b>randomly</b> <b>distributed.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 7 figue...|$|R
