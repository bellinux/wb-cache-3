40|$|The main {{factors of}} the {{developmental}} environment of marine source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> continental margin basins have their specificality. This realization, in return, {{has led to the}} recognition that the developmental environment and pattern of marine source rocks, especially for the source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> continental margin basins, are still controversial or poorly understood. Through the analysis of the trace elements and maceral data, the developmental environment of Miocene marine source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Qiongdongnan Basin is reconstructed, and the developmental patterns of the Miocene marine source rocks are established. This paper attempts to reveal the hydrocarbon potential of the Miocene marine source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> different environment and speculate the quality of source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> bathyal region of the continental slope without exploratory well. Our results highlight the palaeoenvironment and its control on the formation of Miocene marine source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Qiongdongnan Basin of the northern South China Sea and speculate the hydrocarbon potential of the source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the bathyal region. This study provides a window for better understanding the main factors influencing the marine source <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the continental margin basins, including productivity, preservation conditions, and the input of terrestrial organic matter...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{use of the}} phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands were studied and following results were obtained: (1) It {{may be possible to}} use as powdered phosphate fertilizer because of the following reasons: (a) The phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands contain, as compared with the <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the others, less fluorine and much more zinc, manganese, and copper. (b) The phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in,</b> [...] the Ryukyu Islands have a high value of 2 % citric acid soluble phosphoric acid. (2) The high value of 2 % citric acid soluble phosphoric acid of the fused phosphate produced from Ryukyu's phosphorite and serpentine makes the phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands an invaluably useful phosphorite as a raw material of fused phosphate fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|Surveying the {{phosphate}} <b>rock</b> deposits <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands，the writer found that, in the Ryukyu Islands the {{phosphate rock}} deposits might be grouped into two main types as follows; (1) Calcarious phosphate <b>rocks.</b> …… deposit <b>in</b> pocket form on hills near seashores．(2) Iron,aluminium　phosphate <b>rocks.</b> ……deposit　<b>in</b>　calcium　cave. Principal components were determined {{in order to}} clarify chemical characteristics of the phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands. Besides the phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands which were mainly investigated，the following rocks and minerals were also tested for a comparative study；（ａ）Phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the South Sea Islands（ｂ）Continental phosphate rocks（ｃ）Apatites <b>in</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> The phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> the Ryukyu Islands contain more iron，aluminium and silica than others, and a close correlation exists among these components. This fact suggests that the phosphate rocks contain iron and aluminium as silicate...|$|R

5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table <b>Rock</b> <b>in</b> 1948, and a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table <b>Rock</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s.

5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread.

The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{alternative}} rock's declining popularity, {{some artists}} retained mainstream relevance. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into {{the start of}} the 21st century, when bands like Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States. At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> subsequent years.|$|E
