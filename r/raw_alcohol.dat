Initially the melodeons had mechanical reed organs which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of cabaret which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor. The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured can-can dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often <b>raw</b> <b>alcohol</b> with an added coloring.|$|E

In this study, we describe the in vivo role of miR- 155 in ALD. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) (C 57 /BL 6 J) or miR- 155 knockout (KO) and TLR 4 KO mice received Lieber DeCarli diet for 5 weeks. Some mice received corn oil or CCl 4 for 2 or 9 weeks. RESULTS: We found that miR- 155 KO mice are protected from alcohol-induced steatosis and inflammation. The reduction in alcohol-induced fat accumulation in miR- 155 KO mice was associated with increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) alpha (miR- 155 target) binding and decreased MCP 1 production. Treatment with a miR- 155 inhibitor increased PPARgamma expression in naive and <b>alcohol</b> treated <b>RAW</b> macrophages. <b>Alcohol</b> increased lipid metabolism gene expression (FABP 4, LXRalpha, ACC 1 and LDLR) in WT mice and this was prevented in KO mice. Alcohol diet caused {{an increase in the}} number of CD 163 (+) CD 206 (+) infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in WT mice, which was prevented in miR- 155 KO mice. Kupffer cells isolated from miR- 155 KO mice exhibited predominance of M 2 phenotype when exposed to M 1 polarized signals and this was due to increased C/EBPbeta. Pro-fibrotic genes were attenuated in miR- 155 KO mice after alcohol diet or CCl 4 treatment. Compared to WT mice, attenuation in CCl 4 induced hydroxyproline and alpha-SMA was observed in KO mice. Finally, we show TLR 4 signaling regulates miR- 155 as TLR 4 KO mice showed no induction of miR- 155 after alcohol diet. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively our results demonstrated the role of miR- 155 in alcohol-induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis in vivo...|$|R

Then, the NRTL and Henry’s law thermodynamic models were chosen. Simulation results of particular compositions of the selected compounds in the different extractions were analysed and compared with experimental measurements. Simulations represented faithfully the behaviour of compounds in the industrial plants. Therefore, it was possible for two totally separated cases to illustrate the interest of simulation software; for neutral spirit production to determine new operation set points in order to maximise productivity and improve quality for neutral spirit production and for bitter orange distillate production, to explain the choice of different cuts and the role of the presence of peels during distillation...|$|E

The degree of pollution by fusel oils is above the requirements needed for further treatment which in turn requires an ad-ditional rectification. For this reason the process of periodic rectification needs continuous express control. The rapid method of the determination of the com position of crude alcohol using diagrams composition-properties was developed.

40|$|As an {{important}} chemical <b>raw</b> material, <b>alcohols</b> {{can be used}} as fuels, solvents and chemical feedstocks to produce a variety of downstream products. With limited fossil fuel resources, alcohol synthesis from syngas reactions can be a potential alternative to the traditional petroleum based alcohol synthesis. Among many catalysts active for syngas to alcohol processes, alkali promoted Mo 2 C has shown promising performance. More interestingly, the alkali promoter was found to play {{an important}} role in shifting the reaction selectivity from hydrocarbons to alcohols. However, limited understanding of the mechanism of this alkali promoter effect is available due to the complexity of syngas reaction mechanism and low content of alkali added to the catalysts. In this thesis, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the alkali promoter effect with density functional theory (DFT) calculations as our primary tool. We first examine various Mo 2 C surfaces to determine a representative surface structure active to alkali adsorption. On this particular surface, we develop a syngas reaction network including relevant reaction mechanisms proposed in previous literature. With energetics derived from DFT calculations and a BEP relation, we predict the syngas reaction selectivity and find it to be in excellent agreement with experimental results. The dominant reaction mechanism and selectivity determining steps are determined from sensitivity analysis. We also propose a formation mechanism of alkali promoters on Mo 2 C catalysts that shows consistency between experimental IR and DFT computed vibrational frequencies. Finally, the effect of alkali promoters on the selectivity determining steps for syngas reactions are investigated from DFT calculations and charge analysis. We are able to rationalize the role of alkali promoters in shifting the reaction selectivity from hydrocarbons to alcohols on Mo 2 C catalysts. Ph. D...|$|R

O leite cru (250 litros) foi dividido em duas porções que foram armazenadas em tanques de expansão a 4 ? 1 ºC por seis dias. Uma porção foi adicionada de CO 2 grau alimentício até que o pH do leite atingisse 6, 20, enquanto a outra serviu de controle. O leite cru foi avaliado quanto ao pH, acidez, prova do álcool, composição físico-química, proteólise, lipólise, cor e concentração de CO 2 após a injeção. Para caracterização microbiológica, o leite cru foi avaliado quanto à contagem padrão em placas e de micro-organismos psicrotróficos no dia da recepção e após seis dias de armazenamento refrigerado. As amostras foram submetidas ao tratamento UHT por injeção direta de vapor (143 ºC/ 4 s), envasadas em embalagens tetra brik asseptic de 125 ml e armazenadas em BOD a 25, 35 e 45 ºC por 180 dias. No dia seguinte, as amostras foram avaliadas quanto as mesmas características do leite cru, além da prova do álcool, viscosidade, sedimentação, eletroforese, peptídeos por HPLC e esterilidade comercial.

O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o de sub-sub-parcelas divididas e o experimento foi repetido três vezes. O efeito do tratamento, da temperatura e do tempo de armazenamento, e a interação destes fatores sobre as características do leite UHT foi avaliado por análise de variância (ANOVA) e teste de Tukey ao nível de 5 % de significância. Após seis dias de armazenamento refrigerado, não houve diferença significativa nas características físico-químicas do leite adicionado ou não de CO 2, exceto na quantidade de ácido graxos livres que foi maior no leite controle do que no adicionado de CO 2. A adição de CO 2 inibiu o desenvolvimento de micro-organismos durante o armazenamento refrigerado, uma vez que a contagem total e de psicrotróficos do leite controle foi maior que as contagens do leite adicionado de CO 2. O pH das amostras de leite UHT armazenadas a diferentes temperaturas foi afetado pela temperatura e pelo tempo de armazenamento, apresentando maior decréscimo do pH nas amostras armazenadas a 45 ºC. A cor das amostras a 25 °C não apresentou escurecimento durante os 180 dias, enquanto as armazenadas a 35 °C e 45 °C apresentaram desenvolvimento de cor visível a olho nu e aumento no valor b* ao longo do tempo.

The experimental design was split-split-plot and the complete experiment was repeated three times. The effect of treatment, temperature and storage period as well as the interaction of these factors on the characteristics of UHT milk was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey¿s test at 5 % significance level. After six days of cold storage, there was no significant difference in the physicochemical characteristics of raw milk with or without CO 2 addition, except for free fatty acid values, which were higher for the milk without CO 2 addition. The addition of CO 2 inhibited the development of microorganisms during storage, since the standard plate count and psychrotrophic count of milk control was higher than values for the CO 2 added milk. The pH of UHT milk samples was affected by temperature and storage time, showing greater decrease in pH for samples stored at 45 °C. The color of the samples at 25 °C showed no browning during the 180 days, while those stored at 35 ° C and 45 ° C showed brown color visible to the naked eye and an increased b * value over time. Lipolysis of UHT milk samples was higher for samples stored at 45 °C. The proteolysis was higher in milk stored at 45 °C, whose increase was not reflected in viscosity and sedimentation of the milk, since these parameters were not significantly affected during 120 days-storage, period of shelf life usually guaranteed by the processing industries of UHT milk in Brazi...|$|R
