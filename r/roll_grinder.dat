Then, Farrel, under Liebergesell’s direction, focused exclusively on its core operations of plastic and rubber equipment.

Research on the {{vibration}} {{performance of the}} grinder measuring device and its anti-vibration ability {{is very important to}} improve the measuring and grinding accuracy of the <b>roll</b> <b>grinder.</b> According to the problems of real vibration test difficulty and too many unknown parameters for theoretical analysis, a method of integrating theoretical analysis and simulation test is put forward. A vibration analysis virtual prototype of the measuring device is built using ADAMS/Vibration, and then the system natural frequencies, mode shapes and frequency response are solved to conduct free vibration analysis, providing the base for the design and optimization of the measuring device...|$|E

In the article, the vibration resistance of spindle system in grinding head of roller grinding machine is studied by means of harmonic response and modal analysis, by using the method of the transfer matrix, obtained the first five orders of the natural frequency of spindle system. By studying the M 84100 A type spindle system in grinding head of roller grinding machine, obtained {{the conclusion that the}} natural frequency was far from the work frequency, so laid a foundation of the spindle system dynamic design. Preface With the improvement of product quality requirements, the precision of <b>roll</b> <b>grinder</b> is increasing [1]. As {{an important part of the}} <b>roll</b> <b>grinder,</b> the Spindle system static and dynamic performance directly affects the overall performance and the roll accuracy and surface quality[2]. In this paper, choose M 84100 A type roll grinding machine spindle system as the research object mainly used the transfer matrix method to analyze the vibration resistance of the spindle system. The transfer matrix method The transfer matrix method is mainly used for bending vibrations of the shaft components, torsional vibration and torsional vibration of the drive system to establish dynamics model. The method uses a lumped mass modeling, it can be used to deal with elastic support, multi-sectional, multi-supporting structure, the transfer matrix can measure the impact of the gyroscopic and unbalanced moment easily [3, 4]. The transfer matrix of the right end massless shaft segment The transfer matrix links the two points of the system state vector. Usually the two selected points are those points of forming a component boundary[5]. The shaft segment elements.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a process controller {{aimed at improving}} the surface quality generated by traverse grinding, avoiding the surface defects caused by vibrations onset. The innovation provided by the proposed controller consists in suppressing vibration occurrence {{by means of a}} model-based and self-learning approach: a monitoring layer classifies occurring problems and a control logic exploits these indications to select the proper mitigation actions. Since wheel-regenerative chatter represents {{one of the most important}} problems during traverse grinding in terms of achievable productivity and finishing quality, the main control variable is the wheel velocity. This variable is tuned exploiting an adaptive Speed tuning Map computed by the controller using a heuristic approach and learning methodology. The control can manage also the other sources of vibration by means of proper identification and mitigation strategies. Experimental tests are carried out on a <b>roll</b> <b>grinder</b> to validate the control system. Good performances are achieved after some training tests to allow controller learning...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a process controller {{aimed at improving}} {{the performance of the}} surface quality generated by traverse grinding process, avoiding the limitation caused by vibrations onset. Not many examples of grinding process control devoted to vibration control {{can be found in the}} specific literature and the innovation provided by the proposed controller consists in suppressing vibration occurrence by means of a robust approach that exploits both model-based and self- learning functionalities. The designed control system has two basic functions: the recognition of machining situation, as anomalous vibration or onset of chatter and the decision making about the control actions. In the studied case vibrations are mainly caused by wheel regenerative chatter and therefore the main control variable that is controlled is the wheel velocity, which is tuned exploiting an adaptive Speed tuning Map computed from the controller by using an heuristic approach and learning methodology. Experimental tests has been carried out on a <b>roll</b> <b>grinder</b> to validate the control system and good performance is achieved after some training tests for the tuning of the controller parameters...|$|E
50|$|In 1840, Heinrich Adolf Waldrich founded Maschinenfabrik H.A. Waldrich in Siegen, {{which was}} part of the Prussian {{province}} Westphalia at that time. Initially, the company manufactured pumps, pulleys and fans for furnaces. The first steam engine was designed and manufactured in 1863, followed by the first turning machine. When the company founder Heinrich Adolf Waldrich died in 1879, his son of the same name took over the company management. During the following years, the company’s product portfolio was extended. The first roll lathe was manufactured in 1897, the production of the first <b>roll</b> <b>grinders</b> started in 1920. The company management was taken over by Oskar Waldrich, the grandson of the company founder, after the First World War. The number of employees was 20 at that time. Under his management, new markets were developed. E.g. Maschinenfabrik H.A. Waldrich delivered the first machines to Russia in 1927. During the Second World War, the production halls of the company were destroyed almost completely by bombing raids on Siegen in 1944.The product line of portal milling machines was launched in 1961, when the company merged with Ingersoll Milling Machine Co., USA. Ingersoll brought the milling technique that originally came from America to the European market. Therefore, Waldrich Siegen-Ingersoll GmbH was founded. A new production hall was needed for the manufacturing of the high performance portal milling machines, due to the size and weight of the machines. Thus, a new production site with tool machines was built on the greenfield in Burbach. After completing the new building in 1981, the company’s headquarter moved from Siegen to Burbach. WaldrichSiegen had been acquired by Ingersoll in 1971. Waldrich Coburg was integrated in the concern in 1986.After the insolvency of Ingersoll, USA, the companies WaldrichSiegen and Waldrich Coburg were acquired by the owner family of Maschinenfabrik Herkules in 2004. The owners decided to sell Waldrich Coburg again in 2005.Today, WaldrichSiegen Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH is an independent and autonomous company within the medium-sized and owner-managed HerkulesGroup. In the future, WaldrichSiegen is going to appear jointly on the market with UnionChemnitz, which {{has been part of the}} HerkulesGroup since June 2011.|$|R
