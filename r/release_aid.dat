50|$|The {{choice of}} a {{mechanical}} <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> versus a finger tab must be accounted for in a compound bow's tuning and sighting, as well as {{choice of a}}rrow rest, as finger-released arrows will group in a different spot when using a mechanical <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> versus a finger tab. Likewise, the choice of arrow rest for a compound bow depends on whether a finger release archery tab or mechanical <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> is used. For a finger-released arrow, a plunger pin is most commonly used as the arrow rest, to impart a tuned impulse laterally to the arrow {{at the moment of}} release to improve point-of-impact groupings. In contrast, for a <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> configuration, a Whisker-biscuit arrow rest is very commonly used with a compound bow.|$|E
5000|$|Lastly, {{many modern}} {{compound}} bows {{are designed to}} be shot using a <b>release</b> <b>aid.</b> They are designed with solid limb stops and fine planes of motion. This increases the chance of the bow string [...] "jumping" [...] off the cams if a <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> is not used.|$|E
5000|$|Compound archers {{often use}} a {{mechanical}} <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> {{to hold and}} release the string. (This is mostly used on Compound Bows.) This attaches to the bowstring near {{the point where the}} arrow attaches, the nocking point, and permits the archer to release the string with a squeeze of a trigger or a slight increase of tension. The use of a <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> gives a more consistent release than the use of fingers on the string as it minimises the arrow oscillation which is inevitable when the bowstring is released directly from the fingers.|$|E
50|$|Thumb switch <b>release</b> <b>aids</b> are {{the most}} complicated, with the most moving parts of the three most common releases. They work on the {{depression}} of a thumb switch that is mounted to a T-handle's style of release. The attraction to these <b>release</b> <b>aids</b> are {{that they are a}} good midpoint between a caliper and back tension style of <b>release</b> <b>aids,</b> making the transition {{from one to the other}} a little smoother over a longer period of time.|$|R

50|$|The first {{advantage}} {{of using a}} <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> is the drastic decrease in chance of dry firing a compound bow. Doing this {{runs the risk of}} damaging the bow, and can result in the injury of the user.|$|E
50|$|In archery, a <b>release</b> <b>aid,</b> {{mechanical}} release, or {{release is}} {{a device that}} helps to fire arrows more precisely, by using a trigger to release the bowstring, rather than the archer's fingers. It is {{used to make the}} release of the bowstring quicker and reducing the amount of torque put onto the bowstring from the archer's fingers.|$|E
5000|$|Archers using {{compound}} bows {{most commonly}} use a <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> {{to hold the}} string and release it precisely, although finger tabs are also popular with compound bows, especially among older archers who have used finger tabs when shooting recurve bows. The <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> attaches to the bowstring just below the nocking point or at the D loop and permits the archer to release the string {{by the use of}} some form of trigger. When such a device was first invented (patent filed in USA, 1879) it was known as a [...] "clutch". The trigger may be an actual trigger lever which is depressed by a finger or thumb (positive), or held and then released (negative); there are numerous types. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have [...] "back tension" [...] triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or [...] "true back tension"; the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached.|$|E

50|$|A <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> is a {{mechanical}} device {{designed to give}} a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist. In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.|$|E
50|$|Using a <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> {{can also}} {{make it easier to}} group your arrows tighter together, due to a {{consistent}} release that is put on the bowstring every time, rather than using finger muscles to hold back the weight of the bow, which makes the release of the bowstring harder to replicate consistently. This is true not only under high pressure situations, but also in any regular practice.|$|E
50|$|The arrow is {{typically}} released by relaxing {{the fingers of}} the drawing hand (see Bow draw), or triggering the mechanical <b>release</b> <b>aid.</b> Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also {{pay attention to the}} recoil or follow through of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.|$|E

50|$|After a rough start, {{he becomes}} a trusted ally and friend of Clark Kent. Green Arrow retains his many unique arrows and {{demonstrates}} expert archery skill, along with skilled use of a crossbow. In Smallville, Oliver was given a new modern costume that had equipment designed by his company. Green Arrow also makes extensive use of an adapted PSE (Precision Shooting Equipment) compound bow, shot using fingers, rather than an archery tab or <b>release</b> <b>aid,</b> although his gauntlets serve as both a shooting glove and an armguard.|$|E
50|$|The bowstring {{and arrow}} are held with three fingers, {{or with a}} {{mechanical}} arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. Instinctive shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in {{the first or second}} joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical <b>release</b> <b>aid,</b> the release is hooked onto the D-loop.|$|E
50|$|Even with a <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> {{mechanism}} some of {{this effect}} is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing {{to one side and}} then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when dry firing. Dry firing refers to releasing the bow string without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.|$|E
50|$|Back tension <b>release</b> <b>aids</b> are the {{simplest}} mechanically, {{with only one}} moving part. However, {{as a result of}} this, they are the hardest style of release to learn how to use. The aid relies on the muscle tension through the forearms and back in order to release the latch {{at the end of the}} T-handle's leg. These releases are known for their accuracy and dependability on the tournament archery scene. They depend on the fulcrum of a lever over a half-moon-shaped piece of metal in order for the release to go off.|$|R

50|$|Subsequent to the {{outbreak}} of hostilities with NATO, Belgrade received no foreign aid from the United States and other west European countries, but has received much aid from other countries such as Russia, China, and Greece. Since October 2000, however, the European Union aid has steadily increased, and U.S. restrictions on aid have fallen away as the union of Serbia and Montenegro stepped forward to meet its international obligations. In June 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was able to certify that Serbia and Montenegro relationship with the Republika Srpska {{was consistent with the}} Dayton Accords, had released all political prisoners, and was cooperating with ICTY. As a result, the United States is now free to <b>release</b> <b>aid</b> money and support Serbia and Montenegro in international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank. Total U.S. aid to Serbia and Montenegro, including debt forgiveness, exceeded $180 million in fiscal year 2002. The U.S. is the single-largest donor of aid to Serbia and Montenegro.|$|E
5000|$|The Korean Bow (각궁, Gak-gung hanja: , or horn bow) is a {{water buffalo}} horn-based {{composite}} reflex bow, standardized about centuries ago {{from a variety}} of similar weapons in earlier use. Due to its long use by Koreans, it is also known as Guk Gung (국궁 hanja: , or national bow). The Korean bow utilizes a thumb draw and therefore employing the use of a thumb ring is quite common. The Korean thumb ring is somewhat different from the Manchu, Mongol, or the Turkish Thumb Ring, as it comes in two styles, male and female. Male thumb rings are shaped with a small protrusion that sticks out that the bowstring hooks behind (similar to a <b>release</b> <b>aid),</b> while the female thumb ring simply covers the front joint of the thumb as protection from getting blisters (pulling heavy bows repetitively with only the thumb can easily cause blisters to form on the pad of the thumb). [...] Also, the arrow is laid {{on the right side of}} the bow, unlike the western bow, where the arrow is laid on the left side of the bow.|$|E

In particular, semi-empirical procedures are described that incorporate newly-derived, country-specific building inventories and vulnerability functions as well as day/night population distributions within these structures. These data sets, now available online, constitute the key ingredients for our semi-empirical model and form the foundation for PAGER’s fully analytical loss model, described in a companion paper...|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanical}} release permits {{a single point}} of contact on the string instead of three fingers as most commonly used with finger tabs. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release. This is primarily because the most successful types operate with positive pressure, whereas the conventional 'fingers' release is negative pressure. Some archers prefer three fingers under the arrow with a finger tab, whereas the split-finger approach, having one finger above the arrow and two fingers below the arrow is the most commonly used finger shooting method amongst English and modern North American archers, who do not use mechanical <b>release</b> <b>aids.</b>|$|R
