60|$|Richard dying without lawful issue, the {{succession}} to his dominions again became dubious. They consisted of various territories, governed by various <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> {{and all of}} them uncertain. There were two competitors: the first was Prince John, youngest son of Henry the Second; the other was Arthur, son of Constance of Bretagne, by Geoffrey, the third son of that monarch. If the right of consanguinity were only considered, the title of John to the whole succession had been indubitable. If the right of representation had then prevailed, which now universally prevails, Arthur, as standing in the place of his father, Geoffrey, had a solid claim. About Brittany there was no dispute. Anjou, Poitou, Touraine, and Guienne declared in favor of Arthur, on the principle of representation. Normandy was entirely for John. In England the point of law had never been entirely settled, but it seemed rather inclined to the side of consanguinity. Therefore in England, where this point was dubious at best, the claim of Arthur, an infant and a stranger, had little force against the pretensions of John, declared heir by the will of the late king, supported by his armies, possessed of his treasures, and {{at the head of a}} powerful party. He secured in his interests Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Glanville, the chief justiciary, and by them the body of the ecclesiastics and the law. It is remarkable, also, that he paid court to the cities and boroughs, which is the first instance of that policy: but several of these communities now happily began to emerge from their slavery, and, taking advantage of the necessities and confusion of the late reign, increased in wealth and consequence, and had then first attained a free and regular form of administration. The towns new to power declared heartily in favor of a prince who was willing to allow that their declaration could confer a right. The nobility, who saw themselves beset by the Church, the law, and the burghers, had taken no measures, nor even a resolution, and therefore had nothing left but to concur in acknowledging the title of John, whom they knew and hated. But though they were not able to exclude him from {{the succession}}, they had strength enough to oblige him to a solemn promise of restoring those liberties and franchises which they had always claimed without having ever enjoyed or even perfectly understood. The clergy also took advantage of the badness of his title to establish one altogether as ill founded. Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the speech which he delivered at the king's coronation, publicly affirmed that the crown of England was of right elective. He drew his examples in support of this doctrine, not from the histories of the ancient Saxon kings, although a species of election within a certain family had then frequently prevailed, but from the history of the first kings of the Jews: without doubt in order to revive those pretensions which the clergy first set up in the election of Stephen, and which they had since been obliged to conceal, but had not entirely forgotten.|$|E
50|$|It {{is rarely}} {{possible}} to confirm biological parenthood, however, (see bastardy) {{in the case}} of ancient family lines; in addition the progenitor is often a distant ancestor, only known as a result of oral tradition. Where people groups and communities rely solely on a patrilinear family line, their common ancestor often became the subject of a legend surrounding the origin of the family. By contrast, families and peoples with a matrilinear history trace themselves back to an original female progenitrix. Matrilinear <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> are found in about 200 of the 1300 known indigenous peoples and ethnic groups worldwide, whilst around 600 have patrilineal <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> (from father to son).|$|E

5000|$|The Omaha {{and other}} tribes asked the {{government}} to set aside territory for their mixed-race descendants. [...] Under the patrilineal systems of the Omaha and Osage, children of white fathers had {{no place in the}} tribes, where children belonged to their father's gens. Seeking to help mixed-blood Indian descendants get settled in society, the United States government designated allotments of land in western territory for their use. These were known as the Half-Breed Tracts. Because of American Indian tribes' <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and membership, European-American society's discrimination, and the distance that such mixed-race families lived from most European Americans, the children of unions between European fathers and certain Indian mothers were often left outside the social networks of both societies. Generally Indian women and their French-Canadian trader husbands and children lived under the protection of the women's tribes, but their descendants were not considered members of the tribes unless they were officially adopted, as they had white fathers, so were considered [...] "white".|$|E

5000|$|As {{relations}} between the United States government and the tribes became more complex, the mixed-race children often were excluded from benefiting both from the federal laws governing Indians and the political rights of their fathers because of discrimination on both sides. The tribes had their own kinship systems and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and inheritance. For instance, the Omaha had a patrilineal system, and considered mixed-race children of European or [...] "white" [...] fathers to be white unless formally adopted into the tribe by a man. Other tribes had matrilineal systems, and children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their status from her. Due to hypodescent (assignment of children of a mixed union to the subordinate group) {{and the fact that}} many of the mixed-race children grew up in tribes on the frontier, Europeans tended to classify them as being more Indian than white. Their fathers' living [...] "outside" [...] civilized society as mountain men was part of this idea. The Omaha and other tribal leaders advocated setting land aside for the mixed-blood descendants; usually the intent was to award land to male heads of families.|$|E
50|$|More often, {{letters patent}} {{are used to}} create peerages. Letters patent must {{explicitly}} name {{the recipient of the}} title and specify the course of descent; the exact meaning of the term is determined by common law. Normally, the patent specifies the peer's heirs-male of the body as successors; in such a case, the rules of agnatic succession apply, meaning that succession is through the male line only. Some very old titles, like the Earldom of Arlington, may pass to heirs of the body (not just heirs-male), these follow the same <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> as do baronies by writ and seem able to fall into abeyance as well. Many Scottish titles allow for passage to heirs-general of the body, in which case the rules of male primogeniture apply; they do not fall into abeyance, as under Scots law, sisters are not treated as equal co-heirs. English and British letters patent that do not specify a course of descent are invalid, though the same is not true for the letters patent creating peers in the Peerage of Scotland. The House of Lords has ruled in certain cases that when the course of descent is not specified, or when the letters patent are lost, the title descends to heirs-male.|$|E

50|$|Seisin is now {{confined}} to {{possession of the}} freehold, though at one time {{it appears to have}} been used for simple possession without regard to the estate of the possessor. Its importance is considerably less than it was at one time, owing to the old form of conveyance by feoffment with livery of seisin having been superseded by a deed of grant, and the old <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> from the person last seised having been abolished in favour <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> from the purchaser. Lord Denning controversially supported the abolition of the concept of seisin, however the common law has since decided to maintain the concept of seisin. At one time the right of the wife to dower and of the husband to an estate by curtesy depended upon the doctrine of seisin. The Dower Act (1833-1834), however, rendered the fact of the seisin of the husband of no importance, and the Married Women's Property Act 1882 practically abolished the old law of curtesy.|$|R

30|$|The {{second largest}} {{disparity}} in adult mortality (40 q 30) appears by the income {{level of the}} married daughter‚Äôs family. Usually, Indian families adhere to a patriarchal ideology, follow the patrilineal <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> and are patrilocal in nature. With {{the exception of a}} few tribes in Northeast India, daughters move to their husband‚Äôs house after marriage. There is therefore no reason to believe that parents‚Äô survival status depends on the income level of a married daughter‚Äôs family. Yet, the economic condition of the married daughter‚Äôs family can be a proxy for a parent‚Äôs own economic condition because the majority of Indian marriages are either arranged marriages or marriages collectively decided by daughters and their parents with a focus on matching caste, income, education, food preferences, etc. (Allendorf and Pandian, 2016). Thus, the mortality differential by income level of a married daughter‚Äôs family may be the result of their own economic disparity. Both caste- and religion-based disparities in adult life expectancy are much lower than the disparity observed by level of education. This is consistent with the pattern observed in under-five mortality in India (IIPS and Macro 2007).|$|R
40|$|Edmund Leach's data on {{kinship and}} {{marriage}} {{is the starting}} point for a network analysis of marriage exchange and the bilateral devolution of property. The analysis resolves the "Dravidian controversy" over the possibility of fit between the egocentric perspective of dual organization encoded in the Dravidian languages of South Asia and a sociocentric dual organization that is NOT based on matrimonial moieties and unilineal descent, but a more flexible and network-based application of marriage strategies. A network concept of "sidedness" is developed as a new alternative to the moiety concept for dual matrimonial organization. In a significant number of cases where Pul Eliyan villagers marry cousins or other types of consanguineal kin, perfect sidedness is maintained in the actual network of kinship and marriage relations, consistent with the Dravidian "two-sided" terminology of direct matrimonial exchange. The Pul Eliya material illustrates a system <b>of</b> social <b>rules</b> and strategies that are reconciled against each other in the freedom to realign and readjust terminological discrepancies in favor of a continually reemergent but consistent network structure of dual matrimonial organization that lacks a basis in a strict <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century, the Vute were living in Adamawa. They had a matrilineal <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> and were locally organized under the authority of maternal uncles. The Fulani conquest and the founding of the two kingdoms of Banyo and Tibati pushed the Vute further, to the South of Adamawa, in an area of small savannahs and forests. The first generation lived there mostly like refugees, undergoing occasionnai incursions of the ≈•ulani cavalry. Until young men of the following generation trained in the art of hunting and having spun around themselves networks of dependants, destroyed the unilineal organization, killed the former chief-uncles, and organized powerful armies that would practice slave hunting among populations living along and south of the Sanaga. Part of the captives were given to the Fulani as a tribute, the rest of them being sold to Hausa merchants, in exchange of prestige goods that the Vute chief would distribute among his followers. In this process, relatively powerful small states were built all along the frontier of Vute country, the functioning of which was entirely depending on the practice of war. And those states just collapsed when the German administration imposed colonial peace. Siran Jean-Louis.

5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} military and socage tenures was the mode <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally hereditary, it had certainly become so {{at the time of the}} Conquest, and it descended to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held by knight-service as far as regarded the capital fief. The <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time followed the old pre-Conquest <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> Thus in the so-called [...] "Laws of Henry I" [...] The lands other than the capital fief and some socage lands were divided among all the sons equally. But by the time of Henry de Bracton the course <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> lands held by knight-service had so far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case of gavelkind. The military tenant was subject to the feudal incidents, from which the tenant in socage was exempt. These additional fees and obligations were often oppressive. Alienation of lands by will, except in a few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation inter vivos was restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir, in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a tenant had a greater power of alienation over land which he had purchased than over land which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind of land. The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna Carta that a free man should not give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount insufficient to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the rights of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeudation until the passing of the Statute of Quia Emptores. Alienation by a tenant-in-chief of the crown without licence was a ground of forfeiture until 1327, when a fine was substituted.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the kinship and marriage in action-groups of priest and priestess, called Tanggol, performing ritual service for the people of village along the eastern seashore of South Korea. The materials of the study come from my own participating observation of 2 years field-work, 1971 and 1972. It can be said that Tanggol has not been studied before in sociological or anthropological perspectives. It {{seems to me that it}} was very difficult to study because their community is rather closed from others. The name Tanggol, though used among themselves sometimes, is regarded by a man of religious relationship with village as a term of derision and disrepute. Until recently and even today, Tanggol have been despised, placed at the bottom of Korean society as one of the lowest in the social stratification. Tanggol have some caste-like characteristics, being an endogamous and occupational group but without religious sanction and structural scheme. The paper mainly concerns with, firstly, how to inherit an office in connection with a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and marriage. Secondly I tried to find out an exogamous rule in the conditioned minority. Exogamy is regarded as an ideal pattern, but it often can not be kept in practice. They should not marry with patrilineal and matrilateral kinsmen. At the same time they have maintained some bilateral tendency of kinship. Thirdly I analyzed social function of concubines among Tanggol. The concubinage also is not preferred, but permitted for the means to make their occupation more successful. It may be related with a role of women in performing rituals, which gives specific importance for Tanggol women...|$|R
50|$|For this reason, many {{scholars}} {{suggest that the}} original <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> Jewish <b>descent</b> must have been patrilineal, {{and that it was}} changed around the time of Ezra, or even later, at the time of Council of Jamnia, possibly under the influence of Roman law. There are several instances in the Bible where Israelite men marry Gentile women without direct mention of the women converting, although some like Zipporah and Rebecca were still insisting in the practices of their former families. For example, many of the Israelite kings married foreign princesses, and this {{does not seem to have}} prevented the children of these marriages from being considered among the Children of Israel and even succeeding to the throne.
