60|$|That {{checked his}} wildness. It brought {{him up with}} a <b>round</b> <b>turn.</b> His jaw fell, and he stared at her, lost now for words. Of this she took the fullest advantage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] advised Prescott, [...] "I'd walk round a {{few blocks}} first; you want to simmer down before you talk to a man like that. Go slow, and get a <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> on your temper." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{imparted}} {{it to me}} as freely as if I {{had been}} a part of himself.

6000|$|... ‘Oh, come!’ cried I, {{springing}} up and hurrying to the table. ‘You must excuse me!’ I wrote Romaine’s address. ‘There is my reference, Mr. Gilchrist. Until {{you have written}} to him, and received his negative answer, I {{have a right to}} be treated, and I shall see that you treat me, as a gentleman.’ He was brought up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> at that.|$|E
60|$|Bartley hid a yawn {{over his}} note-book, and probably, {{if he could}} have spoken his mind, he would have {{suggested}} to Lapham that he was not there for the purpose of interviewing his ancestry. But Bartley had learned to practise a patience with his victims which he did not always feel, and to feign an interest in their digressions till he could bring them up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

50|$|Three {{players from}} the June regular phase were among the ones who got away. Pitcher Bob Welch (Chicago Cubs, 14th round), infielder Paul Molitor (St. Louis, 28th round) and pitcher Eric Show (Minnesota, 36th <b>round)</b> <b>turned</b> down pro offers for college scholarships.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I will wager {{that you}} will do credit to it, lad," [...] Captain Dave said. [...] "You have proved that {{you are ready to}} turn your hand to any work that may come to you. You have shown a manly spirit, my boy, and I honour you for it; and by St. Anthony I believe that some day, unless a musket-ball or a pike-thrust brings you up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn,</b> you will live to get your own back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now do you know, {{it never}} came into my head that Jimmy Hedgehog would try to do me a bad turn because I had told {{what he said to}} poor Bobby. I had to answer the {{questions}} which the president asked, or I'd sure been brought up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn,</b> and I never said a word more than just enough to satisfy Mr. Crow; but for all that it seems Jimmy had it in for me good and hot.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was brought}} up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> at that. [...] "I beg your pardon, St. Ives," [...] said he. [...] "Believe me, I {{had no wish to}} be offensive.

But, at any rate, you must see for yourself this proposal of marriage is--is merely impossible, my dear fellow. It's nonsense! Our countries are at war; you are a prisoner." ...|$|E
50|$|On the {{following}} restart with 10 to go, a domino-effect stack-up <b>rounding</b> <b>Turns</b> 1 and 2 resulted in Danica Patrick being hit exiting Turn 2, {{sliding down the}} apron and slamming the inside wall on the backstretch, therefore bringing out the eighth and final caution.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I am not afeard, my Heart's-delight,' resumed the Captain, 'There's {{been most}} {{uncommon}} bad weather in them latitudes, there's no denyin', {{and they have}} drove and drove and been beat off, may be t'other side the world. But the ship's a good ship, and the lad's a good lad; and it ain't easy, thank the Lord,' the Captain made a little bow, 'to break up hearts of oak, whether they're in brigs or buzzums.

6000|$|... "Very good. The {{old man and}} his nephew, {{him with}} the blue coat, can have the two empty bunks. But you must speak to that man, Amos. I'll have no philandering aboard my ship, lad--no {{whispering}} or cuddling or any such foolishness. Tell him that this ship is just a bit broke off from Boston, and he'll {{have to put up}} with Boston ways until he gets off her. They've been good enough for better men than him. You give me the French for 'no philandering,' and I'll bring him up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> when he drifts." ...|$|E

"All {{this was}} nuts to Mis Bascum, and she kep' advisin' and encouragin' of me, and I didn't see through her a mite, or guess that settin' folks by the ears was as relishin' {{to her as}} bitters is to some. Merciful, suz! what a piece a work we did make betwixt us! I scolded and moped 'cause I couldn't have my way; Lisha swore and {{threatened}} to take to drinkin' ef I didn't make home more comfortable; the children run wild, {{and the house was}} gittin' too hot to hold us, when we was brought up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn,</b> and I see the redicklousness of my doin's in time.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 50 laps to go. The sixth caution of {{the race}} flew with 47 laps {{to go for a}} single-car wreck in <b>turn</b> 2. <b>Rounding</b> <b>turn</b> 1, Kasey Kahne tapped the left-rear corner of Greg Biffle, got him loose and sent him into the wall.|$|R

6000|$|... "Name them! {{it is no}} easy {{matter to}} call off the stars, {{for the simple reason}} that they are so numerous. Name them, indeed! Why, my pretty niece, Miss Magnet, what do you think of that main-boom now? To my ignorant eyes, it is topped at least a foot too high; and then the pennant is foul; and--and--ay, d---me, if there isn't a topsail gasket adrift; and it wouldn't {{surprise}} me at all if there should be a <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> in that hawser, if the kedge were to be let go this instant. Faults indeed! No seaman could look at her a moment without seeing that she is as full of faults as a servant who has asked for his discharge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> and two half-hitches make a fast belay; and I would counsel {{no one who}} is out of {{the hands}} of these devils to unbar or {{unfasten}} anything in order to fall into them. As to the Quartermaster and myself, we are both elderly men, and not of much account to mankind in general, as honest Pathfinder would say; and it can make no great odds to him whether he balances the purser's books this year or the next; and as for myself, why, if I were on the seaboard, I should know what to do, but up here, in this watery wilderness, I can only say, that if I were behind that bit of a bulwark, it would take a good deal of Indian logic to rouse me out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, {{with his}} hand to his head; [...] "some such thought was in my mind this {{afternoon}} when I heard of your riding. Stay! I have it! I was at Ampthill, Ossory's place, just before I left. Some insupportable coxcomb was boasting a marvellous run with the hounds nigh across Hertfordshire, and Miss Manners brought him up with a <b>round</b> <b>turn</b> and a half hitch by relating one of your exploits, Richard Carvel. And take my word on't she got no small applause. She told how you had followed a fox over one of your rough provincial counties, which means three of Hertfordshire, with your arm broken, by Heaven! and how they lifted you off at the death. And, Mr. Carvel," [...] said my Lord, generously, looking at my flushed face, [...] "you must give me your hand for that." ...|$|E
