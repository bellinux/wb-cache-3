25|$|The hinge {{region of}} {{antithrombin}} in the Figure 5 complex {{could not be}} modelled due to its conformational flexibility, and amino acids P9-P14 are not seen in this structure. This conformational flexibility indicates an equilibrium may exist within the complex between a P14 P15 <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop inserted antithrombin conformation and a P14 P15 <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop expelled conformation. In support of this, analysis of the positioning of P15 Gly in the Figure 5 complex (labelled in model B) shows it to be inserted into beta sheet A (see model C).|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of heparin, amino acids P14 and P15 (see Figure 3) from the <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop are {{embedded}} within {{the main body of}} the protein (specifically the top of beta sheet A). This feature is in common with other serpins such as heparin cofactor II, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and MENT.|$|E
25|$|The {{conformational}} change most relevant for Factor IXa and Xa inhibition involves the P14 and P15 amino acids within the N-terminal {{region of the}} <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop (circled in Figure 4 model B). This region has been termed the hinge region. The {{conformational change}} within the hinge region in response to heparin binding results in the expulsion of P14 and P15 from {{the main body of}} the protein and it has been shown that by preventing this conformational change, increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition does not occur. It is thought that the increased flexibility given to the <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop as a result of the hinge region conformational change is a key factor in influencing increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition. It has been calculated that in the absence of the pentasaccharide only one in every 400 Antithrombin molecules (0.25%) is in an active conformation with the P14 and P15 amino acids expelled.|$|E

25|$|Upon binding to this {{pentasaccharide}} sequence, {{inhibition of}} protease activity is increased by heparin {{as a result}} of two distinct mechanisms. In one mechanism heparin stimulation of Factor IXa and Xa inhibition depends on a conformational change within antithrombin involving the <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop and is thus allosteric. In another mechanism stimulation of thrombin inhibition depends on the formation of a ternary complex between AT-III, thrombin, and heparin.|$|E
25|$|In the {{structures}} shown in Figure 5 the C-terminal portion (P' side) of the <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> loop {{is in an}} extended conformation when compared with other un-activated or heparin activated antithrombin structures. The P' region of antithrombin is unusually long relative to the P' region of other serpins and in un-activated or heparin activated antithrombin structures forms a tightly hydrogen bonded β-turn. P' elongation occurs through the breaking of all hydrogen bonds involved in the β-turn.|$|E
25|$|In {{the revised}} system of {{classification}} again {{adopted by the}} Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type II antithrombin deficiency remains subdivided into three subgroups: the already mentioned type II PE, along with type II RS, where mutations effect the <b>reactive</b> <b>site</b> and type II HBS, where mutations effect the antithrombin heparin binding site. For the purposes of an antithrombin mutational database compiled {{by members of the}} Plasma Coagulation Inhibitors Subcommittee of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type IIa cases are now classified as type II PE, type IIb cases as type II RS and type IIc cases as type II HBS.|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} in oil sorption capacity {{can be attributed}} to adsorption of crude oil molecules at the hydrophobic <b>reactive</b> <b>sites</b> and also diffusion into the pores or hollow lumen of the sorbents (Wang et al. 2012). The decrease, on the other hand, could be attributed to increase pressure and desorption occurring at these <b>reactive</b> <b>sites</b> when the sites are already saturated by crude oil molecules (Thompson et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Adiabatic oven {{testing of}} heat-affected and normal coal {{from the same}} {{location}} at Mandalong Mine shows substantial differences in intrinsic self-heating rates and self-heating behaviour. While initial self-heating rates of the heat-affected coal are greater than normal coal under site conditions, there is no sustained self-heating to thermal runaway due to {{a decrease in the}} number of <b>reactive</b> <b>sites</b> remaining in the heat-affected coal and greater inaccessibility to those sites that do exist. This behaviour is attributable to the vesicular nature of the heat-affected coal contributing to easy access to open pores resulting in the initial burst of self-heating. However, the thermal alteration of the coal also contributes to destruction of <b>reactive</b> <b>sites</b> and makes access to the remaining <b>reactive</b> <b>sites</b> in the micropore system of the coal more difficult...|$|R
25|$|Type I {{antithrombin}} deficiency is characterised by {{a decrease}} in both antithrombin activity and antithrombin concentration {{in the blood of}} affected individuals. Type I deficiency was originally further divided into two subgroups, Ia and Ib, based upon heparin affinity. The antithrombin of subgroup Ia individuals showed a normal affinity for heparin while the antithrombin of subgroup Ib individuals showed a reduced affinity for heparin. Subsequent functional analysis of a group of 1b cases found them not only to have reduced heparin affinity but multiple or 'pleiotrophic' abnormalities affecting the <b>reactive</b> <b>site,</b> the heparin binding site and antithrombin blood concentration. In a revised system of classification adopted by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, type Ib cases are now designated as type II PE, Pleiotrophic effect.|$|E
