500|$|Whitemore, {{along with}} Hagley, has {{historically}} {{had one of}} the highest concentrations of stud farms breeding pedigree livestock, in Australia. In the 1950s there were more than 100 <b>registered</b> <b>studs</b> within [...] of the town's centre. The Poll Dorset, an important breed in prime lamb production in Australia, was first bred at a Whitemore stud. Whitemore farmers, the French family, began breeding Ryeland lambs in early 21st century. The family had originally farmed this breed in the 1930s, but it had now become uncommon in Australia due to changing fashions in meat. The Heazlewood family breeds the Border Leicester, another sheep breed that is now uncommon in Australia. The family was honoured by the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania in 2013 for their involvement in the Tasmanian sheep industry over the previous one hundred years.|$|R

50|$|The closed stud book {{requires}} that all dogs descend from a known and registered set of ancestors; {{this results in}} a loss of genetic variation over time, as well as a highly identifiable breed type, which is the basis of the sport of conformation showing. In order to enhance specific characteristics, most modern purebred dogs <b>registered</b> with closed <b>stud</b> books are highly inbred, increasing the possibility of genetic-based disease.|$|R
50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century the breed had nearly disappeared, however in the 1970s a few aficionados, in {{particular}} Mr. Audrechy, (of Buigny les Gamaches in the Somme), decided to reconstitute the breed from a few remaining specimens which they located after along search.

500|$|The {{majority}} of Dales ponies are black, though brown, bay, grey and roan colours are also acceptable. The only white markings permitted {{on the head}} are a star and/or a snip; stripes, blazes, and white muzzles are not allowed. The hind legs may have {{a small amount of}} white, not extending above the fetlock joint, though ponies with excess white markings may be registered in the B <b>register</b> of the <b>stud</b> book. A Dales pony should move {{with a great deal of}} energy and power, lifting the hooves well clear of the ground. [...] The over-all impression should be of an alert, courageous but calm and kind animal. Ponies which do not meet the physical standard set by the breed registry may be registered as [...] "B-status", meaning that they are of Dales Pony bloodlines but do not have the proper appearance or gaits. Foals by Dales stallions and non-Dales mares may be registered as part-breds. Foals out of Dales mares and non-Dales stallions may not be <b>registered,</b> as the <b>stud</b> book wishes to promote breeding of purebred ponies to maintain the current population levels.|$|R
50|$|The Second World War {{caused a}} drastic {{decline in the}} Rhenish German Coldblood. While {{there was a brief}} revival in {{agricultural}} use of horses in the post-War years, the progressive mechanisation of agriculture led to a further decline. The Wickrath stud was closed in 1957, and merged into the stud of Warendorf, in Westphalia. By 1975 there were eleven mares and two stallions <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book. Numbers have slowly recovered, and in 2013 were reported as 1173 mares and 149 stallions.|$|R
50|$|The first breed {{association}} {{was formed in}} Spain in 1996. There were only ~800 purebred individuals in 2007, their numbers reduced due to crossbreeding with other local Spanish breeds; the population increased to 1,883 by 2011. It is now classified as endangered, with 1,415 animals <b>registered</b> with the <b>stud</b> book. The breed's decline is due to mechanisation of agriculture, segmentation and isolation of subpopulations, crossbreeding, lack of genetic programs, and unstructured breeding efforts. The current breed association, formed in 2005, has undertaken a conservation program {{in partnership with the}} University of Cordoba to maintain the breed.|$|R

In the same year, the festival expanded to Prague and in subsequent years to other cities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Since 2009, the festival has used the new subtitle queer film festival. Mezipatra was founded by a civic association called STUD Brno. Since 2013 it is organized by a <b>registered</b> association Mezipatra, <b>STUD</b> is a co-organizer under the license agreement.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of his {{activities}} in Portuguese East Africa, Pitt became a wealthy man. Seeking a gentile lifestyle back in England, Pitt moved his family from Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London, to West Grinstead Park, West Sussex, which he purchased in 1913 from Sir Merrick Burrell. Having acquired a passion for both the breeding and racing of horses, Pitt eventually established his own <b>stud,</b> <b>registering</b> the West Grinstead Stud in 1924. Pitt enjoyed some considerable success as a breeder, and the West Grinstead Stud produced 129 winners over 26 years; however, his purchase of Papyrus, the 1923 Derby winner, was deemed commercially unsuccessful, since he failed to sire sufficient winners.|$|R
25|$|Recently some {{prestige}} plates {{have been}} issued, which consist of four numbers or {{two groups of}} three numbers. Plates using the format B-nnnnn has been released for vehicles registered in Bendigo (B-0001 to B-4999) and Ballarat (B-5001 to B-9999). These have a customised insert of their town, and are usually blue lettering on a reflective yellow background; slogans vary. Since 1993, those also <b>registered</b> to horse <b>studs</b> across Victoria can reserve a V-nnnn series, usually brown lettering on a yellow background and stating Victorian Thoroughbred as a slogan. Others are designed after football teams, and a limited edition Grand Prix series (GP-001 to GP-999) was authorised when Melbourne first hosted the Australian Grand Prix in 1996. Slimline editions of these plates have also been produced.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Grand Noir du Berry are unknown. It has been {{variously}} suggested that it was influenced by imports of donkeys from Algeria in the 1850s, or that it descends from Catalan donkeys brought to the area by itinerant Romani people. From {{the early twentieth century}} onwards there is ample documentation in photographs of its use in agriculture, in harness and for barge haulage. A breeders' association, the Association Française de l'Âne Grand Noir du Berry, was formed in 1993 and in January 1994 the breed was officially recognised by the agriculture ministry and the Haras Nationaux. The association maintains the stud book for the breed. In 1994 there were 100 animals <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book; the current population is about 1300.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{population}} sharply declined, as mechanization transferred work in cavalry and agriculture to machines. By the 1970s, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction, with only 40 horses <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book. The breed was saved by members of the hippie movement, who re-settled in the Ariège mountains, boosting the local economy and restarting breeding programs. The Mérens also benefited from a new surge in popularity in riding horses, and between 1975 and 1985 its population rebounded, leading the breeding program to be considered an example for the conservation of rare breeds. The herd size remains relatively small, however, and one genetic study considers the traditional type of the breed to be endangered and recommends that efforts should be focused on its preservation.|$|R
500|$|Before the {{introduction}} in 1913 of what became popularly known—"with questionnable taste" [...] {{according to a}} correspondent writing in The Times—as the Jersey Act, Thoroughbred horses in the United Kingdom were registered in the General Stud Book, the stud book for British and Irish Thoroughbreds. The rules allowed a horse to be registered {{if all of the}} horse's ancestors were registered in the General Stud Book or if it had been bred outside of Britain or Ireland and was <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book of its country of origin. Overall the General Stud Book had the most stringent rules for registration of Thoroughbreds at the time, around 1900; other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Russia, were considered by the British and Irish to be much laxer and to have allowed some non-Thoroughbred horses into their national stud books.|$|R
5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the Selle Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses <b>registered</b> with the <b>stud</b> books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, {{including those of}} Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français. Selle Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|R
50|$|Wild horses {{have lived}} in this park since the 1930s. In October 2000, over 600 horses in the Guy Fawkes River National Park were shot and killed from a {{helicopter}} during a controversial cull by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. In response to public outcry, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Bob Debus, commissioned a study into the heritage value of horses {{in the park and}} indicated that, should the horses be found to have genuine heritage significance, they would be humanely removed from the park {{so that they can be}} managed properly in another location by people with an interest in their heritage value. In February 2002, the final report by the Heritage Working Party found that these horses had significant historical, military and cultural value. They are direct descendants of Australia's wartime cavalry horses, known as Walers, and are the only group of Australian wild horse to have proven heritage value. Since the campaign began to remove horses from there over 400 have been passively trapped, taken from the park, and 200 of these have been found a home elsewhere. The Guy Fawkes Heritage Horse Association (GFHHA) takes possession of horses passively removed from the GFRNP and offer them for sale to the public, they also manage the horses to maintain their inherent characteristics and to preserve the unique genetics of these wild horses. A formal <b>register</b> and <b>Stud</b> Book has been established for these purposes. The GFHHA also actively promotes the GF horse versatility by sponsoring classes held at local Ag Shows and encouraging horse owners to participate in all disciplines.|$|R
5|$|The Mérens or Cheval de Mérens, still {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} by the older name of Ariégeois pony, is a small, rustic horse native to the Pyrenees and Ariégeois mountains of southern France, where the Ariège River flows, and northern Spain, near Andorra. Two general types, a small, light traditional mountain horse and a taller, sportier modern type, are found. Always black in color, Mérens must meet strict physical standards {{in order to be}} <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book. The breed is known for its sure-footedness on mountain terrain, as well as for its endurance, hardiness and docility. The French breed registry organizes regional offices, and partners with other national organizations in Europe to preserve and promote the breed. The organization enforces rigorous selection of breeding stock, with a goal of increasing quality in the breed. In the past, the Mérens was used for farm work, draft work and as pack horses. Today it is mainly used as a saddle horse, although some members of the breed have been successful in carriage driving. Many Mérens are taken on an annual transhumance (seasonal migration), in which they are moved higher in the mountains during the summer and into the valleys for the winter. An old practice, it fell into disfavor, but has recently re-emerged.|$|R
5|$|Andalusians only {{began to}} be {{exported}} from Spain in 1962. The first Andalusians were imported into Australia in 1971, and in 1973 the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia was formed for the registration of these Andalusians and their offspring. Strict quarantine guidelines prohibited the importation of new Andalusian blood to Australia for many years, but since 1999, regulations have been relaxed {{and more than half}} a dozen new horses have been imported. Bloodines in the United States also rely on imported stock, and all American Andalusians can be traced directly to the stud books in Portugal and Spain. There are around 8,500 animals in the United States, where the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA) registers around 700 new purebred foals every year. These numbers indicate that the Andalusian is a relatively rare breed in the United States. In 2003, there were 75,389 horses <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book, and they constituted almost 66 percent of the horses in Spain. Breed numbers have been increasing during the 21st century. At the end of 2010, a total of 185,926 Pura Raza Española horses were recorded in the database of the Spanish Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, y Medio Rural y Marino. Of these, 28,801 or about 15% were in other countries of the world; of those in Spain, 65,371 or about 42% were in Andalusia.|$|R
500|$|To be {{registered}} as a Finnhorse, a horse must either have parents registered as Finnhorses, or be verified to be descended {{from at least}} three generations of Finnhorses. To qualify for the Finnhorse stud book as a breeding animal, a horse must prove itself by meeting or exceeding the breed standard set for various qualities: performance ability, conformation, disposition, and in some cases, quality of offspring. Any horse offered for the Finnhorse studbook {{must be at least}} 4 years old, a stallion or a mare, and registered a Finnhorse. The stud book evaluation board considers the performance of horses in their desired discipline: riding, driving, harness racing, or workhorse events. Horses to be <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book are tested for performance at the stud book registration inspection. With the exception of the trotter section, they are also evaluated on [...] "type"; the suitability of the horse's overall build for the section for which it is offered. Individuals that do not qualify for the studbook on their own merits during the stud book evaluation process may be accepted later, based on the quality and accomplishments of their offspring. For this to occur, a horse's offspring are evaluated by their competitive history or their stud book evaluation, and if of high enough quality, their parent then is also granted acceptance into the stud book. Conversely, a horse may be removed from the studbook if its offspring are found to have any inherited flaw or condition. A stallion may also be removed if his offspring are clearly below the average level in competitive success or stud book evaluations.|$|R
500|$|A strict {{system of}} inspection, started in Austria, has evolved {{to ensure that}} only good quality stock meeting high {{standards}} is used for breeding. This is coupled with close maintenance of the studbook to maintain inspection validity. Mares must be inspected and <b>registered</b> with the <b>stud</b> book {{before they can be}} covered, and multiple forms are needed to prove covering and birth of a purebred Haflinger foal. Within six months of birth, foals are inspected, and those considered to have potential as breeding stock are given certificates of pedigree and branded. Horses are reinspected at three years old, checked against written association standards, and if they pass, are then entered into the studbook. After their final inspection Haflingers from Austria and Italy are branded with a firebrand in the shape of an edelweiss. Horses from Austria and from South Tyrol have the letter [...] "H" [...] {{in the center of the}} brand, while horses from all other parts of Italy have the letters [...] "HI". Horses are graded based on conformation, action, bone, height, temperament and color. Mares must have a fully registered purebred pedigree extending six generations back to be considered for stud book acceptance. Stallions are registered separately. Colts must have a dam with a fully purebred pedigree, and are inspected based on hereditary reliability and likely breeding strength as well as the other qualifications. Each stallion's registration certification must show a fully purebred pedigree extending back four generations, as well as records of mares covered, percentages of pregnancies aborted, still-born and live-born, and numbers and genders of foals born. This information is used to match stallions and mares for breeding. Tyrolean colts undergo an initial assessment, and those not chosen must be either gelded or sold out of the Tyrolean breeding area. The chosen colts are reassessed every six months until a final inspection at the age of three, when the best stallions are chosen for Tyrolean breeding, after which they are purchased by the Austrian Ministry of Agriculture and made available for breeding throughout the region. The others are either gelded or sold out of the region. Other countries base their registration and selection practices on Tyrolean ones, as is required by the WHF.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{elaborate}} literature review {{on the issue of}} cattle reproduction, factors influencing fertility and describe the various types of heat detection. The work also includes practical observations, which was based on comparing the results of its own conception of cows {{depending on the type of}} heat detection. The hypothesis was that the results of visual observation will have lower levels of reproduction than heat detection using measuring physical activity. 	The comparison was carried out within the company ZOD Roztoky Kruh, which is located in Roztoky u Jilemnice and enterprise Zetka Strážník, a. s. in Studenec u Horek. Information about the results of reproduction and performance were collecte in the two companies taken from their Analysis of herds <b>registered</b> in the <b>stud</b> book of Czech Fleckvieh and the Results of milk recording system during the period 2012 to 2015. Consequently, the results of reproduction were evaluated graphically for each business separately and then they were compared for both companies between themselves and within the whole population. As selected reproduction indicators for comparison, I selected the number of pregnant cows after all inseminations, insemination interval, service period, insemination index and length of the calving period. 	The comparison showed that the two companies is different in nearly all indicators of reproduction, except calving period, the length of which was in both companies almost the same, on average from 394 to 396 days. In ZOD Enterprise Roztoky Kruh faced with increasing length of calving period, which varies in length averaging about 99. 9 days, which is considered inconvenient. In contrast, the length of insemination interval was shorted by an average of 8. 5 days from the start of monitoring. The number of pregnant cows after insemination was on average around 52. 6 %, which is 4. 7 % less than in the enterprise Zetka Strážník, a. s., where it achieved 57. 3 %. The index of insemination for cows was an average of 1. 75. The enterprise Zetka Strážník had an average length of calving period 94. 9 days. Insemination interval was prolonged by an average of 5. 6 since 2012. The index of insemination for cows had an average value 1. 55. This indicator is not influenced by the type of heat detection. 	The hypothesis was confirmed even though the difference was not too great. Enterprise, which used measurements of physical activity to detect estrus, had better results in terms of reproduction. We can see that heat detection using visual observation is not as effective as using the detectors that detect physical activity in a stable all day...|$|R
