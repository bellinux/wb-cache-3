5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare <b>reform</b> <b>bill.</b> This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare <b>reform</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, in {{response}} to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration <b>reform</b> <b>bill</b> known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{campaigned for}} women's rights, {{including}} the right to the vote and to have a better education. In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, was ignored and the bill became law.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill,</b> the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E

5|$|Political {{plans were}} thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early {{priorities}} was a <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill,</b> but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and the dissident Liberals repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents {{were unwilling to}} serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill.</b> Without {{a majority in the}} Commons, the Conservatives {{had little choice but to}} accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session {{to vote for the}} Tenure of Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent. He also unsuccessfully pressed for a civil service <b>reform</b> <b>bill</b> that attracted the votes of many reform-minded Republicans. Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) denied that he had given the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> {{which included a}} provision that specifically would not allow a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon {{from one of his}} positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare <b>reform</b> <b>bill</b> {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|Lord Grey's first {{announcement}} as Prime Minister was {{a pledge}} to carry out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> in the House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing {{the size of the}} electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the activities and influence of public health interest groups and coalitions on the national health care reform debates in the 103 rd Congress. METHODS: Congressional staff and representatives of public health interest groups, coalitions, and government health agencies were interviewed. Content analysis of eight leading national health care <b>reform</b> <b>bills</b> was performed. RESULTS: The public health community coalesced around public health in health care reform; nearly all the major interest groups and government health agencies joined two or more public health or prevention coalitions, and half joined three or more. The most effective influence {{on health care reform}} legislation was early, sustained personal contact with Congress members and their staffs, accompanied by succinct written materials summarizing key points. Media campaigns and grassroots mobilization were less effective. Seven of the eight leading health care <b>reform</b> <b>bills</b> included {{one or more of the}} priorities supported by public health advocates. CONCLUSIONS: The public health community played an important role in increasing awareness and support for public health programs in the health care <b>reform</b> <b>bills</b> of the 103 rd Congress...|$|R

50|$|This {{bill was}} {{introduced}} {{at the same}} time as the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress) and the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress) as a package of budget <b>reform</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|R
5|$|Owing to {{property}} {{on the road}} becoming more desirable, traffic began to increase on Park Lane during the 19th century. A short section of the lane was widened in 1851 {{as part of the}} redevelopment work on Marble Arch. In July 1866, following the destruction of the boundary railings after a demonstration supporting the Second <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill,</b> the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.|$|E
5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare <b>reform</b> <b>bill</b> in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} and popular pressure for reform {{had grown so}} great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority {{in the general election}} of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.|$|E

25|$|The LCS {{influenced}} the reform {{movements of the}} early 19th century, particularly Chartism, which in turn contributed to the 19th century <b>Reform</b> <b>Bills.</b> The 1832 <b>Reform</b> Act in particular contained many of the reforms called for by the LCS.|$|R
50|$|As Chair of the Privileges and Elections Committee, Putney blocked {{numerous}} electoral <b>reform</b> <b>bills,</b> {{including the}} National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and bills to introduce Instant Runoff Voting {{on a test}} basis.

5|$|When the Lords {{rejected}} the <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill,</b> public violence ensued. That very evening, riots {{broke out in}} Derby, where a mob attacked the city jail and freed several prisoners. In Nottingham, rioters set fire to Nottingham Castle (the home of the Duke of Newcastle) and attacked Wollaton Hall (the estate of Lord Middleton). The most significant disturbances occurred at Bristol, where rioters controlled the city for three days. The mob broke into prisons and destroyed several buildings, including the palace of the Bishop of Bristol, the mansion of the Lord Mayor of Bristol, and several private homes. Other places that saw violence included Dorset, Leicestershire, and Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though {{he was concerned about}} the implications of their <b>Reform</b> <b>Bill</b> which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a <b>reform</b> <b>bill</b> looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E

5000|$|Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) {{supported}} the bill, {{along with several}} other <b>reform</b> <b>bills,</b> by saying that [...] "these common-sense bills will hold federal agencies more accountable {{when it comes to}} how they use tax dollars and how they treat taxpayers." ...|$|R
