Players later recalled that meeting as the turning point in the team's season. The next week, Virginia Tech earned its first win of the season, a 49–27 victory over East Carolina in Lane Stadium. The Hokies followed that by traveling to Boston College for a 19–0 win, their first shutout since 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland {{are at odds}} with the timing of this story. There was no Gniezno {{settlement}} in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only {{at the turn of the}} 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> local population around its building and defense.|$|E

As many as 1,500 people may have been killed. The AFL was purged of Gio soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann {{had argued}} that the {{declaration}} would have three effects: it would swing Russia to maintain pressure on Germany's Eastern Front, since Jews had been prominent in the March Revolution of 1917; it would <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> large Jewish community in the United States to press for greater funding for the American war effort, underway since April of that year; and, lastly, that it would undermine German Jewish support for Kaiser Wilhelm II.|$|E

With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Clark and Michael Jon Carter (Booster Gold) {{inadvertently}} {{traveled to}} the 31st century, where they found themselves caught in a war between New Krypton, led by Kara, and an army of xenophobes, during which Doomsday is reawakened, then defeated when all the belligerents form an alliance. While in the future, Clark met a child named Bartholomew Allen, causing Clark to suspect he was a descendant of Bart and giving him hope {{that he was still}} alive. After meeting Diana Prince, with whom he teamed to defeat Hades and Felix Faust, Clark, as Superman, chose to reveal to the President that he was not a meteor-infected individual as the public believed but was from another planet. Later, Clark attempted to <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> heroes and the world to make a stand against the Monitors.|$|E

Seeing a suspicious gust of wind, Daenerys rides out alone. As Daario prepares to follow her, Drogon flies over the khalasar, with Daenerys riding on his back. Daenerys proceeds to <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> Dothraki by stating that she chooses them all to be her bloodriders, rather than the traditional three chosen by Khals. She then asks if they will cross the sea with her and help her retake the Seven Kingdoms, which they unanimously agree to do.|$|E

5|$|Hulagu {{departed}} for Karakorum and left Kitbuqa, a Nestorian Christian general, {{to continue the}} Mongol conquest.

5|$|In India, {{unaware of}} the delayed {{shipment}} and confident {{of being able to}} <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to <b>rally.</b> <b>The</b> Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{strategic}} {{plans for a}} decisive battle with the U.S. fleet were already established by September 1944. Anticipating the various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational order, code named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking U.S. supply vessels rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October to <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> troops behind Sho.|$|E

The first batch of fliers contain the words Workingmen Arm Yourselves and Appear in Full Force! When Spies saw the line, he said he would not speak at the rally unless the words were removed from the flier. All but a few hundred of the fliers were destroyed, and new fliers were printed without the offending words. More than 20,000 copies of the revised flier were distributed.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{believed}} he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless {{in support of his}} party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A.

Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to <b>rally</b> <b>the</b> people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end.|$|E
