5000|$|Patrick is a {{flamboyant}} contestant on Terry Tibbs' show The Apprentibbs. He {{was planted}} {{in one of}} the two teams competing for Terry Tibbs to hire them, and argued with the team's leader so much that he left the team before they could meet Terry Tibbs in person (this was actually done so that Kayvan Novak could appear as Terry Tibbs when the two teams pitched their <b>finished</b> <b>ideas</b> to him).

So Steve's influence helped us even be able to complete the songs and steer us in a certain direction....without Steve on this record, it wouldn't have been Mercury, it wouldn't have been the same record at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|Powers {{claimed that}} [...] "the best moments of this album are those when vintage Blur styles are evoked with new expertise. The {{meandering}} [...] "Good Song" [...] {{is a beautiful}} case in point. Acoustic guitar picking is matched with temperate drums and a sweet, steady bass countermelody. Albarn's singing is mostly in his mid-range, falling out as easily as breath. Signature background vocal harmonies are there to brighten up the track, but their muted nature doesn't descend into campiness. What's also new is the expert use of electronic noises and drumbeats to fatten the sound." [...] Albarn said [...] "well, that was originally called 'De La Soul' on our huge list of songs, half <b>finished</b> <b>ideas.</b> It was called 'De La Soul you know, right until the end. And I just {{always thought it was}} a good song and just called it 'Good Song'. I love that, I love the sort of intimacy of it and I just think everyone really played gently on it, the melodies. It was a good melody." ...|$|R

50|$|In early July 2008, {{after buying}} out the {{remainder}} of his contract, Assunção joined Atlético Madrid.

40|$|The Form of Conditional used to Denote a Habitual Past Action Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} in other Slavic verbal systems, the use of Conditional to express habitual actions in the past constitutes a particular feature of the Croatian-Bosnian-Serbian diasystem, although not all of it. Historically, this use of Conditional apparently replaced a similar use of Imperfect in Old Slavic and Old Croatian, particularly with perfective verbs, and especially in dependent clauses, where habitual Conditional is most frequent. Perfective habitual Conditional, which is more frequent than the imperfective one, clearly "fills {{a gap in the}} system", as it explicitly denotes <b>repeated</b> <b>finished</b> actions in the past, as opposed to repeated unfinished actions or processes. In contemporary language, perfective Conditional and both imperfective Conditional and imperfective Preterite are concurrent forms which function as habitual constructions. The question is raised whether factors like verbal aspect, type of iteration (mainly expressed by adverbs), a connection with another action or with an external factor in the context or situation, and the use in independent or dependent clauses influence the choice of habitual Conditional. In an attempt to answer this question, the authors investigated the use of habitual Conditional in combination with some adverbs denoting frequency, and its use in dependent clauses with the conjunctions čim and kad. The databases used were the Amsterdam Slavic Parallel Aligned Corpus (ASPAC), and the Croatian national corpus (HNK) ...|$|R
2500|$|Buff coats {{were made}} in {{sleeveless}} and sleeved variants and were garments typically crafted from cowhide or buffalo hide. The very finest buff coats were made of elk-hide. Buff leather was produced by a method of [...] "oil tanning"; following treatment with lime the hide was scraped to remove the outer layer which gave the finished product a matt surface. The hide then had cod oil worked into it in a process called [...] "kicking" [...] and was finally air-dried. The oiling and drying steps could be <b>repeated.</b> The <b>finished</b> leather attained its characteristic buff colour and was supple, durable and weather resistant.|$|R
