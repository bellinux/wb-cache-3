40|$|Background and purpose: ESTRO {{has set up}} a Quality Assurance network (EQUAL) {{to check}} the dose {{delivered}} on axis in reference and non-reference conditions for external radiotherapy. The external audits covered by the network are based on measurements made with mailed thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD). Material and methods: The TLD consist of LiF powder type DTL 937 read with a PCL 3 automatic TLD reader. The participating centres are instructed to deliver to the TLDs absorbed doses of 2 Gy calculated with the Treatment Planning System used in clinical routine. A maximum of three photon energies by participating centre have been checked with 10 on-axis points per beam. The quantities checked include the reference beam output, beam output variation with collimator opening, depth dose data and wedge transmission factor. Results: During the 1998 EQUAL programme 102 centres have been checked corresponding to 235 beams (28 60 Co beams and 207 X-ray beams). About 3 % of the outputs in reference conditions show deviations outside tolerance level (. ^ 5 %). A similar <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> is noted for the percentage depth doses. A <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> (6 %) has been observed for the beam output variation (open and wedged beams) and the wedge transmission factor. The analysis of the results shows that for 24 out of the 102 centres, a deviation outside tolerance level is observed at least in one point, mainly for the large and rectangular ®eld sizes and for the wedged beams. Conclusions: The results for the EQUAL programme show the importance of a quality assurance network in Radiotherapy especially fo...|$|E

The {{frequency}} of a device’s clock actually depends on its environment, such as the temperature and humidity, as well as the type of crystal. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we experimentally validate that MICAz and TelosB sensor motes have different and unique clock skews. Furthermore, the clock skew of a node can easily be monitored, even via a multi-hop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). We argue that this feature can be used for identification of the nodes, detection of Wormhole and Sybil attacks. Second, we show that the clock skew of a sensor node varies with the temperature. We explain how this property can be used to detect malicious and mal-functioning nodes and to geo-localize them...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{relationship}} between the medial longitudinal arch mobility and static and dynamic balance. Methods: A total of 50 subjects (25 female, and 25 male; Mean age: 22. 2  ±  1. 3 years; BMI: 22. 8  ±  3. 8  kg/m 2) were included in this study. The relative arch deformity (RAD) was calculated with both 10 % and 90 % weight bearing (WB). Static balance was evaluated with Single Leg Stance Test and dynamic balance with TechnoBody PK 200 WL computerized balance device. Subjects were evaluated for goniometric measurements of lower extremity joints, leg dominance and leg-length discrepancy. Results: Bipedal dynamic balance was correlated with both feet length at 10 % WB and 90 % WB. There was a correlation between the dynamic balance on dominant foot and RAD value on the aspect of Medium Speed (r = − 0. 32, p =  0. 02), Perimeter Length (r = − 0. 32, p =  0. 02) and Anterior–Posterior Sway (r =  0. 36, p =  0. 01). Static balance was unaffected by RAD value when the visual system was eliminated. Conclusion: Our results suggest that decrease of arch mobility on the dominant foot is associated with posterior sway by causing knee or hip strategy and preventing ankle strategy even in small perturbations.

40|$|Regarding {{the fact}} that bribery and other methods of {{corruption}} are illegal in most countries, their participants try to hide them very carefully and uncovering corruption is often almost impossible. Despite that {{a high number of}} specific procedures exist nowadays. A common feature of these methods is however that they focus on the corruption rate at the level of countries. Quantification of the corruption rate in smaller regional areas is still a considerably unexplored territory not only in the Czech Republic but also all over the world. Also the definition of the potential impacts of corruption or their precise quantification is an area that was investigated only in general level of state. Detailed analysis of corruption still lacks regional dimension. Subnational distinction of a territory in terms of the corruption rate could provide a completely new extension of theories of reasons and consequences of regional disparities. There are several reasons why to focus on this issue. Perhaps the strongest reason is that if corruption is one of the variables that have an effect of reducing economic performance, the elimination of corruption in certain regions may be the key to the elimination of regional economic disparities and thus increase the economic performance of the state. The main goal of the presented article is formulated in this connection. It consists of a proposal of a methodology for quantifying the corruption rate in individual regions of the Czech Republic. It will be possible to mutually compare individual regions {{and at the same time}} define the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> of a region from “surface” corruption rate in a country.

40|$|Abstract. The {{implausibility}} of {{the extreme}} rationality assumptions of Nash equilibrium has been attested by numerous experimental studies with human players. In particular, the fundamental social dilemmas such as the Traveler’s dilemma, the Prisoner’s dilemma, and the Public Goods game demonstrate high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> from the unique Nash equilibrium, dependent on the game pa-rameters or {{the environment in which}} the game is played. These results inspired several attempts to develop suitable solution concepts to more accurately explain human behaviour. In this line, the recently proposed notion of cooperative equi-librium, [5], [6], {{based on the idea that}} players have a natural attitude to coopera-tion, has shown promising results for single-shot games. In this paper, we extend this approach to iterated settings. Specifically, we define the Iterated Cooperative Equilibrium (ICE) and show it makes statistically precise predictions of popula-tion average behaviour in the aforementioned domains. Importantly, the definition of ICE does not involve any free parameters, and so it is fully predictive. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the degree of}} adherence to a cervical spine (c-spine) clearance protocol by pre-hospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel by both self-assessment and receiving hospital assessment, to describe deviations from the protocol, and {{to determine if the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> compliance by paramedic self-assessment differed from receiving hospital assessment. Methods: A retrospective sample of pre-hospital (consecutive series) and receiving hospital (convenience sample) assessments of the compliance with and appropriateness of c-spine immobilization. The c-spine clearance protocol was implemented for Orange County EMS just prior to the April-November 1999 data collection period. Results: We collected 396 pre-hospital and 162 receiving hospital data forms. From the pre-hospital data sheet. the percentage deviation from the protocol was 4. 096 (16 / 396). Only one out of 16 cases that did not comply with the protocol was due to over immobilization (0. 2 %). The remaining 15 cases were under immobilized, according to protocol. Nine of the under immobilized cases (66 %) that should have been placed in c-spine precautions met physical assessment criteria in the protocol, while the other five cases met mechanism of injury criteria. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviations</b> from protocol did not differ over time.

40|$|Abstract—“Shilling ” attacks or “profile {{injection}} ” {{attacks have}} always major challenges in collaborative filtering recommender systems (CFRSs). Many {{efforts have been}} devoted to improve collaborative filtering techniques which can eliminate the “shilling ” attacks. However, most of them focused on detecting push attack or nuke attack which is rated with the highest score or lowest score on the target items. Few pay attention to grey attack when a target item is rated with a lower or higher scores than the average score, which shows a more hidden rating behavior than push or nuke attack. In this paper, we present a novel detection method to make recommender systems resistant to such attacks. To characterize grey ratings, we exploit <b>rating</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> item to discriminate between grey attack profiles and genuine profiles. In addition, we also employ novelty and popularity of item to construct rating series. Since {{it is difficult to}} discriminate between the <b>rating</b> series <b>of</b> attacker and genuine users, we incorporate into discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to amplify these differences based on the <b>rating</b> series <b>of</b> <b>rating</b> <b>deviation,</b> novelty and popularity, respectively. Finally, we respectively extract features from <b>rating</b> series <b>of</b> <b>rating</b> deviation-based, novelty-based and popularity-based by using amplitude domain analysis method and combine all clustered results as our detection results.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} results of mass transfer {{to and from}} drops with applications to liquid–liquid extraction processes are considered. Multiple solute components (specifically 2 solute components) {{are assumed to be}} present in the drop. The system is described using the theory of multi-component mass transfer, in which a flux of one component can be coupled to a concentration gradient in the other. The nominal strength of this coupling is determined by the off-diagonal elements of a diffusivity matrix. Naively it might be thought that, if the off-diagonal matrix elements are small compared to the diagonal ones, then the influence of coupling between components is essentially negligible. It is shown however that this is not always the case. Particular focus is given to the case where one solute component has an imposed concentration difference between the drop interior and the drop surface, whilst the other solute has no such difference imposed. Mass transfer is still observed for the latter component, which is a clear indication of coupling due to multi-component diffusion effects. The mass fraction of the component with no imposed concentration difference evolves first by deviating from its initial value, but later returns back to this initial value. It is possible to place a bound on the extent <b>of</b> this <b>deviation</b> in terms <b>of</b> the elements of the diffusivity matrix and any concentration difference imposed on the other component. Circulation flow, if present within the drop, is found only to have a weak influence on the maximum extent <b>of</b> the aforementioned <b>deviation.</b> It has however a role in speeding up the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> and subsequent return of component mass fraction compared to a non-circulating rigid drop case.
