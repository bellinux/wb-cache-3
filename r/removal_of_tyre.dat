Graphic dependence of kinematic and dynamic magnitudes of some solid bodies is closely connected with the dependence on the velocity of shift of the drive member as well as with dependence on the time.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> copper (II) and lead (II) ions in single {{component}} systems using pyrolytic tyre char. The copper (II) and lead (II) ion <b>removal</b> ability <b>of</b> pyrolytic <b>tyre</b> char had been demonstrated in both equilibrium isotherm sorption studies and fixed-bed sorption column studies. Four isotherm equations, namely, Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Sips, were used to correlate the equilibrium relationship between these two ions and the pyrolytic tyre char. It {{was found that the}} Sips equation gave the most accurate correlation for both ions. The monolayer sorption capacity of copper (II) ion and lead (II) ion <b>of</b> pyrolytic <b>tyre</b> char (at pH 4) was found to be 0. 70 mmol/g and 0. 74 mmol/g respectively. Fixed-bed sorption column studies were performed to investigate the dynamic heavy metal ions sorption onto pyrolytic tyre char. Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model was used to examine the performance of the columns and the effect of different operating variables. The BDST model provided good correlation between the service times and the bed depths of the columns with reasonable accuracy. The pyrolytic tyre char was modified using different chemical reagents, attempting to minimise the zinc leachate problem. It was found that 10 wt% nitric acid reduced the zinc content in pyrolytric tyre char more effectively than other chemical reagents, but also decreased the copper removal capacity and lead removal capacity by 90 % and 75 % respectively. It was found that the metal <b>removal</b> capacity <b>of</b> that modified <b>tyre</b> char was restored by impregnation with saturated calcium hydroxide solution. In addition, ion exchange process and precipitation were proposed to be the major heavy metal ions removal mechanisms. In conclusion, although pyrolytic tyre char demonstrated heavy metals removal ability, it cannot be applied in practical use unless the zinc leachate problem is completely solved. However, a low-cost two-step modification method was demonstrated to resolve the zinc leachate problem without sacrificing the heavy metals removal capacity. It believed that the application <b>of</b> modified pyrolytic <b>tyre</b> char as a heavy metal ion sorbent will be feasible...|$|R

40|$|Mixtures <b>of</b> {{shredded}} <b>tyres</b> {{with sand}} have become accepted geo-materials {{in the past}} decade, especially for use as fill materials. Owing to the large size <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds commonly used in practice, large-scale direct shear testing equipment is specially fabricated to obtain the shear strength parameters of mixtures. The effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing direct shear tests on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios. Out of the four types of samples tested, three (with mixing ratios of 20 / 80, 25 / 75 and 35 / 65 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds to sand) are prepared using 50 to 100 mm long tyre shreds and one (25 / 75 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chips to sand) using tyre chips with nominal size of 9. 5 mm.

40|$|In Australia, it {{has been}} {{estimated}} that over 48, 000, 000 waste tyres are being generated annually, with less than 20 % <b>of</b> these <b>tyres</b> being properly managed or recycled.

The present study aims to determine the function <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> crumbs as an alternative for coarse aggregates in Water Sensitive Urban Design and its applicability in the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> pollutants from urban runoff. Nine columns, three control columns, three with a 10 % crumb rubber substitution, and three with a 20 % crumb rubber substitution, are constructed to depict a typical stormwater filtration system. The current experimental studies focus on the hydraulic conductivity of raingarden filters, also using crumb rubber as a substitute for coarse aggregates in the same percentages as previously mentioned, on unsaturated filters. Results from infiltration studies indicate that the hydraulic conductivities are quite high and varied. 20 % tyre crumb substitutions performed the most consistently, with a median unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of 352 mm/hr, which is generally suitable hydraulic conductivity for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> pollutants and support of vegetation growth. Although the hydraulic conductivities for majority of other samples were greater than 500 mm/hr, conductivities are expected to decrease as the filters become saturated through infiltration, compaction and clogging...|$|R
