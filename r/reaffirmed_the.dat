5|$|Calls for the {{abolition}} of Europe's monarchies have been widespread since the development of republicanism in the 17th to 18th centuries during the Enlightenment. During the French Revolution, the Ancien Régime in France was abolished, and in all territories the French First Republic conquered during the following Coalition Wars, sister republics were proclaimed. However, after Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic European Restoration <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> monarchical balance of power on the continent.|$|E
5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in a reversal of the costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} embroiled leading European universities; the Qing dynasty's Kangxi Emperor {{and several}} popes (including Clement XI and Clement XIV) considered the case; {{the offices of}} the Holy See also intervened. Near the end of the 17th century, many Dominicans and Franciscans had shifted their positions in agreeing with the Jesuits' opinion, but Rome disagreed. Clement XI banned the rites in 1704.

5|$|The monkey lemurs are {{considered}} to be most closely related to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs, although recent finds had caused some dispute over a possible closer relation to living lemurids.

It is known only from subfossil or recent remains and {{is considered to be a}} modern form of Malagasy lemur. It died out around 444–772 CE, shortly after the arrival of humans on the island.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{studies of}} the palustris–couesi contact zone in Texas {{published}} in 1979, using more specimens and characters, indicated that the two species are in fact easily distinguishable there; therefore, O.couesi has since been regarded as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat. Afterward, {{some of the other}} forms synonymized under O.couesi or O.palustris were resurrected as separate species—Oryzomys nelsoni from the Marías Islands, western Mexico, and Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed western Mexican Oryzomys, <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> distinctness of O.nelsoni, and reinstated O.peninsulae from the tip of the Baja California Peninsula and O.albiventer from interior Mexico as species. Still, O.couesi included 22 synonyms, and Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that further research on O.couesi and related species would certainly result in the recognition of additional species.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III was {{initially}} released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned it, {{due to its}} depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes. This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive {{to appeal to the}} OFLC, who <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team.

Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release and <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium Summit {{was held}} in 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st century. The three day meeting was the largest {{gathering}} of world leaders in history, and culminated in the adoption by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a commitment to achieve international development {{in areas such as}} poverty reduction, gender equality, and public health. Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The 2005 World Summit <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security. The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian (r.117–138AD) <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> Roman-Parthian border at the Euphrates, choosing not {{to invade}} Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources. Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against him, yet the Romans made him king of Osroene. Osroes I died during his conflict with Vologases III, the latter succeeded by Vologases IV of Parthia (r. c.147–191AD) who ushered {{in a period of}} peace and stability. However, the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161–180AD) had co-ruler Lucius Verus (r.161–169AD) guard Syria while Marcus Statius Priscus invaded Armenia in 163AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by Avidius Cassius in 164AD.|$|E

5|$|Although France had not {{completely}} defeated Austria, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, nevertheless imposed a heavy political {{toll on the}} Austrians. As {{a result of the}} treaty, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles, the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians, and Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20% of her total population. Emperor Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Napoleon's brother Joseph as the King of Spain, and <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions.. The Austrian defeat {{paved the way for the}} marriage of Napoleon to the daughter of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise. Dangerously, Napoleon assumed that his marriage to Marie Louise would eliminate Austria as a future threat, but the Habsburgs were not as driven by familial ties as Napoleon thought.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Colugos are a {{small group}} of Southeast Asian gliding mammals closely related to the primates. Their fossil record is {{exceptionally}} poor. Although Paleogene groups such as the Plagiomenidae are considered by some to be closely related to colugos, no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo family, Cynocephalidae, had been reported until 1992. In that year, Stéphane Ducrocq and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the Eocene of Thailand as a new genus and species of colugo, Dermotherium major. In 2000, however, Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that Dermotherium might not be a colugo, since the fossil is so poorly preserved that few traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported dermopteran features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other placental groups. Mary Silcox and colleagues <b>reaffirmed</b> <b>the</b> colugo affinities of Dermotherium in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in molar morphology.|$|E
