40|$|A growing {{economic}} literature {{stresses the}} importance of relative comparisons, e. g., for savings and consumption or happiness. In this literature it is usually assumed that <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> against which people compare themselves are exogenously given. In contrast findings from social psychology suggest that people play an active role in determining their <b>reference</b> <b>standards.</b> We present a social comparison model where people choose their <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> to serve motives of self-improvement and self-enhancement. The model predicts that <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> increase in individuals' abilities and that thus people tend to compare themselves to similar others. The results of a questionnaire study confirm the model's prediction, where it is shown that students with higher intellectual abilities choose higher <b>reference</b> <b>standards.</b> We also briefly discuss the role of endogenous <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> for economically relevant questions like migration, minimum income and happiness studies...|$|R

25|$|Ultrasound (US) {{is often}} the first imaging and {{screening}} modality used. On US, HCC often appears as a small hypoechoic lesion with poorly defined margins and coarse irregular internal echoes. When the tumor grows, it can sometimes appear heterogeneous with fibrosis, fatty change, and calcifications. This heterogeneity can look similar to cirrhosis and the surrounding liver parenchyma. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 60 percent (95% CI 44-76%) and specificity was 97 percent (95% CI 95-98%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the <b>reference</b> <b>standard.</b> The sensitivity increases to 79% with AFP correlation.|$|E
25|$|However, MRI has the {{advantage}} of delivering high-resolution images of the liver without ionizing radiation. HCC appears as a high-intensity pattern on T2 weighted images and a low-intensity pattern on T1 weighted images. The advantage of MRI is that is has improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to US and CT in cirrhotic patients with whom {{it can be difficult to}} differentiate HCC from regenerative nodules. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 81 percent (95% CI 70-91%) and specificity was 85 percent (95% CI 77-93%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the <b>reference</b> <b>standard.</b> The sensitivity is further increased if gadolinium contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging are combined.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, a British {{delegation}} was one {{of twenty}} national delegations to a convention in Paris that resulted in seventeen of the nations signing the Metre Convention on 20 May 1875, {{and the establishment of}} three bodies, the CGPM, CIPM and BIPM, that were charged with overseeing weights and measures on behalf of the international community. The United Kingdom {{was one of}} the countries that declined to sign the convention. In 1882 the British firm Johnson, Matthey & Co secured an agreement with the French government to supply 30 standard metres and 40 standard kilograms. Two years later the United Kingdom signed the treaty and the following year {{it was found that the}} standard yard which had been in use since 1855 had been shrinking at the rate of one part per million every twenty years. In 1889, one of the standard metres and one of the standard kilograms that had been cast by Johnson, Matthey & Co were selected at random as the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> and the other standards, having been cross-correlated with each other, were distributed to the signatory nations of the treaty.|$|E

500|$|Ultrasonography of leg veins is a risk-free, {{non-invasive}} procedure that uses ultrasound technology to give {{information about the}} anatomy, physiology and pathology of both the superficial and the deep venous systems, (SVS) and (DVS). It is indicated mainly {{on the study of}} two [...] pathologies: venous thrombosis and venous insufficiency. As with heart ultrasound (echocardiography) studies, venous ultrasonography requires an understanding of hemodynamics in order to give useful examination reports. In chronic venous insufficiency, sonographic examination is of most benefit; in confirming varicose disease, making an assessment of the hemodynamics, and charting the progression of the disease and its response to treatment. It has become the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> for examining the condition and hemodynamics of the lower limb veins.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{examination}} is focused mainly {{on the study of}} two pathologies; venous thrombosis and venous insufficiency. [...] It allows the examiner to evaluate the gross anatomy of the superficial and deep venous networks as well as the blood flow direction, which is crucial in determining vein pathology. [...] It has become the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> used in the assessment of the condition and hemodynamics of the veins of the lower limbs. The normal physiological blood flow is anterograde, flowing from the periphery towards the heart, so that the evidence of an opposite, retrograde flow might indicate a pathology. The presence of a reflux is likewise of note; a reflux when not isolated in a vein (as simply retrograde), means that the blood flow is bi-directional where once the flow had been only anterograde.|$|E
500|$|On 7 April 1795, the gramme, {{upon which}} the {{kilogram}} is based, was decreed to be equal to [...] "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a metre, and at {{the temperature of the}} melting ice". Although this was the definition of the gram, the regulation of trade and commerce required a [...] "practical realisation": a single-piece, metallic <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> that was one thousand times more massive that would be known as grave. This mass unit, whose name is derived from the word [...] "gravitas", which was the Latin word for [...] "weight" [...] at the time, defined by Lavoisier and René Just Haüy had been in use since 1793. Notwithstanding that the definition of the base unit of mass was the gramme (alternatively [...] "gravet"), this new, practical realisation would ultimately become the base unit of mass. A provisional kilogram standard was made and work was commissioned to determine the precise mass of a cubic decimetre (later to be defined as equal to one litre) of water.|$|E

2500|$|In {{selective}} ion monitoring (SIM) certain ion fragments are {{entered into}} the instrument method and only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer. [...] The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at {{a small number of}} fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan. [...] More scans can take place each second. [...] Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, matrix interferences are typically lower. [...] To additionally confirm the likelihood of a potentially positive result, it is relatively important {{to be sure that the}} ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known <b>reference</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. [...] A combination of described symptoms, clinical findings, and electrophysiological testing may be used. [...] CTS work up {{is the most common}} referral to the electrodiagnostic lab. Historically, diagnosis has been made with the combination of a thorough history and physical examination in conjunction with the use of electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing for confirmation. Additionally, evolving technology has included the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CTS. However, it is well established that physical exam provocative maneuvers lack both sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, EDX cannot fully exclude the diagnosis of CTS {{due to the lack of}} sensitivity. A Joint report published by the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagostic Medicine (AANEM), the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM) and the American Academy of Neurology defines practice parameters, standards and guidelines for EDX studies of CTS based on an extensive critical literature review. This joint review concluded median and sensory nerve conduction studies are valid and reproducible in a clinical laboratory setting and a clinical diagnosis of CTS can be made with a sensitivity greater than 85% and specificity greater than 95%. Given the key role of electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of CTS, The American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine has issued evidence-based practice guidelines, both for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
