40|$|Abstract: Basic {{infrastructure}} investment and social {{infrastructure investment}} have different impacts on {{economic growth and}} social development in urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> respectively. Empirical analysis of the impact that basic and social infrastructures have on economic growth and social development in urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> respectively is however largely lacking. Such estimates {{could be used to}} influence basic and social infrastructure investment decisions towards correcting inequalities that exist between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> A balanced panel dataset containing infrastructure, economic, demographic and social indicators are used to compile synthetic indices for basic and social infrastructure (using principal component analysis) and the analysis. Restricted within the least square dummy variable (LSDV), estimation techniques are used to calculate the respective elasticities and to evaluate if the differences between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> are statistically significant. The results indicate that basic and social infrastructure have different impacts on economic growth and social development in urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> The results also indicate that both basic and social infrastructure investment generally have a greater economic growth and social development impact in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> The research provides an empirical framework and actionable elasticities for the respective impact that basic and social infrastructure investment have on urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities,</b> which is largely under-researched. Knowing that basic and social infrastructure investment have a greater impact on economic growth and social development in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> can therefore influence policy and investment decisions towards the reduction of inequalities experienced between urban and <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> M.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} different conditions for integration of immigrants in Swedish <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> The study examine different assessments by members of the Swedish Rural Network’s Working Group on Integration. The overarching question is what opportunities and obstacles they experience in the integration of immigrants in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> This is explored through a series of semistructured interviews, based on three themes of integration: job market integration, social integration and housing integration. The study shows that low residential segregation, closer contact between residents and a committed civil society in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> create opportunities for integration. The need of labor in different sectors of the job market of <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> and the skills of immigrants can also provide opportunities for integration. The investigation shows how the lack of service and infrastructure, limited labor market, lack of housing and xenophobia are obstacles for the integration of immigrants in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities.</b> The study points at various measures to improve integration. Among them is the need of immigrant reception to be coupled with development in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities,</b> with improved plans for housing and infrastructure. Coordination of the skills of immigrants and the work opportunities in <b>rural</b> <b>municipalities</b> is another important measure...|$|R
