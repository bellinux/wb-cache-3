Opposition Labour MP Judith Tizard, who would later serve as an Associate Minister for the ministry in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand, accused the restructure of being [...] "all hype, no substance," [...] lacking the funding and human <b>resource</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> be effective.|$|R
25|$|The same {{scholars}} {{point out}} that ongoing delays caused by judicial review on agency actions may discourage less organized interest, because such groups lack the <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> maintain an effective coalition {{over long periods of}} time.

25|$|The general staffs of {{all major}} powers make {{hypothetical}} war plans.

25|$|In China, for instance, the {{collapse}} of the Cooperative Medical System left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> maintain good health. Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations. This issue was further perpetuated by the rising income inequality in the Chinese population. Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens, resulting in poorer health outcomes.|$|E

50|$|If {{the actual}} figures {{delivered}} through the budget period {{come close to}} the budget, this suggests that the managers understand their business and have been successfully driving it in the intended direction. On the other hand, if the figures diverge wildly from the budget, this sends an 'out of control' signal, and the share price could suffer. Campaign planners incur two types of cost in any campaign: the first is the cost of human <b>resource</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> plan and execute the campaign. the second type of expense that campaign planners incur is the hard cost of the campaign itself.|$|R
25|$|The union {{might have}} escaped this {{disaster}} {{if it had}} characterized the strike as a first step, rather than attempting to pass it off as a victory. That, however, would have required that the union also devote the <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> follow up with renewed, systematic organizing efforts {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the strike, instead of concerning itself with the futile effort to win reinstatement for discharged strikers through the Textile Labor Board. The memory of blacklisting and defeat soured many Southern textile workers on unions for decades.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle criticises the Spartans in his Politics: the helots keep rebelling; the Spartan {{women are}} luxurious; the magistrates (and {{especially}} the ephors) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the apella is silly; {{the wealth of}} the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> be a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he says, are even worse.|$|E
25|$|Again, {{employer}} adaptations {{undercut the}} effectiveness of the corporate campaign. Additionally, labor unions found it less expensive to build community coalitions, and relied more heavily on staff-driven corporate campaigns. Many union activists also argued that the publicity generated by a rowdy shareholder meeting, for example, or an embarrassing report about conflict of interest on a board of directors, supplanted the community campaign by building the necessary community pressure. These arguments proved incorrect. But declining union fortunes (literally) made it difficult to employ the staff and <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> build full-fledged community campaigns. More and more unions came to rely on the corporate campaign even as it became less and less effective.|$|E

25|$|Local food {{shortages}} {{can be caused}} by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as crop rotation, or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern agriculture, such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of free market policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers. Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of American jobs. NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding {{a situation in which the}} president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The bella moth {{presents}} a polyandrous mating system, where females mate with multiple males. On average, females mate with {{four to five}} males over their lifespan of {{three to four weeks}} but can mate with and receive up to thirteen spermatophores. Since spermatophores contain nuptial gifts of pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) and nutrients, multiple mating helps the female increase the fitness of her offspring. In addition, multiple mating also benefits the female directly. Since the spermatophores are sizeable and can be digested within the female, multiple mating allows females to accrue the <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> build additional eggs. This is equivalent to a 15% increase in egg production. In addition, multiple mating results in increased transmission of alkaloidal gifts to eggs. However, {{this does not mean that}} there is segregated allocation of these gifts. Instead, the PA obtained from numerous males is allocated in admixture so that eggs tend to receive from more than one male source. In contrast, normally most of the sperm used to fertilize the eggs comes from a single male.|$|E

She only captured four small British merchant ships during this period {{and returned to the}} Portsmouth Navy Yard for repairs in late 1813. By this time of the war, materials and personnel were being diverted to the Great Lakes, which created a shortage of <b>resources</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> repair her.
