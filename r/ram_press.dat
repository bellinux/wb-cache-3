50|$|Vegetable {{fats and}} oils are what are most {{commonly}} called vegetable oils. These are triglyceride-based, and include cooking oils like canola oil, solid oils like cocoa butter, oils used in paint like linseed oil and oils used for industrial purposes. Pressed vegetable oils are extracted from the plant containing the oil (usually the seed), using one of two types of oil press. The most common is the screw press, which consists of a large-diameter metal screw inside a metal housing. Oil seeds are fed into the housing, where the screws mash the seeds, and create pressure which forces the oil out through small holes {{in the side of}} the press. The remaining solids, called seed cake, are either discarded or used for other purposes. Oil presses can be either manual or powered. The second type of oil press is the <b>ram</b> <b>press,</b> where a piston is driven into a cylinder, crushing the seeds and forcing out the oil. Ram presses are generally more efficient than screw presses.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that women and children in The Gambia are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. The combination of heavy labor demands on women and a weaning diet low in calories takes its toll on women and children during the pre-harvest lean season. In 1995, the Small-Scale Sesame Oil Production project introduced an inexpensive, manual technology for edible oil extraction, called the <b>ram</b> <b>press,</b> to women in The Gambia. The overall aim of the project was to improve household nutritional security through the adoption of the <b>ram</b> <b>press</b> by women sesame growers. A 13 -month study was conducted to evaluate the success of the Small-Scale Sesame Oil Production project. The study involved 120 rural households: 40 households with access to motorized expeller technology (Expeller group) for sesame oil extraction, 37 households with access to manual <b>ram</b> <b>press</b> technology (Press group), and 43 households with access to both technologies (Combination group). Twenty-four hour recalls, food frequency data, anthropometric measurements, and production data were obtained at the baseline and at the post-harvest, peak sesame oil-pressing, and pre-harvest lean seasons.

It was suggested that the sunflower based rations can be used as cheaper alternatives to conventional dairy concentrates. The <b>ram</b> <b>press</b> sunflower cake, in particular is an option that may be used by smallholder dairy farmers to formulate local dairy concentrate, which influence dairying to a similar extent as the commercial dairy concentrate but cheaply. More research is required to determine fermentation patterns, rumen microbial protein synthesis, true intestinal digestibility and absorption of nutrients from sunflower-based diets at the small intestines in crossbred dairy cows...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the causes}} of {{malnutrition}} among the rural inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa is the high cost of dietary fats that are necessary to maintain normal body functions. Though the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN recommends an annual intake of 9. 6 liters of dietary fats a year per person, some areas of Africa consume only about 1. 5 liters annually. Many members of these communities lack the resources to purchase imported edible oils; locally produced peanut oil would provide a cheaper alternative. In addition, peanut production is particularly beneficial to farmers, as peanut plants enrich the soil they grow in. Once they have a steady supply of peanuts, the problem facing farmers is the inability to efficiently extract the oil from the nuts. The current design for human-powered rapid extraction is the Bielenberg <b>ram</b> <b>press,</b> which uses a lever to generate the required pressure needed to extract the oil. However, this design is not optimal for two reasons: it requires significant upper body strength to operate, and also, incorrect operation of the lever leads to {{only a fraction of the}} peanuts' oil content being extracted. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on a design modification originally proposed by a team in D-Lab Spring 2006. (cont.) While the oil extracting mechanism was kept intact, the lever was replaced by a cam-and-follower system driven by treadles. By moving the driving motion from the upper body to the lower body of the user, the new design aims to address the ergonomics issue present in the Bielenberg <b>ram</b> <b>press.</b> The cam also allows optimization of the pressure profile for the peanuts. Research performed by Ravi Patel in 2007 has shown that a rapid buildup followed by a long period of followed by a gradual advancing of the piston will create the desired pressure characteristics to maximize output. An earlier attempt to convert the Bielenberg <b>ram</b> <b>press</b> into a treadle design yielded several insights into how the design could be improved. These insights have led to many design modifications, which are incorporated into the proposed redesign. This redesign is aimed at improving performance, reducing cost, and increasing the manufacturability of the press. by Daipan Lee. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The ram-press {{technology}} for oil expression {{has received a}} lot of attention in many African countries during the last two decades. The technology is based on manually operated mechanical presses, which employ a slider-crank mechanism in two different configurations. The original machine was invented by Karl Bielenberg in 1985 and since then continuous design improvements have been made to improve their performance and ease of operation. This paper deals with the performance of some commonly used <b>ram</b> <b>press</b> machines such as BP- 35, BP- 30 and FI- 32, in order to establish their suitability for small rural oil expression technology. The available oil-seed processing techniques were discussed, including their suitability for locally grown sunflower varieties, and the characteristics of the <b>ram</b> <b>press</b> machines. The machines were tested by using three varieties of sunflower seeds, namely PNR 7225, PNR 7369, and Peredovik. The machines were compared by their outputs obtained when conducting a high production and high expression tests. Based on the above analysis the Camartec design (BP- 30) was found to have the best performance. The machine had the highest efficiency and also the highest expression rate in comparison to CAPU design (BP- 35) and RAM design (FI- 32) machines. The FI- 32 machine was found to be ineffective, having in the high expression test an expression rate below 20 % irrespective of the type of seeds used. In terms of the speed of oil production the CAPU (BP- 35) design performed better then the other machines. However in the high production test its performance was similar to that of Camartec machine...|$|E
