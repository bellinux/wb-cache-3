40|$|<b>Pulsating</b> <b>flow</b> can {{increase}} the heat transfer coefficient when a two-phase flow passes through a single horizontal tube through the following mechanisms: 1) When liquid-vapor two-phase flow and heat transfer occurs inside a tube, flow pulsations can change the flow pattern and increase liquid-wall contact area at a fixed void fraction, thus increasing the heat transfer coefficient; 2) Local pressure at some locations in the tube will drop more with <b>pulsating</b> <b>flow,</b> and the attendant reduction saturation temperature {{can increase}} local evaporation and heat transfer. However, the effects of pulsation are more complex for pulsations within a practical evaporator for which {{the use of a}} multi-tube construction and the presence of tube bends {{at the end of each}} tube certainly affect the resulting flow. In this case, it is anticipated that pulsation width modulation is very important for evaporator performance enhancement. Moreover, local pressure drop in the evaporator increases due to the <b>pulsating</b> <b>flow,</b> and this needs to be taken into account for practical evaporators when considering pulsation as a method of heat transfer performance enhancement. In this work, the effects of pulsation width on heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop in an air-to-refrigerant evaporator have been studied experimentally. An experimental system has been developed with two separate but identical evaporators located in separate but identical wind tunnels.

In part load and zero load conditions, instantaneous reverse flow occurs following the blow-down phase. The two-stage nature of the exhaust stroke combined with strong Helmholtz resonances results in strong fluctuations of the time-resolved mean catalyst velocity. The validity of the addition principle is quantified based on the shape and magnitude similarity between steady and <b>pulsating</b> <b>flow</b> distributions. Appropriate nondimensional groups are used to characterize the flow and quantify the similarity. Statistical significances are provided for the addition principle’s validity. The addition principle is valid when the nondimensional scavenging number S exceeds a critical value Scrit, corresponding to cases of low engine speed and/or high flow rate.

The flow meters were studied using a newly developed flow rig, designedfor measurement of steady and <b>pulsating</b> air <b>flow</b> of mass flow rates and pulsefrequencies typically found in the gas exchange system of cars and smallertrucks. Flow rates are up to about 200 g/s and pulsation frequencies from 0 Hz(i. e. steady flow) up to 80 Hz. The study included the following flow meters:hot-film mass flow meter, venturi flowmeter, Pitot tube, vortex flowmeter andturbine flowmeter. The performance of these meters were evaluated at bothsteady and pulsating conditions. Furthermore, the flow under both steady andpulsating conditions were characterized by means of a resistance-wire basedmass flow meter, with the ability to perform time resolved measurements ofboth the mass flux ρu, and the stagnation temperature T 0.
