5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts,</b> airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E

Experimental study of engine and cabin mounts identifies the structural behaviour of the complicated metal-net elastomeric mounts to isolate driver from {{noise and vibration}} transfer. In order to achieve the expected results, the loss factor and dynamic stiffness of engine mount is studied to provide fundamental information of the energy dissipation. A simple experimental method is presented in this project to evaluate the frequency dependent <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping characteristics by utilizing the measured complex frequency response function from low frequency. The study shows the transition of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness from static to dynamic values.

40|$|A simple {{experimental}} method {{is presented in}} this paper to evaluate the frequency dependent <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping characteristics by utilizing the measured complex frequency response function from impact test and by least-squares polynomial curve fitting the data obtained from the test. The study shows the transition of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness from static to dynamic values. Using the experimentally estimated values of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping, the dynamic response of the tested spring-mass system using a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> as the elastic element can be accurately reproduced. In contrast, it is found that the single degree of freedom (SDOF) ideal spring-mass model using constant stiffness and damping values can only predict the response of the system accurately at resonance but not at non-resonance frequencies. The proposed method is validated by comparing its results with those obtained by using mechanical shaker excitations and those of conventional direct stiffness method using blocked transfer frequency response functions...|$|R

50|$|The {{mid-engined}} Europa used {{a modified}} version of the Chapman strut. Owing to the need to isolate the engine and transaxle from the chassis in order to reduce noise and vibration, the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> led to an excessive sideways movement of the driveshafts. In this case, sideways location of the hubs was controlled by an enlarged diagonal radius rod to the front. Rubber sandwich mounts were developed that allowed vertical movement whilst controlling lateral movement. Similar vibration problems were encountered with the Elite, but as these only had the vibration of the differential to control rather than engine vibration, it could be managed by suitable design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{vibration}} isolation design of vehicle powertrain systems {{is important for}} improving the noise, vibration, and harshness performance of vehicles, {{and it has been}} widely studied. The <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> structure design of the transmission system, which is the main vibration source, directly affects the vibration coupling state of each degree of freedom (DOF) of the powertrain system, and also affects the vehicle ride and handling performance [1]. Therefore, vibration optimal decoupling is an effective way to improve the {{vibration isolation}} effect of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> [2].|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{the usage}} of {{vehicles}} has become necessary in every person's life the automotive industries {{are in need of}} reducing the vibration forces to satisfy the customer requirements. The performance and riding comfort of the automobiles are affected due to the vibrating forces. The power plants are the one of the major sources of vibration and these vibrations are caused because of the unbalanced forces from the engine. Engine mounts are identified as the one of the major sources of vibration controllers. In this investigation, modeling and analysis of an engine <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> are done. The mount consists of two mild steel plates and a rubber isolator in between the plates. The modeling and assembly of <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> components is done using I-DEAS and finite element structural analysis and numerical investigation are made on the finite element (FE) analysis software ABAQUS. The deformations of <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> obtained from FE analysis are used in the Minitab to develop the mathematical model and deformations are obtained with respect to different process parameters. The results obtained from the predicted model are compared with the numerical simulation results...|$|R

50|$|During this period, the Association {{produced}} work on {{the engineering}} uses of rubber.

5000|$|... "The {{most radical}} feature {{of his car}} was the novel {{suspension}} of its six-cylinder engine so as to cut down vibration. The engine was supported on three points and rested on <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts.</b> Noise and vibration were much less. There was {{still a lot of}} movement of the engine when idling, but under a load it settled down. Although it was a great success in the Plymouth, Henry Ford did not like it. For no given reason, he just didn't like it, and that was that. I told Walter that I felt it was {{a step in the right}} direction, that it would smooth out all noises and would adapt itself to axles and springs and steering-gear mounts, which would stop the transfer of road noises into the body. Today <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> are used on all cars. They are also found on electric-motor mounts, in refrigerators, radios, television sets—wherever mechanical noises are apparent, rubber is used to eliminate them. We can thank Walter Chrysler for a quieter way of life. Mr. Ford could have installed this new mount at once in the V&#8209;8, but he missed the value of it. Later Edsel and I persuaded him. <b>Rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> are now found also in doors, hinges, windshields, fenders, spring hangers, shackles, and lamps—all with the idea of eliminating squeaks and rattles." ...|$|E
