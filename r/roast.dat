Two batches of Colombian green coffee were <b>roasted</b> adding increased amounts of sucrose (0 - 15 g per 100 g of coffee) to reach the same <b>roasting</b> degree than a commercial Colombian coffee. Moreover, seven conventional <b>roasted</b> coffees from different origins (Colombia, Brazil, Kenya, Guatemala and Vietnam) and <b>roasting</b> degrees (Dark, Medium and Light), and one 100 % Torrefacto <b>roasted</b> coffee were analyzed.

40|$|<b>Roasting</b> is an {{important}} postharvest process for enhancing the palatability of nuts. Canarium indicum (Burseraceae) is a tropical nut indigenous to lowland rainforests of Melanesia that has potential for commercialization. Three <b>roasting</b> regimes were investigated to indicate a suitable temperature/time relationship for <b>roasting</b> Canarium. 1) <b>Roasting</b> for the same time (10 min) at three different temperatures (115, 120 and 125 °C) using fresh kernels (<b>roasted</b> within one month of harvest) and aged kernels (stored for three months after harvest); 2) <b>Roasting</b> for two different times (10 and 17 min) at the same temperature (120 °C); 3) <b>Roasting</b> kernels of low, medium and high oily appearance at the same temperature (115 °C). Kernel colour was rated from 1 (lightest) to 5 (darkest) using a paint colour swatch. Colours 3, 4 and 5 were considered dark enough to cause rejection. The mean colour of kernels was significantly darker when <b>roasted</b> at 125 °C for 10 min compared with <b>roasting</b> at 115 and 120 °C. Aged kernels were significantly darker when <b>roasting</b> at 120 °C for 17 min than when <b>roasted</b> for 10 min. <b>Roasting</b> 'high' oily kernels produced significantly darker kernels compared with <b>roasting</b> 'shiny' and 'dull' kernels. These results indicate that aged Canarium kernels of inferior quality should be <b>roasted</b> at temperatures below 125 °C for less than 17 min, but fresh, good quality kernels can be <b>roasted</b> at 125 °C for 10 min. Kernels with very oily appearance are not suitable for <b>roasting</b> as oiliness indicates cellular damage, predisposing to excessive after-roast-darkening. Further research is required to provide clearer guidelines for <b>roasting</b> good quality Canarium kernels...|$|R
