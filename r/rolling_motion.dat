5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a <b>rolling</b> <b>motion.</b> Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E

As such, the potential theory used for other ship motions cannot be used for <b>rolling</b> <b>motions.</b> This paper simulates the <b>rolling</b> <b>motions</b> of the DTMB 5512 ship model and the ship transverse section of the S 60 ship model with a naoe-FOAM-SJTU solver using the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes(RANS) method based on the OpenFOAM.

For the ship transverse section of the S 60 ship model, the damping coefficient is divided into three parts with the Euler and RANS methods:friction, vorticity and wave parts. For the DTMB 5512 ship model, the damping coefficient is also respectively analyzed, including the friction, vorticity, wave and bilge keel parts. The results in this paper show that the vorticity part accounts for the greatest proportion, while the friction part accounts for the least, and the bilge keels reduces the damping moment to a certain extent which shows the effect of rolling parameters on <b>rolling</b> <b>motions</b> and moments...|$|R

25|$|Side-to-side {{movement}} of the stick controlled the large rudder. This produced a <b>rolling</b> <b>motion</b> because the wings both had substantial dihedral, through yaw-roll coupling.

The Flying Flea, being a two axis aircraft, could not be landed or taken off in substantial crosswinds. This was not a big issue when the aircraft was designed because at that time aircraft were usually flown from large open fields allowing all take-offs and landings into wind.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytic}} method {{based on}} finite-element method (FEM) for the rolling gaits of tensegrity robots. By analyzing forces during the <b>rolling</b> <b>motions,</b> the following {{problems can be}} solved. First, {{the relation between the}} actuator combinations (AC) and the rolling directions is discovered for controlling the <b>rolling</b> <b>motions.</b> Second, the influence of the driving parameters on the deformations is found out for obtaining the optimized control strategy. Third, the influence of the material parameters on the <b>rolling</b> <b>motions</b> is achieved as guidance to design physical robots. Tensegrity robots were proposed as novel mobile robots based on tensegrity structures that consist of discrete rigid struts and continuous elastic cables. The tensegrity structures process the shock resistance ability and high deformation capacity, and can be used to build lightweight mobile robots. The tensegrity robots can generate multiple gaits and multiple deformations. Rolling gaits are more stable than jumping and more efficient than crawling. Aiming at rolling gaits, to solve the three problems mentioned earlier, force analysis is required. The internal forces of the tensegrity structures always keep balance to maintain the shape of the structures, however, as the structures are highly coupled, the variation of one force will change the rest of the forces and generates feedback effects to this force. As the number of the forces increase with the growing number of struts, the force analysis becomes more and more complicated. The existing exhaustive experimental method can obtain the relation between the AC and the rolling directions through massive experiments, but this method cannot tell the influence of the driving parameters on the deformations and the experiment results based on certain robots are not suitable for other robots without analyzing the influence of the material parameters. In this paper, an analytic method based on FEM is introduced. A six-strut tensegrity model is used as an example to test the feasibility of the method. Experiments on a physical robot are performed to verify the reliability of the computation results...|$|R
