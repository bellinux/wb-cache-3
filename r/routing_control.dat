5000|$|An LFO can be <b>routed</b> to <b>control,</b> for example, the {{frequency}} of the audio oscillator, its phase, stereo panning, filter frequency, or amplification. When <b>routed</b> to <b>control</b> pitch, an LFO creates vibrato. When an LFO modulates amplitude (volume), it creates tremolo. On most synthesizers and sound modules, LFOs feature several controllable parameters, which often include a variety of different waveforms, a rate <b>control,</b> <b>routing</b> options (as described above), a tempo sync feature, and an option to control how much the LFO will modulate the audio signal. LFOs can also be summed and set to different frequencies to create continuously changing slow moving waveforms, and when linked to multiple parameters of a sound, can give the impression that the sound is [...] "alive".|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{specific}} router implementation, the table in which the destination address is looked up could be the routing table (also known as the routing information base, RIB), or a separate forwarding information base (FIB) that is populated (i.e., loaded) by the <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> plane, but used by the forwarding plane for look-ups at much higher speeds. Before or after examining the destination, other tables may be consulted to make decisions to drop the packet based on other characteristics, such as the source address, the IP protocol identifier field, or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number.|$|E
50|$|In routing, the {{forwarding}} plane, {{sometimes called}} the data plane or user plane, defines {{the part of the}} router architecture that decides what to do with packets arriving on an inbound interface. Most commonly, it refers to a table in which the router looks up the destination address of the incoming packet and retrieves the information necessary to determine the path from the receiving element, through the internal forwarding fabric of the router, and to the proper outgoing interface(s). The IP Multimedia Subsystem architecture uses the term transport plane to describe a function roughly equivalent to the <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> plane.|$|E
50|$|PTSE {{information}} is passed between nodes using PNNI topology state packets (PTSPs). These packets utilize the <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> channel (RCC; VPI = 0 and VCI = 18) between adjacent nodes. The RCC {{is also used}} for Hello packets and other PNNI messages. If the switch is unable to establish the RCC with the adjacent node, then PTSE {{information is}} not exchanged. Once a node receives PTSE information, the node stores the contents, or element information, in the database. This information is used to generate precomputed routing tables that identify routes to other network devices. PNNI uses the Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path first (SPF) calculation. The PNNI database {{is also used to}} perform on-demand routing when the appropriate routing table does not contain a viable path.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of CTC {{there were a number}} of {{solutions}} to this problem that did not require the construction of multiple single direction tracks. Many western railroads used an automatic system called absolute permissive block (APB), where trains entering a stretch of single track would cause all of the opposing signals between there and the next passing point to [...] "tumble down" [...] to a Stop position thus preventing opposing trains from entering. In areas of higher traffic density, sometimes bi-directional operation would be established between manned interlocking towers. Each section of bi-directional track would have a traffic control lever associated with it to establish the direction of traffic on that track. Often, both towers would need to set their traffic levers in the same way before a direction of travel could be established. Block signals in the direction of travel would display according to track conditions and signals against the flow of traffic would always be set to their most restrictive aspect. Furthermore, no train could be routed into a section of track against its flow of traffic and the traffic levers would not be able to be changed until the track section was clear of trains. Both APB and manual traffic control would still require train orders in certain situations, and both required trade-offs between human operators and granularity of <b>routing</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

40|$|Inter-domain routing {{is based}} on a fully {{decentralized}} model, where multiple Autonomous Systems (AS) interact via the BGP protocol. Although BGP is the "glue " of the Internet, it faces a lot of problems regarding its fully distributed nature, policy enforcement capabilities, scalability, security and complexity. Due to the widespread adoption of BGP, only incrementally deployable solutions are feasible. Taking this observation into account, we describe a new, backwardscompatible routing model which {{is based on}} outsourcing and logically centralizing the <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> plane. We claim that outsourcing enables enhanced inter-domain routing. As multiple ASes outsource their <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> plane to the same outsourcing service contractor, AS clusters are being gradually formed. A logically centralized multi-AS <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> platform based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles is the natural point for taking efficient routing decisions, detecting policy conflicts, troubleshooting routing problems, and evolving BGP.
