Because the analysis of <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> {{in the field is}} prohibitively expensive we lack understanding on how <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> are distributed and why. Here, we explore the use of high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery in conjunction with in-situ measurements and machine learning techniques to map basal area of spruce and fir for two fire areas in Central Siberia, and analyze the distribution of <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> with respect to topography. First, an advanced feature selection algorithm which combines a genetic algorithm with guided local search is wrapped around the Random Forests regression technique, to identify suitable variable subsets out {{of a large number of}} candidate variables that were derived from Quickbird data. Second, we train and apply Random Forests using the derived variable subsets to the two fire areas to generate spatially explicit estimates of basal area for spruce and fir. Third, we analyze species specific differences and the relationship between basal area and topography using a high resolution digital elevation model from ASTER data. Our results show that the main gradients of species specific basal area can be reproduced using Quickbird data but stress the importance of variable selection. We find associations of <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> with topography - depressions and channels exhibit larger prevalence of <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> than ridges or plateaus, the latter being more often subject to severe fires. We further found that the relationship between basal area and elevation tends to be reversed inside the burned area in comparison to the surrounding unburned forest. Our results suggest that local topography may control the sensitivity of ecological processes to a changing fire regime with more severe fires, and highlight the synergistic use of high resolution satellite remote sensing and machine learning methods for fire ecological applications...|$|R

The comparison of these two curves tells the forester how many trees of each age-class should remain in the stand. Surplus trees are marked for harvest.

Sauder's (1990) paper on mixedwood harvesting describes studies designed to evaluate methods of reducing non-trivial damage to understorey residuals that would compromise their chance of becoming a future crop tree.

30|$|The slight {{increase}} in fine fuels (< 2.54 cm in diameter) over the 31 -year post-fire time period in the research plots (Figure 6) {{may be attributed to}} several possibilities. Although data were not collected after the prescribed fire in 1972, observation of the area indicated that many of the understory trees were killed and that about half of the woody and fine fuels were consumed. The increase in fine fuels may be due to post-fire woody fuels from trees killed by the 1972 prescribed fire or from subsequent tree damage or mortality due to non-fire causes. Also, litterfall from the <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> that may exceed decomposition rates in these relatively productive sites could contribute to the increase in fine fuels. Alternatively, the increase in fine fuels could be attributed to the difference in sampling methods used between the two time periods. In 1971, fine fuels were collected from paired sub-plots and weighed before and after burning, while in 2003, depth measurements were made in the field and converted to fuel load using depth/weight relationships (van Wagtendonk et al. 1998).|$|R

Stand age was defi ned as {{the age of the}} oldest tree cohort in a stand. When most fi res are not stand-replacing, the theoretical equilibrium stand age distribution is either bell-shaped or bimodal and dominated by old age-classes. Old-growth forests (oldest cohort> 150 y) dominate the landscape unless fi res are both frequent and severe. Simulation results and analytical calculations show that if a regime of frequent fi res (about every 50 y) maintains landscapes dominated by old-growth forests, then old-growth dominance persists when the number of fi res is decreased, despite the associated increase in fi re severity. Simulation results were applied to Pinus sylvestris-dominated landscapes of middle boreal Fennoscandia, which according to empirical results were dominated by old-growth forests when fi res were frequent during the 19 th century. Since the changes in the fi re regime can be plausibly explained by changes in the number of human-caused ignitions, old-growth forests have evidently also dominated the landscapes earlier when fi res were less frequent.

Elevation, climate, and substrate are hugely variable in the west resulting in differing forest types, potential productivity, and large variations of possible biomass yield. Studies to determine biomass harvesting efficacy often include estimates of current growing stock by forest type, which helps answer questions regarding utilization potential and possible yield. However, projections of biomass yield, {{and the potential}} influence of active management on increasing yields, is rarely evaluated. Using Forest Inventory and Analysis data collected in Utah between 2000 and 2009, we compared potential biomass yield of managed and unmanaged stands for the major forest types in Utah. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator to make 100 year projections of standing biomass by forest type and potential productivity classes. Results showed that management resulted in increased growth of <b>residual</b> <b>stands</b> which translated into modest increases in total standing biomass over time. Increased residual growth {{as a result of}} management was more pronounced in productive forest types (e. g., spruce-fir or aspen) than less productive forest types (e. g., common pinyon or Utah juniper). Within forest type, sites with higher potential productivity had higher biomass yield projections than sites with lower potential productivity. However, the absolute differences in yield between potential productivity classes among forest types decreased with decreasing forest type productivity. These results have strong management implications for production of woody biomass, especially for operations where multiple entries are planned...|$|R
40|$|Research on timber {{management}} tendencies by nonindustrial {{private forest}} owners, while sometimes conflicting, provides useful information to support policy analyses of timber supply and investment behavior. Numerous research studies regarding NIPF tree planting, intermediate stand treatments, and timber harvesting are reviewed. Conclusive research findings include that: (1) cost sharing correlates with increased tree planting, (2) cost-shared plantings are typically not liquidated when support payments end, (3) technical assistance with harvesting tends to increase tumpage revenues for owners {{and results in}} <b>residual</b> timber <b>stands</b> that are in better condition, and (4) technical assistance is correlated with increased harvesting. The degree to which nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners manage their land for timber productio...|$|R
