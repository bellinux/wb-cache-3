Aero clubs became active from the late 1920s, and the government provided some training aircraft and subsidies. Commercial aviation also began in the 1920s with some short-lived operations. The first major company was Union Airways of New Zealand, which began services in 1936 between Palmerston North and Dunedin via Blenheim and Christchurch. By 1939 the company was flying between Auckland, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.|$|E

50|$|In {{accordance}} with the Convention on International Civil Aviation (also known as the Chicago Convention), all civil aircraft must be registered with a national aviation authority (NAA) using procedures set by each country. Every country, even those not party to the Chicago Convention, has an NAA whose functions include the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>aircraft.</b> An aircraft can only be registered once, in one jurisdiction. The NAA allocates a unique alphanumeric string to identify the aircraft, which also indicates the nationality (i.e., country <b>of</b> <b>registration)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft,</b> and provides a legal document called a Certificate <b>of</b> <b>Registration,</b> one <b>of</b> the documents which must be carried when the aircraft is in operation.|$|R

40|$|The <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft</b> is a {{prerequisite}} for issuance of a U. S. certificate of airworthiness by the FAA. The procedures and requirements for aircraft registration, and the subsequent issuance <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> numbers, are contained in FAR Part 47. However, the process/method(s) for applying the requirements of Parts 45 & 47 to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has not been defined. This task resolved the application of 14 CFR Parts 45 and 47 to UAS. Key Findings: UAS are aircraft systems and as such the recommended approach to registration is to follow the same process for registration as manned aircraft. This will require manufacturers to comply with the requirements for 14 CFR 47, Aircraft Registration and 14 CFR 45, Identification and Registration Marking. In addition, only the UA should be identified with the N number registration markings. There should also be a documentation link showing the applicability of the control station and communication link to the UA. The documentation link can be {{in the form of a}} Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) entry or a UAS logbook entry. The recommended process for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> UAS is similar to the manned aircraft process and is outlined in a 6 -step process in the paper...|$|R
50|$|On 10 November 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102, from Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, {{suffered}} undercarriage {{damage in}} an emergency landing at Rome-Ciampino Airport, after experiencing bird strikes, which damaged both engines on approach.
