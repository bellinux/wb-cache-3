40|$|A {{potential}} {{treatment for}} paralysis resulting from {{spinal cord injury}} is to <b>route</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> from the brain around the injury via artificial connections. Such <b>signals</b> could then <b>control</b> electrical stimulation of muscles, thereby restoring volitional movement to paralyzed limbs 1 – 3. In previously separate experiments, activity of motor cortex neurons related to actual or imagined movements {{has been used to}} control computer cursors and robotic arms 4 – 10, and paralyzed muscles have been activated by functional electrical stimulation (FES) 11 – 13. Here we show that monkeys can directly control stimulation of muscles using the activity of neurons in motor cortex, thereby restoring goal-directed movements to a transiently paralyzed arm. Moreover, neurons could control functional stimulation equally well regardless of any prior association to movement, a finding that significantly expands the source of <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> for brain-machine interfaces. Monkeys learned to utilize these artificial connections from cortical cells to muscles to generate bidirectional wrist torques, and controlled multiple neuron-muscle pairs simultaneously. Such direct transforms from cortical activity to muscle stimulation could be implemented by autonomous electronic circuitry, creating a relatively natural neuroprosthesis. These results are the first demonstration that direc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 A connectionist/control {{architecture}} and simulation are described. The model is detailed at {{three levels of}} scale. The system-scale includes regions that specialize in different classes of processing. The activity of the regions is coordinated by a central <b>control</b> structure that <b>routes</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> among regions and sequences transmissions among regions to limit message interference. One region serves as a context storage mechanism that can reactivate messages contained on a innerloop of processing. At the macro scale, each region is d[i]vided {{into a number of}} levels that sequentially or spatially input or output the patterns to other levels. Each level has a control structure that monitors the activity of all the modules in its level and <b>controls</b> the <b>signals</b> to coordinate the sequential storage and processing of information. At the micro scale, each level includes multiple modules. Each of these modules involves a connectionist network that processes vectors of information. A module can store, categorize, maintain, and prioritize a received vector. This architecture provides an interpretation of working memory phenomena including the magic number 3 or 4, acoustic confusions, sequential processing, problems with digit cancelling, difficulty maintaining order information, elaborative versus maintenance rehearsal, episodic versus semantic memory, release from proactive interference, long-term memory recency effects, robut processing during short-term overload, and proactive and retroactive effects. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{design feature}} of the VCS3 (and later EMS systems) was that, rather than using patch cords to <b>route</b> audio and <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> between modules, Cockerell employed a small matrix plugboard into which the user stuck special conductive pins that connected an input (listed on the X-axis of the matrix) to an output (on the Y-axis). This matrix patchboard gave the VCS3 {{a high degree of}} inter-connectivity, comparable to that of much larger modular systems, and far greater than similar small synthesisers like the Minimoog. It was also much easier to examine than the tangle of patch cords used to interconnect other modular systems of the day, such as the Moog modular synthesizer and was many times smaller than the cumbersome Moog patch bays, which used patch cord leads capped with 1/4-inch 'phone' jacks.|$|R
40|$|The Port Card {{will be one}} link in {{the data}} {{acquisition}} system for the D 0 Silicon Vertex Detector. This system consists of the following parts, starting at the detector: Silicon strip detectors are mounted in a spaceframe and wire-bonded to custom bare-die integrated circuits (SVX-II chips) that digitize the charge collected by the strips. The 128 -channel chips are mounted on a High-Density Interconnect (HDI) that consists of a small flex circuit that <b>routes</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> and eight data bits for each of three to ten chips onto a common data bus. A cable then routes this bus approximately thirty feet out from the detector to the Port Card. The Port Card houses a commercial chipset that serializes the data in real time and converts the signal into laser light impulses that are then transmitted through a multi-mode optical fiber about 150 feet to a Silicon Acquisition & Readout board (SAR). Here, the data is transformed back to parallel electrical signals that are stored in one of several banks of FIFO memories. The FIFOs place their data onto the VME backplane to a VME Buffer Driver (VBD) which stores the event data in buffers for eventual readout over a thirty-two signal ribbon cable to the Level Two Computers and subsequent tape storage. Control and sequencing of the whole operation starts with the Silicon Acquisition/Readout Controller (SARC) working {{in tandem with the}} D 0 Clock System. The SARC resides in the same VME crate as the SARs, and transforms signals from the Trigger System into control codes distributed to the various Port Cards via optical fibers operating at 53 Mb/s. It is through these control codes that data taking operations such as data-acquisition, digitization, readout, and various resets can be carried out. The Port Card receives the control codes and manipulates the SVX-II chips in the proper way to effect proper data taking. There will be a total of about 700, 000 channels, which translates into about 5580 SVX-II chips, 66 to 100 Port Cards, 66 to 100 SARs, and four to eight SARCs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Multihoming {{is used by}} stub {{networks}} to improve the reliability of their Internet connectivity. In recent years, commercial “intelligent <b>route</b> <b>control</b> ” devices are used by multihomed stub {{networks to}} optimize the routing of their Internet traffic. In this work, we first conduct measurement of qualities of alternate paths through multihoming. In the remaining part, we study the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> of traffic {{among a group of}} multihomed stub networks which may belong to an organization and exchange data regularly. This type of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> is special because the access links of such networks may not be over-provisioned and are shared by traffic <b>controlled</b> by multiple <b>route</b> <b>control</b> devices. Such shared bottlenecks may affect the effectiveness of uncoordinated “intelligent route control”.

30|$|We {{design the}} MDs by {{explicitly}} exploiting the layered {{construction of the}} <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> In particular, we first generate a quantized control vector based {{on the principles of}} PPC. This vector contains the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and N− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Then, we construct M descriptions based on this control vector. The descriptions are constructed so that the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and J− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> can be obtained by combining any subset of J∈{ 1,, M} descriptions. Thus, the more packets that are received at the plant, the more future plant predictions become available. Note that on reception of at least one packet out of the M packets, the current quantized <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> can be completely recovered at the plant input side. When receiving and combining more descriptions, the quality of this <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is not improved. Instead new <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> become available. With this approach, we thus avoid the issue of having to guarantee stability subject to a probabilistic and time-varying accuracy of the <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Instead, we can use ideas from quantized PPC, when assessing the stability.

40|$|Abstract—Leakage {{power is}} an {{important}} component of the total power consumption in FPGAs built using 90 nm and smaller technology nodes. Power gating, in which regions of the chip can be powered down, has been shown to be effective at reducing leakage power. However, previous techniques focus on staticallycontrolled power gating. In this paper, we propose a modification to the fabric of an FPGA that enables dynamically-controlled power gating, in which logic clusters can be selectively powereddown at run-time. For applications containing blocks with large idle times, this could lead to significant leakage power savings. Our architecture utilizes the existing routing fabric and unused input pins of logic clusters to <b>route</b> the power <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> No modifications to the existing routing algorithms are required to support the new architecture. We study the area and power tradeoffs by varying the basic architecture parameters of an FPGA, and by varying the size of the power gating regions. We also study the leakage energy savings using a model that characterizes an application in terms of its structure and behavior. We show less than 1 % of area overhead for a power gating region size of 3 X 3 logic tiles. Using the application model, we show that up to 40 % leakage energy reduction can be achieved using the proposed architecture for different application parameters, not including power dissipated by the power state controller.
