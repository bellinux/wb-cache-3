5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several <b>related</b> <b>systems</b> failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

25|$|The Israeli {{economy is}} driven by {{industries}} based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country’s defence infrastructure.

40|$|We study block {{diagonal}} preconditioners and {{an efficient}} variant of constraint preconditioners for general two-by-two block linear systems with zero (2, 2) block. We derive block diagonal preconditioners from a splitting of the (1, 1) -block of the matrix. From the resulting preconditioned system we derive a smaller, so-called <b>related</b> <b>system</b> that yields {{the solution of}} the original problem. Solving the <b>related</b> <b>system</b> corresponds to an ecient implementation of constraint preconditioning. We analyze the properties of both classes of preconditioned matrices, in particular their spectrum. Using analytical results we show that the <b>related</b> <b>system</b> matrix has the more favorable spectrum, which in many applications translates into faster convergence for Krylov subspace methods. We show that fast convergence depends mainly {{on the quality of the}} splitting, a topic for which a substantial body of theory exists. Our analysis also provides a number of new relations between block-diagonal preconditioners and constraint preconditioners. For constrained problems, solving the <b>related</b> <b>system</b> produces iterates that satisfy the constraints exactly, just as for systems with a constraint preconditioner. Finally, for the Lagrange multiplier formulation of a constrained optimization problem we show how scaling nonlinear constraints can dramatically improve the convergence for linear systems in a Newton iteration. Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments on a constrained optimization problem. We consider the general [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of getting the right {{information}} to the right people at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and <b>related</b> <b>systems,</b> rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

40|$|We study block-diagonal preconditioners {{and fast}} {{iterative}} solvers for indefinite two-by-two block linear systems with zero (2, 2) block. Our preconditioners {{are derived from}} a splitting of the (1, 1) block, A = D E, where the matrix D can be efficiently inverted. Dierent splittings lead to dierent preconditioners, and we analyze properties of the preconditioned matrices, in particular their eigenvalue distributions. From the preconditioned linear system we derive a fixed point iteration {{as well as its}} so-called <b>related</b> <b>system</b> for solving the original block two-by-two problem. We study the convergence of the fixed point iteration and the eigenvalue distribution of the <b>related</b> <b>system</b> matrix. Using our analytical results we show that solving the original system by applying GMRES [20] to the <b>related</b> <b>system</b> is typically more efficient than solving it by applying GMRES to the preconditioned system. In addition, in the case of constrained problems the use of the xed point iteration or its <b>related</b> <b>system</b> leads to approximations that satisfy the constraints exactly after one iteration. Moreover, we show how scaling the original block two-by-two system can improve convergence dramatically. Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments on a constrained optimization application. Our approach is very general, as we make almost no assumptions on the given block two-by-two system. In particular, the system matrix might be nonsymmetric, and the (1, 1) block A might be indefinite, even singular. This is the first paper in a two-part sequence. In the second paper we will study the use of our preconditioners in a broad variety of applications...|$|R
