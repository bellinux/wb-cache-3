40|$|Damage {{is found}} in <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> bead corner radii of RTM 6 epoxy-based {{composite}} ribs due to in-service thermal-mechanical loading after an aircraft inspection. The same types of damage are obtained through pure thermal cycling of a single bead. However, thermal cycling is a time-consuming process. Therefore, a faster way of damage investigation is required. A potential way to achieve this objective is by mechanically cycling a coupon specimen with simpler geometry than the bead. To investigate potential {{solutions to the problem}} a literature review is performed. The scope of the literature review covers several topics as follows. Laminate fatigue damage modes and their impact on the laminate is researched. It is discovered that it is typical for RTM 6 epoxy-based laminates to build-up high matrix residual tensile stresses after manufacturing. Several differences between thermal and mechanical cycling are discovered. It is found that the most common way to test composites is by the use of ASTM standards. However, there is little available information about the fatigue behavior of laminates with <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> areas. Investigation of the fatigue behavior of laminates with <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> areas is performed by the use of FEA and physical tests. Four specimen types labeled from A to D are manufactured. Type A is a dog-bone pure RTM 6 specimen. Types B to D are all composite specimens with the same in-plane geometry and different layups and manufacturing processes. All specimens are tested statically and in fatigue. In the fatigue testing session, fractography of the damage occurring at different test conditions for different specimen types is performed. In addition, two FE models are created. The first model is of the bead. The second model is a harmonized model applicable to all composite specimen types with required layup readjustments for each specimen type. It is discovered by FEA that the maximum principal stress in the <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> area is perpendicular to the matrix cracks in the bead and the composite specimens. It is also discovered that the maximum principal stress cycle of the matrix at the <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> layer interface with the fabric is similar in the bead and the specimens. The similar fatigue parameters are the R-ratio and the stress amplitude. The parameter similarity suggests they could potentially drive the <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> layer fatigue damage initiation. Moreover, a positive through-the-thickness stress gradient is discovered, which suggests the cracks are likely to initiate bellow the <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> layer surface. This hypothesis is further supported by fractographic observations of cracks not reaching the laminate free surface. Static and fatigue tests are performed. The static test provides the UTS of all specimen types, based on which cyclic load levels are selected. In the specimen fatigue tests several results are observed. In the first place, damage similar to the bead damage is found, namely cracks and delamination. In the second place, the damage is observed to penetrate through the laminate thickness and to be dependent upon the laminate compaction. However, this penetration depth dependency on the compaction might be influenced by the second curing cycle of specimen type C, in which the damage was observed. Finally, reduction in the specimen stiffness is observed due to fatigue damage accumulation in time. Based on the results recommendations are formulated. For design purposes <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> area formation should be avoided {{both inside and outside the}} laminate. If their formation is inevitable, at least the laminate should be kept well compacted and the <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> area location should be kept only at the surface. For future research, two topics are identified as requiring such. First, is the laminate stiffness reduction. Second, is the influence of the second curing cycle of the well compacted specimen type C. Aerospace EngineeringAerospace Structures & Material...|$|E

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that the high}} content of resins and asphaltenes in heavy oil is responsible for high viscosity (Chao et al. 2012). The viscosity enhancing effect of the resins on heavy oil {{is due to a}} large number of heteroatoms contained. This promotes the formation of complex structures between family molecules, with little relationship with the size of the resin itself. In the asphaltene case, in addition to its own high viscosity, its viscosity enhancing effect is more reflected in the impact of micelles formed by interaction on the viscosity (Li et al. 2010). When the resins and aromatics in heavy oil are not enough to surround the asphaltenes to form micelles, the asphaltene molecules are likely to further associate with each other to form large clumps and coagulations, which greatly increase the viscosity of heavy oil. The approaches of viscosity reduction upon treatment of heavy crude oil with catalysts are mainly from two aspects. Intermolecular forces with weak bond energies expressed such as hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and van der Waals force are easy fractured, resulting in that the tight association structure in heavy oil becomes loose. The small molecules wrapped inside the heavy oil molecular aggregates are released and the viscosity undergoes reversible reduction. On the other hand, part of the chemical bonds with weak bond energies (C–C, C–O, and C–S bonds) are ruptured, leading to scission reactions for alkyl side chains and generating chain bridges, heterocyclic rings, etc. With heavy substances converting to light components, the molecular aggregation is weakened along with a decrease in the average relative molecular weight, and the viscosity reduces irreversibly. It is acknowledged that condensed aromatic rings form the main structure of <b>resin</b> and asphaltene. <b>Rich</b> fatty structural units connected to the aromatic rings, complex branched structures, and a high degree of aromatization make the molecular structure exhibit strong polarity and make it easy to be attacked by oxygen atoms, which contribute to a fast oxidation reaction rate and large reactivity for resin and asphaltene at low temperatures (Castro and Vazquez 2009; Chen et al. 2013 b).|$|R

40|$|In-situ micro-mechanical {{testing of}} small {{composite}} laminates {{has been carried}} out under SEM where video recordings allowed examination of the evolution of damage processes at the microscale. Samples are tested under three- and four-point bending to encourage failure under various combinations of normal and shear stresses. SEM micrographs of the distinct phases of failure are presented and their transitions described, from initial debonding at fibre-matrix interfaces, through to catastrophic failure. For [90 / 0]s laminates, the transverse crack density is varied by altering the thickness of the exterior 90 ◦ ply block. This influences the distance between evenly spaced transverse cracks, which allows the relationship between transverse cracking and the resulting micro-delamination behaviour to be investigated. It was found that the process of micro-delamination coalescence is impeded for laminates with lower transverse crack densities, hence delaying catastrophic failure. A virtual experimental sub-modelling method is presented to numerically predict the cracking behaviour of real laminate microstructures, which can be compared directly with experimental results to validate the numerical modelling approach. The onset and evolution of matrix plasticity is modelled by implementing a Mohr-Coulomb material model, while the fibre-matrix interface region is represented by a cohesive zone model. Numerical models closely corresponded to experimental results, validating the modelling approach which provides a method for non-destructive prediction of cracking behaviour for real composite structures in the future. The Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (NNA) is used to generate statistically equivalent random fibre distributions for large microstructure cells, embedded into homogenised laminate models. These models are used for a parametric study of certain key cohesive properties. Optimised values for the cohesive interface strength and fracture energy were determined through comparison with experimentally observed transverse cracking behaviour.

Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCFS) are one class of textile composites which are being investigated for this use. The aim of this project was to determine what affect the fabric structure of the NCF has on the larninates microstructure and in turn what affect this has on the final mechanical properties. After an explanation of the need for textile composites a review of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different classes is presented. The concept of a link between the microstructure of the composite and its mechanical properties is introduced with a review of past work in this area. Image analysis methods are identified as the most promising microstructural measurement techniques and their past use in quantifying composite microstructures is surveyed. Methods of quantifying the tow crimp, <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> areas and fibre orientations were developed using image analysis techniques.

In the present paper a modelling methodology is documented that captures intra- and inter-laminar damage and their interrelations by use of shell element layers representing sub-laminates that are connected with cohesive interface layers to simulate delamination. This approach allows the simulation of large structures while still capturing the governing damage mechanisms and their interactions. The paper describes numerical algorithms for the implementation of a Ladevèze continuum damage model for the ply and methods to derive input parameters for the cohesive zone model. By comparison with experimental results from gas gun impact tests the potential and limitations of the modelling approach are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity of <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> methanolic extracts (RRMEs) of Commiphora myrrha, Operculina turpethum, and Pinus roxburghii. Materials and Methods: Different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae). Results: Among all the bacterial strains tested, E. faecalis was most sensitive and S. typhi was resistant to C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. The extracts of O. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which B. subtilis and S. aureus {{were the most}} sensitive. Conclusion: This suggested that the antibacterial activity of RRMEs of O. turpethum was more than C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. This probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a finite element (FE) approach using commercial ANSYS V 11. 0 software to accurately predict the cured shape of bistable composites by including {{the influence of}} manufacturing imperfections, such as <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> areas and ply-thickness variations. Laminate composition was characterised by optical microscopy and their cured shapes measured using a Peak Motus motion analysis system. The FE model accurately predicts observed differences between laminate curvature in the two stable states. Localised reversal of curvature resulting from through-thickness shear stress is also predicted. Structural response to thermal loading was experimentally characterised showing a temperature dependent deflection rate and a residual curvature caused by non-reversible residual stresses. FE-predictions show good agreement with experiment over the range 20 - 110 °C. The presented data {{highlights the importance of}} manufacturing processes and materials selection in the design of thermally stressed multi-stable composite structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} biaxially {{deforming}} a weft-knit Milano rib fabric {{on the overall}} composite compressive properties has been studied for a glass/vinyl-ester knitted composite. A range of combinations of wale-course stretch ratios was considered. It {{was found that the}} compression properties of these structures, on the whole, appeared to be closer to isotropic and relatively insensitive to fabric deformation. This observation is believed to be due to the dominance of the matrix properties. Despite not detecting any gross changes in the knit structure, it is believed that some redistribution and reorientation of the fibres did occur during fabric deformation, which in turn altered the relative contents and/or directionality of the fibres in the composites. A feature of the compressive failure was kinking of the highly bent yarns, particularly in <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> regions having reduced lateral support for yarns...|$|E
40|$|Micromechanisms {{of fatigue}} failure in double-notch {{cross-ply}} carbon/epoxy coupons {{have been investigated}} using synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT). The fatigue behaviour of toughened and untoughened matrices has been compared, highlighting similarities and differences of damage modes in terms of fatigue initiation and propagation. Results show that damage does not propagate evenly for the toughened systems: the presence of <b>resin</b> <b>rich</b> regions constrains crack propagation, which is shown to suppress damage growth. In contrast, untoughened material is characterized by more uniform crack progression. The presence of toughening particles in the resin system favours complex local crack geometries, such as crack deflection {{and the formation of}} bridging ligaments along the crack wake due to particle debonding events. A distinctive aspect of fatigue loading is identified in the degradation of crack bridging ligaments associated with increasing number of cycle...|$|E
