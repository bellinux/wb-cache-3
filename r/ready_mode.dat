40|$|We use a {{mathematical}} model of the calyx of Held to explore information transmission at this giant glutamatergic synapse. The significant depression of the postsynaptic response to repeated stimulation in vitro {{is a result of}} various activity-dependent processes in multiple time scales, which can be reproduced by multiexponential functions in this model. When stimulated by Poisson-distributed spike trains the amplitude of the postsynaptic current varies considerably with the preceding interspike intervals. Here we quantify the information contained in the postsynaptic current amplitude about preceding interspike intervals and determine the impact of different pre- and postsynaptic factors on information transmission. The mutual information between presynaptic spike times and the amplitude of the postsynaptic response in general decreases as the mean stimulation rate increases, but remains high even at frequencies greater than 100 Hz, unlike at many neocortical synapses. The maintenance of information transmission is attributable largely to vesicle recycling rates at low frequencies of stimulation, shifting to vesicle release probability at high frequencies. Also at higher frequencies the synapse operates largely in a release <b>ready</b> <b>mode</b> in which most release sites contain a release-ready vesicle and release probabilities are low.

40|$|Programs such as space {{transportation}} systems are developed and deployed only rarely, {{and they have}} long development schedules and large development and life cycle costs (LCC). They have not historically had their LCC predicted well and have only had an effort to control the DDT&E phase of the programs. One of the factors driving the predictability, and thus control, of the LCC of a program is the maturity of the technologies incorporated in the program. If the technologies incorporated are less mature (as measured by their Technology Readiness Level - TRL), then the LCC not only increases but the degree of increase is difficult to predict. Consequently, new programs avoid incorporating technologies unless they are quite mature, generally TRL {{greater than or equal}} to 7 (system prototype demonstrated in a space environment) to allow better predictability of the DDT&E phase costs unless there is no alternative. On the other hand, technology development programs rarely develop technologies beyond TRL 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment). Currently the lack of development funds beyond TRL 6 and the major funding required for full scale development leave little or no funding available to prototype TRL 6 concepts so that hardware would be in the <b>ready</b> <b>mode</b> for safe, reliable and cost effective incorporation. The net effect is that each new program either incorporates little new technology or has longer development schedules and costs, and higher LCC, than planned. This paper presents methods to ensure that advanced technologies are incorporated into future programs while providing a greater accuracy of predicting their LCC. One method is having a dedicated organization to develop X-series vehicles or separate prototypes carried on other vehicles. The question of whether such an organization should be independent of NASA and/or have an independent funding source is discussed. Other methods are also discussed. How to make the choice of which technologies to pursue to the prototype level is also discussed since, to achieve better LCC, first the selection of the appropriate technologies...|$|E
40|$|D. Cur. Although {{tuberculosis}} {{is regarded}} as a curable disease, it still remains a health problem. The World Health Organization declared tuberculosis as a global emergency in 1993, and a global failure of health service providers to deal with the burden of tuberculosis in 1997. One of the factors that has a detrimental effect on the struggle against tuberculosis, is the fact that certain patients suffering from tuberculosis interrupt and/or stop taking their treatment before the scheduled period, thus, not adhering to their treatment. This non-compliance contributes to the increasing problem of chronic “halfcured and half-ill” patients with an increase of resistance against some of the first-linemedication. The problem with resistance is that second-line-medication must then be used. These medications are more toxic, the treatment is more expensive and takes longer, and, at the most, only half of the patients are cured. There are however other patients who comply with their treatment and complete it successfully. As a result of the above-mentioned problem the researcher has researched treatment compliance of tuberculosis {{within the context of the}} North West Province’s Southern District with the following objectives: ? to explore and describe the reasons why certain patients suffering from tuberculosis interrupt or prematurely stop their treatment; ? to explore and describe the reasons why certain patients suffering from tuberculosis comply with their treatment and complete it successfully; ? to develop and validate strategies in order to facilitate treatment compliance of the patient suffering from tuberculosis. Unstructured interviews were conducted with six patients who complied with their treatment, 11 patients who did not comply with their treatment (or defaulters), eight family members of non-compliant patients, and nine community health nurses. The following questions were asked in each respective group of participants: ? The treatment compliant patients and the defaulters were asked: “Tell me about your TB and treatment”. ? The family members were asked: “Tell me how his TB and treatment was for him”. ? The nurses were asked: “Why do you think some TB patients comply with their treatment and others are defaulters?” Interviews were recorded on tape and transcribed verbatim. Tesch’s (in Creswell, 1994 : 155) eight-step method of data-analysis was used in collaboration with an independent encoder to analyse the data. This research has proven that the treatment compliant patient is motivated and ready to comply with his treatment. Although the defaulter is also motivated he is not ready to comply with his treatment, because he does not accept tuberculosis as his problem nor the treatment thereof. This non-acceptance contributes to his misconceptions regarding tuberculosis and its treatment, and a negative attitude also develops towards the medicine, which becomes evident in the termination or adjustment of his treatment. The compliant patient on the other hand, within the same situation, when experiencing side effects, for example, still adheres to his treatment. Factors that contribute to the treatment compliance of the patient are: his motivation; his stage of behavioural change; the application of specific processes that will enable the patient to move from a nonready to a <b>ready</b> <b>mode,</b> where treatment compliance can be maintained; a patientcentred approach in the nurse-patient-relationship, where effective interpersonal skills are applied, where the patient is actively involved and where a member of his family is involved in the interaction process; and where cultural beliefs, stigmatisation and misconceptions with regard to tuberculosis and treatment are addressed. Strategies have been developed and validated that may enable the nurse to facilitate the patient’s treatment compliance. These strategies address the following aspects in order to promote the nurse’s knowledge and skills concerning: tuberculosis as problem and the treatment thereof; interpersonal skills within a patient-centred nursing approach; assessment of patient’s readiness to accept behavioural change within the patient’s cultural context; facilitation of the patient’s treatment compliance; facilitation of the community’s behavioural change in order to promote social support of the patient while cultural beliefs, stigmas and misconceptions are addressed...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the nature of}} a man's {{immediate}} memory for a short sequence of verbal items. Two components of immediate memory may be distinguished: an 'active' memory component, which is progressively destroyed within a few seconds if, subsequent to presentation of the sequence, the man is required to perform a distracting task which prevents rehearsal of the items, and a residual 'inactive' component which is more permanent. My concern is with behavioural evidence relating {{to the question of how}} the attributes of a verbal sequence are represented in active memory subsequent to identification of the constituent items. It is possible selectively to probe the retrieval of different attributes of the sequence by the use of appropriate tasks. Evidence on the performance of normal adult subjects in various short-term memory tasks, from the literature and from my own experiments, is extensively reviewed. There emerges a fundamental contrast between two groups of tasks: on the one hand, tasks which require the subject to indicate whether a test item was present in the memorised sequence (item recognition) or to judge the relative recency with which items have occurred; on the other,tasks which require the subject to base his response on the order or precise position of items in the sequence. To account for the nature of the contrast I put forward a general hypothesis which is an amended and elaborated version of parts of a general model of memory described by Morton (1970). It is argued that subsequent to identification of an item, representations of it may temporarily be held in active memory by two distinct storage mechanisms. Thefirst is as a decaying trace at the neural unit, called (following Morton) a 'logogen', responsible for the identification of that item. This trace may be treated as possessing a unidimensional 'strength' whose magnitude is dependent on how recently the item has occurred. Item recognition and judgements of recency are held to be mediated by assessment of the test item's trace strength with respect to a decision criterion located on the strength continuum. Secondly, the item may also be represented as one of several maintained in a serially- organised limited-capacity storage mechanism called (following Morton) the 'response buffer'. This holds a small number of the verbal responses recently made available by the logogens, coded as a string of articulatory descriptions or commands. It has two crucial properties. Firstly, items represented in it as potential responses may be fed back in sequence to the logogens for re-identification (the process of sub-vocal rehearsal). Secondly, since the serial order in which items enter the response buffer is retained as an intrinsic property of its structure, retrieval from it provides a <b>ready</b> <b>mode</b> of access to the order or position of items in the memorised sequence, which item-traces at logogens do not. The thesis falls into two parts. The first three chapters contain a theoretical review of the literature. In Ch. 1, the active/ inactive distinction is introduced with some reference to the historical background (1. 1). Some points of technique are raised (1. 2), the aims, of the present work are outlined (1. 3) and the twostore hypothesis is described (1. 4) In Ch. 2, evidence is reviewed from short-term memory experiments in which accuracy is the main dependent variable, beginning with experiments in which either serial recall of the whole sequence or probed recall of a single item is required. The hypothesis that the order of items is retained in active memory as an intrinsic property of the memory structure is contrasted with theories (e. g. Wickelgren, 1972) emphasising the formation of temporary associations between the representations of items adjacent in the list and/or between item and position representations. It is concluded that inter-item associations play no major role in active memory, and that item-position associations cannot account both for the partial independence of order and item errors and for the relationship between order errors and phonemic similarity. Conrad's (1965) model is introduced as a precursor of my own. It is concluded that items are recalled primarily from the (ordered) response buffer, but that traces at logogens influence the availability of responses as guesses when items are wholly or partly lost from the response buffer (2. 11). Some evidence is then described which suggests that variables may be identified which differentially influence retention of information about the order of items and about their occurrence (2. 12). Experiments comparing the effectiveness of position, context or both,as cues for recall are argued to imply that order and position are coded by the same mechanism, but that access to items retained by it may be more direct given a position rather than a contextual cue (2. 13). We then turn to experiments on short-term recognition and judgements of recency, which are discussed in relation to the trace strength theory of Wickelgren and Norman (1966) (2. 21). It is concluded that an item's recent identification is represented as an exponentially-decaying trace located at a unique permanent representation of that item, to which access is direct (2. 22). But order-recognition experiments provide little evidence that associations between items are represented in active memory in the same way (2. 23). The two-store hypothesis is then applied to some general problems of the functions of active memory: in speech comprehension (2. 31) as an 'address register' for inactive memory (cf. Broadbent, 1971) (2. 32) and as a working memory. Finally, the logogen system is discussed in relation to Sperling's (1967) 'recognition buffer' (2. 34) and evidence for articulatory as opposed to acoustic coding in immediate memory is reviewed (2. 35). In Ch. 3, I introduce the experimental paradigms pioneered by Sternberg (1966), which involve presentation on each trial of a different sub-span list for memorisation, followed by a probe to which reaction-time (RT) is measured. Several models are outlined of the nature, dynamics and format of the representations mediating performance in Sternberg's item-recognition paradigm (IRn), in which the subject must indicate whether the probe was or was not a member of the list. Predictions are derived from Sternberg's two scanning models and two versions of a trace strength hypothesis and compared to data available in the literature. The evidence favours the hypothesis that subjects perform the IRn task by judging the strength of the trace at the amodal representation (logogen) to which the probe provides direct access (3. 1). Evidence from a version of the IRn paradigm in which the memory set remains constant from trial to trial is then reviewed; it is argued that the results obtained are necessarily equivocal with respect to active memory; nevertheless, the concept of trace strength may be of use in this context also (3. 2). Next, we see that Sternberg's own experiments on contextual recall (CR), in which the subject must respond with the item following the probed item in the list, yield a pattern of results very different from that obtained in IRn. His own explanation is in terms of different strategies of search within a single store. In view of the failure of the exhaustive scanning model of IRn, the differences may be better accounted for by the two-store model. Since these RT paradigms provide a relatively pure and sensitive way of probing the retrieval of different attributes from active memory, a strategy is suggested of looking for factors which differentially influence performance in IRn, CR and related tasks. Evidence already available suggests that these factors may include serial position, phonemic similarity and the availability of a position cue. The second part of the thesis describes my own experiments. These employ Sternberg's varied-set IEn and CR paradigms and a task in which the subject must indicate the location of the probe in the list presented on that trial (Ln). In Ch. 4, I raise some methodological issues inherent in the use of reaction time as a measure and give details of the apparatus and general procedure common to the experiments. In Ch. 5 are described three experiments on the effects of phonemic similarity between items of the memory set on performance in the three tasks. Five-consonant lists were presented visually at a fast rate; the probe followed immediately and subjects were instructed not to rehearse; vocabulary and other factors were held constant across tasks. In Exp. I (CR) and Exp. III (Ln) phonemic similarity increased both RT and error frequency. The relationship between serial position and the effects of similarity in both tasks suggested a slow forward serial search through a temporally-ordered phonemically-coded store, save perhaps for terminal items of the sequence. The effects of similarity were in both tasks diminished when the probed item was phonemically distinct from the list items and, in CR, when the response item was similarly isolated. In Exp. II, no comparable effects upon IRn performance were found. Moreover, whereas marked increases with serial position probed were obtained in both CR and Ln, in the IRn task RT showed an accelerating decrease with serial position probed. The contrast between the two patterns of results is argued to be incompatible both with Sternberg's account in terms of two retrieval strategies and with Wickelgren's associative theory. The first experiment described in Ch. 6 (Exp. IV) demonstrated that IRn was not facilitated by a cue presented along with the probe which informed the subject which half (in terms of ordinal position) of the four digit memory set was relevant to his decision. This result is compatible with the proposal that access to the active memory representations involved in IRn is direct, and does not require a search through an ordered store. Exp. V compared the effects upon IRn and CR of giving with the probe a cue telling the subject in which of four spatio-temporal positions the probed item had been presented (if, in IRn, it was a positive probe). Experimental parameters and subjects were the same for both tasks. Information provided by the position cue had a marked facilitatory effect on CR, none on IRn (as in Exp. IV). The difference is held to reflect the fact that location in the list of the probed item and retrieval of its successor, in CR, requires a serial search of the response buffer, a search which may however be abbreviated if the subject knows at what position to begin the search. In Ch. 7 I give an account of a single experiment (Exp. Vl) intended to test predictions critically distinguishing the models of IRn outlined in Section 3. 1. Memory sets of 1 - 4 consonants were visually presented at a fast rate; subjects were told not to rehearse, Two variables were manipulated: 1) the recency of occurrence, prior to the present trial, of items presented as negative probes; 2) the recency of items in the memory set. The latter was varied by presenting the probe either immediately or following a short delay during which rehearsal was prevented by a vowel-naming task. It was found that the more recently a negative probe had occurred, the slower and less accurately it was rejected; the effect increased with set size. The introduction of a filled delay between list and probe reduced the slopes of the serial position and set-size functions. The former showed monotonic recency effects. These and other aspects of tho data are incompatible with any scanning model and favour the trace strength inspection hypothesis. In Ch. 8, two early exploratory experiments are described in which the task was again IRn. Mixed memory sets of digits and letters were presented; the probe was randomly either a letter or a digit. The question was whether the subject could use the semantic class of the probe to restrict a search to the appropriate subset of the list; such a strategy would not be possible according to a pure trace strength hypothesis. While Exp. VII provided no evidence for such a 'directed search' strategy, the data from Exp. VIII, in which the conditions were changed so as to maximise the possibility of such a strategy, showed an increase in RT with the size of the subset of the same class as the probe. However, it transpires that given the conditions of the experiment, this result does not rule out an explanation in terms of the trace strength inspection model. Changes are suggested which would make the experiment more decisive. The last chapter is devoted to concluding comments,speculations and plans. The necessity for exploring the adequacy of the two-store model in relation to other areas of research is acknowledged; these include speech production perception and comprehension, attention, non-verbal memory and the study of patients with memory disorders due to brain damage. Further experiments are suggested to compare the effects in the various short-term memory tasks of semantic similarity, rate of presentation, and interpolated material. In conclusion it is suggested that a greater emphasis on the representation of motor as well as perceptual events does much tc clarify the nature of active memory. </p...|$|E

This invitation was peculiarly acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many, and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons. He sat down, along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions, upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new. But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton that he replied, with an air of indifference, [...] "Um! ay! we aye hae sodgers amang us, mair or less. There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{deployed}} {{aircraft carriers}} underway, in between routine flight operations in regions where flyovers by potentially hostile aircraft were possible, {{two to four}} Navy and/or embarked Marine Corps fighter aircraft would be placed on or {{in the vicinity of}} catapults, armed, manned and ready to launch within 5 minutes of notification. This was characterized during the 1960s to present day by F-8 Crusader aircraft, followed by the F-4 Phantom II, the F-14 Tomcat, and today by the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18 Super Hornet. This [...] "Ready Five" [...] alert was augmented by a Ready 15 alert of pre-flighted, armed, but unmanned aircraft near the catapults with the pilot or crew standing by in the squadron's ready room, ostensibly able to launch within 15 minutes. Alert flight crews for airborne early warning, fixed-wing and rotary-wing antisubmarine warfare, and search and rescue helicopters were similarly established as required, typically in a Ready 15 or <b>Ready</b> 30 <b>mode.</b> This model was employed during the Cold War and continues to be employed to this day, especially when aircraft carriers and their strike groups are operating in areas of increased international tension.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the marked}} stack of bills is not used, it is stored {{next to a}} {{magnetic}} plate near a bank cashier, in standby or safe <b>mode,</b> <b>ready</b> {{to be handed over}} to a potential robber by a bank employee. When it is removed from the magnetic plate, the pack is armed, and once it leaves the building and passes through the door frame, a radio transmitter located at the door triggers a timer (typically at least 10 seconds), after which the dye pack explosively releases an aerosol (usually of Disperse Red 9) and sometimes tear gas, intended to destroy the stolen money and mark the robber's body with a bright stain. The chemical reaction causing the explosion of the pack and the release of the dye creates high temperatures of about [...] which further discourages a criminal from touching the pack or removing it from the bag or getaway vehicle.Dye packs are used in over 75% of banks in the US.|$|R
60|$|Then there arose a great {{row in the}} House, {{and there}} seemed to be a doubt whether the still {{existing}} Minister of the day would be allowed to continue his statement. Mr. Gresham rose to his feet, but sat down again instantly, without having spoken a word that was audible. Two or three voices were heard calling upon the Speaker for protection. It was, however, asserted afterwards that nothing had been said which demanded the Speaker's interference. But all moderate voices were soon lost in the enraged clamour of members on each side. The insolence showered upon those who generally supported Mr. Daubeny had equalled that with which he had exasperated those opposed to him; and as the words had fallen from his lips, there had been no purpose of cheering him from the conservative benches. But noise creates noise, and shouting is a <b>ready</b> and easy <b>mode</b> of contest. For a while it seemed as though the right side of the Speaker's chair was only beaten by the majority of lungs on the left side;--and in the midst of it all Mr. Daubeny still stood, firm on his feet, till gentlemen had shouted themselves silent,--and then he resumed his speech.|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} learner {{autonomy}} in EFL {{in recent years}} has run in parallel with the proliferation of self-access centres and the increasing availability of multimedia self-study materials. However, unless the learners themselves are <b>ready</b> for independent <b>modes</b> of learning, they may make poor use of such facilities. It is thus important to ascertain the degree of readiness for learner independence among our students. To this end, a 45 -item questionnaire designed and used in a British university was administered to a group of Spanish students studying English at a University language centre. While the Spanish students stated that they took responsibility for their own learning and enjoyed some independent work, they also exhibited a high degree of teacher dependence and felt that they could not improve without a class. It can be concluded that Spanish students value highly the teacher-class framework for language learning. Although a shift towards greater independence in language learning is positive, it would be unwise to promote this aspect {{at the expense of the}} traditional teacher-class structure. The ideal solution would be to incorporate aspects of learner training and greater autonomy within the existing structures, or to seek ways of integrating the affective and organizational aspects of the teacher-class system into more independent modes of learning. 1...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{partnerships}} and other cooperative forms of governance are common-place in addressing problems of environmental management in rural landscapes. These forms of governance are multi-dimensional {{in the policy}} instruments employed; the make-up of actors; and, the types of rationalities that actors use to debate the problem and proposed solutions. This paper pursues {{the question of how}} different modes of social action, represented in argumentative claims of participants, influence social coordination in these governance arenas. An empirical study is presented of agri-environmental governance in Australia where actors debate planning and policy initiatives to reduce diffuse water quality impacts from farms on the adjacent Great Barrier Reef. Forester 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualisation of practical social action which locates communicative action in the 2 ̆ 7 real world 2 ̆ 7 of interest-based planning contexts, is used as an analytical frame to identify: (i) the type of claims made by governments, farmer groups and other actors in argumentation; (ii) the claims association with communicative, strategic and instrumental modes of action; and, (iii) their consequence for social coordination in formation and maintenance of inclusive, legitimate and viable forms of governing. The study finds that the interconnected character of claims made by actors, and the <b>ready</b> switching between <b>modes</b> of action observed, point to a situated and dynamic expression of rationality within these contested and prolonged debates on how to legitimately and effectively govern rural environments. © 2010...|$|R
30|$|High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC or H. 265), {{the latest}} {{international}} video coding standard, displays a 50 % bit rate reduction with nearly equal quality and dramatically higher coding complexity compared with H. 264. Unlike other fast algorithms, we first propose an algorithm that combines the CU coding bits with {{the reduction of}} unnecessary intra-prediction modes to decrease computational complexity. In this study, we first analyzed the statistical relationship between the best mode and the costs calculated through Rough Mode Decision (RMD) process and proposed an effective mode decision algorithm in intra-mode prediction process. We alleviated the computation difficulty by carrying out the RMD process in two stages, reducing 35 modes down to 11 modes in the first RMD process stage, and adding modes adjacent to the most promising modes selected during the first stage into the second RMD stage. After these two stages, we had two or three <b>modes</b> <b>ready</b> {{to be used in}} the rate distortion operation (RDO) process instead of the three or eight in the original HEVC process, which significantly reduced the number of unnecessary candidate modes in the RDO process. We then used the coding bits of the current coding unit (CU) as the main basis for judging its complexity and proposed an early termination method for CU partition based on the number of coding bits of the current CU. Experimental results show that the proposed fast algorithm provides an average time reduction rate of 53 % compared to the reference HM- 16.12, with only 1.7 % Bjontegaard delta rate increase, which is acceptable for Rate-Distortion performance.|$|R
