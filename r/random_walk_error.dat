30|$|Indoor {{navigation}} is {{an exciting}} research and development area that promises new applications for many aspects of our lives. Whereas positioning and navigation outdoor have become ubiquitous and affordable {{over the last decade}} or so, providing similar services in indoor environments is extremely challenging. Depending on the required degree of accuracy a number of approaches are being followed [1 – 3], ranging from high sensitivity GNSS, dedicated wireless systems to inertial navigation as well as various combinations. In this article, we will focus on inertial navigation for pedestrians and the application is continuous and online meter-level-accuracy positioning with either foot-mounted sensors [4] or other suitable forms of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) [5, 6]. PDR is based on the principle that we can detect and estimate individual steps of a person. A simple step counter can be used to estimate distance traveled [7] and if we estimate heading changes then we can also estimate the relative location change over time. An advanced form of PDR uses one or more inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on suitable parts of the body (e.g., the foot); we perform a true six degrees of freedom navigation integration, usually aided during resting phases (e.g., the well-known zero velocity update--ZUPT) [4]. Every form of PDR suffers from errors which might be modeled, for instance, as angular and distance random walks [8]. The result is a <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>error</b> in relative location which implies that the estimated location drifts over time.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. The Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) {{has been}} in the gaming {{industry}} for several years now. Of late though programmers and scientists have started to use the parallel processing or stream processing capabilities of the GPU in general numerical applications. The Monte Carlo method is a processing intensive methods, as it evaluates systems with stochastic components. The stochastic components require several iterations of the systems to develop an idea of how the systems reacts to the stochastic inputs. The stream processing capabilities of GPUs are used for the analysis of such systems. Evaluating low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) for utilisation in Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) is a processing intensive process. The non-deterministic or stochastic error components of the IMUs output signal requires multiple simulation runs to properly evaluate the IMUs performance when applied as input to an INS. The GPU makes use of stream processing, which allows simultaneous execution of the same algorithm on multiple data sets. Accordingly Monte Carlo techniques are applied to create trajectories for multiple possible outputs of the INS based on stochastically varying inputs from the IMU. The processing power of the GPU allows simultaneous Monte Carlo analysis of several IMUs. Each IMU requires a sensor error model, which entails calibration of each IMU to obtain numerical values for the main error sources of lowcost IMUs namely scale factor, non-orthogonality, bias, random walk and white noise. Three low-cost MEMS IMUs was calibrated to obtain numerical values for their sensor error models. Simultaneous Monte Carlo analysis of each of the IMUs is then done on the GPU with a resulting circular error probability plot. The circular error probability indicates the accuracy and precision of each IMU relative to a reference trajectory and the other IMUs trajectories. Results obtained indicate the GPU to be an alternative processing platform, for large amounts of data, to that of the CPU. Monte Carlo simulations on the GPU was performed 200 % faster than Monte Carlo simulations on the CPU. Results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, indicated the <b>Random</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>error</b> to be the main source of error in low-cost IMUs.

40|$|Abstract: Position and Orientation System (POS) is a {{technology}} widely used for motional error compensation of airborne InSAR. The measurement errors of inertial sensor (accelerometers and gyros) are the chief influencing factors to {{the precision of}} POS. In order to enhance the accuracy of POS, an improved SINS error model {{should be used in}} POS. Traditionally, the SINS error model is considered as a random constant error for both gyros and accelerometers. In this paper, a more precise error model for SINS is developed by augmenting <b>random</b> <b>walks</b> <b>error,</b> first-order Markov process error, scale factor error and installation error. According to the improved SINS error model, a Kalman filter is established with 45 states including three random constant <b>errors</b> s, three <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>errors,</b> three first-order Markov process errors, three scale factor errors and six installation errors for both gyros and accelerometers, and nine navigation parameter errors. To validate the improved error model in respect of accuracy, the semi physical flight simulation based on the imitation of imaging-flight route of InSAR is made to compare with the traditional SINS error model which only considering the random constant error. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the improved SINS error model is one order higher than the traditional SINS error model. The improved SINS error model presented in this paper will lead to higher accuracy of POS used in InSAR motion compensation...|$|R

Light circulating through the loop in both directions experiences a relative phase delay proportional to rotation rate about the loop axis. This paper derives the phase delay and discusses signal detection, signal processing techniques and error sources.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{navigating}} a gun-launched, spinning projectile using only accelerometers is presented. A linear {{combination of the}} outputs of a general configuration of at least 12 accelerometers is shown to provide measurements of angular acceleration and angular rate products of the form w 2 /i and wiwj. These measurements {{are used in the}} development of a 12 state, extended Kalman filter to estimate position, velocity, attitude, and angular rate, with twelve additional states included to estimate accelerometer biases. Assumptions about the dynamic behavior of the vehicle are used to assist in attitude estimation. These assumptions come in two parts. First, that the nose of the vehicle remains pointed along the air-relative velocity vector during flight. Second, that the vehicle lateral angular rates have a secular component due to the vehicle pitching over during flight to maintain this alignment. A digital filter is used to isolate the secular pitch-over component of the estimated rate in an intermediate, non-rolling frame. These dynamics-based estimates are then incorporated as measurements in the navigation filter. A configuration of 12 accelerometers arranged on the faces of a 10 cm cube is used in a six degree of freedom simulation to navigate a projectile spinning at 2 Hz. The navigation filter is shown to reliably estimate angular rates with biases as large as 1 g. Bias state estimation is also shown to compensate for instrument misalignments up to 1 degree. Using the dynamics-based measurements, the navigation filter successfully estimates projectile roll attitude to within 20 degrees for instrument <b>random</b> <b>walk</b> <b>errors</b> up to 2. 5 milli-g/[square root] Hz. by Paul James Goulart.

Hence, they smooth inventory levels and update prior information about assets using multiple instruments. In ignoring other instruments, previous studies have ignored the information that these provide and overemphasize the role of price changes in inventory management.
