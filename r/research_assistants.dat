5|$|GTRI is {{the largest}} single {{employer}} of Georgia Tech graduate and undergraduate students; as of 2013, GTRI employed 186 graduate co-ops and <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> and 128 undergraduate co-ops. GTRI's contributions to the Georgia Tech community include collaborative research with academic faculty, courses originated by GTRI faculty, and joint service efforts. Collaboration is strong between the faculties of GTRI and the academic schools and departments. Many GTRI researchers hold appointments as adjunct faculty members in Georgia Tech academic departments, serve on thesis advisory committees, and teach both academic and continuing education courses.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed {{as the first}} Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It {{was the first time}} a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two <b>research</b> <b>assistants</b> had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E
40|$|Research {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of knowledge and, hence, wealth generation, so it is timely to consider a neglected category of the research workforce, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> The <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> has traditionally been part of the fabric, if not the structure, of university research efforts but despite the extent of the contribution, the breadth of skills and the depth of qualifications often brought to the position of <b>research</b> <b>assistant,</b> there is no overt professional pathway articulated for these research workers. Equally, there is an implicit, if not overt lack of recognition of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> role in processes of knowledge generation. This lack of recognition is reflected in the difficulty of defining the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> role and articulating how it differs across disciplines. This paper considers the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> in the current research landscape and culture of Australian universities, providing background to a wide-ranging empirical study of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> workforce exploring the experience of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> and the significance of the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> role in knowledge generation. 10 page(s...|$|R

30|$|The general {{procedure}} for performing the {{content analysis of}} annual reports is outlined below: the principal investigator and the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> performed the content analysis. Prior to the coding process, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> was given a detailed briefing on what constitutes a CSR disclosure, {{the use of the}} coding instrument and an explanation of the different categories and types of disclosure. During the briefing session, the principal investigator used several different annual reports that were not part of the actual sample used for the study to highlight different types of disclosures. At the end of the session, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> was then handed a few annual reports to attempt the coding. Upon completion of this preliminary round of coding, the principal investigator reviewed the coding and categorisations performed by the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> The principal investigator addressed specific issues in coding raised by the <b>research</b> <b>assistant.</b> Following this initial round, the <b>research</b> <b>assistant</b> and the principal investigator both were involved in the coding process of the annual reports and discussed any ambiguity of the items of disclosure, which were reviewed and resolved. This was carried out to ensure consistency and reliability in the content analysis procedure.|$|R

25|$|In November 1997, King was {{assigned}} to oversee the union's National Organizing Department, a position created especially for him. UAW members approved making the position an elected vice president in June 1998, and King was elected that year. It was the first new vice presidency created in many years. During his four-year tenure in this latter position, King pushed the UAW to organize retail workers at Kmart, casino workers; state, county, and local government employees; and graduate student teaching and <b>research</b> <b>assistants.</b> Yokich defended King's outreach to these nontraditional constituencies of the UAW. King also established six regional organizing centers to help devolve responsibility for organizing closer to the worksite. By November 2000, he had led organizational drives which added about 50,000 new members to the union. By 2001, more than 22,000 state government workers in Michigan belonged to the UAW, as did some 15,000 graduate student workers. More than 20,000 of the 60,000 new members the UAW organized between 2002 and 2006 worked outside the automotive industry. Under his leadership, the UAW organized another 6,000 new members between 2006 and 2009. But his organizing drives also saw some major setbacks, such as when Nissan workers in Tennessee rejected UAW representation 2-to-1 in what {{was seen as a}} major setback for the union in its Southern organizing effort. Another loss came at Freightliner in North Carolina, and a major organizing effort at Mercedes-Benz never resulted in an election.
