25|$|<b>Random</b> <b>generation</b> of gamma variates is {{discussed}} in detail by Devroye, noting that none are uniformly fast for all shape parameters. For small values of the shape parameter, the algorithms are often not valid. For arbitrary values of the shape parameter, one can apply the Ahrens and Dieter modified acceptance–rejection method Algorithm GD (shape k ≥ 1), or transformation method when 0 < k < 1. Also see Cheng and Feast Algorithm GKM 3 or Marsaglia's squeeze method.|$|E
25|$|ToeJam & Earl is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} by Johnson Voorsanger Productions {{and published by}} Sega for the Sega Genesis video game console. Released in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players {{assume the role of}} either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earls design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the <b>random</b> <b>generation</b> of levels and items. It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|For {{generating}} random permutations {{of a given}} {{sequence of}} n values, {{it makes no difference}} whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of n to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of n that result in the same permuted sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large n due to the growth of the number n!, {{there is no reason to}} assume that n will be small for <b>random</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 61 - 65. Randomness is {{a crucial}} resource for cryptography, and random number generators are critical building blocks of almost all cryptographic systems. Therefore, <b>random</b> number <b>generation</b> {{is one of the}} key parts of secure communication. <b>Random</b> number <b>generation</b> does not guarantee security. Problematic <b>random</b> number <b>generation</b> process may result in breaking the encrypted communication channel, because encryption keys are obtained by using random numbers. For computers and smart devices, <b>generation</b> of <b>random</b> numbers is done by operating systems. Applications which need random numbers for their operation request them from the operating system they are working on. Due to the importance of <b>random</b> number <b>generation,</b> this process should be analyzed deeply and cryptographically for different operating systems. From this perspective, we studied Android <b>random</b> number <b>generation</b> process by looking at the source codes and found that security of <b>random</b> number <b>generation</b> done by Android relies on the security of <b>random</b> number <b>generation</b> of Linux. Then we analyzed Android random number generator by modifying the kernel source code and applying some tests on its entropy estimator. Finally, we looked for possible weaknesses of random number generator during startup of Android devices. Sarıtaş, SerkanM. S...|$|R

500|$|The newfound {{success in}} roguelike-likes is {{considered}} {{part of a larger}} trend in those that play both board and computer games, looking for [...] "rich play experiences", as described by 100 Rogues developer Keith Burgun, that more popular titles may not always offer. David Bamguart of Gaslight Games stated that there is a thrill of the risk inherent in roguelike-likes with <b>random</b> <b>generation</b> and permadeath, helping the player become more invested in the fate of their player character: [...] "The deadly precariousness inherent to the unknown environments of roguelikes gives that investment a great deal of meaning." [...] Additionally, many of these newer roguelike-likes strive to address the apparent high difficulty and ruthlessness that traditional roguelikes were known for, and newer players will be able to find more help through user-generated game guides and walkthroughs made possible through wide Internet accessibility. Fabien Fischer offers that players have taken to independently-developed roguelike-likes as they have tired from [...] "superficial gameplay, whitewashing spectacle, the content craze, and Skinner Box design" [...] in titles produced by AAA developers and publishers.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay was {{compared}} frequently to Blizzard's Diablo series. According to Sullivan, the comparison was inevitable as Diablo helped define the genre, and was emphasized {{by the lack}} of action RPGs at the time. While the core gameplay remained traditional, they attempted to innovate in other areas. Character creation was simplified to simply choosing a name and gender rather than character types being tied to classes or chosen proficiency. They also effectively removed tutorials so players could get straight into gameplay, using games like Neverwinter Nights as an example of tutorials impeding players during early stages. When creating the skill system, the team looked at earlier successful RPGs and considered how they could improve on them. They also wanted to avoid creating characters who had [...] "a little of everything" [...] while offering replayability. The result was the creation of the themed masteries, with the added element of skill acquisition not being tied to level progression, allowing for players to bank skill points for different purposes. This system was built to encourage player freedom and represent logical character progression rather than tying one character to one class. Spawn points for enemies were governed by a <b>random</b> <b>generation</b> system, of what monsters are spawned depending on both environment and player level. Loot was controlled by a database system which mixed and matched characteristics to produce [...] "over 100,000" [...] item combinations. Loot drops were also made to fit the types of creatures killed, in contrast to other games such as World of Warcraft which had animals dropping currency and weapons regardless. Loot types were also designed to be clearly visible on enemies so players could pick and choose which enemies to engage and which defeated enemy to loot. According to Bruno, the team were limited with the amount of impact and realism they could put into combat by the necessity of keeping the game within its prescribed ESRB age ratings of [...] "E for Everyone" [...] and [...] "T for Teens": this meant that blood was non-existent and hit reactions were minimal, negatively affecting player impressions of the game. Multiplayer was part of the game plan from its beginnings, with the main goal being to foster a community around the game. Bruno later faulted the lack of secure multiplayer as one of the major faults with the game: THQ apparently was unwilling to invest in this.|$|E
