40|$|INGINE Inc. {{developed}} its own {{wave energy}} converter (WEC) named INWAVE and has currently installed three prototype modules in Jeju Island, Korea. This device is an on-shore-type WEC that consists of a buoy, pulleys fixed to the sea-floor and a power take off module (PTO). Three ropes are moored tightly {{on the bottom of}} the buoy and connected to the PTO via the pulleys, which are moving back and forth according to the motion of the buoy. Since the device can harness wave energy from all six degrees of movement of the buoy, it is possible to extract energy efficiently even under low energy density conditions provided in the coastal areas. In the PTO module, the <b>ratchet</b> <b>gears</b> convert the reciprocating movement of the rope drum into a uni-directional rotation and determine the transmission of power from the relation of the angular velocities between the rope drum and the generator. In this process, the discontinuity of the power transmission occurs and causes the modeling divergence. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the virtual torsion spring in order to prevent the impact error in the <b>ratchet</b> <b>gear</b> module, thereby completing the PTO modeling. In this paper, we deal with dynamic analysis in the time domain, based on Newtonian mechanics and linear wave theory. We derive the combined dynamics of the buoy and PTO modules via geometric relation between the buoy and mooring ropes, then suggest the <b>ratchet</b> <b>gear</b> mechanism with the virtual torsion spring element to reduce the dynamic errors during the phase transitions. Time domain simulation is carried out under irregular waves that reflect the actual wave states of the installation area, and we evaluate the theoretical performance using the capture width ratio...|$|R
25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Recent improvements in design have replaced the <b>ratchet</b> (<b>gear</b> and pawl mechanism) with sprag clutches and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives {{were made by the}} Manchester Locomotive Works.|$|R
50|$|Dashpots {{frequently}} use {{a one-way}} mechanical bypass to permit fast unrestricted motion {{in one direction}} and slow motion using the dashpot in the opposite direction. This permits, for example, a door to be opened quickly without added resistance, but then to close slowly using the dashpot. For hydraulic dashpots this unrestricted motion is accomplished using a one-way check-valve that allows fluid to bypass the dashpot fluid constriction. Non-hydraulic dashpots may use a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>gear</b> to permit free motion in one direction.|$|R

The fan-shaped auditorium that seated 1,614 sat atop the podium and had a street-level entrance on Hopkins Plaza as well as a pedestrian bridge that connected to an elevated walkway leading to other buildings in Charles Center. Balconies were behind the orchestra seats and protruded beyond the exterior walls to give the building the appearance of a <b>ratchet</b> <b>gear</b> when viewed from above.|$|R

This phenomenon, known as the Leidenfrost effect, is associated with dramatically reduced friction and heat exchange between the solid and liquid phases and {{can also lead to}} directionally self-propelled droplets on surfaces with asymmetric micro and macro scale features resembling surface profiles in <b>ratchet</b> <b>gears.</b> Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} directionality of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets can be achieved on surfaces with nanoscale features, namely, on tilted nanopillar arrays. High speed video analysis of bouncing Leidenfrost droplets on such asymmetrically nanostructured surfaces reveals an unexpected role of the asymmetric wettability of tilted nanopillar arrays during their intermittent contact with the Leidenfrost droplets as a key mechanism responsible for the directional droplet rebound and subsequent movement...|$|R
40|$|An X-Y scanner {{utilizes}} an {{eddy current}} or ultrasonic current test probe to detect surface defects in small flat plates and the like. The apparatus includes a scanner which travels {{on a pair}} of slide tubes in the X-direction. The scanner, carried on a carriage which slides in the Y-direction, is driven by a helix shaft with a closed-loop helix groove in which a follower pin carried by scanner rides. The carriage is moved incrementally in the Y-direction upon the completion of travel of the scanner {{back and forth in the}} X-direction by means of an indexing actuator and an indexing gear. The actuator is in the form of a ratchet which engages <b>ratchet</b> <b>gear</b> upon return of the scanner to the indexing position. The indexing gear is rotated a predetermined increment along a crack gear to move carriage incrementally in the Y-direction. Thus, simplified highly responsive mechanical motion may be had in a small lightweight portable unit for accurate scanning of small area...|$|R
5000|$|Researchers {{from the}} University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have {{constructed}} a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, {{when not in}} thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-Brownian motion into work {{by means of a}} granular gas, which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state. The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas. [...] Because the <b>ratchet's</b> <b>gear</b> and pawl mechanism, as described above, permitted the axle to rotate only in one direction, random collisions with the moving beads caused the vane to rotate. This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis. However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads. Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas. Unlike an ideal gas, though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop. In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained. Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength. For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation. [...] The experiment was filmed.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} of Richard of Wallingford, the use of <b>ratchets</b> and <b>gears</b> allowed the towns of Europe to create {{mechanisms}} to display the time on their respective town clocks; by {{the time of}} the scientific revolution, the clocks became miniaturized enough for families to share a personal clock, or perhaps a pocket watch. At first, only kings could afford them. Pendulum clocks were widely used in the 18th and 19th century. They have largely been replaced in general use by quartz and digital clocks. Atomic clocks can theoretically keep accurate time for millions of years. They are appropriate for standards and scientific use.|$|R

40|$|Radiologists {{commonly}} use contrast {{agents to}} improve resolution and acuity when employing MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Introducing MRI contrast agents to the {{tissue in the}} innermost part of the femoroacetabular joint is extremely difficult because the anatomy prevents the contrast agents from infiltrating those surfaces. Therefore, getting the ideal image resolution and making diagnosis of the hip is difficult. The objective was to design a product that would successfully distract one hip joint while also stabilizing the patientâ€™s pelvis to improve visualization so that physicians are able to better diagnose the hip. The deliverables included a preliminary model that illustrates how the device will move and apply load, and a minimal viable prototype of the traction device. A platform was designed to contain each component. Traction was applied with a winch that employed a <b>ratchet</b> <b>gear</b> system. The winch could be translated {{to either side of}} the platform via pins holding the winch and gears in place. Stabilizing components included pegs strategically placed under the arms and in the groin area. To alleviate some of the psychological concerns a patient may have, a release mechanism was incorporated into the design. The patient would pull the rope that is attached to the velcro strap on the ankle brace to release their foot from the ankle brace in traction. The spring for the spring scale will be made from beryllium copper because it is non ferromagnetic and is ideal for use as a tension spring. The platform, pegs, winch, and spring box were made from pine plywood. MRI images were taken with and without use of the traction device prototype, and there was a noticeable difference in the space between the femoral head and acetabulum. Our method of providing traction was sufficient and effective in distracting and stabilizing the hip joint. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Design is an {{important}} but little understood intelligent activity. Conceptual design is the transformation of functional specifications to an initial concept of an artifact that achieves them. Human designers rely heavily {{on the use of}} sketches, which {{can be thought of as}} qualitative models of a device. An appealing model of conceptual design is that of a mapping from qualitative functional specifications to a corresponding qualitative object model. As a case study, I have investigated this model for the conceptual design of part shapes in elementary mechanisms, such as <b>ratchets</b> or <b>gears.</b> I present qualitative modelling formalisms for mechanical function, the place vocabulary, and for shape, the metric diagram. However, I show that qualitative functional attributes can not be mapped into corresponding qualitative attributes of a device that achieves them, and consequently that qualitative function can not be computed based solely on a qualitative object model. Only a significantly weaker functional model, kinematic topology, can be derived based on qualitative object models alone. This result means that at least in mechanical design, sketches do not represent...|$|R
50|$|A {{retractor}} is {{a surgical}} instrument with which a surgeon can either actively separate {{the edges of}} a surgical incision or wound, or can hold back underlying organs and tissues, so that body parts under the incision may be accessed. The two are each available in many shapes, sizes, and styles. The general term retractor usually describes a simple handheld steel tool possessing a curved, hooked, or angled blade fitted with a comfortable handle, that when in place maintains the desired position of a given region of tissue. These simple retractors may be handheld, clamped in situ, or suspended {{at the end of}} a robotic arm. Retractors can also be self retaining and not need to be held once inserted by having two or more opposing blades or hooks which are separated via spring, <b>ratchet,</b> worm <b>gear</b> or some other method and pull on opposite sides of a wound. The term retractor is also used to describe the distinct, hand-cranked devices such as rib spreaders (also known as thoracic retractors, or distractors) with which surgeons may forcefully drive tissues apart to obtain the exposure. For specialized situations such as spinal surgery retractors have been fitted both with suction and with fiberoptic lights to keep a surgical wound dry and illuminated.|$|R

40|$|Although MIT Students {{have been}} taught an {{enormous}} amount of theory and design, they are not exposed to simple machine elements and designs from the past. As a result, students often spend time reinventing things when the answers have been already developed. This project focuses on presenting students with designs from the past that are useful, novel and make the student think. This agenda is one that is being approached by a number of others. In particular, there are the Clark Collection at the Museum of Science and KMODDL (Kinematic Models for Design Digital Library), an online resource containing both photographs and video of models and 3 D printing templates, all aiming to make this knowledge more accessible to a wider group of people. The goal of the present work is to create a more easily understood set of models that can be made inexpensively and can be produced around the world. The models included in this collection focus on four main themes: pulleys, <b>gears,</b> <b>ratchets</b> and mechanisms that convert rotary to linear motion. By using consistent coloring to act as a legend, educational descriptions that accompany the models to provide context, and a simple design to allow for fabrication using a laser cutter, the educational goals of the project were executed and met. The models are more easily understood and cost a fraction of the amount to fabricate as those made with a 3 D printer while being more robust and visually pleasing. by Michael L. Stern. Thesis (S.

40|$|In modern life, human {{have become}} {{dependent}} on portable electronics, such as cell phones, MP 3 and handheld computers, {{most of which are}} powered by batteries. Although the performance of batteries is being continuously improved, the limited energy storage and service life constrain the lasting use of these mobile electronics. Therefore it is desirable to find alternative or supplementary methods to solve this problem from its root cause. It is known that human body contains rich chemical energy, part of which is converted to mechanical energy up to 200 W when in motion, so it is ideal to harvest {{a small fraction of the}} human kinetic energy to power mobile electronic devices. In this thesis, first, the previous work done by other researchers on energy harvesting from human motion, especially from unintentional human motion, such as arm swing and leg moving, is reviewed. Then the fundamental principles to mechanically harvest motion energy are discussed, including the mechanical oscillating mechanisms and electromagnetic transduction. Derived from the general harvesting model, four different devices are designed and analyzed. Shoe is important for human, one of which functions is to serve as shock-absorber to protect foot from the large impact force. As the foot strikes the ground, the shoe is subject to not only large force but also large displacement in the heel. The third new device is designed to insert in the shoe heel to harvest the kinetic energy from foot strike, and at the same time to function as a shock absorber for foot. Considering the stability and efficiency, a spring-slider-crank mechanism is used in this harvester to covert the up-down foot strike motion into unidirectional rotation to drive an AC generator. The spring and slider compose an oscillating system to absorb the foot strike motion, and crank and slider make up the conversion mechanism to transfer the bi-directional translation into unidirectional rotation. A set of gear is used to speed up the rotation. The kinematical performance of the harvester is also analyzed. The first one is the automatic winding mechanism of mechanical movement. It consists of an oscillating weight, a <b>ratchet</b> mechanism, a <b>gear</b> set and a mainspring. The mechanism can be modeled as a double pendulum when worn on a user's wrist. Its kinematical performance is analyzed with experimental validation. This thesis discusses the feasibility of mechanical power generators driven by human motion, with the focus on their architecture design and performance analysis. The main objective is to develop effective power generators for harvesting the energy from human motion, and use it to power portable electronic devices. To directly convert the human arm motion to electricity, the second novel energy harvester is designed, analyzed and simulated. It mainly consists of an eccentric rotor made of permanent magnet, and a set of coils as a stator. The eccentric rotor, as a simple pendulum, acts as the kinetic energy harvester which absorbs the motion from human body in motion. With the permanent magnets on the rotor, the moving rotor produces a changing magnetic field, from which the stator induces electricity. In this design, a torsion spring is also added onto the rotor so that the harvester works even when the motion is on horizontal plane. When foot strikes the ground, a large acceleration is produced. The fourth new energy harvester uses dual-oscillating mode. It contains two oscillating mechanisms: one is spring-mass oscillator to absorb the vibration from footstep motion, and the other is cantilever beam using the tip mass to amplify the vibration. Analysis shows that the dual-oscillating mechanism can be more effectively harvest the foot step motion. The energy conversion sub-mechanism is based on the electromagnetic induction, where the coils fixed at the tip end of the cantilever beam serves as the slider, and the fixed permanent magnets and yoke produce the changing magnetic field. Mathematical analysis and simulation are included. Xie, Longhan. Adviser: Ruxu Du. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72 - 04, Section: B, page:. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This thesis {{reports about}} a {{six degrees of}} freedom (DOF) {{precision}} manipulator in MEMS, concerning concept generation for the manipulator followed by design and fabrication (of parts) of the proposed manipulation concept in MEMS. Researching the abilities of 6 DOF precision manipulation in MEMS is part of the Multi Axes Micro Stage (MAMS) project in which the disciplines of precision engineering, control engineering and micro mechanical engineering are represented. Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, or MEMS technology is generally based on lithographic, deposition and etching techniques also applied in the integrated circuits (IC) industry. The basis for these microsystems is a thin polished substrate usually consisting of very pure single crystal silicon, called a wafer. Roughly, since the 1980 â€™s a lot of mechanical devices on the micrometer scale have been developed in MEMS technology. Some strikingly resemble machines that are very common in the large world, consisting of down-scaled <b>gears,</b> <b>ratchets,</b> racks, pinions, sliders and hinge mechanisms. Others are based on flexure mechanisms resembling large scale systems used for precision position adjusting and manipulation. There are also large differences between MEMS systems and macroscopic mechatronical systems. Where actuation in macroscopic systems is dominated by electromagnetic transduction, the preferred principle of actuation in MEMS systems is far less pronounced. Efficient electromagnetic transducers are difficult to realize in MEMS while actuators based on electrostatic attraction are more simple to fabricate and generally show better performance. On the micrometer scale, large electrical fields can be obtained at relatively low voltages and the breakdown fields scales favorable due to Paschenâ€™s law. Other actuation principles often encountered in MEMS are electrothermal and piezo-electric actuation. Another aspect in which MEMS differ from macroscopic systems is the fabrication method, characterized by a ï¿½ï¿½? 2. 5 dimensionalï¿½ï¿½? design freedom. This largely complicates the design of 3 dimensional geometries, especially regarding structuring of devices in the direction normal to the wafer-plane. This {{is one of the main}} reasons, the design of a 6 degrees of freedom stage for precision manipulation is a large challenge. However, the potential improvements obtained by downscaling a manipulation system encourage to research the feasibility of a 6 DOF precision MEMS manipulator. A miniaturized precision system does not only benefit because of reduction in size, but thermal drift is substantially reduced as well and the primary resonance frequency increases considerably. To put the development of a 6 DOF precision MEMS stage in a practical perspective, specifications are defined for a sample manipulator in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), capable of imaging resolutions in the AÂ° -range. This application requires a highly stable system capable of strokes of Â§ 10 mm and nanometer resolution positioning. In this thesis a concept for 6 DOF manipulation is presented, based on stacking of two 3 DOF parallel kinematic manipulators. One is used for the three planar DOFs and stacked on top of the other, manipulating the three out-of-plane DOFs. The design of the flexure based mechanisms is largely based on exact kinematic constraining of the DOFs. Limitations to fabrication of the desired mechanism rising form MEMS technology are identified and solutions are proposed. The planar 3 DOF manipulator actuated by electrostatic comb-drives is successfully fabricated in bulk SCS. Characterization shows largely linear mechanical behavior on the sub-micron scale. For actuation of the out-of-plane stage, a vertical comb-drive suspended by torsion beams is designed. To increase stability with respect to electrostatic side pull-in, the torsion beam consists of vertical and horizontal parts. A process is developed to enable fabrication of the required geometry for the torsion beams and the vertical comb-drive teeth in SCS. This process is compatible with the fabrication of the planar 3 DOF stage. Fabrication of the special 3 dimensional geometry still requires improvement and many out-of-plane devices show short circuits. However, out-of-plane actuation with a stroke of 10 mm has been observed. Increased stability with respect to side pull-in might also be obtained by a different kind of electrostatic transduction. In this case a dielectric plate or a floating conduction plate is partially inserted between to parallel electrodes. A voltage over the electrodes will result in a force pulling the plate inwards. In a first order approximation no forces in lateral (pull-in) direction are found. Finite element simulations (FEM) reveal forces in lateral direction do occur, however these are much smaller compared to the case of a comb-drive. Additionally, in case of charging, the lateral forces on a charge sheet between two parallel electrodes are modelled. The dependance of the lateral force on the lateral position of the charge sheet is found not to be highly non-linear like in the case of a comb-drive. This encourages the expectation that the alternative electrostatic actuators are far less sensitive to side pull-in than comb-drives. However, a proof of principle has not yet been realized...|$|R
