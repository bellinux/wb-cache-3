5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write.</b> They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|Stamper {{was working}} as a pianist rather than as a {{songwriter}} at the time the song appeared but never learned how to <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write</b> using traditional music notation thus he would have not been able submit the song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim. Bayes and Norworth compelled Stamper at one point to wear stage make-up to appear Japanese, apparently to keep him from being interviewed by reporters.|$|E
50|$|These {{coherency}} {{states are}} maintained through {{communication between the}} caches and the backing store.

5|$|Initially Bute {{was brought}} up at Dumfries House by his mother and grandmother, but {{following}} their deaths he passed into the care of his grandfather, the 1st Marquess of Bute, and travelled with him across England and Europe. His family considered him to be clever {{and he went to}} study at Christ's College in Cambridge in 1809. Over the next few years he visited the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and Russia, taking a keen interest in land economics. He developed an eye condition during this period and became partially blind, leaving him unable to travel without assistance or to tolerate bright lights, and finding it difficult to <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write.</b>|$|E
5|$|The birth {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222–235). Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write</b> their official documents for them. Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability to read. An early form of story ballet (pantomimus) was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire {{in part because it}} relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{assembly}} language defined for the Mark 1. Programs {{had to be}} written and submitted in binary form, encoded as eight 5-bit characters for each 40-bit word; programmers were encouraged to memorize the modified ITA2 coding scheme to make their job easier. Data was read and written from the papertape punch under program control. The Mark 1 had no system of hardware interrupts; the program continued after a <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write</b> operation had been initiated until another input/output instruction was encountered, {{at which point the}} machine waited for the first to complete.|$|E

50|$|The sense/inhibit line {{is shared}} {{by all of the}} cores in a {{particular}} plane, meaning that only one bit can be <b>read</b> (<b>or</b> <b>written)</b> at once. Core planes were typically stacked in order to store one bit of a word per plane, and a word could be <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>written</b> in a single operation by working all of the planes at once.|$|R

5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes were infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write,</b> as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{eventually}} married Polly in 1915, {{after they}} had moved to Elmore Street, Everton. One of the witnesses at the wedding was Polly's sister, Catherine Seddon. Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly could not <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write,</b> but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not have enough money to keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage. It was situated just around the corner from Newcastle Road (where Julia Stanley lived). Polly died on 30 January 1949.|$|E
5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write</b> at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

50|$|When the {{processor}} needs to <b>read</b> from <b>or</b> <b>write</b> to a location in main memory, it first checks whether {{a copy of}} that data is in the cache.

25|$|The Holy Qurbana {{is mostly}} {{conducted}} and prayers recited in Malayalam. However, {{some parts of}} the Holy Qurbana are sung in Syriac. During the 20th century, the 'Qurbana-kramam' i.e. the 'book containing the order of worship', was translated into English, for the benefit of worshipers who lived outside Kerala, and did not know to <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write</b> Malayalam.|$|E

25|$|Originally simply {{known as}} SDRAM, single data rate SDRAM can accept one command and {{transfer}} {{one word of}} data per clock cycle. Typical clock frequencies are 100 and 133MHz. Chips are made {{with a variety of}} data bus sizes (most commonly 4, 8 or 16 bits), but chips are generally assembled into 168-pin DIMMs that <b>read</b> <b>or</b> <b>write</b> 64 (non-ECC) or 72 (ECC) bits at a time.|$|E
