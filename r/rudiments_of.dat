5|$|At age 9, Gandhi {{entered the}} local school in Rajkot, near his home. There he studied the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic, history, the Gujarati {{language}} and geography. At age 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons.|$|E
5|$|Dave Guard and Bob Shane {{had been}} friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii where both had learned to play ukulele in {{required}} music classes. They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing {{an eclectic mix of}} Tahitian, Hawaiian, and calypso songs.|$|E
5|$|Mabel Tolkien {{taught her}} two {{children}} at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of {{the look and feel of}} plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> Latin very early.|$|E

5|$|The <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> {{perspective}} {{arrived with}} Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), {{who attempted to}} draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford learnt the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> cricket {{from his}} uncle Cuthbert Best—a former club player for Fitzroy. He {{had the best}} batting and bowling averages for his school team in 1913, 1914 and 1915 and {{eventually}} rose to the captaincy. His local grade club, Fitzroy, awarded Ponsford a medallion—presented by the local mayor—for being his school's outstanding cricketer in the 1913–14 and 1914–15 seasons. The medallion was awarded along with an honorary membership of the club, and Ponsford trained enthusiastically, running from school to the nearby Brunswick Street Oval in the Edinburgh Gardens to practise in the nets. Les Cody, the general secretary of Fitzroy Cricket Club and a first-class cricketer with New South Wales and Victoria, was Ponsford's first cricketing role model.|$|E

5|$|Revie {{was born}} in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> the language.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E
5000|$|Sattvic {{is derived}} from Sattva (सत्त्व) which is a Sanskrit word. Sattva is a complex concept in Indian philosophy, used in many contexts, and it means one that is [...] "pure, essence, nature, vital, energy, clean, conscious, strong, courage, true, honest, wise, <b>rudiment</b> <b>of</b> life".|$|R

5|$|Schnaufer then {{attended}} the advanced Flugzeugführerschule C 3 (FFS C 3—advanced flight school) at Alt Lönnewitz near Torgau and the blind flying school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from August 1940 to May 1941. This qualified him to fly multi-engine aircraft. During this assignment {{he was promoted}} to Fähnrich (cadet sergeant) on 1 September 1940, to Oberfähnrich (rank equivalent to Company Sergeant Major) on 1 February 1941 and to the officer rank of Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1941. He was then posted for ten weeks to the Zerstörerschule (destroyer school) at Wunstorf near Hanover. At Wunstorf, Schnaufer and the radio operator (Bordfunker) Friedrich Rumpelhardt were assigned as an aircrew team on 3 July 1941. Schnaufer's previous radio operator had proved unable to cope with aerobatics, and Schnaufer thoroughly tested Rumpelhardt's ability to cope with aerobatics before they teamed up. Here the two decided to volunteer to fly night fighters to defend against the increasing Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command offensive against Germany. Following their training at Wunstorf, the two were sent to the Nachtjagdschule 1 (1st night fighter school) at Schleißheim near Munich, formerly the Zerstörerschule 1 (ZS 1—1st destroyer school), to learn the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> night-fighting. The night fighter training was carried out on the Ar 96, the Fw 58 and the Messerschmitt Bf 110. Training at night focused on night takeoffs and landings, cooperation with searchlights, radio-beacon direction finding and cross country flights.|$|E

The auditory plate becomes depressed and converted into the auditory pit (or otic pit).|$|R
25|$|His {{subsequent}} {{career as}} assistant {{prosecutor in the}} District Court of Brzeżany (since 1945 Berezhany, Ukraine) and Warsaw, followed by a private legal practice in Warsaw, did not divert Lemkin from elaborating <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> international law dealing with group exterminations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> the {{permanent}} kidneys make their appearance {{about the end}} of the first or the beginning of the second month. Each kidney originates as a ureteric bud from the caudal end of the Wolffian duct, which, in turn, originates from intermediate mesoderm. The ureteric bud starts close to where the Wolffian duct opens into the cloaca, and grows dorsalward and rostralward along the posterior abdominal wall, where its blind extremity expands and subsequently divides into several buds, which form the <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> the renal pelvis and renal calyces; by continued growth and subdivision it gives rise to the collecting duct system of the kidney. The other, more superficial, portion of the diverticulum, on the other hand, becomes the ureter.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, Annette Dieudonné {{became a}} student of Boulanger's, {{continuing}} with her for the next fourteen years.

50|$|The {{posterior}} arch forms about two-fifths of {{the circumference}} of the ring: it ends behind in the posterior tubercle, which is the <b>rudiment</b> <b>of</b> a spinous process and gives origin to the Recti capitis posteriores minores and the ligamentum nuchae.

50|$|The <b>rudiment</b> <b>of</b> the {{acoustic}} nerve appears {{about the end}} of the third week as a group of ganglion cells closely applied to the cephalic edge of the auditory vesicle. The ganglion gradually splits into two parts, the vestibular ganglion and the spiral ganglion. The fibers connecting the spiral ganglion with the central nervous system form the cochlear nerve.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} mitral atresia were studied in 30 hearts {{to determine the}} presence or absence <b>of</b> a morphological <b>rudiment</b> <b>of</b> the atretic valve and the relation <b>of</b> this <b>rudiment,</b> if found, to any chamber in the ventricular mass. All the hearts showed atrial situs solitus and no ventricular inversion; consequently all had left atrioventricular atresia. In all instances dense fibrous tissue connected the floor of the left atrium to the left ventricle. This connective tissue is considered to be the morphological <b>rudiment</b> <b>of</b> the atretic mitral valve. In several hearts the intervening fibrous tissue varied from a thick fibrous membrane to a tiny fibrous cord; it is impossible to detect these variations clinically. It is, therefore, more practical to classify those hearts which have a detectable fibrous membrane macroscopically as having an "imperforate membrane" and those with a fibrous strand detectable only microscopically as having an "absent atrioventricular connection. ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>rudiments</b> <b>of</b> double-entry {{accounting}} were {{practiced in the}} Ilkhanate; merdiban was then adopted by the Ottoman Empire.
