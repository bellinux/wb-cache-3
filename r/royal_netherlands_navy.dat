5|$|The Royal Commission {{reported}} in August 1913. It {{recommended that the}} Koninklijke Marine (<b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy)</b> acquire nine dreadnought-type battleships to protect the NEI from attack and help guarantee the country's neutrality in Europe. Five of these would be based in the colony, while the other four would operate out of the Netherlands. Seven foreign companies submitted designs for the contract; naval historians believe that a 26,850-long-ton (27,280tonnes) ship, whose design was submitted by the German firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, would have been eventually selected.|$|E
5|$|After a {{recommendation}} from high-ranking Dutch naval officers that the Koninklijke Marine (<b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy)</b> be bolstered so any attacker {{would have to}} deploy {{a significant amount of}} their fleet to the East Indies, keeping it from other theaters of war, the Minister of Defense ordered the Navy to prepare designs for a two or three-member class of battlecruisers. As they had not previously designed a modern capitalship, and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane's Fighting Ships, the Dutch turned to Germany. This initially bore no results, as the two sides were unable to come to terms. During this time, a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance; completed on 11 July 1939, it was missing many of the post-First World War advances in warship technology. In particular, the armor protection was completely outmoded.|$|E

APAR is the first {{active electronically scanned array}} multifunction radar employed on an operational warship.|$|R
5000|$|The Limnos (F451) {{is one of}} the Greek [...] of frigates and is {{the third}} Hellenic Navy ship by that name.

25|$|HNLMS Zwaardvisch (S814) was {{the lead}} ship of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy's</b> , {{which was based on}} the British T class. The {{submarine}} was originally ordered as HMS Talent (P322) and built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and John Brown & Company, Clydebank. It served mainly in the Pacific against the Japanese during the war, operating under both British and US operational command in Ceylon and Australia. In 1950, the vessel was renamed HNLMS Zwaardvisch. She was sold and broken up for scrap in 1963.|$|R
5|$|Garland {{was then}} {{assigned}} to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in the North Atlantic until December 1943, when she was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone to escort convoys off West Africa. In April 1944, the ship was transferred to back to the Mediterranean Fleet where she escorted convoys. She sank one German submarine in September {{before returning to the}} UK for a lengthy refit that lasted until March 1945. Garland was then {{assigned to the}} Western Approaches Command, but carried emergency supplies to coastal towns in Belgium and the Netherlands immediately after the war ended in May. She was paid off and reclaimed from the Polish Navy in July 1946. A few months later, the ship was sold to the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy</b> for use as a school ship. Garland was refitted as an anti-submarine training ship in 1948 and renamed HNLMS Marnix in 1950. Reclassified as a frigate in 1952, the ship was not decommissioned until 1964 and scrapped afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Winckel {{was born}} on 3 November 1912 in Muntok, Bangka Island, {{in what was then}} the Dutch East Indies. On the island his parents ran a trading store in {{commodities}} such as rubber, tin and sugar. Winckel had an untroubled childhood and at age fifteen was sent back to the Netherlands to study at the nautical school in Delfzijl. He stayed with his grandparents while studying, and three years later became a seaman first class for the merchant marine. He specialised in navigation. In 1931, when he was aged nineteen, Winckel started working as a quartermaster on the freighter Pallau, which sailed between the Netherlands and Java. After his work on the ship he went to the island of Borneo to work on oil rigs. By 1935 he returned to the Netherlands once more, this time to work for the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy</b> as a submarine torpedo calibrator. During his time at the Navy a friend showed him a flyer for a pilot position at the Netherlands East Indies Air Force, which was being formed at the time. Winckel joined the Air Force in 1935 and became a pilot at age 23. Between 1935 and 1942 he flew transports across the Dutch East Indies, mainly in Lockheed Lodestars.|$|E

50|$|Den Helder was {{the site}} of a naval base as early as the 18th century. An Anglo-Russian {{invasion}} force landed at Den Helder in August 1799 and captured the Batavian navy there (see Battle of Castricum). French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, visiting Den Helder in 1811, was impressed with the town's strategic location and ordered the construction of a fort (Kijkduin) and naval dockyards (Willemsoord). The docks were built during the years 1813-1827. In 1947, it officially became the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy's</b> main centre of operations. Den Helder continues to be the navy's main base today. The <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Naval College is also located in the city, as is the Dutch Navy Museum.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the Atlantic {{competed with}} the Lockheed P-3 Orion to be {{selected}} as the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy's</b> next anti-submarine aircraft. The selection process, during which Lockheed Corporation was alleged to have engaged in multiple incidents of bribery, ultimately chose the Atlantic. Fewer Atlantics were procured than originally planned however; {{and a total of}} three Atlantics out of the Netherlands' nine-strong fleet were lost through a series of failures during missions over the Atlantic Ocean. These losses resulted in the grounding of the type in 1981 and contributed to its eventual replacement by the P-3 Orion.|$|R

500|$|On 11 September 1942, Carpender succeeded Leary as [...] {{commander}} {{of both the}} Southwest Pacific Force and the Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific Area. In the former role, he reported to the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral [...] Ernest J. King; in the latter he was answerable directly to the Commander in Chief, Southwest Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. The new post came with a promotion {{to the rank of}} vice admiral, but Carpender was not the most senior naval officer in the theater, as the Royal Australian Navy′s Admiral Sir Guy Royle and the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy′s</b> Vice Admiral Conrad Helfrich were both senior to him. The [...] Southwest Pacific Force was small; when Carpender assumed command, it consisted of just five cruisers, eight destroyers and 20 submarines.|$|R
50|$|By {{the summer}} of 1962, the Indonesian {{military}} had begun planning a large-scale amphibious and air assault against Biak, the Netherlands' main power base in West Irian. This operation would have been known as Operation Jayawijaya ("Victory over colonialism") and would have included a substantial task force of 60 ships including several which had been supplied by Sukarno's Soviet and Eastern Bloc allies. On 13 and 14 August 1962, air drops of Indonesian troops were staged from Sorong in the Northwest to Merauke in the Southeast as a diversion for an amphibious assault against the Dutch military base at Biak Island by a force of 7000 paratroops, 4500 Marines and 13 000 Army troops. However, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy's</b> signals intelligence section Marid 6 Netherlands New Guinea and Dutch patrol aircraft detected the invasion force and alerted their command.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy's</b> (RNN) Naval Aviation Service {{operated}} {{fleet of}} 24 Lynx {{for a total}} of 36 years, entering service in 1976 and phased out in 2012 after being extensively used. These performed search and rescue, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and special forces support tasks while operating from the flightdecks of most RNN vessels during this period. In 1993, the RNN fleet were upgraded to a common Lynx SH-14D standard. In 1999, a design defect in the rotor-head used on some Lynx aircraft was responsible for the loss of a Dutch aircraft in 1999; this led to a number of Lynx worldwide to be temporarily grounded until retrofitted with new titanium rotor-heads. On 28 February 2011, a Dutch Lynx and three navy personnel were captured by Libyan forces while performing an evacuation mission inside the country. On 19 September 2012, the RNN performed its final operational Lynx flight.|$|R
50|$|These ships {{share their}} Anti-Air Warfare suite with the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Navy's</b> De Zeven Provinciën-class frigates and the German Navy's Sachsen-class frigates. The sensors of this suite include the long range {{surveillance}} radar SMART-L (passive electronically scanned array) and the multi-function radar APAR active electronically scanned array. The SMART-L and APAR are highly complementary, {{in the sense}} that SMART-L is a L band radar providing very long range surveillance while APAR is an I band radar providing precise target tracking, a highly capable horizon search capability, and missile guidance using the Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination (ICWI) technique, thus allowing guidance of 32 semi-active radar homing missiles in flight simultaneously, including 16 in the terminal guidance phase. The primary anti-air weapons are the point defence Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile and the area defence SM-2 IIIA. The Mk 41 Vertical Launch System is used to house and launch these missiles. Depending on the number of Harpoon launchers installed, up to 48 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile and 32 SM-2 IIIA may be carried.|$|R

500|$|In November 1943, Kinkaid {{replaced}} Carpender as Commander Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific Area, and the Seventh Fleet, {{known as}} [...] "MacArthur's Navy". General Douglas MacArthur had twice requested Carpender's relief, and Kinkaid's record {{working with the}} Army in Alaska made him a logical choice. Australian newspapers hailed {{the appointment of a}} [...] "fighting admiral", but neither MacArthur nor the Australian government had been consulted about the appointment, which was made by the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King. This was a violation of the international agreement that had established the Southwest Pacific Area. The Navy Department then announced that the replacement of Carpender with Kinkaid was merely a proposal, and MacArthur and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, were asked if Kinkaid was acceptable. They agreed that he was. In his new role, Kinkaid had two masters. As commander of the Seventh Fleet, he was answerable to King, but as Commander Allied Naval Forces, Kinkaid was answerable to MacArthur. Operations were conducted on the basis of [...] "mutual cooperation" [...] rather than [...] "unity of command", and relations between the Army and Navy were not good.
