40|$|Permanent-magnet (PM) {{synchronous}} machines (PMSMs) {{can provide}} excellent performance {{in terms of}} torque density, energy efficiency, and controllability. However, PMs on the rotor are prone to centrifugal force, which may break their physical integrity, particularly at high-speed operation. Typically, PMs are bound with carbon fiber or retained by alloy sleeves on the rotor surface. This paper {{is concerned with the}} design of a rotor <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> for a 1. 12 -MW 18 -kr/min PM machine; its electromagnetic performance is investigated by the 2 -D finite-element method (FEM). Theoretical and numerical analyses of the rotor stress are carried out. For the carbon fiber protective measure, the stresses of three PM configurations and three pole filler materials are compared in terms of operating temperature, rotor speed, <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> thickness, and interference fit. Then, a new hybrid protective measure is proposed and analyzed by the 2 -D FEM for operational speeds up to 22 kr/min (1. 2 times the rated speed). The rotor losses and machine temperatures with the carbon fiber <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the hybrid <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> are compared, and the sleeve design is refined. Two rotors using both designs are prototyped and experimentally tested to validate the effectiveness of the developed techniques for PM machines. The developed <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> makes it possible to operate megawatt PM machines at high speeds of 22 kr/min. This opens doors for many high-power high-speed applications such as turbo-generator, aerospace, and submarine motor drives...|$|E

However, induced eddy currents in the rotor conductive parts result {{in a loss of}} efficiency and rotor heating. Therefore, several methods to reduce such losses have been proposed in the literature including copper shielding. In this paper, a high-speed SPM machine rotor with a copper shield is designed and investigated both electromagnetically and mechanically. Several quantitative investigations including placing the copper sheet around the <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> or magnets, different copper sheet and airgap thicknesses, different <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> materials, different harmonic contents in the current waveform, i. e. pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and pulse width modulation (PWM) generated waveforms, and different frequencies and current levels are reported.

The effect of laminating the magnets and the losses in the anisotropic sleeve are analysed with 3 D simulations, using simplifications determined with 2 D simulations.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} synchronous reluctance (SyR) machines for high-speed applications {{with the aid of}} optimization algorithms and considering both electromagnetic and mechanical performances. The design of small SyR machines with rated speeds from 5 krpm to 50 krpm is investigated, using two commercial laminations: a cobalt iron alloy and a high-grade non-oriented silicon steel. The integrity of the SyR rotors is guaranteed by the structural ribs and posts connecting the steel segments, so to simplify motor construction, without any <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The silicon steel, despite the lower magnetic performances respect to the cobalt iron, appears a competitive choice in high-speed applications due to its superior mechanical performances. Extensive design optimization, magnetic and structural finite element analysis demonstrate the feasibility of such high-speed SyR machine...|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{designing}} high-speed surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM), the rotor <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> is inserted into the rotor to prevent the permanent magnet&# 39;s damage. It is quite {{an efficient way to}} consider manufacturability, but the sleeve becomes the major source of ohm loss in high-speed operation. In this paper, the high-speed motor for a turbo blower at the rating of 100 kW, 20 000 r/min was introduced. To improve its efficiency, the retaining sleeve&# 39;s optimal design was needed. For this, parametric analysis on the shape of the <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> was carried out in a different type of motor. Within a range that meets the mechanical safety, sleeve designs have been changed. The effect of changing design variables of the sleeve was studied. This paper presents the optimized sleeve&# 39;s advantages in electrical efficiency from the results of the electromagnetic finite element analysis software. Finally, it suggests the optimal sleeve design to reduce eddy-current loss, which is related to motor shape.

The work described covers the no-load tooth-ripple losses due to the distortion of the fundamental flux density wave by the stator slotting (making the flux density stronger under teeth and weaker under slots), and the on-load losses which include the additional effects of the MMF winding harmonics, including particularly the important slot order harmonics.

40|$|In the thesis, {{methods for}} the thermal and {{mechanical}} analyses of high-speed PM electrical machines are presented and implemented. The first method implemented for the thermal analysis is a combined 2 D- 3 D numerical method. The thermal and turbulent {{properties of the}} flow, such as the temperature rise in the flow and the coefficients of thermal convection, are estimated using a 2 D multiphysics method that couples CFD with heat-transfer equations. The detailed distribution of the temperature rise in the whole solid domain of the machine is determined using a 3 D numerical heat-transfer method. The temperature rises in the machine are also estimated with the traditional thermal-network method, which uses a totally different approach to the heat-transfer analysis. The methods used for the mechanical analysis of the machine include finite-element rotordynamics modelling of the rotor for estimation of the critical speeds and {{the shapes of the}} bending modes and also analytical estimation of the stress in the <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The implemented methods are used for the comparative thermal and mechanical analyses of three different high-speed PM rotor constructions. The first type of rotor construction is retained with a carbon-fibre sleeve and uses a shield for eddy currents made of aluminium. The second rotor construction is retained with a <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> made from the alloy Ti- 6 %Al- 6 %V- 2 %Sn and the sleeve of the third rotor construction is made from the alloy Ti- 2. 5 %Cu. The last two rotor constructions do not have separate eddy-current shields. The comparative analysis shows that the rotor with a carbon-fibre sleeve and an aluminium eddy-current shield shows the best thermal properties. The rotor with a <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeve</b> made of the titanium alloy Ti- 6 %Al- 6 %V- 2 %Sn offers promising thermal properties because the critical temperatures in the rotor are not exceeded. Additionally, the same rotor construction provides the best rotordynamics properties when compared to the other rotor constructions. The rotor construction retained with a sleeve made of the alloy Ti- 2. 5 %Cu is inferior from the thermal and mechanical points of view when compared with the previous rotor constructions. The methods used for the thermal and mechanical analyses are also used for the determination of the maximum power limits for high-speed PM electrical machines for air-compressor applications. For that purpose, five high-speed PM electrical machines for the speeds of 20, 000 rpm, 40, 000 rpm, 60, 000 rpm, 80, 000 rpm, and 100, 000 rpm are designed in order to determine their maximum mechanical powers. The electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical designs of each machine are performed simultaneously and all the critical values of the thermal and mechanical design constraints are considered. The obtained maximum power limit defines the speed-power region of safe operation of the high-speed PM electrical machines intended for compressor applications...|$|E
40|$|High speed fault {{tolerant}} permanent magnet machines have strong asynchronous airgap harmonics, making them susceptible to rotor eddy-current losses. These losses {{can be reduced}} by using novel high resistivity materials like plastic bonded magnets and carbon fibre reinforced <b>retaining</b> <b>sleeves.</b> This is an entirely new concept, and little knowledge exists on this specific topic. This thesis investigates the consequences of using these materials for the losses. The resistivity of the materials is not accurately specified and therefore measured first using eddy-currents. Then fast 2 D simulations are utilised to determine the dependency of the losses on all parameters, while the lamination thickness of the magnets and the anisotropic sleeve are studied with 3 D simulations. The 3 D results can be scaled using the 2 D results if desired. Some conclusions are that the eddy-currents are resistance limited at all times and that laminating the magnets reduces the losses as expected. The losses in the sleeve are shown not to be negligible, even when the perpendicular resistivity {{is as high as}} 10 m?m. Lastly, both the magnet and sleeve losses strongly increase with increasing relative permeability of the magnets, which in turn increases with temperature. Magnets with a low relative permeability should therefore be used. Electrical Power ProcessingElectrical Sustainable EnergyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
