40|$|Summary- Honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera carnical, {{infested with}} Varroa jacobsonl were dequeened and divided into 2 {{subunits}}. Each pair of subunits were <b>requeened</b> with an inseminated A m capensis and A m carnica queen. The {{development of the}} mite population was monitored by determining the number of mites in samples of brood, and worker bees, and lhe number of dead mites on the bottom board of the hive. The mite population showed a restricted development in A m capensts colonies. Varroa mites were found at surprisingly low frequencies on adult worker bees of the Cape honeybee. A more efficient grooming activity, {{in combination with the}} short post-capping stage of the brood, may be the central factors for the restricled development of the mite population in 4 m capensis.

40|$|Workers of a {{queenless}} {{honeybee colony}} can requeen the colony by raising a new queen {{from a young}} worker brood laid by the old queen. If this process fails, the colony becomes hopelessly queenless and workers activate their ovaries to lay eggs themselves. Laying Cape honeybee workers (Apis mellifera capensis) produce female offspring as an additional pathway for <b>requeening.</b> We tested the frequency of successful <b>requeening</b> in ten hopelessly queenless colonies. DNA genotyping revealed that only 8 % of all queens reared in hopelessly queenless colonies were the offspring of native laying worker offspring. The vast majority of queens resulted from parasitic takeovers by foreign queens (27 %) and invading parasitic workers (19 %). This shows that hopelessly queenless colonies typically die due to parasitic takeovers and that the parasitic laying workers are an important life history strategy more frequently used than in providing a native queen to rescue the colony.

40|$|During {{the three}} phases over which project {{activities}} were implemented {{it was possible}} to carry out varroa control activities in 25 districts, using some 43 000 strips of a chemical called Apistan, with a varying degree of success. During the first phase, an initial stock of the anti-varroa chemical was distributed in Gjirokastra, Kolonje, Korc, Permt, Sarande and Tirane. The 18 additional districts covered during the second phase were Ballsh, Fier, Tepelen, Vlor, Berat, Durrs, Lushnj;, Kavaj, Skrapar, Gramsh, Librazhd, Elbasan, Pogradec, Kruj, Burrel, La, Mirdit and Puk. Major activities consisted in organizing seminars for veterinarians, lectures for beekeepers, and coordinated varroa control campaigns. Those beekeepers trained during the first phase, reported that they benefitted from the training. A total of 100 veterinarians were trained during the second phase. In all cases, an intensive use was made of communication facilities (radio, television, newspapers, etc.). The difference in the price of Apistan (from US$ 0. 5 during the first phase to US$ 1. 00 during the second one), had had an adverse effect on the participation of the beekeepers {{who were involved in the}} latter phase. In addition to the above, several other activities were implemented especially in field testing the effectiveness of chemical treatment, in assessing the impact of T. V. and radio messages, in assessing the ability of the veterinarians to suitably carry out their work in the beekeeping sector. A survey was also organized to collect information on beekeepers, through interviews with them, field veterinarians and other staff members of the institutions concerned. Based on the above information, {{it was possible to}} establish the characteristics of the average Albanian beekeeper using parameters such as number of bee colonies managed (30. 8), number of years of beekeeping experience (21. 1),quantity of honey produced per bee colony (17. 6 kg per year), average sale price of honey (US$ 2. 98), <b>requeening</b> interval (2. 2 years) and comb renovation (2. 8 years). It is recommended to strengthen existing support structures and services to beekeepers. There is also a need to promote apiculture in Albania through better organization of the marketing system for honey and bee products. If properly organized, this should lead to their export...|$|E
25|$|Not all Africanized hives {{display the}} typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders {{a point to}} begin {{breeding}} a gentler stock. Work {{has been done in}} Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to <b>requeen</b> colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended cross-breeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the European honey bee although they also contain African honey bee material. Also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of Africanized bee colonization, this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques. Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much further from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact. The Africanized bee is considered the bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1939 This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} of the major bee diseases found in Oregon with notes on minor ailments of bees and on diseases not yet present followed by a history of the introduction and spread of the more important diseases, a history of bee legislation in Oregon and {{a discussion of}} the distribution and occurrence of American foulbrood and European foulbrood in Oregon as shown by inspection reports of the state apiary inspector for 1935, 1937 and 1938. A bibliography of 39 titles is included. Chapter I. American foulbrood is the most serious disease of bees. It is an infectious disease of the later larval stages and pupal stage caused by Bacillus larvae. The disease is practically always fatal to the colonies contracting it, no race of bees is resistant to it, it is spread largely by beekeepers in manipulating their bees, can be spread in package bees and in commercial honey although neither are important factors {{and it is difficult to}} control except by burning diseased colonies as soon as they are found. Some work is being done on breeding resistant stock and this work has some prospect of being successful since a method of controlling the mating of the queen has been discovered. Chapter II. European foulbrood is an infectious disease of bees attacking the brood of bees in the earlier larval stages while the sugar content of the digestive tract is still relatively high. It is caused by Bacillus alvei, a germ that assumes quite variable morphological forms during its development. Italian, Caucasian and Carniolan bees are usually resistant taken as colonies and not as individuals. The disease may be spread in honey and pollen and on equipment. It may be controlled by strengthening infected colonies and <b>requeening</b> with queens of resistant stock. Chapter III. Sac brood is an infectious disease caused by a filterable virus which does not live long in honey, pollen nor in dead larvae. Its principal damage is in weakening colonies and its seriousness is not usually realized because most of the dead larvae are removed by the bees. Nosema-disease and paralysis are diseases of adult bees, both of them are present in Oregon but are of little importance. Dissentery of bees in winter and early spring is due to stores with too high a water content. Parafoulbrood is not present in Oregon. Isle of Wight disease, caused by a mite in the trachea, is not present in North America. Septicemia and fungus diseases of bees are of little importance. Chapter IV. Instructions are given for methods of diagnosing the common bee diseases in the apiary with a chart listing symptoms of the common diseases. Chapter V. Bee diseases have been known since before the Christian era but it was not until 1903 that the different types of brood diseases were separated and their causative organisms isolated. It is not known just when or how American foulbrood was brought to Oregon but it was present in Malheur county in 1907 and was found in nearly all parts of the state by 1920. It is now present in every county in the state. There was a virulent type of European foulbrood in Clatsop county in 1908 and the disease was common in western Oregon by 1920. At present it is decreasing in importance and is seldom found in central and eastern Oregon. Sac brood is found all over the state but is generally confused with poisoning. Spray poisoning is serious only in Jackson, Hood River and Wasco counties. The first inspection law was passed in 1905, the next in 1917, another in 1920 and the present law in 1933. The first three were ineffective. Chapter VI. The present distribution of bee diseases is given by counties for 1935, 1937 and 1938 as shown by inspection records...|$|E
40|$|In honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) {{the queen}} monopolises reproduction. However, {{especially}} after queen loss, workers can lay eggs, but {{are unable to}} mate. They produce haploid male offspring (drones) from unfertilised eggs via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis. In contrast, workers of the honeybee subspecies Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz typically produce diploid female offspring from unfertilised eggs thelytokously. After queen loss and without queen-derived brood A. m. capensis colonies can successfully requeen from worker-derived brood. This, however, is a relatively rare event in wild populations. Moreover, workerderived queens were described to be smaller, more worker-like and reproductively inferior. On the other hand, the fixation of the thelytokous trait relies mainly on sufficient numbers of viable drones produced by worker-derived queens. Small numbers of reproductively inferior worker-derived queens in A. m. capensis populations would be clearly counterintuitive. It is therefore necessary to quantify the significance of worker-dependant queen rearing pathways on the individual (queen) and on population level. Reproductive inferiority of worker-derived queens could not be confirmed on the individual (queen) level when comparing parameters indicating potential reproductive success of queen- and worker-derived queens. Queen- and worker-derived queens clearly showed a congruent range of reproductive performance. In queen rearing preference tests, increased acceptance of worker-derived female larvae was exactly counterbalanced by increased mortality, resulting in {{an equal number of}} eclosing virgin queens from an equal number of grafts in both test groups. Larval survival and successful eclosion is a prerequisite for a queen’s reproductive success. I found no difference in eclosion success for queen- and worker-derived virgin queens, indicating a similar potential for reproductive success in both queen types. Assessments of the developmental patterns of colonies headed by both queen and worker-derived queens in long-term experiments revealed no significant differences in reproductive success. Colonies headed by queen-derived queens and colonies headed by worker-derived queens could not be separated when comparing the different developmental pathways observed or from differences in worker-force. Reproductive dominance in A. m. capensis appeared tobe determined by a function of relative compositional and absolute quantitative pheromonal patterns, where individuals, which produce compositionally most queen-like blends in highest quantities, occupy top positions. Queen- and worker-derived virgin queens occupied intermediate positions between pseudoqueens and mated queens. However, {{no significant differences between the}} pheromonal status of queen- and worker-derived virgin queens were observed, suggesting a similar range of reproductive dominance for both queen types. In behavioural bioassays queen- and worker-derived virgin queens appeared to be similarly attractive to clustering workers and to drones in a drone congregation area, indicating no differences in potential reproductive success for queens from both origins for those parameters. The significant influence of the queen substance 9 -ODA on attractiveness to workers and drones was confirmed. Rare <b>requeening</b> events from worker-derived female brood in queenless A. m. capensis do not satisfactorily explain the fixation of the thelytokous trait at a population level. I observed A. m. capensis worker ovipositing into empty artificial queen cell cups in queen-right colonies. The queen was confined behind a queen excluder grid in a separate compartment of the colony, to imitate reduced pheromonal flow, similar to swarming or superseding colonies. Eggs oviposited by workers in artificial queen cell cups were readily accepted for queen rearing and successful eclosion of viable virgin queens was observed. Consequently I suggested an alternative worker-dependant reproductive pathway in A. m. capensis, which was never described before: In swarming or superseding queenright colonies, laying workers may directly compete with the queen for reproductive success by ovipositing (instead of the queen) into natural queen cell cups. At a population level this reproductive tactic may result in large numbers of worker-derived queens of high reproductive quality in natural populations of A. m. capensis. ...|$|E
