5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E

Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, helium volumes <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2008, Russia {{announced}} that its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov {{said that a}} military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was essential to prevent Georgia from regaining control. Georgia considers Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russian-occupied territories. In November 2011, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied Georgian territories.|$|E

5|$|The Newfoundland Referendums of 1948 were {{a series}} of two referendums to decide the {{political}} future of the Dominion of Newfoundland. Before the referendums, Newfoundland was in debt and went through several delegations {{to determine whether the}} country would join Canada, <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> British rule or regain independence. The voting for the referendums occurred on June 3 and July 22, 1948. The eventual result was for Newfoundland to enter Canadian Confederation.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Constantinople {{was under the}} command of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. Upon hearing the news, Heraclius split his army into three parts; {{although}} he judged that the capital was relatively safe, he still sent some reinforcements to Constantinople to boost the morale of the defenders. Another part of the army was {{under the command of}} his brother Theodore and was sent to deal with Shahin, while the third and smallest part would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> his own control, intending to raid the Persian heartland.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, the eastâ€“west highway across the Lower Peninsula through Portland to Detroit was {{assigned}} the M-16 designation, This was redesignated US16 in 1926. The section of US16 through Portland was decommissioned on March 7, 1960. It would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> local control {{until the first}} quarter-mile (0.4km) section was transferred to state control on September 18, 1978. The route was first marked on state highway maps in 1982 along the full mile and a quarter (2.0km). It was transferred back to local control on October 31, 2007.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Hitler {{approved}} {{the creation of}} an Albanian Waffen-SS division that was to serve only inside Kosovo, and was intended to protect ethnic Albania but <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> German control. It was meant to be one of three Muslim Waffen-SS divisions serving in the Balkans, the other two being the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian). Himmler's goal was to expand Waffen-SS recruiting in the Balkans and form two corps of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the West Virginia Legislature at Wheeling passed an act abolishing slavery in West Virginia on February 3, 1865, thus ending the institution of the plantation in West Virginia. Since the 1960s, many of West Virginia's plantation houses have acquired places on the National Register of Historic Places, the United States government's official list of sites, buildings, and structures deemed worthy of preservation. The house at Traveller's Rest, near Kearneysville, is West Virginia's sole plantation house designated as a National Historic Landmark for its national-level historical significance. As of 2015, the majority of West Virginia's plantation houses <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> private ownership.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of war or}} {{national}} emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> {{the control of the}} Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 12th century, Philip Augustus {{extended}} the Louvre fortress {{to defend the}} city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges {{to either side of}} its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> English occupation until 1436.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with their}} {{performance}} in Poland, Hitler allowed further {{expansion of the}} armed SS formations, but insisted new units <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> the operational control of the army. While the SS-Leibstandarte remained an independent regiment functioning as Hitler's personal bodyguards, the other regimentsâ€”SS-Deutschland, SS-Germania, and SS-Der FÃ¼hrerâ€”were combined to form the SS-VerfÃ¼gungs-Division. A second SS division, the SS-Totenkopf, was formed from SS-TV concentration camp guards, and a third, the SS-Polizei, was created from police volunteers. The SS gained control over its own recruitment, logistics, and supply systems for its armed formations at this time. The SS, Gestapo, and SD {{were in charge of}} the provisional military administration in Poland until the appointment of Hans Frank as Governor-General on 26 October 1939.|$|E
5|$|She {{fought with}} the Spanish Republican Navy in the Spanish Civil War. At the {{outbreak}} of the Nationalist revolt, wireless operators in the navy headquarters Madrid intercepted radio messages from General Francisco Franco to rebels in Morocco. They alerted the crews aboard Jaime I and other ships, who mutinied against their rebellious officers and ensured the ships would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> Republican control. The vessels were nevertheless crippled by poor discipline for some time, as they had murdered many of their officers, and distrusted those that were not killed. On the first months of the war, Jaime I shelled a number of rebel strongholds, among them Ceuta, Melilla and Algeciras. In Algeciras she hit with her secondary armament the Nationalist gunboat Eduardo Dato, which was burned down to the waterline, although she was later repaired and returned to service.|$|E

5|$|Snyder {{hoped to}} have {{principal}} photography take place from JuneSeptember 2007, but filming was delayed until September 17, 2007. Snyder wanted a $150 million budget, but Warner Bros. preferred the budget <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> $100 million; the film ultimately finished with a budget of approximately $120 million. The production took place in Vancouver, where a New York City back lot was built. Sound stages were used for apartments and offices, while sequences on Mars and Antarctica were shot against green screens. Ten visual effects companies, Sony Pictures Imageworks and Intelligent Creatures among them, came on board {{to work on the}} film, which ended up having 1,100 shots featuring effects, a quarter of them being computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{negotiations}} led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino {{resulted in}} the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, {{in part because he}} requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would <b>remain</b> <b>under</b> Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territoryâ€”specifically Narvaâ€”could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva.|$|E
