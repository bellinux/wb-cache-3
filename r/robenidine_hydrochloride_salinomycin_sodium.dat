The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set.

In response to this review the applicant has conducted further studies to address the inadequacies previously identified and the additional studies are reviewed in the following opinion. From the supplementary metabolic studies, it has been concluded that unchanged salinomycin represents less than 10 % of the total radioactivity in the excreta regardless of gender.

The chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in rats demonstrates that <b>salinomycin</b> <b>sodium</b> (SAL-Na) from Kokcisan is not carcinogenic and a LOEL of 1. 5 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 bw day- 1 could be derived based on marginal, mostly pharmacological effects in haematology and blood biochemistry.

The FEEDAP Panel considers that the whole metabolites represent a risk which in a worst case is equal to an equivalent quantity of SAL-Na.

Animals and methods: Four phytochemicals/extracts (extract from Echinacea purpurea, betaine (Betain™), curcumin, carvacrol (two different doses)), and a recombinant FIP from Ganoderma lucidum cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli were investigated for their anticoccidial potential. The experiment was conducted in a battery cage trial with 54 cages of eight birds each.

The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For calf feed an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for maduramicin ammonium alpha and semduramicin sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix/instrument combinations but all LOQs were in the 0. 01 ¿ 0. 65 mgkg- 1 range, hence well below the target concentrations of each analyte.

40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, lasalocid <b>sodium,</b> <b>salinomycin,</b> narasin, maduramicin and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (robenidine, decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|R

We validate this high-throughput system in detecting schistosomula viability using auranofin (a known inhibitor of thioredoxin glutathione reductase), praziquantel and a range of small compounds with previously-described (gambogic acid, <b>sodium</b> <b>salinomycin,</b> ethinyl estradiol, fluoxetidine hydrochloride, miconazole nitrate, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, amphotericin b, niclosamide) or suggested (bepridil, ciclopirox, rescinnamine, flucytosine, vinblastine and carbidopa) anti-schistosomal activities. This developed method is sensitive (200 schistosomula/well can be assayed), relevant to industrial (384 -well microtiter plate compatibility) and academic (96 -well microtiter plate compatibility) settings, translatable to functional genomics screens and drug assays, does not require a priori knowledge of schistosome biology and is quantitative. Conclusions/Significance The wide-scale application of this fluorescence-based bioassay will greatly accelerate the objective identification of novel therapeutic lead targets/compounds to combat schistosomiasis. Adapting this bioassay for use with other parasitic worm species further offers an opportunity for great strides to be made against additional neglected tropical diseases of biomedical and veterinary importance. Author Summary With only one effective drug, praziquantel, currently used to treat most worldwide cases of schistosomiasis, there exists a pressing need to identify alternative anthelmintics before the development of praziquantel-resistant schistosomes removes our ability to combat this neglected tropical disease. At present, the most widely adopted methodology used to identify promising new anti-schistosome compounds relies on time consuming and subjective microscopic examination of parasite viability in response to in vitro schistosome/compound co-culturing. In our continued effort to identify novel drug and vaccine targets, we detail a dual-fluorescence bioassay that can objectively be used for assessing Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula viability in a medium or high- throughput manner to suit either academic or industrial settings. The described methodology replaces subjectivity with sensitivity and provides an enabling technology useful for rapid in vitro screens of both natural and synthetic compound libraries. It is expected that results obtained from these quantifiable in vitro screens would prioritize the most effective anti-schistosomal compounds for follow-up in vivo experimentation. This highly-adaptable dual-fluorescence bioassay could be integrated with other methods for measuring schistosome phenotype and, together, be used to greatly accelerate our search for novel anthelmintics. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
