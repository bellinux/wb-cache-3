40|$|Introduction: Strangulation of {{the penis}} and scrotum by a {{constricting}} object has been rarely reported. Aim: To describe {{a man with}} penoscrotal strangulation caused by a steel ring and its successful removal. Methods: A 28 -year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 7 -hour history of a steel ring lodged {{at the base of}} his penis and scrotum. Removal was accomplished with the assistance of fire brigade personnel who used their hydraulic <b>cable</b> <b>cutter</b> to shear the ring. During the removal, there were no complications. Results: The hydraulic <b>cable</b> <b>cutter</b> avoided thermal injury and shortened removal time compared with procedures described in the literature. The patient's recovery was uneventful, with erectile function restored after 1  week. Conclusion: Genital incarceration is an urgent clinical situation requiring prompt treatment. However, suitable tools for removing the foreign object are not readily available in emergency and urology departments. Cooperation with other disciplines, even non-medical disciplines, can result in creative and timely measures for removal of the object. Zhang J, Wang X, Zhang J, et al.

50|$|The ships use AN/SLQ-48 {{remotely}} operated mine disposal system supplied by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and the EX116 Mod 0 {{remotely operated}} vehicle (ROV) mine neutralization system supplied by ATK and Raytheon. The AN/SLQ-48 detects, locates, classifies, and neutralizes moored mines and mines resting on the seabed. The vehicle uses high-frequency, high-resolution sonar, low light level television (LLLTV), <b>cable</b> <b>cutters,</b> and explosive charges to detect and dispose of mines, while remaining tethered to the vessel by a 1070 m cable and under control of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|The E-4 {{was similar}} to the E-2, which it {{replaced}} in production, but with the dive brakes removed. It was fitted with Kuto-Nase barrage-balloon <b>cable</b> <b>cutters</b> in {{the leading edge of the}} wings. 258 E-3 and E-4 were built. The E-4 was identical to the E-2, with the exception of the heavy MG FF in the nose. Five of the six positions were flexible, with only one fixed gun; the MG FF installed along the floor, just off centre. The cannon in the nose could be moved. Both were powered by BMW 801L engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{paravane}} {{weapon was}} developed by the British inventor Sir Dennistoun Burney as a means to sweep enemy mines. Towed behind a ship, the paravane wire would either cut the mine's mooring cable or bring the mine and paravane together, detonating the mine. There are offensive and defensive paravanes. There are main paravanes and auxiliary protector paravanes. Some paravanes are equipped with <b>cable</b> <b>cutters</b> that cut the moored mines. Explosive paravanes are essentially a towable or controllable mine. The US Department of Defense continues to have interest in paravanes.|$|R
50|$|The Osprey {{class are}} {{a series of}} coastal minehunters {{designed}} to find, classify, and destroy moored and bottom naval mines from vital waterways. They use sonar and video systems, <b>cable</b> <b>cutters</b> and a mine detonating device that can be released and detonated by remote control. The Osprey class are the worlds second largest minehunters (surpassed by the Royal Navys 60 m s) to be constructed entirely of fiberglass and designed to survive the shock of underwater explosions. Their primary mission is reconnaissance, classification, and neutralization of all types of moored and bottom mines in littoral areas, harbors and coastal waterways.|$|R

5000|$|These swords {{are often}} mistaken for radio antennas. The entire system may include {{upper and lower}} cutter assemblies, a non-electrically {{conductive}} abrasive strip wire scoring device along {{the center of the}} divided windscreen and windshield wiper protector frames to keep wires from hanging up on wiper motor shafts. The WSPS is designed to channel a wire or cable into the <b>cable</b> <b>cutter</b> to score and weaken it as it travels into the cutter assembly and [...] "cut" [...] a wire before it can entangle the rotor system. The U.S. Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, AL, claims that in a single wire strike 90% survivability is achieved by using WSPS. The more wires encountered at a given time the less likely WSPS will help the aircraft survive the encounter.|$|R
50|$|The {{starting}} point was a Mk. 10 or Mk. 21 {{version of the}} Chipmunk. The modifications included a redesigned fuselage to accommodate a 50 Imperial gallon (227 l) hopper located where the front seat {{was found in the}} original aircraft, and a completely new cockpit in the location of the original rear seat. An air-driven spray pump was mounted under the forward fuselage. The pilot sat 11 inches (28 cm) higher than in the original aircraft. A turnover truss and a new energy-absorbing seat were provided to protect the pilot from injury in a crash; and <b>cable</b> <b>cutters</b> were mounted in front of the cockpit as protection against one of the main hazards to agricultural aircraft (flying into power or telephone lines). A small dorsal fin and anti-spin strakes were fitted to the rear fuselage as well.|$|R
25|$|The cruise stage {{carried the}} MSL {{spacecraft}} through the void {{of space and}} delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The cruise stage has its own miniature propulsion system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own electric power system, consisting of a solar array and battery for providing continuous power. Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a <b>cable</b> <b>cutter</b> separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell. Then the cruise stage was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the cruise stage was located by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

50|$|This {{deployable}} antenna parabola {{was designed}} and developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC), now Lockheed Martin, under subcontract to Fairchild Aerospace, {{after several years of}} small study contracts at LMSC. The program manager at LMSC was GKC (Colin) Campbell. The deployment of the reflector was initiated by pyrotechnically operated SQUIB <b>cable</b> <b>cutters.</b> Deployment time was on the order of 2.5 seconds producing 2500 Ft Lbs of torque at the spacecraft interface. The reflector surface was designed for optimal operation at S-Band frequencies. It weighed 182 lbs at launch and stowed into a toroidal volume (doughnut shaped) approximately 6 feet in diameter and 10 inches thick. Three models were fabricated, the STM or structural test model, the F reflector and the G reflector. The STM was destroyed by Fairchild shortly after the program was finished and the F model was launched with the spacecraft in 1972. The G model sat unprotected in the Farchild parking lot for several years before it was donated to the Smithsonian. Bill Wade, the assistant program manager and test manager on the program supported The Smithsonian in the restoration by providing a complete set of drawings and specifications and visited the Silver Hill facility to provide technical guidance.|$|R

500|$|Max is an {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "hyperkinetic, three-foot rabbity thing" [...] {{with white}} fur, but prefers {{being called a}} lagomorph. Max retains few characteristics consistent with a rabbit, with permanently rigid ears set in an excited posture and a huge jaw normally stuck in a crazed grin. Unhinged, uninhibited and near psychotic, Max enjoys violence and tends to prefer the aggressive way of solving problems, seeing the world {{as little more than}} a vessel for his [...] "pinball-like stream of consciousness". This creates a seeming disregard for self-preservation; Max will revel in dangerous situations with little impression that he understands the risks he faces. As a result, Max is usually enthusiastic to engage in any activity, including being used by Sam as a <b>cable</b> <b>cutter</b> or an impromptu bludgeon. Despite this, Max possesses a sharp mind and an observational nature, and enjoys interpreting new experiences in as unpredictable manner as possible. However, Max has a distaste for long stories and occasionally loses focus during lengthy scenes of plot exposition; by his own admission, Max possesses a particularly short attention span. Despite his seemingly heartless personality, he believes strongly in protecting Sam. However, Max can still act violently towards his friend, stating that when he dies he will take Sam with him. Moreover, Max is extremely possessive of Sam and their status as partners and best friends. Max traditionally carries a Luger pistol, but as he wears no clothes, other characters often make comments as to where Max keeps it on his person. Purcell considers Max to be representative of pure id, the uncoordinated instinctual trends of the human psyche.|$|R
2500|$|For several reasons, a {{different}} landing system {{was chosen for}} MSL compared to previous Mars landers and rovers. Curiosity was considered too heavy to use the airbag landing system as used on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers. A legged lander approach would have caused several design problems. It would have needed to have engines high enough above the ground when landing not to form a dust cloud that could damage the rover's instruments. This would have required long landing legs that would need to have significant width to keep {{the center of gravity}} low. A legged lander would have also required ramps so the rover could drive down to the surface, which would have incurred extra risk to the mission on the chance rocks or tilt would prevent Curiosity from being able to drive off the lander successfully. Faced with these challenges, the MSL engineers came up with a novel alternative solution: the sky crane. The sky crane system lowered the rover with a [...] tether to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars. This system consists of a bridle lowering the rover on three nylon tethers and an electrical cable carrying information and power between the descent stage and rover. As the support and data cables unreeled, the rover's six motorized wheels snapped into position. At roughly [...] below the descent stage the sky crane system slowed to a halt and the rover touched down. After the rover touched down, it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground by detecting the weight on the wheels and fired several pyros (small explosive devices) activating <b>cable</b> <b>cutters</b> on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage. The descent stage flew away to a crash landing [...] away. The sky crane concept had never been used in missions before.|$|R
40|$|An {{electric}} power <b>cable</b> sheath <b>cutter</b> for longitudinally slicing an outer metallic sheath {{of a power}} cable include a frame arranged to be clamped by clamps to each end of a selected longitudinal section of the power cable. A carriage, slidingly mounted to the frame, has rollers that embrace an outer surface of the power cable so that the carriage "floats" on the cable in use. A milling tool with its drive motor is supported on the carriage and is adjustable up and down to enable a depth to be chosen. As a result, the sheath is cut through and inner strands of the power cable are not damaged. The effective depth of the remote end of the cutting tool is controlled by operation of a first motor 20, and the carriage is driven along in use the frame by a second motor so that the cutter can operate automatically without close manual supervision.

50|$|Mining and {{quarrying}} industries commonly use a wire saw to cut hard stone {{into large}} blocks that {{can then be}} shipped to processing plants to be further refined (in the case of ore dressing) or shipped to distributors (in the case of granite or marble for building). These wire saws are large machines that use diamond-impregnated beads on a cable. The saws allow {{the bottom of a}} quarry slab to be cut free (after the cable is passed through access drill holes); with the bottom cut, back and side charges (explosives) can cleanly cleave the slab. Quarry saws on this principle date back centuries; before the era of steel <b>cables</b> with diamond <b>cutters,</b> there were fiber ropes that drew sand through the kerf. The sand (flushed with water) cut the stone (albeit more slowly than diamond does today).|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stage of balloon deployment systems for missions, nichrome wire <b>cable</b> <b>cutters</b> were {{often used in}} place of pyro-actuated cutters. Typically, a nichrome wire is wrapped around a bundle of polymer cables with a low melting point and connected to a relay-actuated electric circuit. The heat from the nichrome reduces {{the strength of the}} cable bundle, which quickly breaks under a mechanical load and can thus be used as a release mechanism for a deployment system. However, the use of hand-made heated nichrome wire for cutters is not very reliable. Often, the wrapped nichrome wire does not cut through the cable because it either pulls away from its power source or does not stay in contact with the cable being cut. Because nichrome is not readily soldered to copper wire, unreliable mechanical crimps are often made to connect the nichrome to an electric circuit. A self-contained device that is reusable and reliable was developed to sever cables for device release or deployment. The nichrome wire in this new device is housed within an enclosure to prevent it from being damaged by handling. The electric power leads are internally connected within the unit to the nichrome wire using a screw terminal connection. A bayonet plug, a quick and secure method of connecting the cutter to the power source, is used to connect the cutter to the power leads similar to those used in pyro-cutter devices. A small ceramic tube [0. 25 -in. wide 0. 5 -in. long (. 6. 4 -mm wide 13 -mm long) ] houses a spiraled nichrome wire that is heated when a cable release action is required. The wire is formed into a spiral coil by wrapping it around a mandrel. It is then laid inside the ceramic tube so that it fits closely to the inner surface of the tube. The ceramic tube provides some thermal and electrical insulation so that most of the heat generated by the wire is directed toward the cable bundle {{in the center of the}} spiral. The ceramic tube is cemented into an aluminum block, which holds it in position. The leads of the nichrome wire are attached to screw terminals that connect them to power leads. A bayonet plug mounted at the bottom of the rectangular block connects the power leads to a relay circuit. A thin aluminum shell encloses the entire structure, leaving access points to attach to the bayonet plug and to feed a cable into the cylinder. The access holes for the deployment cable are a smaller diameter than the nichrome coil to prevent the cable from coming in direct contact with the nichrome when loaded. It uses the same general method of severing a cable with a heated wire as was used previously, but implements it in such a way that it is more reliable and less prone to failure. It creates a mechanism to create repeatability that was nonexistent in the previous method...|$|R
