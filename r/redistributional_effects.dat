40|$|There is {{currently}} a policy debate on potential refinements to monetary policy regimes in countries with low and stable inflation such as the U. S. and Canada. For example, in Canada, a systematic review of the current inflation targeting framework is underway. An issue that has generally received relatively less attention in this debate is the <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation. This omission {{is likely to be}} important since the welfare costs of inflation depend not only on aggregate effects but also on redistributional consequences. The goal {{of this paper is to}} contribute to this policy debate by assessing the <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation in Canada that arise through the revaluation of nominal assets and liabilities. We find that the <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation are sizeable even for low and moderate inflation episodes. The main winners are young middle-class households with substantial amounts of mortgage debt. Besides young households, inflation also represents a windfall gain for the government because of its long-term debt. Old households, rich households, and the middle-aged middle-class lose from inflation, largely due to their sizeable holdings of bonds and non-indexed defined benefit pension assets.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} arguments in favour of price stability is that unexpected inflation generates changes in the distribution of income and wealth among different economic agents. These redistributions occur because many loans are specified in fixed dollar terms and unexpected inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors by reducing the real value of nominal assets and liabilities. This article quantifies the <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects</b> of unexpected inflation in Canada, providing comprehensive evidence of the nominal assets and liabilities of various economic sectors and household groups. A key finding is that the <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects</b> of unexpected inflation are large even with episodes of low inflation. The main winners are young, middle-income households who are major holders of fixed-rate mortgage debt and the government [...] inflation reduces the real burden of their debt. The losers are high-income households and middle-aged, middle-income households that hold long-term bonds and non-indexed pension wealth. ...|$|E

40|$|The Medicare {{program is}} now an {{important}} source of transfers to elderly and disabled beneficiaries, and will continue to grow rapidly in the future. Because the Medicare program is so large in magnitude, it can have significant <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects.</b> In this paper, we measure the flow of Medicare benefits to high-income and low-income neighborhoods in 1990 and 1995. We find that Medicare spending per capita for the lowest income groups grew much more rapidly than Medicare spending in either high income or middle income neighborhoods. Home health care spending {{played an important role in}} the increased spending among the lowest income neighborhoods. To our knowledge, this differential shift in spending has not been documented, yet it exceeds in magnitude the entire per capita transfer from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and is half of the average transfers to the elderly poor from Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Recent cutbacks in home health care benefits may undo some of this change.

40|$|A current {{proposal}} for reforming the German statutory health insurance suggests replacing earnings-related contributions by per-capita health premia. Combining a {{computable general equilibrium}} analysis with abundant empirical data on heterogenous household types, we investigate both the distributional and allocative impact of such a reform proposal. Our results indicate efficiency gains in terms of GDP and employment. This is because employed households of all skill types would increase their labour supply. Yet, while these household types would benefit from introducing health premia, others, such as those including pensioners or unemployed individuals, may suffer in terms of equivalent variations, despite tax-financed compensating transfers to these low-income households. Nonetheless, such transfers are {{an essential part of}} the reform proposal in order to mitigate <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects.</b> By comparing two different compensation schemes, we find that higher transfers go along with higher GDP and employment.

Most impacts, arising from reduced traffic, will be beneficial. There should be an overall reduction in carbon emissions, as well as reductions in local pollutants and noise. For the latter, the effects on immissions will be particularly large where reductions in traffic occur in densely populated areas [65]. Tables  8 and 9 (in Section  5) show the observed reductions in carbon dioxide and pollutants within the charging zones for the case study cities. It is important to note, though, that redistribution of traffic outside the charged zone may have negative impacts. As [46] found in a desk study for Leeds, the distribution of changes in emissions is very sensitive to scheme design, and can raise concerns over environmental justice [18]. However, careful design can minimise these <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects,</b> and road user charging and the policies which complement it can be designed to focus the benefits more directly on environmental enhancement [30].|$|E
40|$|One of {{the roots}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis has been seen in the design of subprime mortgage contract leading to high sensitivity of such type of loans to house price changes. The market of subprime loans, especially in the last years preceding the crisis, has been highly financed by securitization. The paper investigates how borrowers with subprime characteristics influence the transmission mechanism of business cycles in the economy and whether the securitization of subprime loans has a positive effect on the economy. The formal setup is a DSGE model with different types of borrowers and banks acting as financial intermediaries, in which households and entrepreneurs borrow against housing collateral. The economy is subject to four shocks: monetary, inflationary, preference and technology. It is shown that alone the existence of subprime borrowers does not make the economy more responsive to different shocks at the aggregate level (it has only <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects)</b> and that under certain circumstances the securitization of subprime loans (in form of residential mortgage backed securities) may lead to amplification of the business cycles...|$|E
40|$|There is {{confusion}} in the literature concerning the relationship between income inequality and redistribution in a cross-country perspective. The {{reason for this is}} that different contributions in the literature are not referring to the same characteristic.

By employing micro data from the Luxembourg Income Study database in combination with more aggregated information from the OECD for 15 countries, we show that the answer to the question 'does more income inequality generate more redistribution?' depends on how the concept of redistribution is operationalized. Moreover, we argue that closer attention should be given to the common-base version of redistribution, which uses the 'transplant-and-compare' procedure of Dardanoni and Lambert (2002).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} two areas of Macroeconomics: (1) welfare effects of inflation and (2) monetary policy and asset prices. The first chapter focuses on examining the <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation in the United States in a cash-in-advance economy framework. Most {{literature on the}} welfare effects of inflation has largely focused on the aggregate welfare effects of inflation without much assessment about it's <b>redistributional</b> <b>effects.</b> The first chapter examines, quantitatively, how different income brackets in the U. S. would be impacted in terms of consumption and asset positions if long-run inflation were to rise. The second and third chapters focus on the latter strand of macroeconomics. Recently, central bankers {{around the world have}} been debating on what should be the appropriate response of monetary policy to large swings in asset prices. In this spirit, chapter 2 examines {{what would have happened if}} the Federal Reserve had reacted to stock price misalignments prior to crashes and major financial crises such as the Great Recession by extending the standard New Keynesian model to include asset prices. First, the proposed model is used to estimate the response of monetary policy to the stock market using Bayesian techniques. We find that the Federal Reserve did not react to U. S. stock market fluctuations during the Great moderation period. We then undertake a counterfactual experiment in which we assume that the Federal Reserve targets stock price misalignments in addition to inflation and output gap. Our policy experiment suggests that had the Federal Reserve raised their policy rate in response to rising stock prices, the boom-bust cycle of stock prices would have been substantially reduced and surprisingly, this would not have been associated with a decrease in average output. For example, the exuberance of the dotcom in the late 1990 s and the boom in stock prices associated with the housing market in the mid 2000 s would have been milder. Further, the severity of the Great Recession in terms of output loss would have been significantly lower had the policy rate been reactive to rising stock prices prior to the crisis. In the wake of the Great Recession, this chapter contributes to the current debate on whether central banks should target asset price misalignments. The third chapter extends the the second chapter to include financial intermediaries to emphasize the role of credit spreads that serve as an important business cycle propagation mechanism. This chapter asks three related questions. First, to what extent has the Federal Reserve adjusted interest rates in response to movements in credit spreads in the past and whether this response has evolved overtime. Second, how does the presence of financial intermediaries that are a source of credit growth, contribute to the fluctuations in the macroeconomy in the face of a monetary policy shock. Third, what effect does a financial shock that tends to increase credit spreads have on macro variables in the economy...|$|E
