5|$|A 2008 {{molecular}} phylogenetic study clarified the <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> mushroom-forming {{species of}} the family.

5|$|The phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Strombidae {{were mainly}} studied by Simone (2005) and Latiolais (2006), using two {{distinct}} methods. Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) {{based on an}} extensive morpho-anatomical analysis of representatives of Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae and Struthiolariidae, which included L.gigas (there referred to as Eustrombus gigas).|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E

5|$|Other realist novels by Moore {{from this}} period include A Drama in Muslin (1886), a satiric story of the {{marriage}} trade in Anglo-Irish society that hints at same-sex <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> unmarried daughters of the gentry, and Esther Waters (1894), {{the story of an}} unmarried housemaid who becomes pregnant and is abandoned by her footman lover. Both of these books have remained almost constantly in print since their first publication. His 1887 novel A Mere Accident is an attempt to merge his symbolist and realist influences. He also published a collection of short stories: Celibates (1895).|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> three lineages.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Gardner and James Patton {{suggested}} in 1976 that Allen's O.rivularis {{may be the}} same species as O.bombycinus. They considered O.bolivaris as probably the same as O.nitidus and listed castaneus as a synonym of O.capito (equivalent to modern Hylaeamys megacephalus and closely related species plus Transandinomys talamancae). In 1984, Benshoof and colleagues reported the first record of Oryzomys bombycinus from Honduras. Guy Musser and Marina Williams reviewed O.talamancae in 1985 and included O.castaneus {{as one of its}} synonyms, though without having examined the holotype. In the 1993 second edition of Mammal Species of the World, Musser and Michael Carleton used the name Oryzomys bolivaris for the species previously known as O.bombycinus, and in 1998, Musser and colleagues fully documented the allocation of the names bolivaris, castaneus, rivularis, bombycinus, alleni, and orinus to the same species, Oryzomys bolivaris. They noted its similarity to O.talamancae, but did not attempt to determine phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> species they discussed. In their limited material, they found geographic variation within the species inconsequential and they recognized no subspecies.|$|E

25|$|The phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> main subdivisions of {{arthropods}} {{have been}} the subject of considerable research and dispute for many years. A consensus emerged from about 2010 onwards, based on both morphological and molecular evidence. Extant (living) arthropods are a monophyletic group and are divided into three main clades: chelicerates (including arachnids), pancrustaceans (the paraphyletic crustaceans plus insects and their allies), and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and allies). The three groups are related as shown in the cladogram below. Including fossil taxa does not fundamentally alter this view, although it introduces some additional basal groups.|$|E

The early Carnian pistosaur Bobosaurus was found to be one step more advanced than Augustasaurus in relation to the Plesiosauria and therefore it represented by definition the basalmost known plesiosaur. This analysis focused on basal plesiosaurs and therefore only one derived pliosaurid and one cryptoclidian were included, while elasmosaurids weren't included at all. A more detailed analysis published by both Benson and Druckenmiller in 2014 was not able to resolve the <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> lineages at the base of Plesiosauria.|$|E
