50|$|On 30 April 2015, USAF RC-135V, 64-14848, {{operating}} out of Offutt AFB, NE aborted takeoff on a routine training mission when crewmembers observed smoke and flames coming from the aft galley. The aircraft commander aborted the takeoff at about 50 KIAS and the cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians—27 individuals in all—evacuated the aircraft. Although there were no injuries, except for minor smoke inhalation, the ensuing fire damaged aircraft control and mission related systems. Total repair cost was estimated at $62.4 million US. The cause of the mishap was failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a <b>retaining</b> <b>nut</b> connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley. This resulted in an oxygen leak and caused a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the <b>retaining</b> <b>nut</b> and caused the tubing to become detached, which fed even more to the fire, increased its size and caused severe damage to the airframe, galley and mission equipment aboard the aircraft. The oxygen system work which was listed {{as the cause of}} this 2015 mishap was completed in August 2013.|$|E
25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by overtightening their <b>retaining</b> <b>nuts.</b> In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the main cable {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|R

5000|$|The second Gyrodyne was {{grounded}} {{during the}} accident investigation which determined flapping hinge <b>retaining</b> <b>nut</b> failure due to poor machining as the cause. The extensively modified second prototype, renamed Jet Gyrodyne, flew in January 1954. Though retaining the name [...] "Gyrodyne", the Jet Gyrodyne was a compound gyroplane, {{and did not}} operate on the same principle as the original aircraft. It had a two-blade rotor manually controlled with cyclic and collective pitch mechanisms that acted directly on each rotor blade and was driven by tip jets fed with air from two compressors driven by the Alvis Leonides radial engine. Pusher propellers, one mounted {{at the tip of}} each stub wing, provided yaw control through differential collective pitch and thrust for forward flight. The Jet Gyrodyne was constructed to provide rotor drive and operational data for the Fairey Rotodyne compound gyroplane.|$|E
5000|$|Fairey Aviation was {{one such}} {{company that was}} {{intrigued}} by the potential of rotary-wing aircraft, and proceeded to develop the Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne in accordance with Specification E.16/47. The Gyrodyne was a unique aircraft {{in its own right}} that defined a third type of rotorcraft, including autogyro and helicopter. Having little in common with the later Rotodyne, it was characterised by its inventor, Dr. J.A.J. Bennett, formerly Chief Technical Officer of the pre-Second World War Cierva Autogiro Company as an intermediate aircraft designed to combine the safety and simplicity of the autogyro with hovering performance. Its rotor was driven in all phases of flight with collective pitch being an automatic function of shaft torque, with a side-mounted propeller providing both thrust for forward flight and rotor torque correction. On 28 June 1948, the FB-1 proved its potential during test flights when it achieved a world airspeed record, having attaining a recorded speed of 124.3 mph [...] The programme was not trouble-free however, a fatal accident involving one of the prototypes occurring in April 1949 due to poor machining of a rotor blade flapping link <b>retaining</b> <b>nut.</b> The second FB-1 was modified to investigate a tip-jet driven rotor with propulsion provided by propellers mounted at the tip of each stub wing, being renamed the Jet Gyrodyne.|$|E
40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan <b>retaining</b> <b>nut.</b> The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal.

40|$|The CIF {{will treat}} {{hazardous}} and mixed low-level radioactive waste in a rotary kiln and secondary combustion chamber. A high efficiency {{air pollution control}} system follows the secondary chamber. The rotary kiln is designed with a gas seal {{at each end of}} its rotating barrel which provides a barrier between the interior of the kiln and outside air. The internal pressure of the rotary kiln will be maintained below atmospheric pressure, so exterior air passing the seals is forced into the kiln`s interior. Positive pressure may be applied in the seal labyrinth, adding a barrier to flow. Both CIF seals will be covered entirely with exhaust hoods, drawing air over the outside of the seal and into a HEPA filtered exhaust system. Cam follower misalignment on a John Zink rotary kiln seal caused damage to the seal`s rotor. The misalignment was quantified, corrected, and checked to verify straightness. The primary purpose of the correction was to allow seal testing 1 to continue, but the information is applicable to the Consolidated Incineration Facility (CIF) since two large seals of similar design will be installed there. Cam follower straightness was off as much as 3. 5 {degrees}, causing followers to run untrue on the rotor. High contact forces resulted, removing flakes of metal from the rotor surface. The misalignment caused weight bearing followers {{on one side of the}} seal to back out of their threaded mounts. The root cause was poor machining of the follower mounting holes. Correction was accomplished by relieving the holes and installing machined spacers and <b>retaining</b> <b>nuts.</b> Cam followers on the CIF`s Zink seals should be inspected for straightness before the seals are installed...|$|R
50|$|The {{plastic insert}} is {{placed at the}} end of the nut, with an inner {{diameter}} (ID) slightly smaller than the major diameter of the screw.

50|$|Tie rods may be {{connected}} {{at the ends}} in various ways, but it is desirable that {{the strength of the}} connection should be at least equal to the strength of the rod. The ends may be threaded and passed through drilled holes or shackles and <b>retained</b> by <b>nuts</b> screwed on the ends. If the ends are threaded right- and left-hand the length between points of loading may be altered. This furnishes a second method for pre-tensioning the rod at will by turning it in the nuts so that the length will be changed. A turnbuckle will accomplish the same purpose. The ends may also be swaged to receive a fitting which is connected to the supports. Another way of making end connections is to forge an eye or hook on the rod.|$|R
5000|$|To remove {{backlash}} {{and obtain}} the optimum stiffness and wear characteristics {{for a given}} application, a controlled amount of preload is usually applied. This is accomplished in some cases by machining the components such that the balls are a [...] "tight" [...] fit when assembled, however this gives poor control of the preload, {{and can not be}} adjusted to allow for wear. It is more common to design the ball nut as effectively two separate nuts which are tightly coupled mechanically, with adjustment by either rotation one nut with respect to the other, so creating a relative axial displacement, or by <b>retaining</b> both <b>nuts</b> tightly together axially and rotating one with respect to the other, so that its set of balls is displaced axially to create the preload.|$|R
50|$|Friction torque {{can also}} be an asset in engineering.

2500|$|The {{solution}} is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and <b>retained</b> with a <b>nut,</b> then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts.

60|$|But especially, in the winter, {{the extent}} to which this {{transportation}} and planting of nuts is carried on is made apparent by the snow. In almost every wood, you will see where the red or gray squirrels have pawed down through the snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet deep, and almost always directly to a nut or a pine-cone, as directly as if they had started from it and bored upward,--which you and I could not have done. It would be difficult for us to find one before the snow falls. Commonly, no doubt, they had deposited them there in the fall. You wonder if they remember the localities, or discover them by the scent. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under a thicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of evergreens {{in the midst of a}} deciduous wood. If there are any nut-trees, which still <b>retain</b> their <b>nuts,</b> standing at a distance without the wood, their paths often lead directly to and from them.

5000|$|A Philidas nut is a locknut {{with one}} or more slots cut {{laterally}} in the reduced-diameter circular top for less than half the diameter, the metal above the slot(s) being deformed downwards so that over the last one or two turns, the thread for half the diameter is [...] "axially depitched" [...] or displaced from its normal position. As the nut is threaded on, the displaced sections are elastically forced back axially to their original position, the load increasing the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action. These <b>nuts</b> <b>retain</b> their locking action at temperatures limited only by the base material, as no polymeric insert is used, and as the locking action is by elastic deformation, they can be re-used multiple times. They may look similar, but differ substantially from the split beam nut because the former has a radial displacement of the deformed portion, while the Philidas nut uses axial deflection or depitching.|$|R
40|$|Black rats (Rattus rattus) cause {{extensive}} damage in Hawaiian macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) orchards. In a previous study, extensive and persistent snap trapping significantly reduced rat populations and depredations on developing macadamia nuts, but {{had little effect}} on subsequent yields of mature nuts. This suggested that macadamia trees may compensate for rat damage, and that commonly used indices based on rodent activity and proportion of nuts damaged may overestimate the impact of rodent depredations and exaggerate the effectiveness of control measures. To clarify the effects of rat feeding on developing macadamia nuts, two levels of damage at two times during nut development and evaluated yields of mature nuts were simulated. Both number of nuts per raceme (P = 0. 0001) and total weight of mature kernels per raceme (P = 0. 0001), but not mean weight per mature kernel (P = 0. 90), varied among treatments. Both number of nuts and total weight of kernels decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with increasing damage. Time during nut development that damage was simulated had no apparent effect (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) on yields. These results indicate that racemes did not compensate for damage by <b>retaining</b> other <b>nuts</b> on the same raceme that might otherwise have dropped prematurely. A variance component analysis was also conducted to determine how best to sample the orchard in a practical fashion while minimizing potential sources of bias and retaining sensitivity for distinguishing among treatment effects.

40|$|Delayed or {{extended}} fruit abscission in many cultivars of macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia (Proteaceae), necessitates multiple harvests {{from the}} orchard floor. However, {{it is not}} known whether there is a link between fruit maturation and timing of abscission. In this study, relationships between kernel oil content, nut size, removal force and abscission were investigated in 2 commercial orchards, one in Queensland (24 ˚S) and one in New South Wales (29 ˚S). Abscission lasted 6 months (March–September) at both sites due to differences in timing of abscission between cultivars and extended abscission within cultivars. Abscission was consistently associated with declines in fruit removal force, from more than 2 kgf in early March towards 1 kgf at the peak of abscission. Later abscission in cvv. A 16 and 246, compared with cvv. 344 and 741, was correlated with more gradual declines in removal force. Fruits containing small nuts and kernels tended to possess lower removal forces and these fruits were often heavily represented in the population of fruits that abscised earliest. There was little or no difference in kernel oil content between fruits of different removal force or between sample dates for any cultivar, either for samples taken from the tree or from the orchard floor. Attainment of maximal oil content and onset of fruit abscission are therefore independent processes in macadamia. If abscission can be accelerated, {{it may be possible to}} advance the harvest of late-abscising cultivars such as A 16 and 246 which <b>retain</b> mature <b>nuts</b> on the tree up to several months after maximal oil accumulation...|$|R
50|$|The {{valve stem}} is a tube made of metal or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. Valve stems usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in valve stems eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the valve stem at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their valve stem is all metal with a <b>nut</b> <b>retaining</b> it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|R

25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then <b>retain</b> the wheel <b>nuts</b> and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle <b>nuts,</b> <b>retaining</b> washers, locking washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps.
