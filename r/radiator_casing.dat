5000|$|The {{conventional}} shield-shaped <b>radiator</b> <b>casing</b> {{was replaced}} by a chromed vertically-barred [...] "waterfall" [...] grille in July 1937, earlier on some other Flying Standard models.|$|E
50|$|For 1939, all Cadillac V8s had new grille styling; {{similar in}} {{appearance}} but different in detail dimensions on each series. The pointed center grille and the functional side grilles were die-cast, with finepitch bars. A single die-cast louver was positioned {{to the rear}} of each hood side panel. Headlights were once again attached to the <b>radiator</b> <b>casing.</b> Chassis changes included: tube and fin radiator core; sea shell horns under the hood; 10mm spark plugs.|$|E
40|$|In a Stirling {{radioisotope}} system, heat must continually {{be removed}} from the GPHS modules, to maintain the GPHS modules and surrounding insulation at acceptable temperatures. Normally, the Stirling convertor provides this cooling. If the Stirling convertor stops in the current system, the insulation is designed to spoil, preventing damage to the GPHS, but also ending the mission. An alkali-metal Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) is under development to allow multiple stops and restarts of the Stirling convertor. The status of the ongoing effort in developing this technology is presented in this paper. An earlier, preliminary design had a radiator outside the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) casing, used NaK as the working fluid, and had the reservoir located on the cold side adapter flange. The revised design has an internal <b>radiator</b> inside the <b>casing,</b> with the reservoir embedded inside the insulation. A large set of advantages are offered by this new design. In addition to reducing the overall size and mass of the VCHP, simplicity, compactness and easiness in assembling the VCHP with the ASRG are significantly enhanced. Also, the permanently elevated temperatures of the entire VCHP allows the change of the working fluid from a binary compound (NaK) to single compound (Na). The latter, by its properties, allows higher performance and further mass reduction of the system. Preliminary design and analysis shows an acceptable peak temperature of the ASRG case of 140 C while the heat losses caused by the addition of the VCHP are 1. 8 W...|$|R
