25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E

After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial {{for the lost}} lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named [...] "Kuta Karnival— A Celebration of Life". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach {{as well as in}} the water for young and old plus <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.|$|E
2500|$|Ellis Rowan full {{of enthusiasm}} with her artistic creation, which enabled herself {{to observe the}} insect world and animal life. These magical creatures brought her {{entertainment}} and helped her escaped from her busy business of botanical [...] painting. In spite of observing insects, Ellis also a collector of them. Her letters which wrote during her journey always mentioned collecting activities, {{and some of them}} were the adventurous stories of snakes. There were sheets of paper painted with <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> butterflies leaning on Ellis’ studio wall. They indicate the study that Ellis down as a source of adding to the flower paintings. However, the adding of these animals and insects were more for the artistic effect rather than the realistic illustration. Though the scientific value of Ellis’ botanical Paintings is limited, they are as the excellent record of history of some Queensland’s flora drawn by an artist who was in search of the aesthetic expression and picturesque beauty.|$|E

60|$|We {{pushed off}} again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work now, but Herbert <b>and</b> Startop persevered, <b>and</b> <b>rowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>rowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>rowed</b> {{until the sun}} went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little, {{so that we could}} see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast {{deepening}} into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising grounds, between which and us {{there seemed to be no}} life, save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} the sun had quitted {{the face of the}} vast apartment-house on which the day habitually broke, and had gone about its {{business}} of lighting and heating the city roofs and streets, the holiday companions were well on their way up the Third Avenue Elevated toward that region of the Bronx which, in all their New York years, they had never yet visited. They exulted at each stop and start of the train in the long succession of streets which followed so fast upon one another that the guards gave up trying to call them out as a hundred-and-so-many, and simply said Fifty-fifth, and Sixty-sixth, and Seventy-seventh Street. This slight of their duty to the public comported agreeably with the slip-shod effectiveness of the whole apparatus of the New York life: the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of shops, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of flats, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of back yards with miles of wash flying in the soft May wind, which, probably, the people in the open car ahead felt almost a gale.|$|E
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the parlour stood a large deal table. On it were set <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of the tin and lead {{soldiers}} which were part of the shopkeeper's stock. The visitor would have thought nothing of it {{if it had not been}} for a certain odd grouping of them, which did not seem either entirely commercial or entirely haphazard.|$|E
6000|$|... "But the {{beautiful}} things religion gives! The beauty! Do you know Saint Paul's, Stephen? Latterly I {{have been there}} time after time. It {{is the most beautiful}} interior in all the world, so great, so sombrely dignified, so perfectly balanced--and filled with such wonderful music, brimming with music just as crystal water brims in a bowl of crystal. The other day I went there, up into a little gallery high up under the dome, to hear Bach's Passion Music, the St. Matthew Passion. One hangs high and far above the little multitudes below, the white-robed singers, the white-robed musicians, ranks and ranks, the great organ, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of congregation, receding this way, that way, into the haze of the aisle and the transepts, and out of it all streams the sound and the singing, it pours up past you like a river, a river that rushes upward to some great sea, some unknown sea. The whole place is music and singing.... I hang on to the railings, Stephen, and weep--I have to weep--and I wonder and wonder....|$|E

But {{when he entered the}} churchyard, and looked about him anxiously to see where he should begin searching for his sister's grave, his head grew confused, and his heart began to fail him. Bangbury was a large town, and <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of tombstones seemed to fill the churchyard bewilderingly in every visible direction.|$|E
60|$|As they {{advanced}} {{towards the}} asylum they {{looked up at}} its rows on rows of windows, and understood the Master's material threat. By means of that complex but concealed machinery which ran like a network of nerves over the whole fabric, there had been shot out under every window-ledge <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of polished-steel cylinders, the cold miracles of modern gunnery. They commanded the whole garden and the whole country-side, and could have blown to pieces an army corps.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will go in}} this way," [...] she said, {{suddenly}} {{opening the}} hall door. She had unlocked it before she went out, for that entrance was hardly ever used. So she showed the Italian into the sombre drawing-room, with its high black bookshelves with <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of calf-bound volumes, its old red and flowered carpet, its grand piano littered with music. Ciccio put down the things as she directed, and stood with his cap in his hands, looking aside.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of coal {{in the village}} caused a huge expansion in housing with a population in the 1841 census of 111 to a population of 558 in 1851. To provide for the huge increase the collieries a rapid housing programme began with 15 dwellings in 1841 to 96 in 1851. The familiar street names Bryn farm cottages, Buck <b>Row,</b> Yard <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> Farteg <b>Row</b> appeared, <b>and</b> so did a street called Wain Row, which transformed into Cross <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> Meadow <b>Row.</b>|$|R

60|$|Behind {{the mill}} door, and {{invisible}} to the mere wayfarer who did not visit the family, were chalked addition and subtraction sums, many of them originally done wrong, and the figures half rubbed out and corrected, noughts being turned into nines, and ones into twos. These were the miller's private calculations. There were also chalked {{in the same place}} <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of strokes like open palings, representing the calculations of the grinder, who in his youthful ciphering studies had not gone so far as Arabic figures.|$|E
6000|$|... "The rehearsals are all right," [...] she admitted, {{looking up}} at him almost pathetically. [...] "It's the night itself that seems so awful. I know every word, I know every note, and yet I can't feel sure. I can't sleep for {{thinking}} about it. Only last night I had a nightmare. I saw all those <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of faces, and the lights, and my voice went, my tongue was dry and hard, not a word would come. And you were there--and the others!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker {{ignored the}} question. He {{was sitting in}} the same {{attitude}} of watchfulness, the revolver resting on his knee. He seemed mistrustful of John's right hand, which was hanging limply at his side. It was from this quarter that he appeared to expect attack. The cab was bowling easily up the broad street, past <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of high houses each looking exactly the same as the last. Occasionally, to the right, through a break in the line of buildings, a glimpse of the river could be seen.|$|E

6000|$|This {{sprinkling}} of people seemed only {{to enhance the}} cool brown emptiness of the church, the <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of empty pews, disengaged prayerbooks and abandoned hassocks. It {{had the effect of}} a preposterous misfit. Johnson consulted with a thin-legged, short-skirted verger about the disposition of the party. The officiating clergy appeared distantly {{in the doorway of the}} vestry, putting on his surplice, and relapsed into a contemplative cheek-scratching that was manifestly habitual. Before the bride arrived Mr. Polly's sense of the church found an outlet in whispered criticisms of ecclesiastical architecture with Johnson. [...] "Early Norman arches, eh?" [...] he said, [...] "or Perpendicular." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} squadrons of the 21st Lancers {{had turned}} the {{shoulder}} of the steep Kerreri Hills, we saw in the distance a yellow-brown pointed dome rising above the blurred horizon. It was the Mahdi's Tomb, standing in the very heart of Omdurman. From the high ground the field-glass disclosed <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of mud houses, making a dark patch on the brown of the plain. To the left the river, steel-grey in the morning light, forked into two channels, and on the tongue of land between them the gleam of a white building showed among the trees. Before us were the ruins of Khartoum and the confluence of the Blue and White Niles.|$|E

60|$|When he {{got home}} he hurried upstairs to his bare chamber. He swept his table clear, and then, in an expert fashion, he seized handfuls of coin and piled them in little columns on his board. There was an army of fat pennies, a dozen to a column, along the back, <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of fat brown rank-and-file. In front of these, rows of slim halfpence, like an advance-guard. And {{commanding}} all, a stout column of half-crowns, a few stoutish and important florin-figures, like general and colonels, then quite a file of shillings, like so many captains, and a little cloud of silvery lieutenant sixpences. Right at the end, like a frail drummer boy, a thin stick of threepenny pieces.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see how I {{could prove}} an alibi," [...] remarked Mr. Ledbetter, {{trying to show}} by his {{conversation}} {{that he was an}} educated man. There was a pause. Mr. Ledbetter perceived that on a chair beside his captor was a large black bag on a heap of crumpled papers, and that there were torn and burnt papers on the table. And in front of these, and arranged methodically along the edge were <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of little yellow rouleaux--a hundred times more gold than Mr. Ledbetter had seen in all his life before. The light of two candles, in silver candlesticks, fell upon these. The pause continued. [...] "It is rather fatiguing holding up my hands like this," [...] said Mr. Ledbetter, with a deprecatory smile.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} beasts--rows and <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of them! The {{smallest}} beasts were nearest the King's rock throne; {{then there were}} wolves and foxes, lynxes and hyenas, and the like; behind them were gathered the monkey tribes, who were hard to keep in order because they teased the other animals and were full of mischievous tricks. Back of the monkeys were the pumas, jaguars, tigers and lions, and their kind; next the bears, all sizes and colors; after them bisons, wild asses, zebras and unicorns; farther on the rhinoceri and hippopotami, and at {{the far edge of}} the forest, close to the trees that shut in the clearing, was a row of thick-skinned elephants, still as statues but with eyes bright and intelligent.|$|E
