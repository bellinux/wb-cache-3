5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of <b>roentgenium</b> has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce <b>roentgenium</b> isotopes. For chemical studies {{to be carried out}} on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 281Rg, the most stable known <b>roentgenium</b> isotope, is 26seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of <b>roentgenium</b> isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the <b>roentgenium</b> isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of <b>roentgenium,</b> as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of <b>roentgenium</b> has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium, despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the ns subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at <b>roentgenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|All <b>roentgenium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known <b>roentgenium</b> isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known <b>roentgenium</b> isotope; it has a half-life of 2.1minutes. (The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of about 11minutes, {{which would make it}} one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known.) The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range. The undiscovered isotope 287Rg has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; however, no known <b>roentgenium</b> isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. The unknown isotopes 277Rg and 283Rg are also expected to have long half-lives of 1second and 10minutes respectively. Before their discovery, the isotopes 278Rg, 281Rg, and 282Rg were predicted to have long half-lives of 1second, 1minute, and 4minutes respectively; however, they were discovered to have shorter half-lives of 4.2milliseconds, 17seconds, and 2.1minutes respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roentgenium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of <b>roentgenium</b> {{have been reported}} with atomic masses 272, 274, 278–282, and 286 (unconfirmed), two of which, roentgenium-272 and roentgenium-274, have known but unconfirmed metastable states. All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roentgenium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is {{a synthetic}} element {{that can be}} created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 2.1minutes, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 11minutes. <b>Roentgenium</b> was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled Roentgen).|$|E
5|$|<b>Roentgenium</b> is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 28.7g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from roentgenium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>roentgenium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>roentgenium</b> (Rg) was {{suggested}} by the GSI team in 2004, to honor the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, the discoverer of X-rays. This name was accepted by IUPAC on November 1, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split {{into a pair of}} energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For <b>roentgenium,</b> calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent that}} it becomes the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and <b>roentgenium</b> is expected to be silvery in appearance. The atomic radius of <b>roentgenium</b> is expected to be around 138pm.|$|E
5|$|Nihonium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Seven different isotopes of nihonium have been reported with atomic masses 278, 282–286, and 290; they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of <b>roentgenium,</b> although nihonium-284 may have an electron capture branch to copernicium-284.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 11 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to gold in group 11 as the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. <b>Roentgenium</b> is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, copper, silver, and gold, although it may show some differences from them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roentgenium</b> is {{the ninth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Using Mendeleev's {{nomenclature}} for unnamed and undiscovered elements, <b>roentgenium</b> {{should be}} known as eka-gold. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unununium (with the corresponding symbol of Uuu), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it element 111, with the symbol of E111, (111) or even simply 111.|$|E
5|$|The proton-rich {{isotopes}} with masses 260, 261, and 262 {{were directly}} produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 {{were reported in}} the decay chains of meitnerium and <b>roentgenium,</b> while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (unconfirmed) appear in the decay chains of 282Nh, 287Mc, 288Mc, 294Ts, and 290Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about tenmilliseconds for 262mBh to about oneminute for 270Bh and 274Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed 278Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.|$|E
25|$|A {{repeat of}} the thorium-experiment using the {{superior}} method of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) failed to confirm the results, despite a 100-fold better sensitivity. This result throws considerable {{doubt on the results}} of the Marinov collaboration with regard to their claims of long-lived isotopes of thorium, <b>roentgenium</b> and unbibium. It is still possible that traces of unbibium might only exist in some thorium samples, although this is unlikely.|$|E
500|$|<b>Roentgenium</b> is {{predicted}} to be a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 11 elements, <b>roentgenium</b> {{is predicted}} to show stable +5, +3, and −1 oxidation states, with a less stable +1 state. The +3 state {{is predicted to}} be the most stable. Roentgenium(III) is expected to be of comparable reactivity to gold(III), but should be more stable and form a larger variety of compounds. Gold also forms a somewhat stable −1 state due to relativistic effects, and <b>roentgenium</b> may do so as well: the electron affinity of <b>roentgenium</b> is expected to be around , significantly lower than gold's value of , so roentgenides may not be stable or even possible. The 6d orbitals are destabilized by relativistic effects and spin–orbit interactions {{near the end of the}} fourth transition metal series, thus making the high oxidation state roentgenium(V) more stable than its lighter homologue gold(V) (known only in one compound) as the 6d electrons participate in bonding to a greater extent. The spin-orbit interactions stabilize molecular <b>roentgenium</b> compounds with more bonding 6d electrons; for example, [...] is expected to be more stable than , which is expected to be more stable than [...] Roentgenium(I) is expected to be difficult to obtain.

500|$|The {{probable}} {{chemistry of}} <b>roentgenium</b> {{has received more}} interest {{than that of the}} two previous elements, meitnerium and darmstadtium, as the valence s-subshells of the group 11 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at <b>roentgenium.</b> Calculations on the molecular compound RgH show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium–hydrogen bond, even though spin–orbit interactions also weaken it by [...] The compounds AuX and RgX, where X = F, Cl, Br, O, Au, or Rg, were also studied. Rg+ is predicted to be the softest metal ion, even softer than Au+, although there is disagreement on whether it would behave as an acid or a base. In aqueous solution, Rg+ would form the aqua ion +, with an Rg–O bond distance of 207.1pm. It is also expected to form Rg(I) complexes with ammonia, phosphine, and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1940s {{to the early}} 1960s, {{the early days of}} the {{synthesis}} of heavier and heavier transuranium elements, it was predicted that since such heavy elements did not occur naturally, they would have shorter and shorter half-lives to spontaneous fission, until they stopped existing altogether at around element 108 (now known as hassium). Initial work in the synthesis of the actinides appeared to confirm this. The nuclear shell model, introduced in the late 1960s, stated that the protons and neutrons formed shells within a nucleus, somewhat analogous to electrons forming electron shells within an atom. The noble gases are unreactive due to their having full electron shells; thus it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells – having so-called [...] "magic" [...] numbers of protons or neutrons – would be stabilized against radioactive decay. A doubly magic isotope, having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, would be especially stabilized, and it was calculated that the next doubly magic isotope after lead-208 would be flerovium-298 with 114 protons and 184 neutrons, which would form the centre of a so-called [...] "island of stability". This island of stability, supposedly ranging from copernicium (element 112) to oganesson (118), would come after a long [...] "sea of instability" [...] from elements 101 (mendelevium) to 111 (<b>roentgenium),</b> and the flerovium isotopes in it were speculated in 1966 to have half-lives in excess of a hundredmillionyears. It took thirty years for the first isotopes of flerovium to be synthesized. More recent work suggests that the local islands of stability around hassium and flerovium are due to these nuclei being respectively deformed and oblate, which make them resistant to spontaneous fission, and that the true island of stability for spherical nuclei occurs at around unbibium-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).|$|E
2500|$|IUPAC has {{established}} international standards for naming elements. The first scientist or laboratory to isolate an element {{has the right}} to propose a name; after a review process, a final decision is made by the IUPAC Council.

The names combine syllables that represent the digits of the atomic number, followed by [...] "-ium". For example, [...] "unununium" [...] is element 111 ("un" [...] being the syllable for 1). However, once the element has been found, the systematic name is replaced by a trivial one, in this case <b>roentgenium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Super-heavy {{elements}} such as <b>roentgenium</b> are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induce fusion reactions.
