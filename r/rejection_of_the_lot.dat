40|$|We {{deal with}} a lot {{consisting}} of effectives, and defectives classified into several categories according to their inferiorities. A sequential sampling plan for the lot based on the sequential probability ratio test proposed by Wald [7] is investigated. The primary object is to develop exact formulae for operating characteristic, average sample size and the moment generating function {{of the number of}} observations for the sequential plan. For this purpose, we use the combinatorial method for counting all the possible sampling processes falled into acceptance or rejection region. Further more, we propose a way of determinating constants which involve two equalities giving decision boundaries of acceptance or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot...</b>|$|E
30|$|From Table  3, it can {{be noted}} that the {{existing}} sampling plan under the classical statistics method provides the determined values at all specified parameters. On the other hand, the proposed plan under the neutrosophic interval method provides the probabilities in the interval. For an example, when n[*]=[*] 5, the lot acceptance probability is 0.1632, the probability of indeterminacy (i.e., neither an acceptance not a reject) is 0.6333. It means, that when a lot of inspection with n[*]=[*] 5 and c[*]=[*] 0 is applied for the inspection of the lot, there is 63 % chance that an experimenter is undecided about the lot sentencing. By comparing both sampling plans, we note that the plan under the classical statistics only has the decision of acceptance or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot.</b> The existing plan does not provide any information about the indeterminacy. So, the proposed sampling under the neutrosophic statistics is more effective and adequate under the uncertainty environment and this conclusion coincides with [21].|$|E
3000|$|We {{have assumed}} in the {{discussion}} above that the null for the producer is that the lot is conforming, or analogously the production line is stable producing a good product. The engineer who tries to correct problems that do not exist (he rejects the null when it is true) is wasting precious time in worthless activities. This is a type I error, {{the basis of the}} p value 7 to the statistician and equivalent to producer risk for the industrial engineer. Increasing the value of the cutoff c will decrease the probability of type I error by making <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> more difficult. However, increasing the value of c makes acceptance easier and therefore will increase the probability of type II error, β [...] p [...]. Considering that type II error is relatively less important for the producer, the tradeoff tends to be attractive for the producer. From the consumer’s side of the story and contrary to the producer, the null should be that the lot is non-conforming, in other words, that the consumer should naturally distrust the quality of the lot or process.|$|E
50|$|Method: Qualification ESS is by {{exposure}} to qualification environmental levels, then operated to demonstrate capacity plus a margin. Acceptance ESS is typically done on 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production <b>lot</b> (but not less than 10 units) {{by exposure}} to qualification environmental levels, then operated to demonstrate capacity plus a margin. Failure of one UUT requires <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production <b>lot.</b> For explosive devices, test requirements and methods are tailored from MIL-HDBK-1512 and NATO AOP-7. For batteries, guidance on test requirements is in RCC-Doc-319-99.|$|R
40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} {{is concerned}} with norms <b>of</b> deciding about <b>the</b> acceptance or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> based on <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product during inspection. Dodge and Romig popularized the acceptance sampling as a major field of SQC. Various Sampling plans, systems and schemes are developed as per <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industry. Quick Switching Systems is a system which requires fewer samples for processes running at low levels of defects. Quick Switching Systems are compared with single, double, multiple, chain and variable sampling plans as well as MIL STD 105 E switching systems and concluded its advantages. This article presents the Quick Switching Double Sampling System (QSDSS) when <b>the</b> fraction <b>of</b> non-conforming items is a fuzzy number and being modeled based on the fuzzy Binomial distribution. Operating Characteristic (OC) curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy system is like a band having high and low bounds whose width depends on the ambiguity proportion parameter in <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> when that sample size and acceptance numbers is fixed. Tables are constructed and numerical illustrations are given to describe <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> QSDSS for sample size tightening with fuzzy Binomial distribution with its OC curve...|$|R
40|$|Burr {{distribution}} is {{considered as a}} probability model for <b>the</b> lifetime <b>of</b> products. Reliability test plans are those sampling plans in which items from a lot are put to test to make conclusions on <b>the</b> estimate <b>of</b> life, and hence acceptance or <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submitted <b>lot</b> is done. A test plan designs <b>the</b> termination time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment and the termination number for a given sample size and producer’s risk.

30|$|Recognizing that <b>the</b> points <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{producer}} or consumer {{come from}} different perspectives, the value chosen for c is <b>of</b> pivotal importance. <b>The</b> producer will want a c that is relatively large, admitting <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> accepting bad lots {{so that there}} is no <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> good <b>lots.</b> <b>The</b> consumer, on the other hand, will desire a low value for c, consequently rejecting some good lots but better guaranteeing <b>the</b> acceptance <b>of</b> only good lots. Therefore, it will be difficult if not impossible to find values for c that will serve <b>the</b> desires <b>of</b> both adversaries.|$|R
40|$|Chile is {{the number}} one {{exporter}} of table grapes in the world with annual exports of 800, 000 tons valued at $ 1. 3 billion. Approximately 75 % of Chile’s grape production is for export markets. Chile is <b>the</b> major supplier <b>of</b> table grapes for the U. S. and the E. U. in winter months. In recent years, Chilean table grapes have been marketed up to 120 days after harvest and transported to markets 15 - 30 days away by overseas transport [1]. Importing countries have very low (. 5 %) tolerance for decays in import shipments. If a lot fails to make the grade tolerance, growers may have important financial losses due to price reduction or even to <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>lot</b> [1]. Postharvest decay of grapes can be minimized with preharvest fungicide sprays in vineyards. The main fungal grape disease targeted by fungicide sprays in Chile is gray mold (Botrytis). Berries infected with Botrytis left in the vineyard at harvest dry and become sources <b>of</b> spores. Inside <b>the</b> grape, the fungus forms side growths, which exude enzymes that degrade and soften the materials that cement grape tissue walls together. Th...|$|R

During storage <b>the</b> main effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> arthropods species on food products {{is related to the}} damage they cause and <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> product quantity and quality that can lead to <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> contaminated <b>lots.</b> <b>The</b> arthropods species recorded in the survey are mentioned. A total of 27 arthropods species including insects and arachnids were identified. The insects species Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Ephestia cautella (Walker) were common to the seven warehouses and in the milling factory, while Ahasverus advena (Waltl) and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) were found in the seven examined warehouses.

40|$|Aim. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the heart transplantation experience based on patients` descriptions. Background. To patients with heart failure, heart transplantation represents a possibility to survive and improve their quality of life. Studies have shown that more quality of life is related to patients` increasing awareness and participation in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> healthcare team in the post-transplantation period. Deficient relationships between patients and healthcare providers result in lower compliance with the postoperative regimen. Method. A phenomenological approach was used to interview 26 patients who were heart transplant recipients. Patients were interviewed individually and asked this single question: What does <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> being heart transplanted mean? Participants` descriptions were analysed using phenomenological reduction, analysis and interpretation. Results. Three categories emerged from data analysis: (i) the time lived by the heart recipient; (ii) donors, family and caregivers and (iii) reflections on the experience lived. Living after heart transplant means living in a complex situation: recipients are confronted with lifelong immunosuppressive therapy associated with many side-effects. Some felt healthy whereas others reported persistence of complications as well as <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> other pathologies. However, all participants celebrated an improvement in quality of life. Health caregivers, their social and family support had been essential for their struggle. Participants realised that life after heart transplantation was a continuing process demanding support and structured follow-up for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> their lives. Conclusion. The findings suggest that each individual has unique experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart transplantation process. To go on living participants had to accept changes and adapt: to the organ change, to complications resulting from <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organ, to <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> pills and food restrictions. Relevance to clinical practice. Stimulating a heart transplant patients spontaneous expression about what they are experiencing and granting them <b>the</b> actual status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main character in their own story is important to their care...|$|R
