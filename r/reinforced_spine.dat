50|$|Another longstitch {{technique}} {{is done in}} conjunction with a chain stitch. This particular sewing method is very old and originated in Germany as early as the medieval era. In Szirmai's text, The Archaeology of medieval bookbinding, the author describes this method of bookbinding being used on parchment-covered books with <b>reinforced</b> <b>spines</b> between 1375 and 1500. The sections were sewn directly through holes in the cover material, with two sections being sewn through each row of holes. This allowed the creation of a chain stitch at the first and last sewing stations.|$|R
50|$|Aciculata, {{the most}} active polychaetes, which have parapodia <b>reinforced</b> by {{internal}} <b>spines</b> (aciculae).|$|R
50|$|The term is {{also used}} in bookbinding, where a narrow soutache is applied {{at the top and}} bottom of a book back to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>spine</b> and provide a barrier to keep dust out of the binding.|$|R
50|$|Library binding {{is a way}} to {{increase}} the life of books and periodicals used in libraries. This is done by sewing the pages in place and by <b>reinforcing</b> the <b>spine</b> for each volume. The goal of library binding is long-term preservation. However, library bound books also benefit library patrons by ensuring that the volume in hand is complete, opened with ease, and easy to photocopy.|$|R

50|$|After {{having his}} <b>spine</b> <b>reinforced</b> and regaining mobility, Sir Edmund moved to Gotham, where he wrested {{control of the}} Chinatown {{district}} away from the Triad gangs, revealing himself to be alive, and initially focusing on Robin for revenge (although his memories of the battle in Hong Kong were muddled, he eventually remembered that it was Lady Shiva that was most responsible for his defeat there, although he still remained hostile to Robin). Not long after, however, he lost power in a gang war, with his own Ghost Dragons rebelling and the Triad gangs sending assassins (such as the Silver Monkey of the Brotherhood of the Fist) after him.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the decking was {{strengthened}} {{by adding a}} reinforced concrete slab. In 1990, tests showed the bridge was too weak for many heavy goods vehicles, and traffic was limited to a 7.5 ton maximum. This was increased to 17 tons after the bridge had been strengthened in 1992. The secondary members needed strengthening and this was effected by enhancing the shear strength of the transverse cross beams by bonding steel plates to the web of the cross beams. The longitudinal cross-bracing was {{strengthened by}} using angle splints and {{the space between the}} splints and the cross-bracing was grouted. Additional transverse bracing was supplied by <b>reinforcing</b> the central <b>spine</b> of the arch, with one end bolted to steel sleeves, and the other end bolted to the cross beams {{at the top of the}} arch.|$|R

500|$|The sail of Dimetrodon {{is formed}} by {{elongated}} neural spines projecting from the vertebrae. Each spine varies in cross-sectional shape from its base to its tip {{in what is}} known as [...] "dimetrodont" [...] differentiation. Near the vertebra body, the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape, and closer to the tip, it takes on a figure-eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine. The figure-eight shape is thought to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>spine,</b> preventing bending and fractures. A cross section of the spine of one specimen of Dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure-eight shaped rings close to its center, indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age. The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip, indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail. The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for the epaxial muscles of the back, and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey's fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body. Higher up on the distal (outer) portion of the spine, the bone surface is smoother. The periosteum, a layer of tissue surrounding the bone, is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail.|$|R
