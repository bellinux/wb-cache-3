5|$|Wain's Hotel, 310 Princes St (Category I). Built in 1879 to {{a design}} by Mason & Wales, Wain's Hotel remains Dunedin's grandest hotel building, and {{reflects}} the opulence which followed the Central Otago Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1860s. The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance façade remains largely intact. This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled spandrels {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} European Americans to visit the area were fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Rogue Valley. Neither Ogden nor the {{expedition}} mentioned the Table Rocks. The gold <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 1850s brought many emigrants to the area, and Table Rock City (later renamed Jacksonville) was established several {{miles south of the}} rocks. The sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with the Rogue River Indians. These conflicts turned into warfare, and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end the hostilities. In June 1851, soldiers of the United States Army led by Major Philip Kearny attacked the Takelma near Lower Table Rock, but the Takelma were prepared. One soldier died, and three others were injured. Major Kearny returned with volunteers from Yreka soon after, accompanied by Oregon Territory delegate Joseph Lane. The ensuing Battle of Table Rock lasted 10days, and 30Takelma were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The suburb {{was founded}} by wealthy pioneer William Henry Valpy, and its name {{reflects}} his family connections with the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. Caversham grew rapidly during the Central Otago Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1860s because of its location on routes south to the Otago hinterland. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, Caversham was heavily industrialised, and its population included many skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople. This, combined with the community's strong Protestant roots, led to the area's generally left-leaning political stance. Caversham's early history {{has been the subject of}} the Caversham Project, a major historical and archaeological study by the University of Otago. Caversham was a separate borough until 1904, when it was amalgamated with Dunedin city. It is currently administered as part of the city's South Dunedin ward. At a national level, it is part of the Dunedin South electorate.|$|E

25|$|Williamstown {{had been}} a {{primitive}} settlement until the Victorian gold <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, but after the gold seekers began to arrive, many from the tin mines of Cornwall, and many more from the Californian gold fields, the settlement's growth was phenomenal.

5|$|The Western Australian gold <b>rushes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1890s {{resulted}} in strong economic growth, {{and a massive}} increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and expanding to 184,000 by 1901. The influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.|$|R
25|$|Montana showed much {{precision}} {{and finished the}} game completing 26 of 30 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns.

25|$|Harry Lane {{was born}} in Corvallis, Oregon, a small town {{on the banks of}} the Willamette River, on August 28, 1855. He was the son of Eliza Jane and Nathaniel Lane.

25|$|The gold <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1860s and the {{construction}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which reached Kamloops from the West in 1883, brought further growth, resulting in the City of Kamloops being incorporated in 1893 with a population of about 500. The logging industry of the 1970s brought many Indo-Canadians into the Kamloops area, mostly from the Punjab region of India. In 1973, Kamloops annexed Barnhartvale and other nearby communities.|$|E
25|$|The gold <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850s {{attracted}} {{a wave of}} Jewish immigration, and immigrants soon outnumbered native-born Jews. Initially, they settled in rural areas, {{but by the end}} of the 19th century the lack of Jewish communal connections and fear of assimilation led most Australian Jews in rural areas to relocate to the Jewish centres in cities. As a result, the rapidly growing community in Sydney needed larger facilities, and built the Great Synagogue, located on Elizabeth Street, opposite Hyde Park, which was consecrated in 1878.|$|E

25|$|Waller's {{attack was}} not unexpected, and Prince Maurice had made {{ready to meet}} him. Yet, the first <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebels carried the entrenchments of Speen Hill. Speen itself, though stoutly defended, fell into their hands within an hour, Essex's {{infantry}} recapturing here some of the guns they had had to surrender at Lostwithiel. But meantime, Manchester, {{in spite of the}} entreaties of his staff, had not stirred from Clay Hill. He had already made one false attack early in the morning, and been severely handled, he was aware of his own deficiencies as a general.|$|E
25|$|By 1830, 15.11% of the colonies' total {{population}} were Scots, which increased {{by the middle}} of the century to 25,000, or 20-25% of the {{total population}}. The Australian Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850s provided a further impetus for Scottish migration: in the 1850s 90,000 Scots immigrated to Australia, far more than other British or Irish populations at the time. Literacy rates of the Scottish immigrants ran at 90-95%. By 1860, Scots made up 50% of the ethnic composition of Western Victoria, Adelaide, Penola and Naracoorte. Other settlements in New South Wales included New England, the Hunter Valley and the Illawarra.|$|E

25|$|The {{area around}} the Blue Mounds, Dane County, was first settled in 1828 by Ebenezer Brigham, a {{successful}} lead miner from Massachusetts. He had traveled to Wisconsin {{to join in the}} lead <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1820s. After arriving, he set up operations just north of where the cave lies today. Ebenezer's house later became a trading post, an inn, a stagecoach stop, and the first post office in Dane County. Ebenezer Brigham later became a colonel and helped build and command Fort Blue Mounds during the Blackhawk War. He died after a long life, not knowing that a beautiful cave existed beneath his Brigham Farm.|$|E
25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}}, much of {{the area}} of The Flat was poorly drained and marshy. Early settlement of the area took place along the hill fringes at Caversham and St. Clair. The arrival at St Clair of William Henry Valpy (1793–1852) in 1849 led to the first development of permanent roading in the area; Valpy, reputedly the wealthiest man in New Zealand, had a branch dray road built from Dunedin's central settlement to his St. Clair farm which ran {{along the edge of}} what is now South Dunedin. With the rapid expansion of the city {{at the time of the}} Otago Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1860s, settlement expended, notably around what is now Hillside Road.|$|E
25|$|Hobart's {{first major}} {{problems}} {{came with the}} combination of a general economic downturn in the 1840s, followed by the Victorian gold <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 1850s. Large-scale migration to the Victorian goldfields occurred, creating a shortfall in local labour resources. As a response, the once booming economy of Hobart began to decline. Despite the economic and population declines of the early 1850s, the decade proved to be one of social and cultural advancement for the young city. Transportation of convicts to Van Diemen's Land was abolished in 1853, and calls for responsible self-government were successful, with a new constitution drafted, and Van Diemen's Land became an independent British Colony in 1856. The new colony immediately changed its name to Tasmania, to disassociate itself with its past as a penal colony.|$|E
