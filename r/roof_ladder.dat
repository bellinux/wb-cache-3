50|$|From the {{introduction}} of the Class 5E, Series 1 in 1955, the body shape of the locomotive remained virtually unchanged apart from the roofline on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side, where the Class 5E had a single cut-out in line with the vertical row of three grilles on the body side while the Class 5E1 had an additional cut-out in line with the small window {{to the right of the}} two grilles aft of the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder.</b> All these units had round headlamps and rounded corners on their cab ends.|$|R

50|$|A castle {{was built}} {{there in the}} first half of the thirteenth century, but was {{destroyed}} in 1252. The first houses were built in the late thirteenth century. The oldest known house is' 'the Maioun de Pie' at Safranier. It has no doors or windows; entry is gained thru the <b>roof</b> via <b>ladder.</b>|$|R
50|$|Series 8 {{and later}} {{locomotives}} could {{be distinguished from}} all older models by the large hatch door on each side, below the second small window {{to the right of}} the side door on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side and below the first window immediately {{to the right of the}} door on the other side.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives rebuilt from Class 6E1, Series 2 to 7, have {{part of the}} {{compressed}} air piping sunk into a recess which runs along the left half of the lower edge of the body on the locomotive’s right side, the side opposite the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side. This pipe was not rerouted on locomotives rebuilt from Class 6E1, Series 8.|$|R

50|$|Locomotives {{which were}} rebuilt from Class 6E1, Series 6 and 7, have {{part of the}} {{compressed}} air piping sunk into a recess which runs along {{the rear of the}} lower edge of the body on the locomotive’s right side, the side opposite the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side. On locomotives which were rebuilt from Class 6E1, Series 8 to 11 this pipe was not rerouted.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had two cut-outs on the roofline on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side, but {{an unbroken}} roofline {{on the opposite}} side. Like the predecessor Class 5E, the Class 5E1, Series 1 and 2 had two rectangular access panels on the lower sides above the battery box, but they also had an additional rectangular panel on the lower sides above the second axle from the left.|$|R

50|$|UCW did not {{allocate}} works {{numbers to}} the locomotives they built for Spoornet. On the Class 14E1, the transformer serial numbers are engraved {{in the top}} right corner of a large plate which depicts the circuit diagram of the transformer, mounted below the sill and halfway between the bogies on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side of the locomotive. These serial numbers do not follow the locomotive unit number sequence. Their transformer numbers, last livery and disposal {{are listed in the}} table.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{inscriptions}} {{painted on the}} locomotive sides, the Class Experimental AC locomotive can be visually distinguished from regular Class 6E1 locomotives by the single pantograph on its no. 2 end {{instead of the usual}} two pantographs on both ends, {{as well as by the}} large grilles on the sides. The Class 6E1 has two large grilles to the right of centre on each side while no. E1600 has only one such grille on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side and three on the opposite side.|$|R
50|$|Series 8 was {{the only}} Class 6E1 series with unique visual {{distinguishing}} features. It could be distinguished from all earlier series by its large hatch door on each side, below the second small window {{to the right of}} the side door on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side and below the first window immediately {{to the right of the}} side door on the other side. It could also be distinguished from all subsequent series by the absence of rainwater drainage holes along the lower body sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had two cut-outs on the roofline on the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side, but {{an unbroken}} roofline {{on the opposite}} side. The Series 3, 4 and 5 locomotives could be visually distinguished from earlier series by their three small square access panels on the lower sides above the battery box instead of the two larger rectangular access panels on the Series 1 and 2 locomotives. Like the Series 2, the Series 3 also had an additional rectangular access panel on the lower sides above the second axle from the left.|$|R
50|$|Some visible {{external}} {{differences from}} the originals were side window screens, higher side doors with a curved rainwater gutter above it (not done on E1101) and reinforcing under the side doors and side windows. On the <b>roof</b> access <b>ladder</b> side the cut-outs {{on the roof}} edge were filled in and the units were repainted in the then current Spoornet blue livery with outline numbers, the only Class 5E1s to receive this livery. They were also equipped with driver’s consoles similar to those which were later fitted to the Class 18Es.|$|R
