5|$|The Shuttle is {{the first}} orbital {{spacecraft}} designed for partial <b>reusability.</b> It carries large payloads to various orbits, and, during the Shuttle–Mir and ISS programs, provides crew rotation and carries various supplies, modules and pieces of equipment to the stations. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years' operational life.|$|E
25|$|Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) is {{used for}} Falcon 9 {{launches}} to low Earth and geostationary orbits. SLC-40 is not capable of supporting Falcon Heavy launches, or polar launches. As part of SpaceX's booster <b>reusability</b> program, the former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zone 1, has been designated for use for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} 20th century, many {{of these}} {{techniques}} were expensive and involved {{a small number of}} dedicated craft practitioners, while the <b>reusability</b> of props, models, effects, or animation techniques made it easier to keep using them. The combination of high initial cost and lower maintenance cost pushed producers into building these techniques into the basic concept of a series, influencing all the artistic choices.|$|E
25|$|Maintainability {{includes}} {{concepts of}} modularity, understandability, changeability, testability, <b>reusability,</b> and transferability from one development team to another. These {{do not take}} the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.|$|E
25|$|The {{unmanned}} Shenzhou 8 mission successfully docked with Tiangong-1 on 2 November 2011 GMT, marking China's first orbital docking. Shenzhou 8 undocked from Tiangong-1 on 14 November, before successfully {{completing a}} second rendezvous and docking, thus testing the <b>reusability</b> of the docking system. Shenzhou 8 deorbited on 17 November 2011, and landed intact in Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia. After the mission, the CNSA reported that Tiangong-1's systems were in optimal condition.|$|E
25|$|The Falcon9v1.1 {{includes}} {{several aspects of}} reusable launch vehicle technology included in its design, as of the initial v1.1 launch in September 2013 (throttleable and restartable engines on the first stage, a first-stage tank design that can structurally accommodate the future addition of landing legs, etc.). The Falcon 9 v1.1's launch occurred two years after SpaceX committed to a privately funded development program with the goal to obtain full and rapid <b>reusability</b> of both stages of the launch vehicle.|$|E
500|$|The SpaceX {{reusable}} launch {{system development}} {{program is a}} privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times {{in a manner similar}} to the <b>reusability</b> of aircraft. [...] The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid <b>reusability</b> of space launch vehicles. The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours. [...] SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.|$|E

Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the Unix philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{potential}} users of web templates have the willingness {{and ability to}} hire developers to design a system for their needs. Additionally, some may wish to use the web but have limited or no technical proficiency. For these reasons, a number of developers and vendors have released web templates specifically for reuse by non-technical people. Although web template <b>reusability</b> is also important for even highly skilled and technically experienced developers, it is especially critical to those who rely on simplicity and [...] "ready-made" [...] web solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Bronze statues were {{of higher}} status, but have survived in far smaller numbers, {{due to the}} <b>reusability</b> of metals. They were usually made in the lost wax technique. Chryselephantine, or gold-and-ivory, statues were the cult-images in temples and were {{regarded}} as the highest form of sculpture, but only some fragmentary pieces have survived. [...] They were normally over-lifesize, built around a wooden frame, with thin carved slabs of ivory representing the flesh, and sheets of gold leaf, probably over wood, representing the garments, armour, hair, and other details. In some cases, glass paste, glass, and precious and semi-precious stones were used for detail such as eyes, jewellery, and weaponry. Other large acrolithic statues used stone for the flesh parts, and wood for the rest, and marble statues sometimes had stucco hairstyles. Most sculpture was painted (see below), and much wore real jewellery and had inlaid eyes and other elements in different materials.|$|E
2500|$|The first rubber condom was {{produced}} in 1855, and by the late 1850s several major rubber companies were mass-producing, among other items, rubber condoms. A main advantage of rubber condoms was their <b>reusability,</b> making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, {{by the end of}} the 19th century [...] "rubber" [...] had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world. [...] For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber. [...] The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies.|$|E
2500|$|Recordable CDs {{with even}} greater capacity, {{compatible}} with existing infrastructure of CD-ROM drives, made the expensive new high-capacity floppy technologies obsolete. The floppy disk's remaining <b>reusability</b> advantage was then eliminated by re-writeable CDs. However, writing and rewriting CDs was never as fast or convenient as writing on floppy disks, when the data fits {{on one or}} two floppy disks. Networking, advancements in flash-based devices, and widespread adoption of USB provided another alternative that in turn made both floppy disks and optical storage obsolete for some purposes. The rise of file sharing and multi-megapixel digital photography encouraged the use of files larger than most 3½-inch disks, the largest-capacity standard disks, could hold. Floppy disks were commonly used as sneakernet carriers for file transfer, but the broad availability of LANs and fast Internet connections provided a simpler and faster method of transferring such files, where the air-gapping of a sneakernet is not an important benefit. Other removable storage devices have advantages in both capacity and performance when network connections are unavailable or when networks are inadequate.|$|E
5000|$|The agility {{promised by}} a service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) is usually {{measured in terms}} of the <b>reusability</b> level of its contained services. However, this <b>reusability</b> relates directly to the way the service contract defines service capabilities. A service built on a potentially reusable functional context but with a contract that does not convey this <b>reusability</b> correctly does not achieve its <b>reusability</b> potential.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} reuse relies in an {{essential}} {{way on the}} ability to build larger things from smaller parts, and being able to identify commonalities among those parts. <b>Reusability</b> is often a required characteristic of platform software. <b>Reusability</b> brings several aspects to software development that {{do not need to be}} considered when <b>reusability</b> is not required.|$|E
50|$|Extensibility and <b>reusability</b> {{have many}} {{emphasized}} properties in common, including low coupling, modularity and high cohesion. Software <b>reusability</b> is boosted by extensibility and refers to software elements’ ability to construct for many different software systems, which {{is motivated by}} the observation of software systems often sharing common elements. <b>Reusability</b> together with extensibility allows a technology {{to be transferred to}} another project with less development and maintenance time, as well as enhanced reliability and consistency.|$|E
