This was the cause of the death of my friend Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by loss of blood in carrying him so far.

50|$|Since the {{valuable}} fibres {{are located in}} the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), <b>ropes,</b> <b>yarn,</b> paper, composite materials and burlap. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the fibre node, that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Nowadays, {{pineapple}} {{leaf fibre}} (PALF) {{is getting more}} attention in research area since it’s showed the enhanced properties to be utilized in few industries. From the previous studies, it has been proved that, PALF is mechanically sound as a composites reinforcement agent and it’s showed the good contribution in pulp and papermaking production. Due to its enhanced properties, PALF now is commercialized as an alternative textile fiber. PALF is silky, fine and textile grade. Apart from being used as an alternative fiber for home textile and apparel, PALF meet the basic requirement {{to be used as}} technical fibers. Instead of having a good strength, PALF also have a reasonable length as well as can be pliable. All of these are the main principle of rope making fibers hence make PALF have huge potential to be used as rope making fibers. This paper will present the possibility of converting PALF into textile yarns and then into <b>rope</b> <b>yarns</b> for cordage and rope making. The methodology involved is included PALF extraction, PALF spinning, and PALF twisting. Finally, this paper will present the expected approached for the upcoming work area...|$|R
50|$|Bast fibres are {{processed}} {{for use in}} carpet, <b>yarn,</b> <b>rope,</b> geotextile (netting or matting), traditional carpets, hessian or burlap, paper, sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the non-woven, moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc. From prehistoric times through at least the early 20th century, bast shoes were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe.|$|R

60|$|So we took no Tier-rangers captive, nor any Lumpers, nor Truckers, nor Dredgermen, nor other evil-disposed {{person or}} persons; but went ashore at Wapping, {{where the old}} Thames Police office is now a station-house, and where the old Court, with its cabin windows looking on the river, is a quaint charge room: with nothing worse in it usually than a stuffed cat in a glass case, and a portrait, {{pleasant}} to behold, of a rare old Thames Police officer, Mr. Superintendent Evans, now succeeded by his son. We looked over the charge books, admirably kept, and found the prevention so good that there were not five hundred entries (including drunken and disorderly) in a whole year. Then, we looked into the store-room; where there was an oakum smell, and a nautical seasoning of dreadnought clothing, <b>rope</b> <b>yarn,</b> boat-hooks, sculls and oars, spare stretchers, rudders, pistols, cutlasses, and the like. Then, into the cell, aired {{high up in the}} wooden wall through an opening like a kitchen plate-rack: wherein there was a drunken man, not at all warm, and very wishful to know if it were morning yet. Then, into a better sort of watch and ward room, where there was a squadron of stone bottles drawn up, ready to be filled with hot water and applied to any unfortunate creature who might be brought in apparently drowned. Finally, we shook hands with our worthy friend Pea, and ran all the way to Tower Hill, under strong Police suspicion occasionally, before we got warm.|$|E
