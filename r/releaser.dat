5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone, compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. Dopamine and serotonin were collected using microdialysis, and increases in dopamine and serotonin were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin <b>releaser,</b> with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E

40|$|Monoamine <b>releasers</b> {{constitute}} {{one class}} of drugs currently under investigation as potential agonist medications {{for the treatment}} of cocaine dependence. The efficacy and safety of monoamine <b>releasers</b> as candidate medications may be influenced in part by their relative potency to release dopamine and serotonin, and we reported previously that <b>releasers</b> with approximately 30 -fold selectivity for dopamine versus serotonin release may be especially promising. The present study examined the effects of the <b>releasers</b> benzylpiperazine, (+) phenmetrazine, and 4 -benzylpiperidine, which have 20 - to 48 -fold selectivity in vitro for releasing dopamine versus serotonin. In an assay of cocaine discrimination, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate 0. 4 mg/kg i. m. cocaine from saline in a two-key, food-reinforced procedure. Each of the <b>releasers</b> produced a dose- and time-dependent substitution for cocaine. 4 -Benzylpiperidine had the most rapid onset and shortest duration of action. Phenmetrazine and benzylpiperazine had slower onsets and longer durations of action. In an assay of cocaine self-administration, rhesus monkeys were trained to respond for cocaine injections and food pellets under a second order schedule. Treatment for 7 days with each of the <b>releasers</b> produced a dose-dependent and selective reduction in self-administration of cocaine (0. 01 mg/kg/injection). The most selective effects were produced by phenmetrazine. Phenmetrazine also produced a downward shift in the cocaine self-administration dose effect curve, virtually eliminating responding maintained by a 30 -fold range of cocaine doses (0. 0032 – 0. 1 mg/kg/injection) while having only small and transient effects on food-maintained responding. These findings support the potential utility of dopamine-selective <b>releasers</b> as candidate treatments for cocaine dependence...|$|R

40|$|Agonist therapy ” {{for cocaine}} and methamphetamine {{addiction}} involves administration of stimulant-like medications (e. g., monoamine <b>releasers)</b> to reduce withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. A significant {{problem with this}} strategy is that many candidate medications possess abuse liability because of activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons in the brain. One way to reduce DA-mediated abuse liability of candidate drugs is to add in serotonin (5 -HT) releasing properties, since substantial evidence shows that 5 -HT neurons provide an inhibitory influence over mesolimbic DA neurons. This article addresses several key {{issues related to the}} development of dual DA/ 5 -HT <b>releasers</b> for the treatment of substance use disorders. First, the authors briefly summarize the evidence supporting a dual deficit in DA and 5 -HT function during withdrawal from chronic cocaine or alcohol abuse. Second, the authors discuss data demonstrating that 5 HT release can dampen DA-mediated stimulant effects, and the “antistimulant ” role of 5 -HT 2 C receptors is considered. Next, the mechanisms underlying potential adverse effects of 5 -HT <b>releasers</b> are described. Finally, the authors discuss recently published data with PAL- 287, a novel nonamphetamine DA/ 5 -HT releasing agent that suppresses cocaine self-administration but lacks positive reinforcing properties. It is concluded that DA/ 5 -HT <b>releasers</b> could be useful therapeutic adjuncts for the treatment of cocaine and alcohol addictions, as well as for obesity, attention-deficit disorder, and depression...|$|R

40|$|Monoamine {{transporters}} {{such as the}} dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter- 2 (VMAT- 2) {{are critical}} regulators of DA disposition within the brain. Alterations in DA disposition can lead to conditions such as drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia, a fact that {{underscores the importance of}} understanding DAergic signaling. Psychostimulants alter DAergic signaling by influencing both DAT and VMAT- 2, and although the effects of these drugs result in increased levels of synaptic DA, the mechanisms by which this occurs and the effects that these drugs exert on DAT and VMAT- 2 vary. Many psychostimulants can be classified as <b>releasers</b> (ie, amphetamine analogs) or uptake blockers (ie, cocaine-like drugs) based on the mechanism of their acute effects on neurotransmitter flux through the DAT. <b>Releasers</b> and uptake blockers differentially modulate the activity and subcellular distribution of monoamine transporters, a phenomenon likely related to the neurotoxics potential of these drugs to DAergic neurons. This article will review some of the recent findings whereby <b>releasers</b> and uptake blockers alter DAT and VMAT- 2 activity and how these alterations may be involved in neurotoxicity, thus providing insight on the neuro-degeneration observed in Parkinson’s disease...|$|R

These biocides {{do not appear to}} be frequent or important sensitizers. Even in highly selected patient groups of metalworkers, mean prevalence rates of sensitivity are low: 0. 2 % for Tris(hydroxymethyl) nitromethane, 1. 6 % for tris(N-hydroxyethyl) hexahydrotriazine, 1. 9 % for Bioban (R) P- 1487 and Bioban (R) CS- 1246, and 2. 8 % for Bioban (R) CS- 1135. In the case of the Biobans, many reactions may have been irritant. Only N,N'-methylenebis(5 -methyloxazolidine) has a fairly high mean score of 4. 0 % in metalworkers. With the exception of Bioban (R) P- 1487, there is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to the <b>releasers</b> and formaldehyde sensitivity: 40 - 70 % of reactions to <b>releasers</b> occur in patients sensitive to formaldehyde and may therefore be caused by formaldehyde allergy.

The patch test {{relationship}} between the <b>releasers</b> in cosmetics to formaldehyde contact allergy is reviewed and it is assessed whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals with contact allergy to formaldehyde. There is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers and formaldehyde contact allergy: 15 % of all reactions to 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol and 40 - 60 % of the reactions to the other <b>releasers</b> are caused by a reaction to the formaldehyde in the test material. There is only fragmented data on the amount of free formaldehyde in cosmetics preserved with formaldehyde donors. However, all <b>releasers</b> (with the exception of 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol, for which adequate data are lacking) can, in the right circumstances of concentration and product composition, release > 200 p. p. m. formaldehyde, which may result in allergic contact dermatitis. Whether this is actually the case in any particular product cannot be determined from the ingredient labelling. Therefore, we recommend advising patients allergic to formaldehyde to avoid leave-on cosmetics preserved with quaternium- 15, diazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, or imidazolidinyl urea, acknowledging that many would tolerate some products...|$|R
