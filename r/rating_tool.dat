40|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} over one hundred tools dealing with various aspects of {{sustainability}}. The aspects of sustainability included in the <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> are different, as are the stages at which <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> {{are used in the}} planning and design, and post construction stages of different building types. This paper presents a snapshot of various <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> for sustainability nationally and internationally and presents <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> that are relevant for Australia. The research process was a literature review using various primary and secondary sources, including the internet. The Building Code of Australia determines minimum regulatory standards for buildings nationally. However, there are state based variations covered in the Building Code of Australia Appendices for various jurisdictions around Australia. The paper explains which <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> are required to meet the minimum standards for certification and which represent best practice. The first section is the introduction where the role of the BCA and the ABCB is explained. This is followed by a brief overview of the <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> globally. The next section describes Australian tools and reviews what is available in the residential sector followed by voluntary tools and product and LCA tools. This is followed by discussions and conclusion. A &# 039;Rating Tools Rundown&# 039; is presented as Appendix A, which captures the intent of relevant Australian tools and their applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{community}} {{is the basic}} unit of urban development, and appropriate assessment tools are needed for communities to evaluate and facilitate decision making concerning sustainable community development and reduce the detrimental effects of urban community actions on the environment. Existing research into sustainable community <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> focuses primarily on those that are internationally recognized to describe their advantages and future challenges. However, the differences between <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> due to different regional conditions, situations and characteristics {{have yet to be}} addressed. In doing this, this paper examines three sustainable community <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> in Australia, namely Green Star-Communities PILOT, EnviroDevelopment and VicUrban Sustainability Charter (Master Planned Community Assessment Tool). In order to identify their similarities, differences and advantages these are compared in terms of sustainability coverage, prerequisites, adaptation to locality, scoring and weighting, participation, presentation of results, and application process. These results provide the stakeholders of sustainable community development projects with {{a better understanding of the}} available <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> in Australia and assist with evaluation and decision making...|$|R

A simplified analysis is tabled to highlight the limited direct response of most green building <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> to {{the health and well-being of}} building occupants. Inquiry into this deficit identifies a few salient points as a preamble to a larger discussion of use of <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> to assess effectiveness of sustainability and the impact on ecology.

40|$|AbstractThe current set of {{building}} sustainability <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> developed for application to new building designs focus mainly on technical aspects. Sustainable building developments are usually assessed by use {{of building}} performance indicators, i. e. energy consumption, use of materials and other key features of the buildings reflecting comfort and satisfaction. Such sustainability <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> recently applied mainly for new building designs, however {{there is a need}} to assess the sustainability of measures applied in refurbishment projects. In this case the question of economic feasibility of applied measures appears. Measures differ by sustainability rating and by demand of investment cost for their integration in building design. The paper presents the new approach that let to assess the sustainability and economic utility of refurbishment measures. The proposed approach for eco-efficiency analysis based on application of sustainability <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> (BREEAM and LEED), cost analysis and MCDA methods. The application of proposed approach illustrated on case study that presents the eco-efficiency analysis of refurbishment measures applied in multi-family apartment blocks...|$|R

50|$|Whereas the {{internal}} logic of decision frameworks (choosing) tend to diminish ecosystems and land eco-productivity, eco-logical design (creating) can multiply functions and public benefits synergistically. Eco-positive design involves open systems thinking (i.e. with transparent/permeable boundaries). For example, building <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> {{are based on}} limits or thresholds (borders) and do not contemplate net public gains. Perhaps because of the deeply-embedded historic elevation of rationalist decision-making over design, green building design templates and <b>rating</b> <b>tools</b> are decision-based. Being reductionist, they encourage tradeoffs between costs and benefits or nature and society in physical development. Hence they tend to reduce adaptability, diversity and reversibility.|$|R

We cannot avoid them, but we can minimize the negative impacts of global warming. The green building concept {{is one of the}} methods to minimize the environmental impact. It takes into account principles of sustainable development in planning, construction, operation, and maintenance. Greenship <b>Rating</b> <b>Tools</b> is used to evaluate and calculate green achievements, prior to green building certification. The aim of this research is to represent the perceptions of contractors and consultants toward application of Greenship <b>Rating</b> <b>Tools</b> on apartment buildings in Surabaya. Based on the data obtained from a questionnaires survey carried out to 41 respondents, the mean value ranking method is used to evaluate the main factors of Greenship.
