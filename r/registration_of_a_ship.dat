50|$|The Commonwealth {{does not}} {{recognize}} blasphemy as an offence. In 1991, the Australian Law Reform Commission proposed the removal of all references to blasphemy in federal legislation. All that remains as a law against blasphemy is a prohibition against the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> which has a blasphemous name. This law exists on a more practical level and is to prevent strained relations between Australia and other more religious nations {{and to protect the}} vessel and its occupants from harm whilst in foreign waters. The Australia Criminal Code Act 1995 does not create an offence of blasphemy or blasphemous libel while Chapter 1 section 1.1 of the Act abolishes the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel and the Blasphemy Act 1697.|$|E
50|$|Vessels which travel {{international}}ly or cross international {{borders are}} required to be registered. Registration is not necessary for vessels that travel only in local waters, though some jurisdictions require those vessels to be registered on the national registry. The country <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> is <b>a</b> <b>ship's</b> flag state and determines its nationality as well as which country's laws govern its operation and the behavior of its crew.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{maritime}} norm, the {{nationality of ship}} is authorized with the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> ship by the state concerned, and the ship registered is allowed to fly {{the flag of the}} state. The Japanese legislation for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> ship requires that the nationality of the ship shall be genuinely linked with the nationality of owner(s) of the ship, and does not allow a bareboat chartered-out vessel to the foreign state to temporarily terminate the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the ship in Japan. Under the regime of EEZ, many Japanese far seas fishing vessels(FSFVs) were decommissioned or forced to transfer of ownership to the coastal state if they wanted continuation of fishing operation in the EEZ of coastal states concerned, which led drastic reduction of Japanese FSFVs. The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea(1982) which stipulates the status of ships in Article 92 does not regulate the linkage between nationality and ownership of ship, and the United Nations Convention on Conditions for <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Ships(1986), while not in force, clearly recognizes the case <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the bareboat chartered-in ship. Some States(Canada, New Zealand, England, etc.) allow the bareboat chartered-in vessel to register it with their <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>As</b> the shortterm bareboat chartered-out would be one of breakthroughs for the plight of Japanese FSFVs loosing opportunity in the high seas, it is keenly requested that Japanese policy <b>of</b> ship <b>registration</b> allows temporary termination <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> Japanese ship for bareboat chartered-out...|$|R
