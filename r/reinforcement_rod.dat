5000|$|In December 2003, Suggs {{was charged}} with Felony Aggravated Assault {{stemming}} from a March 2003 incident in Arizona. Reports accused Suggs of assaulting {{a man with a}} piece of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rod</b> and attacking another man {{in the parking lot of}} Phoenix Municipal Stadium after a basketball tournament. Suggs' brother was accused of hitting a man with a baseball bat in the same altercation. [...] His accuser Jeryme Cook stated that the fight began with words exchanged between Cook and Rico Suggs, the football player’s cousin, but they went their separate ways. Reports stated that Terrell Suggs later showed up courtside of a game that Cook and his friends Anthony Henrie and Casey Cothern were watching. Allegedly, Terrell Suggs held a baseball bat to his shoulder, and was with Rico Suggs, brother Donald Suggs and two other men. Cook stated that after exchanging words with Suggs he and his friends walked away, but the Suggs group kept following them around the tournament grounds and eventually to the parking lot, where Cook said he figured he was going to have to fight Rico Suggs. Cook stated that at one point Terrell Suggs handed his kid brother the baseball bat and said, [...] "If anyone jumps in you swing the bat to kill, not to hurt". A witness stated that Donald Suggs then stuck the bat close to Cook’s face. Cook said he swatted the bat away with his hand, turned to calm Henrie, and then saw Terrell Suggs take a swing that broke his nose and cheekbone. In June 2005, Suggs was acquitted of the charges. Juror Richard Tudor stated, [...] "Charges could have gone either way on it, the case wasn't investigated enough to prove either way. It's supposed to be guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and they just couldn't prove that”. Suggs had faced a 5-year prison sentence if convicted.|$|E

Fibersteel rod is composed of seven pre-impregnated rods twisted into a spiral shape to act as a substitute for steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rod</b> in concrete;A polycarbonate matrix which had been solvent treated was tested according to Rockwell Hardness Test (ASTM 785). An 80 % glass loading was achieved by implementing a resin wet-out tank, which contains rollers designed to spread and submerge fibers in a polycarbonate/solvent solution. Percent of glass loading was obtained according to Ignition Test (ASTM 2584). Prototype pultrusion and pulforming equipment was designed and built at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa;There were significant differences among all different temperature and speed combinations for the Rockwell Hardness on the polycarbonate matrix.

40|$|Evaporation of the {{swimming}} pool water into the indoor air causes penetration of the water vapour containing chlorine derivatives into the enclosure structures and corrosion of the reinforcement due {{to the presence of}} dissolved chlorine derivatives in the water. Water vapour migration through outdoor and indoor enclosures is intensive in the cold season, but it may also occur in the warm season. Bearing elements of outdoor and indoor enclosures are now made of the reinforced concrete that has fillers — Portland cement or other types of cement and steel, metal (steel) bars of different diameters. In “ideal” conditions, the concrete must stop corrosion of the steel reinforcement, but it does not happen this way in practice, as corrosion of the reinforcement is influenced by a number of factors. The concentration of chlorides that diffuse into the concrete is lower than the concentration of chlorides in the concrete, but their corrosive influence is higher because of their “non-free” condition. The authors describe the causes and results of corrosion of the steel reinforcement caused by derivatives of chlorine and boosted by the gaseous regime inside {{the swimming}} pool building. Analysis of the cases of influence of the water containing 3 % of chlorine onto the corrosion of reinforced Portland cement aimed at the reduction of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rod</b> diameter is performed. Corrosion of bearing structures causes the loss of strength and durability of buildings, and this process is unsafe from the viewpoint of security of people.

40|$|The author proposes several {{structural}} solutions {{aimed at}} the reinforcement of monolithic floor slabs by means of fastening metal stripes {{onto the surface of}} slabs, laying supplementary <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rods</b> inside indents and attaching them by dowels. The author describes a force redistribution pattern identified in the course of analysis of monolithic floor slabs of buildings that have a wall design system. The author provides recommendations concerning the method of trial loading designated for the assessment of the true bearing capacity of floor slabs of residential buildings. The monolithic nature of reinforced slabs is attained by supplementary dowel connections. The dowel joint of old and new concrete elements takes the transverse shearing force in the event of bending to assure the monolithic behaviour of elements. Efficient behaviour of a monolithic slab is attained by means of a reliable connection between supplementary <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rods</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rods</b> inside slabs. Elements made of composite materials have been recently applied to strengthen reinforced concrete structures. These materials are basically composed of polymer tars and reinforcement materials (glass fiber, carbon and aramid fibers).

40|$|Repair and/or {{upgrading}} {{of concrete}} structures with bonded steel or FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymers) materials or {{by use of}} external tendons {{have been used for}} some time. In most cases the bonded on FRP materials are unstressed. However if prestressing could be applied better utilization of the strengthening material and a better strengthening result would most likely be achieved. More research is carried out in the area of repair and upgrading of concrete structures with prestressed FRP materials. Bonding prestressed FRP laminates or sheets to a concrete surface has proven to be efficient and also gives a better utilization of the strengthening material used. External prestressed cables of FRP materials have shown to be an alternative to steel cables in, for example, upgrading concrete structures. Good durability properties and a first-rate behaviour in creep and relaxation have given very good results so far. One weak part for both external prestressed cables as well as bonded laminates has shown to be anchorage. For cables this is due to lower lateral properties of the cables compared to the axial properties and for laminates due to the high peeling stresses at the cut off end of the laminate. Often the anchorage device has problem to handle the high stresses that would justify the use of FRP materials in prestressing, i. e. the stress that can be achieved due to the anchorage is not high enough. However this is changing with a number of research projects around the world focusing on the anchorage issue where a number of anchorage details have been developed The research presented in this thesis is focused on strengthening concrete structures with prestressed CFRP rods bonded in slots in the concrete cover. The prestressing force was transferred to the concrete via adhesive bond only; no mechanical anchorage was used during the tests. Three factors were varied during the tests; prestressing force, bond length (i. e. length of the rod) and stiffness of the rod. The results from the tests show a increased concrete cracking load as well as a increased steel yielding load. The thesis consists of a main body and three papers.

Nevertheless, in certain applications, such as ocean platforms and long-span bridges, the need higher for durability and toughness concrete because important and must be given appropriate attention. Structures from LWC mixture can design to have similar strength and mechanical characteristic as in normal concrete. To achieve higher structural carrying capacity, steel fiber was be added to EPS lightweight aggregate. This research paper evaluates the pull out strength of lightweight concrete mix and <b>reinforcement</b> steel <b>rod.</b> Poison’s Ratio and Modulus of Elasticity also determined in this paper. Three different series eas made, label as Series A, Series B and Series C. Series A is defined as control sample, Series B is concrete mix containing 30 % of EPS, and Series C is concrete mix containing 30 % of EPS with 0. 5 % of steel fiber. Two different tests were carried out by using lOOOkN UTM machine with same dimension of cylindrical sample size 150 mm x 300 mm. All the testing methods are in accordance to American Standard Test and Material, ASTM. Maximum pull out strength was achieved by 30 % EPS mix proportion, 174. 539 kPa. Maximum Modulus of Elasticity was achieved by 30 % EPS with 0. 5 % steel fiber and Poison’s Ratio value is 0. 17...|$|R
