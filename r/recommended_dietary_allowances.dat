5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowances</b> (RDAs), or Adequate Intakes (AIs) {{for when}} there is not {{sufficient}} information to set EARs and RDAs. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes. The current AI for potassium for women and men ages 14 and up is 4700mg. AI for pregnancy equals 4700mg/day. AI for lactation equals 5100mg/day. For infants 0–6 months 400mg, 6–12 months 700mg, 1–13 years increasing from 3000 to 4500 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL established.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowances</b> (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day.

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowances</b> (RDAs) for {{molybdenum}} in 2000. If {{there is}} not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for molybdenum for people ages 19 and up is 34 μg/day. The RDA is 45 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 50 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 50 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the RDA increases with age from 17 to 43 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of molygdenum the UL is 2000 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).|$|E

25|$|In 1941, {{the wheat}} {{industry}} began to adopt voluntary widespread enrichment (fortification) of wheat flour with vitamins, folic acid, and iron, {{the outcome of}} a recommendation by the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, charged with investigating the causes of poor health among many World War II recruits. By 1942, some 75 percent of breads in the United States were fortified. Mandatory fortification requirements went into effect in 1943, following the publication of the first U.S. government <b>recommended</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>allowances.</b> The removal of naturally occurring nutrients that occurs in grain processing led to a number of diseases caused by nutritional deficiency, including beriberi, pellagra, neural tube defect, and iron deficiency anemia.

40|$|ABSTRACT Zinc intakes {{of low-income}} {{pregnant}} women of Mexican descent were {{estimated by the}} use of 24 -hr dietary recalls. Recalls were obtained during the first two trimesters for 344 women and again during the third trimester of pregnancy for 279 of the same women. The daily mean zinc intake was calculated as 9. 4 ± 3. 8 mg during the first two trimesters and as 10. 0 ± 4. 3 mg during the third trimester. For about 85 % of the women, the reported intakes were below two-thirds of the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> for zinc. In a subsample of the women, no significant correlation was shown between low dietary zinc intakes and low serum zinc levels during either early or late pregnancy. Zinc and protein intakes were highly correlated in both early and late pregnancy (r = 0. 83 and 0. 89, respectively). Diets that provided 90 to 100 g of protein (about 125 % of the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance)</b> provided a mean of 13. 6 g of zinc (67 % of the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance).</b> Am.
