Decomposition and nutrient release from mulch were studied using fine-mesh litterbags with five different leguminous species and the natural fallow vegetation as control. Samples from each treatment were analyzed for total C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, cellulose content and soluble polyphenol at different sampling times {{over the course of}} one year. The decomposition rate constant varied with species and time. Weight loss from the decomposed litter bag material after 96 days was 30. 1 % for Acacia angustissima, 32. 7 % for Sclerolobium paniculatum, 33. 9 % for Iinga edulis and the Fallow vegetation, 45. 2 % for Acacia mangium and 63. 6 % for Clitoria racemosa. Immobilization of N and P was observed in all studied treatments. Nitrogen mineralization was negatively correlated with phenol, C-to-N ratio, lignin + phenol/N ratio, and phenol/phosphorus ratios and with N content in the litterbag material. After 362 days of field incubation, an average (of all treatments), 3. 3 % K, 32. 2 % Ca and 22. 4 % Mg remained in the mulch. Results confirm that low quality and high amount of organic C as mulch application are limiting for the quantity of energy available for microorganisms and increase the nutrient immobilization for biomass decomposition, which results in competition for nutrients with the crop plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of short rotation Desmodium distortum planted fallow on maize grain yield and soil properties, an experiment was conducted over four consecutive years (1995 - 1998) at two locations (Minkoameyos in the humid forest zone and Ntui in the forest-savannah transition zone) in Centre Cameroon. The experimental design for each year was made of four replications and three treatments: i) Natural Fallow used as control (NF), ii) Desmodium Fallow (DF) and iii) Soybean (Glycine max) Rotation (SR). Maize (Zea mays) was used as plant test and was planted {{each year in the}} first cropping season (March-June) followed by each treatment from July to February. The analysis of variance and mean separation (Tukey's HSD) were used to evaluate the effects of treatments on maize yield and soil chemical properties {{at the end of the}} experiment. No treatment could produce relatively more than the first year of the experiment where maize yields were based on 7 - 8 year-old natural fallow in both sites. However, in Minkoameyos, there was a significant difference (p= 0. 043) between the treatments in the fourth year. Desmodium plots out-yielded both natural fallow and soybean plots. In Ntui, there was a highly significant difference (p= 0. 000) among treatments in the third and fourth years. Desmodium plots also outyielded both natural fallow and soybean plots; while natural fallow plots out-yielded soybean plots. The general trend of productivity was ranked as: DF> NF> SR. Apart from the available P that has shown a highly significant difference (p= 0. 000) compared to the initial value and to other treatments, no other significant difference was noticed with other soil properties in both sites. However, the general trend is that most soil chemical properties tended to decrease excepted pH water and available phosphorus. The study has shown that, in forest-savannahâ€“transition zone (Ntui), Desmodium distortum had highly significant effect on maize grain yield from the third year while in the forest zone (Minkoameyos), the effect of Desmodium was significant from the fourth year. This therefore, suggests that the Desmodium shrub has a potential for improving plant nutrient availability in these soils when used in short <b>rotational</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{agricultural}} technologies {{have had an impact}} in the humid forest zone remains questionable as adoption levels have been low. The technologies developed emphasized on maintaining soil fertility and crop yields in short <b>fallow</b> <b>systems.</b> This chapter defines the problems and opportunities of commercialization of cassava (Manihot esculenta) production in the forest margins of peri-urban Cameroon. Cassava is the chief subsistence staple and mainly produced extensively in traditional mixed food crop fields in a short fallow rotation. The fallow period is mostly around 2 - 4 years with natural regrowth typically dominated by Chromolaena odorata (Ngobo et aI., 2004). The urban demand for cassava products is currently higher than the supply which improves cassava income generation potential and justifies the development of more commercially orientated fields. Yet intensification levels are low and yields are generally far below the potential attainable. Observed production increments have been mainly based on increased cassava growing area. Data from farmer interviews and group discussions in three villages in peri-urban Yaounde indicate that technologies for sustainable intensification of cassava production should target both pre- and post-harvest activities. They should focus on reduced labour requirements and pest and disease management. The technology proposed therefore re-emphasizes on returns to labour as a parameter of success and includes the involvement of farmers in technology testing. A commercial cassava field with a <b>rotational</b> Pueraria <b>fallow</b> <b>system</b> is discussed as a basic design. To ensure appropriateness and subsequently a higher adoption potential and hence higher impact, the system has built-in flexibility for further on-farm adaptations.

The simple random sampling technique, using the table of random digits and availability sampling method were respectively employed to select settlements and farmers for investigations. Structured interview was utilized to generate data for the study. In order to capture the inputs to land in the study area, the level of agricultural land-use intensity was measured, using three surrogates, namely, proportion of farmland cultivated, frequency of cultivation and crop combination level. The study results showed that Obagaji area is a mixed cropping region where semi permanent cultivation with <b>rotational</b> bush <b>fallow</b> <b>system</b> dominates the existing cultivation systems. The characteristic features of agricultural practices in households with low number of family members in the area are: more extensive land-use systems, more of shifting elements than permanent cultivation, only very small proportion of land is under cultivation at any one time and very short cropping period on the field. The reverse is true for households with high number of family members. The direct variation in intensity of agricultural land use with regards to family size in the area is significant...|$|R

The study plots were at Mbaise, a densely populated area of southeastern Nigeria, where farmers regenerate their exhausted soils by maintaining planted fallows of Dactyladenia barteri (Hook.

The effect of three years of fallow on the weed flora of arable fields in the two <b>fallow</b> management <b>systems</b> differed remarkably. The first flush of weeds on fields that were cultivated after three years of planted D. barteri fallow (Mbaise) consisted of 80 % broadleaf weeds, 7 % grass weeds and 13 % sedges.

Annual biomass production of hedgerow prunings during cropping phases ranged from zero (D. barteri) to 3. 4 Mg haâ€“ 1 (S. spectabilis). During the growth of groundnut and maize, hedgerows produced < 1 Mg haâ€“ 1 in 1998, < 0. 6 Mg haâ€“ 1 in 2001 and < 0. 8 Mg haâ€“ 1 at any individual pruning. Combined relative crop yields over the three cycles were lower in planted fallow than in the no-tree control.

The planted <b>fallow</b> hedgerow <b>system</b> appears unsuitable to improve crop yields because the nutrient supply from prunings is low due to their low biomass production.

Total aboveground biomass production of P. phaseoloides was 7. 45 Mg haâˆ’ 1, 4. 2 times higher than F. macrophylla (1. 78 Mg haâˆ’ 1; P < 0. 05). In two years (24 MAP), the soil bulk density under P. phaseoloides, F. macrophylla and the natural regrowth in both bush and forest land use systems decreased (P < 0. 05). Within the same period, there was a general improvement in aggregate stability. The particle size distribution changed over 3 years (36 MAP), such that at 0 â€“ 10 cm depth, the percent sand content had reduced whiles the percent clay content had increased under all the <b>fallow</b> <b>systems</b> in both bush and forest land use systems (LUSs). Soil N also increased significantly (P < 0. 05) after cropping under all the <b>fallow</b> <b>systems</b> in both LUS.

Soil P also decreased after cropping under all the <b>fallow</b> <b>systems</b> in both LUS whereas decrease in Mg was only observed under P. phaseoloides. F. macrophylla had Mg content after cropping similar to the initial in both LUS.

The same species also showed good self-regeneration after a maize crop but were surpassed by other species with respect to nitrogen concentration and digestibility. The observed properties of the forage legumes are discussed with respect to their relative importance for the targeted <b>fallow</b> <b>system,</b> and management alternatives are considered.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} an improved <b>fallow</b> <b>system</b> based on forage legumes, the potential interest of crop-livestock farmers in enhancing soil fertility restoration and dry-season feed supply was assessed during a socio-economic study on 11 farms of settled agro-pastoralists in the subhumid zone of West Africa. Simultaneously, eight farmers in the group participated in simple and largely farmer-managed on-farm experiments testing the establishment of selected forage legumes on fallow land. In addition to agronomic parameters, the participatory approach included an evaluation of the technology by farmers both during farm visits and field days. With cropping and dry-season feeding strategies increasingly being limited by land availability, the agronomic performance of some of the tested legume species, in particular Stylosanthes guianensis, promised substantial productivity gains once they could be integrated into the traditional <b>fallow</b> <b>system.</b> The major concerns of the farmers were animal health and labour supply for cropping activities, rather than soil fertility and feed constraints. The need for initial weed control within most of the legume species, therefore, limited their acceptability by farmers at this early stage of innovation testing. Nevertheless, farmers' interest grew remarkably {{in the course of the}} study. Options for the selection of appropriate species and management practices, which aimed at facilitating the establishment of legumes on fallow land, are discussed as a means of enhancing further adoption of the innovation...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to reduce}} soil erosion, {{maximize}} soil water conservation, and optimize grain production in dryland cropping systems in the Central Great Plains has culminated in development of nontilled <b>fallow</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems have greatly reduced the degree of soil disturbance, and the amount and degree of residue incorpora-tion. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the influence of soil disturbance and residue management on soil temperature, soil water, and winter wheat (Triticum mstivum L.) growth. Two field studies were established in 1981 and 1982 on an Alliance silt loam (Fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aridic Argiustoll) with treatments con-sisting of various degrees of soil disturbance (moldboard plow, tan-dem disk, and no tillage), residue incorporation (on the soil surface or incorporated), and amount of residue applied (0. 0,O. S, and 1. 0 of that produced by the previous crop). Decreased soil disturbance (til...|$|R
40|$|In the High Andes of Bolivia, sectoral <b>fallow</b> <b>systems</b> are {{a common}} form of land use. Fields {{in the study area}} (Japo, Department of Cochabamba) are {{cultivated}} for three years with potatoes as the first crop and then lie fallow for nine years. Despite the low nutrient content of the soil and the high elevation of the area (between 4000 and 4500 m above sea level), farmers achieve relatively high yields. This is explained by traditional knowledge about soil fertility management. The study focuses on nutrient dynamics over a 12 -year cycle. A participatory research approach was applied to obtain [...] ...|$|R

Much of this land was farmed under the bush <b>fallow</b> <b>system,</b> whereby land is left idle {{for a period of time}} to allow natural regeneration of soil fertility. 18 million hectares were classified as permanent pasture, but had the potential to support crops. Most of the 20 million hectares covered by forests and woodlands are believed to have agricultural potential.|$|R
40|$|The slash-and-burn {{practice}} of land preparation that farmers use traditionally in forest-based <b>fallow</b> <b>systems</b> in the humid tropics causes land degradation {{and human health}} hazards. As an alternative to slash-and-burn, a mechanized, fire-free method of land preparation was evaluated on smallholdings in the eastern Amazon region. The use of machinery for harvesting fallow vegetation and chopping it for mulch {{eliminates the need for}} hard labor and fire for land clearing and increases labor productivity. Four different tractor-propelled choppers with power demand of 50 kW to 122 kW were tested. Their chopping capacity varied between 4. 5 Mg and 20 Mg of fresh biomass per hour. The mechanized chop-and-mulch technology can be used in fallow vegetation that is up to 12 years old, which in the study region corresponded to 20 Mg to 150 Mg fresh biomass per hectare. Two additional choppers ? a stationary silage chopper and a high-powered crawler tractor with a chopping device ? were also tested but both were not suitable for smallholder <b>fallow</b> <b>systems.</b> In the context of the mulch technology, new low-input crop varieties were screened and their response to fertilizer was studied. The mulch technology facilitates extended cropping, to plant crops off-season, and modify crop rotation. Degraded fallow vegetation can be improved by enrichment planting using fast-growing leguminous tree species. Financial analysis of different scenarios revealed that farm income and labor productivity from chop-and-mulch systems can be up to two times greater than from the traditional slash-and-burn system. 200...|$|R
