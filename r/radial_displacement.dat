The equations of the <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> of the flexible ring and the output torque for the actuator are deduced for three different situations: only considering electrostatic force, considering electrostatic and van der Waals forces, and considering electrostatic and the Casimir forces. The effects of van der Waals or the Casimir force on the <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> of the flexible ring and the output torque for the actuator are analyzed.

However these discrepancies do not necessarily prove the existence of secular variations; in the binary model, they can be interpreted mainly in terms of the Ovenden effect.

40|$|The {{stability}} {{coefficients for}} quasi-adiabatic pulsations for {{a model in}} thermal imbalance are evaluated using the dynamical energy (DE) approach, the total (kinetic plus potential) energy (TE) approach, and the small amplitude (SA) approaches. From a comparison among the methods, {{it is found that}} there can exist two distinct stability coefficients under conditions of thermal imbalance as pointed out by Demaret. It is shown that both the TE approaches lead to one stability coefficient, while both the SA approaches lead to another coefficient. The coefficient obtained through the energy approaches is identified as the one which determines the stability of the velocity amplitudes. For a prenova model with a thin hydrogen-burning shell in thermal imbalance, several radial modes are found to be unstable both for <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> and for velocity amplitudes. However, a new kind of pulsational instability also appears, viz., while the <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> are unstable, the velocity amplitudes may be stabilized through the thermal imbalance terms...|$|R

As the nut is threaded on, the displaced sections are elastically forced back axially to their original position, the load increasing the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action. These nuts retain their locking action at temperatures limited only by the base material, as no polymeric insert is used, and as the locking action is by elastic deformation, they can be re-used multiple times. They may look similar, but differ substantially from the split beam nut because the former has a <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> of the deformed portion, while the Philidas nut uses axial deflection or depitching.|$|E
40|$|In modern manufacturing, cutting forces {{measurement}} is a {{key element}} in understanding the operational conditions during machining. Nevertheless, in some cases, the use of dynamometers can be problematic, for instance in case of thin-walled workpieces in presence of instabilities: due to the presence of resonances in the frequency response of the dynamometer itself can induce significant perturbations in the measured signals. This was the case for [1]: the addition of the dynamic system of the dynamometer can modify the conditions of the chatter onset. In the present paper, we address the problem of quasi-static evaluation of the cutting force during turning cylindrical shells. The cutting force components are estimated indirectly, from the displacement measurements, {{with the help of the}} flexibility matrix, based on the elastic behavior of the structure. First, we find the relation between the applied concentrated force components and <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> of the points, which <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> are actually measured.

5000|$|Camera cranes may be small, medium, or large, {{depending}} on the load capacity and length of the loading arm. Historically, the first camera crane provided for lifting the chamber together with the operator, and sometimes an assistant. The range of motion of the boom was restricted {{because of the high}} load capacity and the need to ensure operator safety. In recent years a camera crane boom tripod with a remote control has become popular. It carries on the boom only a movie or television camera without an operator and allows shooting from difficult positions as a small load capacity makes it possible to achieve a long reach of the crane boom and relative freedom of movement. The operator controls the camera from the ground through a motorized panoramic head, using remote control and video surveillance by watching the image on the monitor. A separate category consists of telescopic camera cranes. These devices allow setting an arbitrary trajectory of the camera, eliminating the characteristic jib crane <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> that comes with traditional spanning shots.|$|E
5000|$|The pitch {{diameter}} (PD, or D2) {{of a particular}} thread, internal or external, is the diameter of a cylindrical surface, axially concentric to the thread, which intersects the thread flanks at equidistant points, when viewed {{in a cross-sectional plane}} containing the axis of the thread, the distance between these points being exactly one half the pitch distance. Equivalently, a line running parallel to the axis and a distance D2 away from it, the [...] "PD line," [...] slices the sharp-V form of the thread, having flanks coincident with the flanks of the thread under test, at exactly 50% of its height. We have assumed that the flanks have the proper shape, angle, and pitch for the specified thread standard. It is generally unrelated to the major (D) and minor (D1) diameters, especially if the crest and root truncations of the sharp-V form at these diameters are unknown. Everything else being ideal, D2, D, & D1, together, would fully describe the thread form. Knowledge of PD determines the position of the sharp-V thread form, the sides of which coincide with the straight sides of the thread flanks: e.g., the crest of the external thread would truncate these sides a <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> D - D2 away from the position of the PD line.|$|E

5000|$|Certain cams can be {{characterized}} by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a roller follower (a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end) would make as the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is {{the motion of the}} follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the follower is at rest, and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.However, the most common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large shaft diameters relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the tip circle.

Methods: In this study, 37 patients received MATs: 16 MATs (10 lateral and 6 medial) were inserted by an open soft-tissue technique (open MATs), whereas 21 MATs (14 lateral and 7 medial) were implanted by an arthroscopic bone tunnel procedure (arthroscopic MATs). <b>Radial</b> <b>displacement,</b> in millimeters, was evaluated 1 year postoperatively on 1. 5 -T magnetic resonance images. The number of MATs with <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> larger or smaller than 3 mm was determined. To compare <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> of open versus arthroscopic MATs, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Results: The <b>radial</b> <b>displacement</b> of open lateral and medial MATs was significantly larger (all reported P <. 02) {{than that of}} arthroscopic MATs.

In a second part, the influence of <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> on the â parameter will be examined, according to a previous idea of Bolshakov and Pharr.

To take into account the fact that in most elastoplastic materials the equivalent indenters used during unloading are rather in the form of paraboloids than cones, as in the well known method of Oliver and Pharr, this case will be examined in details. A simple formula will be also proposed for the calculation of the <b>radial</b> <b>displacements</b> in the case of indenters described by polynoms or obeying power laws with non integer exponents. The conclusions concerning equivalent indenters in the form of paraboloids are then compared with preliminary experimental results obtained with a new indenters made of a cube-corner terminated by a Berkovich part.
