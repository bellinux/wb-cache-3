Within the statistical uncertainties, our MZ relation agrees with the z approx. 2. 3 result, particularly since our somewhat higher metallicities (by around 0. 1 dex) are qualitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift (z = 1. 76) of our sample. For the masses probed by our data, the MZ relation shows a steep slope which is suggestive of feedback from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizing evolution where high mass galaxies reach the local MZ <b>relation</b> <b>at</b> earlier times. In addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation of the star-forming main sequence (the SFR-M <b>relation)</b> <b>at</b> this redshift. This result indicates that grism emission-line selected samples do not have preferentially high star formation rates (SFRs). Finally, we report no evidence for evolution of the mass-metallicity-SFR plane; our stack-averaged measurements show excellent agreement with the local relation...|$|R

5|$|In Egypt Darius built many {{temples and}} {{restored}} {{those that had}} previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a Zoroastrian, he built temples dedicated to the Gods of the Ancient Egyptian religion. Several temples found were dedicated to Ptah and Nekhbet.

The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphs. To construct these monuments Darius employed a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the empire's economy and improved inter-cultural <b>relations.</b> <b>At</b> the time of Darius's death construction projects were still under way.
