5000|$|Drohobych wrote a {{treatise}} {{about the}} solar eclipse {{that took place}} on July 29, 1478. He suggested that cosmic events of this nature {{may or may not}} have favorable effects on events on Earth but they certainly would not cause catastrophes. In the early 1480s, Italy was at the forefront of book printing. Initially all publications were of a religious nature, however books about astronomy, botany, and geography had been growing in popularity, too. In 1483 Drohobych published in Rome his first book in Latin [...] "Prognostic Estimation of the year 1483" [...] (Iudicium Pronosticon Anni MCCCCLXXXIII Currentis). It was a nineteen-page publication of astrological (zodiac) calendars, which were popular at that time, that helped its <b>readers</b> to <b>make</b> <b>predictions</b> about events on Earth depending on the planets' positions. This publication had several noteworthy elements: Drohobych gave accurate predictions for two lunar eclipses; he provided accurate calculations of the phases of the Moon; and he also touched upon the subject of planetary movement. Furthermore, he indicated that the geographic coordinates were an important factor in determining the sun's and planets' positions. Depending on the geographic location of the observer, the positions of cosmic objects would vary. His longitude calculations were not error-free, however. He deserves credit for being the first Eastern European scholar who in a printed publication indicated the exact geographic coordinates of several Ukrainian, Polish, and Lithuanian cities.|$|R

Participants read high-cloze sentence contexts (e. g., “The student {{is going to the}} library to borrow a…”), followed by a word that was predictable (book), form-related (hook) or semantically related (page) to the predictable word, or unrelated (sofa). At a 500 ms SOA (Experiment 1), semantically related words, but not form-related words, elicited a reduced N 400 compared to unrelated words. At a 700 ms SOA (Experiment 2), semantically related words and form-related words elicited reduced N 400 effects, but the effect for form-related words occurred in very high-cloze sentences only. At both SOAs, form-related words elicited an enhanced, post-N 400 posterior positivity (Late Positive Component effect). The N 400 effects suggest that readers can pre-activate meaning and form information for highly predictable words, but form pre-activation is more limited than meaning pre-activation. The post-N 400 LPC effect suggests that participants detected the form similarity between expected and encountered input. Pre-activation of word forms crucially depends upon the time that <b>readers</b> have to <b>make</b> <b>predictions,</b> in line with production-based accounts of linguistic prediction...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a project undertaken {{to investigate the}} business case and drivers for Building lnformation Modeling (BIM) in an Australian context. In a semi-structured approach, many key personnel from five case study projects were interviewed in detail to help ascertain which, if any, crucial factors appear to be driving and/or inhibiting the successful adoption of BIM amongst Australian architectural, engineering, construction and facility management organisations. The results of the case studies showed that there are variations in the business case for BIM from one project to another, and no single, consistent business case could be produced. The business case is far too specific {{in terms of the}} individual projects, companies and technologies for a universal business case to be meaningful. However, the results did offer significant value to organisations desiring to analyse their own business case for BIM implementation by; advancing a framework {{that can be used to}} assemble business cases for future BIM implementation initiatives; by providing much information and opinion that will help <b>readers</b> <b>make</b> more informed <b>predictions</b> of their business case outcomes; and by indicating the degree of consensus around BIM business case issues through comparison of the results or all the case studies, the cross-study analysis evaluated the extent of agreement for a wide range of theoretical propositions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{semantic}} {{science is}} {{to allow for the}} publications of ontologies, observation data, and hypotheses/theories. Hypotheses <b>make</b> <b>predictions</b> on data and on new cases. Those hypotheses that fit the available evidence are called theories. This paper considers how thoeries can be used for predictions in new cases. Theories are typically very narrow and not all of the inputs to a theory are observed, so to <b>make</b> <b>predictions</b> on a particular case, many theories need to be used. Without any global design, the available theories do not necessarily fit together nicely. This paper explains how theories can be combined into theory ensembles to <b>make</b> <b>predictions</b> on a particular case. This is needed to evaluate theories, and to <b>make</b> useful <b>predictions.</b> We motivate and give desiderata for theory ensembles for level 1, feature-based, semantic science, which assumes that the data and the theories can be described in terms of features (random variables) ...|$|R
