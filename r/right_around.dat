5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived <b>right</b> <b>around</b> the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{received}} Magruder's {{calls for}} reinforcement and instructed Huger to let Ransom go support the men trapped {{on the field}} of battle. He also sent orders to the brigades of Brig. Gens. Joseph B. Kershaw and Paul Jones Semmes, in Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division within Magruder's command. Robert Ransom's unit, after they finally showed up with Huger's permission, first attempted to charge straight up the hill, following the path of other Confederate brigades attempting to aid Magruder. When this proved useless, Ransom ordered them to regroup in the woods to the Confederate right, march double-time a half a mile in a hook to the <b>right</b> <b>around</b> all the other Confederate units and attack the far Union western flank. While Ransom was angling west, Jackson responded to a request for reinforcement from D. H. Hill by sending forward brigades from his own command to move from the east into the area where D. H. Hill had attacked. From his own division Jackson sent Brig. Gens. Alexander Lawton and Charles S. Winder, and from Ewell's division, Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble and Cols. Leroy A. Stafford and Jubal Early.|$|E

5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs <b>right</b> <b>around</b> the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few inches of the top, and then mostly in the front vise or <b>right</b> <b>around</b> the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it is far better than no bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E

25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck <b>right</b> <b>around</b> the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E
25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side.

This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand can find it by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the many}} losses inflicted on the Xiongnu, {{rebellion}} soon broke out and former enslaved people rose up in arms.

In 72 BC, the joint forces of the Wusun and Han invaded {{the territory of the}} Luli King of the <b>Right.</b> <b>Around</b> 40,000 Xiongnu people and many of their lifestock were captured before their city was sacked after the battle. The very next year, various tribes invaded and raided the Xiongnu territory from all fronts; Wusun from the west, Dingling from the north, and Wuhuan from the east. The Han forces had set out in five columns and invaded from the south. According to Hanshu, this event marks the beginning of Xiongnu decline and the dismantlement of the confederation.|$|E
