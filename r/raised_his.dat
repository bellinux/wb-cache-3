5|$|After David Duggan, {{leader of}} the Conservative Party {{and one of the}} men named, <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> concern over the {{pamphlet}} in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, police raided the Social Credit League's Edmonton headquarters.

5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose {{hatred of}} the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus had in fact <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, {{to the rank of}} magister militum, the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, Robespierre's impassioned {{defense of}} the march <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> public profile considerably. The episode gave him a lasting heroic status among the poissardes and {{burnished}} {{his reputation as a}} patron of the poor. His later rise to become virtual dictator of the Revolution was greatly facilitated by his actions during the occupation of the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Shostakovich <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> {{voice in}} defense of poet Joseph Brodsky, who was sentenced to five years of exile and hard labor.

5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership was {{dangerous to the}} stability of the empire.

At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E
