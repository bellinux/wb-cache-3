5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28.

Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds.

40|$|International audienceThe {{triggering}} {{factors of}} <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> remain unknown {{due to a}} lack of exhaustive, regular and accurate surveys. Based on an inventory of 331 <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> collected weekly between 2002 and 2009 from Veules-les-Roses to Le Treport (Upper Normandy), the relationships between coastal chalk cliff <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> (dates and geomorphological features) and external factors commonly agreed as triggering (rainfall, temperature variations, tide and wind) are studied. The combination of multivariate statistical and empirical analyses indicates that (1) “cold and dry weather” and “high rainfall and high wind” are the conditions most likely to trigger <b>rock</b> <b>falls,</b> (2) the main triggering factors of <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> are effective rainfall (for <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> mostly between 200 and 1, 400 m 3 or larger than 10, 000 m 3 and coming from the whole cliff face), freeze/thaw cycles (especially for <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> smaller than 200 m 3 and coming from the foot and top of the cliff face) and marine roughness (<b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> mainly smaller than 200 m 3 and coming from the cliff foot). However, the contribution of each factor to triggering is difficult to determine because of combinations of factors (85 % of 331 cases), relays of processes and hysteresis phenomena. In view of these first results, it is still presumptuous to predict the location and time of triggering of <b>rock</b> <b>falls.</b> However, the statistical and naturalistic approaches adopted and the observations made in this study are from an original database, and constitute a real starting point for the prediction and prevention of the hazard of coastal chalk cliff <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> in Upper Normandy...|$|R

5|$|In 1913, the British amateur {{palaeontologist}} Reginald W. Hooley described {{two more}} specimens of O. latidens, {{collected from the}} sea after a <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> near Atherfield Point on the Isle of Wight in 1904. The first of these, NHMUK R3877, was collected as three blocks and consists of a skull, neck and trunk vertebrae, a shoulder blade, an ischium, {{and parts of the}} forelimbs. The second specimen, NHMUK R3878, was collected in one block, and includes parts of the pectoral girdle and forelimbs. These specimens represent the most complete remains of Cretaceous pterosaurs found in England, and NHMUK R3877 was one of the only known three-dimensionally preserved pterosaur skeletons for much of the 20th century (pterosaurs bones are often flattened compression fossils). Hooley discussed O. latidens in detail, and placed the genus Ornithodesmus in its own family, Ornithodesmidae. His article ended with a discussion wherein it was noted that the palaeontologist Charles William Andrews had expressed doubts as to whether O. latidens belonged in the genus Ornithodesmus, as the vertebrae of the specimen that genus was based on differed markedly from those of Hooley's specimen. The American palaeontologist Samuel W. Williston subsequently reviewed Hooley's article, disagreeing with some of his conclusions about the anatomy and classification of the animal. After Hooley's monograph, little was written about the animal {{for the rest of the}} 20th century, and no similar pterosaurs were found for decades.|$|E

25|$|An area of {{the east}} face of 67,400 m² was laser-scanned, {{creating}} 22 overlapping computer images, with measurements accurate to between 3 and 5cm.
