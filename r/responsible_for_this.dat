However, the tribbles reveal {{the identity of a}} Klingon agent masquerading as a human: Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), Baris' own assistant. He had infected the grain with a virus that becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually prevents the organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E

5|$|The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory is a {{historical}} observatory located {{on the grounds of}} the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic declination. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906.

Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy at the center of Abell 2063. The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris.

Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit by falling debris.

5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> Later on, Tom sadly talks {{about how much he}} will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> discrepancy has {{been rejected by}} astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIncubation of digitonin-permeabilized bovine chromaffin cells {{results in}} a loss of Ca 3 +-dependent {{catecholamine}} secretion. The addition of cytosolic proteins prevents this loss of secretory activity. It has been proposed that calpactin might be the protein which is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> preventing <b>this</b> loss of activity. The experiments described in this paper show that cytosolic proteins which have been depleted of calpactin are as effective as control cytosolic proteins in preventing the loss of Ca 2 +-dependent secretion. Thus, a cytosolic protein(s) other than calpactin appears to be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> preventing <b>this</b> loss of secretory activity...|$|R
5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding {{the formation of the}} cosmos, the moon and the earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation, such as the forging of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with bolts of brass, Buoy'd with pure air shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was {{demolished}} {{and replaced by}} a new house in Georgian style. The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right-angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former vaulted undercroft of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of wines and beers. The first floor was the piano nobile, containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs {{leading up to the}} main entrance. Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating. Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing. According to the authors of the Buildings of England series, the architect <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was James Wyatt. Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a walled garden at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers. The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden. Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, and barrel vaulting was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its arcade.|$|E
5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E
