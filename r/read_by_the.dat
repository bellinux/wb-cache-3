5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were <b>read</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E

Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems <b>read</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202).

5|$|The good {{preservation}} of the texts in Unas' pyramid shows that they were arranged {{so as to be}} <b>read</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ba of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would then leave the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written {{on the walls of the}} antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this point the Ba of Unas would face east, the direction of the sunrise, and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.|$|E
5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device.
