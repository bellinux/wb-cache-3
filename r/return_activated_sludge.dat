The EF under steady solids loading required a minimum unit height and gas:solids ratio of 0. 006 for efficient clarification.

When digested, this nitrogen and phosphorus are released, producing a dewatering liquor high in ammonia or nitrate and phosphate. Not only does this dewatering liquor need to be treated, but the phosphate also precipitates in the digester and surrounding pipework, resulting in loss of digester capacity and pipe blockages. This investigation studies anoxic-aerobic digestion (aerobic digestion with intermittent aeration), as an alternative digestion of BNR WAS. Aerobic digestion is simple to operate – being {{an extension of the}} <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> process, requiring aeration and limited recycling. This compared with anaerobic digestion which is complex to operate requiring airtight containers with fire risk, heating and much recycling. In anoxic-aerobic digestion, the nitrogen is removed by nitrification-denitrification, which has the added advantages of reducing the digester's oxygen demand and recovering some of the alkalinity lost in nitrification. Phosphate is precipitated in the digester - a convenient location.

The adsorption of TiO 2 nanoparticle to heterotrophic biomass has been previously studied; however, past studies did not address the effects of environmental transformations of the nanoparticles’ surface properties. These changes often occur in the environment prior to being received by the wastewater treatment facility. This study uses gold labeled TiO 2 (Au@TiO 2) nanoparticles to observe how exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation modifies the surface properties of TiO 2 nanoparticles, and ultimately affects their adsorption to heterotrophic biomass. Using instrumental neutron activation analysis, the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of Au@TiO 2 nanoparticles in dried <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> was found to be 5. 49 mg/kg 7. 02 mg/kg, respectively.

Exposure to UV irradiation reduced Au@TiO 2 nanoparticle hydrophobicity and shifted the electrophoretic mobility versus pH curve to the left.

Analysis of Au in the supernatant and the settled solids from the batch adsorption tests yielded an incomplete material balance. The Au concentration of the supernatant suggested that exposure to UV irradiation increased biosorption to heterotrophic biomass.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) {{have become a}} mature technology that can compete with conventional wastewater treatment processes. An MBR comprises an <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> bioreactor to biodegrade the polluting components and a membrane module which separates the biomass from the effluent by means of micro- or ultrafiltration. The latter replaces the sedimentation tanks of conventional <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> processes. While a reduced plant footprint and a better effluent quality, completely free of suspended solids, are among the many advantages, membrane fouling remains the major bottleneck. Despite extensive research efforts, membrane fouling in MBRs is still far from being fully understood, mainly due to the inherent interactions between the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge,</b> the influent and applied process conditions. Due {{to the lack of}} clear causal relationships between <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> mixed liquor characteristics and membrane fouling, in practice most, if not all, MBRs are operated {{in such a way that}} effects of membrane fouling are reduced. It is clear that the remediation of fouling increases the overall cost of an MBR and is, unfortunately, not always very effective. In order to be able to prevent membrane fouling, the focus in this dissertation has been on investigating the impact of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> mixed liquor characteristics on membrane fouling in MBRs. From lab-scale, pilot-scale and full-scale MBRs experiments the following results are obtained. Better bioflocculation [...] . less foulingThe influence of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculation and reflocculation was studied in a lab-scale MBR. <b>Activated</b> <b>sludge</b> could be deflocculated and reflocculated by changing the ratio of monovalent over polyvalent cations ([M/P]) in the influent. As a result of a high [M/P] in the influent, severe sludge deflocculation occurred and worsened filtration characteristics were observed. Increasing fragment surface as a consequence of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculation coincided with a reduced <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability. Once the influent was switched to a low [M/P], the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> reflocculated and filtration characteristics improved significantly within three weeks after the switch. With this experiment, it is evidenced that bioflocculation strongly influences membrane fouling in MBRs. Filtration characteristics deteriorate dramatically when <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculates whereas a reflocculated sludge improves the filtration performance significantly. Higher SRT [...] . better bioflocculation [...] . less foulingA pilot-scale MBR was operated at different solids retention times (SRT) to study the influence of SRT on effluent quality, bioflocculation and membrane fouling in MBRs. Effluent quality was proven to be unaffected at an SRT of 50 days and 30 days, while at an SRT of 10 days nitrification decreased from 99 % to 81 %. Also COD removal rates were slightly lower compared to SRTs of 30 days and 50 days. Apart from effluent quality, also <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> bioflocculation deteriorated at an SRT of 10 days. The deflocculation could be monitored by means of automated analysis of microscopic <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> images. An increasing relative fragment surface in the images, reflecting a more deflocculated state of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge,</b> contributes to severe membrane fouling. Conclusively, a higher SRT induces a better bioflocculation which improves the filterability of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> and reduces the membrane fouling. It is all about bioflocculation [...] . or not?Ten full-scale MBRs were sampled in both winter and summer. Each of these <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> samples was subjected to the Delft Filtration Characterization method (DFCm) to determine the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability while a large set of parameters was measured. Although in literature most of these parameters have been indicated as major membrane foulants, no clear correlation between any single parameter and filterability could be established. This suggests that every parameter alone is a poor indicator of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> fouling propensity. The results from this sampling campaign reveal that a combination of sludge morphology and relative hydrophobicity (RH) allows for a first classification of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability. It was found that <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculation and low <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> RH have a negative impact on <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability and vice versa. For sludge samples that have poor to good <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability, accurate estimations of sludge filterability can be calculated on the basis of floc-bound proteins (eEPS PN), soluble polysaccharides (SMP PS), sludge morphology, the dissociation constant and RH. Finally, the impact of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> characteristics on membrane fouling was studied using a reverse engineering approach. A commercially available membrane performance enhancer (MPE 50, Nalco) was added to <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> samples originating from five different membrane bioreactors treating municipal or industrial wastewaters. Before and after the addition of MPE 50, a large set of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> parameters was measured and filtration tests were performed in a lab-scale MBR. As a consequence of the MPE 50 addition, <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> bioflocculation improved and the concentration of SMP in the bulk liquid strongly reduced. Also the concentration of eEPS reduced, though to a lesser extent. For sludges with a low RH, the addition of MPE 50 increased the RH. These experiments confirm that a rough classification of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability can be made from RH and image analysis data alone. Based on <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> morphology, eEPS PN and RH, the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability can be accurately estimated for sludge samples with moderate to good filterability. nrpages: 197 status: publishe...|$|R
