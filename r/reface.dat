John Webb was employed from 1657 to 1660 to relocate the family's living accommodation from the Strand front to the garden front. In the 1740s and 1750s the Strand front was largely reconstructed and two wings were added which projected from the ends of the garden front at right angles. These were over [...] long and contained a ballroom and a picture gallery, the latter itself 106 feet (32 m) long. The style of the new interiors was late palladian and the architects were Daniel Garrett until his death in 1753, and then the better known James Paine. In the mid-1760s Robert Mylne was employed to <b>reface</b> the courtyard in stone, and he may also have been responsible for extensions to the two garden wings which were made at this time. In the 1770s Robert Adam was commissioned to redecorate the state rooms on the garden front. The Glass Drawing Room at Northumberland House was one of his most celebrated interiors. Part of the Strand front had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1780.|$|E

50|$|With {{the growth}} of the Company, {{additional}} space was required, and in the 1790s adjoining structures to either side of East India House were purchased and pulled down. Designs to extend and <b>reface</b> the building were commissioned, after some canvassing among John Soane and George Dance, from Henry Holland - though even then the Company's Surveyor, architect Richard Jupp, insisted on overseeing construction. Work on the new building began in 1796. After Jupp's sudden death in April 1799, it was completed by Holland. The Company's museum was housed in one extension, the library in the other.|$|E
50|$|If {{the loose}} ball {{goes out of}} bounds on a {{face-off}} before either team can pick it up, it is awarded to the team that last touched it and all other players are released when play is restarted. If the officials cannot determine who last touched it and the ball remained in midfield without crossing either restraining line, the ball is refaced; if it has crossed a restraining line before going out, it is awarded via alternate possession. A <b>reface</b> is also required if an injury or time-out stops play before possession is established and the ball has not crossed the restraining line; if it has it is awarded by alternate possession.|$|E

5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of sink cabinets, pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), <b>reface</b> existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure. Resins, organic materials which convert from liquid to solid form, are used to manufacture engineered wood (e.g., particleboard) frequently used to build kitchen cabinet carcases can be a factor.

40|$|Over {{the last}} forty years, {{graffiti}} and street-art {{have become a}} global phenomenon within the visual arts. Whilst they have increasingly been taken seriously by the art establishment (or perhaps the art market), their academic and popular examination still remains within old debates which argue over whether these acts are vandalism or art, and which examine the role of graffiti in gang culture {{and in terms of}} visual pollution. Based on an in-depth ethnographic study working with some of the world’s most influential Independent Public Artists, this book takes a completely new approach. Placing these illicit aesthetic practices within a broader historical, political, and aesthetic context, it argues that they are in fact both intrinsically ornamental (working within a classic architectonic framework), as well as innately ordered (within a highly ritualized, performative structure). Rather than disharmonic, destructive forms, rather than ones solely working within the dynamics of the market, these insurgent images are seen to <b>reface</b> rather than deface the city, operating within a modality of contemporary civic ritual.
