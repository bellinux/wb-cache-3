5|$|One {{major change}} {{was made to}} the {{calculation}} for the general classification {{before the start of}} the second Giro d'Italia. Originally a point was given to each rider for his placing on each stage, but the organizers chose to give the <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for the <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> placed 1st through 50th in a stage.|$|E
5|$|Effective October 1, 2013, {{the price}} of the card was reduced to $2, the rebate program was discontinued, and the maximum {{permitted}} negative balance upon exit was set at $1.50, with <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> would exceed this being required to use the Exitfare machines to add value to their cards.|$|E
5|$|Outlaw Run {{consists}} of two trains, each featuring twelve pairs of riders. <b>Riders,</b> <b>who</b> must be 48 inches (122cm) or taller to ride, are restrained in their individual fiberglass seats with a U-shaped lap bar. Unlike most roller coaster trains, which have polyurethane wheels, Outlaw Run features steel wheels.|$|E
50|$|The Grand Prix was won by Martin Vaculík {{who beat}} Chris Harris, wild card Bartosz Zmarzlik and Tomasz Gollob. Vaculík {{becoming}} first Slovak <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> {{ride in the}} SGP and third <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> won SGP event in his debut (after Tomasz Gollob and Emil Sayfutdinov). It was 150th SPG event since 1995 and Greg Hancock was only <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> rode in all meetings.|$|R
50|$|Syd Jackson (sometimes {{referred}} to as Sid Jackson) (born c.1908) was a British motorcycle speedway <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> {{was one of the}} stars of the early years of the sport in Britain, and an international <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> represented England several times.|$|R
5|$|A combativity {{award was}} also {{attributed}} for the <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> had ridden the most aggressively {{in the eyes}} of the judges at the end of every stage. It could have been a <b>rider</b> <b>who</b> featured in breakaways or a cyclist who attacked often.|$|R
5|$|The cost of Metrobus is {{allocated}} under {{a formula}} which considers the excess of expenses over revenues from specific bus routes. The cost of MetroAccess is allocated {{under a different}} formula, which divides MetroAccess costs {{by the number of}} trips requested by <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> reside in each jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The final {{individual}} classification was {{the young}} rider classification. This was calculated {{the same way as}} the general classification, but the classification was restricted to <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> were born on or after 1 January 1987. The leader wore a white jersey.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. <b>Riders</b> <b>who</b> were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 10-second time {{bonus for}} winning the stage, Kristoff took over the overall lead of the race, one second ahead of Boonen, who moved into {{the lead of the}} points competition. Several <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> had been contenders for the overall victory, {{including}} Wiggins and Cancellara, finished over nine minutes behind Kristoff, eliminating them from contention for overall victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce fraud and waste, Metro {{announced}} in October 2008 that it would be eliminating paper bus transfers effective January 4, 2009. All <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> wished to take advantage of reduced-fare transfers were required to pay using SmarTrip. Paper bus passes were eliminated in January 2011 and passes are now only available on SmarTrip.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 Daytona 200, after early leader Gary Nixon retired, Roberts battled for {{the lead}} with former 500cc world champion, Giacomo Agostini before an {{overheated}} engine forced him to settle for second place. In April 1974, Roberts ventured to Europe {{for the first time}} to compete in the prestigious mola 200 road race for 750cc motorcycles. He made a positive impression competing against the best road racers in the world, once again finishing second to Agostini. He then traveled to England with a team of American riders to compete against a British riding team in the 1974 Transatlantic Match races. The conventional wisdom at the time was that American <b>riders,</b> <b>who</b> competed mostly in dirt track races, could not race on asphalt at the same level as the British <b>riders,</b> <b>who</b> specialized in road racing events. Roberts dispelled any such notions by winning three of the six races and finishing second in the remaining three races. Roberts was the top individual points scorer in the event with 93 points, five more than Barry Sheene, the top British rider.|$|E

5|$|The recent {{editions of}} Paris–Roubaix had been won in various ways. Seven of the {{previous}} ten editions had been won by <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> had made solo breakaways; the most recent of these was Niki Terpstra in 2014. Other editions had been won in small group sprints: there were three riders together at the finish in 2008 Paris–Roubaix, two riders in 2013 and six in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began {{applying}} for over $600,000 in TEA-21 grants {{to create a}} paved, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The total cost of paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy.|$|E

5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} estimating {{the number of}} <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).|$|E
5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail <b>riders,</b> <b>who</b> appreciate their gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, stamina and gait, and members of the breed were used to make the first horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the Caribbean Premier League has given the QPO a new tenant - The Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel and the ground has hosted Red Steel league matches {{in each of the}} three seasons as well as the semifinals and finals of the 2013 and 2015 editions of the CPL.

5|$|The {{team had}} an {{excellent}} later {{half of the season}} in single-day races, attaining top-ten placings in all but one such race that they entered. This successful run started at the Clásica de San Sebastián. Both Schleck brothers were mentioned as possible pre-race contenders, and Fränk Schleck rode to sixth place on the day by finishing with the first chase pack back of solo winner Philippe Gilbert and second-placed Carlos Barredo. In August, Nizzolo continued his strong neo-pro season with a fifth place ride at the GP Ouest-France, finishing second-best from the peloton behind three attacking <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> took each podium place just ahead of them.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught every one of the twelve initial leaders, and {{subsequently}} Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} six to seven riders from this Giro had presumptive positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those <b>riders</b> <b>who</b> tested positive have not yet been revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.|$|E
