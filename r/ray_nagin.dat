5|$|On September 6, Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> {{ordered a}} forced {{evacuation}} of {{everyone from the}} city who {{was not involved in}} clean up work, citing safety and health concerns. The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin,</b> telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E
25|$|Although Landrieu had {{at first}} {{indicated}} {{he did not}} plan to run for mayor, in December 2009 he announced he would be running in the 2010 New Orleans mayoral election, {{in a bid to}} succeed <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin,</b> who was term-limited.|$|E
25|$|Brown co-authored a book, Deadly Indifference: The Perfect (Political) Storm: Hurricane Katrina, The Bush White House, and Beyond, {{about his}} {{experiences}} during Hurricane Katrina. The book was released June 16, 2011 and is published by Taylor Trade Publishing. Brown criticizes the performance of numerous people, including Bush, Trent Lott, Dennis Hastert, <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin,</b> and Jesse Jackson, and critiques his own performance by stating that he failed {{to be ready for}} the press and was too timid in his response.|$|E
25|$|A {{former partner}} of the Adams and Reese law firm, Couhig now leads his own firm, Couhig Partners. Couhig has twice been a {{candidate}} for the United States House of Representatives. A persistent Republican in a heavily Democratic city, he was defeated in a race for mayor of New Orleans in the spring of 2006 by the incumbent, <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin.</b> He is also known for bringing the minor league baseball team the New Orleans Zephyrs to the city.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006, Brown {{chaired the}} host {{committee}} for a fund raiser held in Chicago {{to support the}} re-election of Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> of New Orleans, Louisiana. Helping organize the event was information technology contractor Mark St. Pierre, who had worked contracts for both the city of New Orleans and Cook County government, and was a significant political donor to both Brown and Nagin. The event figured prominently in the indictment of Nagin on corruption charges on January 18, 2013. Brown was not charged.|$|E
25|$|Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> officially reopened the French Quarter on September 26, 2005 (almost a {{month after}} the storm), for {{business}} owners to inspect their property and clean up. Within a few weeks, a large selection of French Quarter businesses had reopened. The Historic New Orleans Collection's Williams Research Center Annex was the first new construction completed in the French Quarter after Hurricane Katrina. In September 2015, SBP (a disaster relief organization that began after the hurricane), broke ground its new headquarters, moving from Chalmette to a 25,000-square-foot former salvage company on Toulouse Street as part of a $7.2 million relocation effort. The organization moved into its new space in May 2016. The building is also serves as the national hub for the Disaster Resilience and Recovery Lab.|$|E
25|$|During the {{administration}} of Morrison's successor, Vic Schiro, the government sponsored studies of the feasibility of relocating New Orleans International Airport to a new site, contemporaneous with similar efforts that were ultimately successful in Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and Dallas (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport). This attempt {{got as far as}} recommending a site in New Orleans East; a man-made island was to be created south of I-10 and north of U.S. Route 90 in a bay of Lake Pontchartrain. In the early 1970s it was decided that the current airport should be expanded instead, leading to the construction of a lengthened main terminal ticketing area, an airport access road linking the terminal to I-10, and the present-day Concourses A and B. New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, in office from 1986 to 1994, later reintroduced the idea of building a new international airport for the city, with consideration given to other sites in New Orleans East, {{as well as on the}} Northshore in suburban St. Tammany Parish. Only a couple months before Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> again proposed a new airport for New Orleans, this time to the west in Montz, Louisiana. These initiatives met with the same fate as 1960s-era efforts concerning construction of a new airport for New Orleans.|$|E
500|$|After {{the devastating}} events of Hurricane Katrina, Usher {{launched}} Project Restart {{that would go}} on to help more than 700 families with housing and keeping their lights on. Usher also while in New Orleans would meet with students from Dillard and Xavier to aid them with cleaning up the city. [...] "I'm here to physically do something and hopefully motivate other people to do the same," [...] said Usher in an interview. Usher, because of his efforts and dedication to helping the city of New Orleans rebuild was presented the key to the city of New Orleans in 2008 from former Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin.</b> Also in this presentation, Usher in his honor was proclaimed his own day, Usher Day.|$|E
500|$|Although Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> {{ordered a}} {{mandatory}} evacuation of the city, many people {{refused to leave}} or were unable to do so. In Plaquemines Parish, an official described those remaining behind as [...] "gambling with their own lives." [...] Reasons were numerous, including a belief that their homes or the buildings in which they planned to stay offered sufficient protection, lack of financial resources or access to transportation, or a feeling of obligation to protect their property. These reasons were {{complicated by the fact}} that an evacuation the previous year for Hurricane Ivan had resulted in gridlocked traffic for six to ten hours. The fact that Katrina occurred at the end of the month, before pay checks were in the hands of many was also significant. A [...] "refuge of last resort" [...] was designated at the Louisiana Superdome. Beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents from 12 pickup points throughout the city to the [...] "shelters of last resort." ...|$|E

2500|$|March 2 saw {{the release}} of the election's second poll, {{conducted}} by CNN, USA Today, and Gallup. [...] 19% of [...] those polled said they would definitely vote for <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin,</b> while 44% said they would definitely not vote for him.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2006, Landrieu officially {{announced}} he would run for mayor of New Orleans in the April 22 election. [...] Before Hurricane Katrina the incumbent <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> was widely expected to be reelected with little difficulty, but post-disaster problems and controversies had left many New Orleanians interested in new leadership.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first round}} of the New Orleans mayoral {{election}} of 2006 took place on April 22, 2006; a runoff between incumbent Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> and Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu took place on May 20, resulting in reelection for Mayor Nagin. [...] The Mayor of New Orleans is the top official in New Orleans' mayor-council system of government.|$|E
2500|$|The first mayoral {{debate of}} the {{campaign}} was held on March 7 at Loyola University. [...] The debate was attended by <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> and 8 of his challengers: [...] James Arey, Virginia Boulet, Rob Couhig, Ron Forman, Mitch Landrieu, Leo Watermeier, Tom Watson, and Peggy Wilson. [...] Kimberly Williamson Butler was invited, but could not attend due to her jail sentence. [...] The candidates discussed levees and hurricane evacuation plans, housing and redevelopment of neighborhoods, {{the role of the}} state and federal government in the rebuilding of the city, and the issue of race in a city with drastically altered demographics. [...] The two main challengers, Forman and Landrieu, were perceived as largely playing safe, while other candidates, particularly Couhig and Wilson, were more combative. [...] <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> focused on defending his record and emphasizing the need for experienced leadership in a time of crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Couhig and Peggy Wilson, {{a former}} member of the New Orleans City Council, were the two Republican {{candidates}} for mayor. His campaign started with television ads mocking the perceived leading candidates, Mitch Landrieu, Ron Forman, and incumbent Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin.</b> In televised debates prior to the nonpartisan blanket primary, Couhig's combative style attracted attention. MSNBC pundit Chris Matthews declared Couhig the [...] "absolute winner" [...] of the pre-primary debate.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2002, {{businessman}} <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> {{was elected}} mayor. A former cable television executive, Nagin was unaligned {{with any of}} the city's traditional political blocks, and many voters were attracted to his pledges to fight corruption and run the city on a more business-like basis. [...] In 2014 Nagin was convicted on charges that he had taken more than $500,000 in payouts from businessmen in exchange for millions of dollars' worth of city contracts. He received a 10-year sentence.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, {{the first}} public poll of the {{election}} was released. [...] Conducted between January 26 and February 13, the poll showed Mitch Landrieu leading with 35% of the vote and <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> trailing with 25%. [...] Ron Forman received 9% and Peggy Wilson stood at 7%. [...] However, only residents who {{had returned to the}} city were polled; without the input of absentee voters, the pollster acknowledged that the results could not be considered representative.|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, {{thousands}} {{of civil rights}} demonstrators marched across the Crescent City Connection calling for satellite voting locations {{to be set up}} outside the state to give displaced New Orleanians the same voting rights as those who have returned to the city. [...] The march - the largest New Orleans has seen in several years - was organized by Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, and prominent speakers included Bill Cosby, former mayor Marc Morial, Al Sharpton, U.S. Rep. Bill Jefferson, and Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the primary}} campaign, {{incumbent}} mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> faced a record 21 challengers for his position. [...] Many were political novices without significant financial backing. [...] In addition to Nagin, two candidates in particular were considered by political pundits to be [...] "major candidates" [...] {{because of their}} name recognition and financingRon Forman and Mitch Landrieu. [...] Others preferred not to distinguish between 'major' and 'minor' candidates, noting that, in the 2002 election, these same pundits considered Nagin a long-shot. [...] The top-financed candidate in that election, two-term city councilman Troy Carter, came in fifth.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> : Incumbent mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> sought re-election. [...] Before Katrina, he {{was widely}} {{perceived}} {{as having a}} very high chance of re-election, but the new political climate left his level of support uncertain. [...] Nagin faced strong criticism of his handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. [...] Many middle- and upper-class white voters, who supported him in the 2002 election and were vital to his success in that contest, were alienated by his ‘chocolate city’ speech in January 2006, and very few white voters supported him this time. [...] The elements {{of the business community}} that were such an important part of his support base in 2002 mainly supported other candidates, while Nagin's business-oriented plans for reconstruction in New Orleans have alienated many voters. [...] Moreover, the city’s black majority has been significantly reduced, and many in the city’s black community were critical of Nagin even before the hurricane, citing amongst other issues {{the fact that he was}} known to have conservative politics and had supported Republican candidates in the past. [...] Nagin campaigned on his experience as mayor and in defense of his record, arguing that New Orleans needs experienced leadership in a crisis situation. [...] After being defeated in the primary, Rob Couhig, Virginia Boulet, and Tom Watson endorsed Nagin in the runoff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{violent crime}} rate {{was a key}} issue in the 2010 mayoral race. In January 2007, several {{thousand}} New Orleans residents marched to City Hall for a rally demanding police and city leaders tackle the crime problem. Then-Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> said he was [...] "totally and solely focused" [...] on addressing the problem. Later, the city implemented checkpoints during late night hours in problem areas. The murder rate climbed 14% in 2011 to 57.88 per 100,000 rising to #21 in the world. In 2016, according to annual crime statistics released by the New Orleans Police Department, 176 were murdered.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least one}} {{reliable}} source, The Economist, recognized {{the likelihood that}} Brown was [...] "pushed" [...] out by the administration rather than having resigned voluntarily, although internal e-mails from Brown indicated that he was already planning to leave FEMA at the time Katrina hit. The same suggestion was made {{by at least one}} member of Congress during a hearing on what went wrong during Katrina. Brown concentrated his testimony at that hearing on alleging that Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco and New Orleans mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> bore most, if not all, of the blame for the failures in the response to Katrina, and that his only fault had been not to realize sooner their inability to perform their respective duties.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> {{threatened}} {{to use his}} powers of eminent domain to seize vacant, severely damaged properties in all of New Orleans {{that had not been}} gutted or scheduled to be gutted before early 2007. [...] Such blighted properties had been creating serious problems for returned New Orleanians, including infestations of rats and other vermin. [...] Similar actions to seize abandoned blighted property are in effect in other Louisiana parishes, as well as in Mississippi counties affected by the storm. However, as hundreds of thousands of locals were still waiting for promised insurance or Road Home money, many of the poor lacked resources to work on their houses. The neighborhood had few stores and only a handful of schools reopened.|$|E
2500|$|In {{comments}} in 2005, Farrakhan stated {{that there was}} a [...] hole under one of the key levees that failed in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. He implied that the levee's destruction was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the population of the largely black sections within the city. Farrakhan later said that New Orleans Mayor <b>Ray</b> <b>Nagin</b> told him of the crater during a meeting in Dallas, Texas. Farrakhan further claimed that the fact the levee broke the day after Hurricane Katrina is proof that the destruction of the levee was not a natural occurrence. Farrakhan has raised additional questions and has called for federal investigations into the source of the levee break. He also asserted that the hurricane was [...] "God's way of punishing America for its warmongering and racism".|$|E
