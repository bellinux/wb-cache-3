We find that firms with works councils make a significantly higher net investment in <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> compared to firms without such an institution. However, we also find that the fraction of workers still employed with the same firm five years after training is significantly higher in the presence of works councils, enabling firms to recoup training investments over a longer time horizon.

40|$|According to {{standard}} human capital theory firm financed training cannot be explained if skills are of general nature. Nevertheless, investments of firms into general training {{can be observed}} {{and there has been}} a large literature to explain this puzzle, mostly referring to imperfect labor market issues. In German speaking countries firms invest heavily into <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> although it is assumed to be general. In our paper, we study the question to what extent <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> is general at all. Our paper for the first time studies how specificity of training may be defined based on Lazear’s skill-weights approach. In our empirical part we use a unique German Qualification Survey, containing extensive information about the required skills at a workplace. We build occupationspecific skill-weights and find that the more specific the skill portfolio in an occupation is in comparison to the general labor market, the higher are the net costs firms have to bear for <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> in the respective occupations. At the same time, the more specific the skill requirements are in an occupation, the smaller is the probability of an occupational change during an employee’s entire career. Due to the new definition of occupational specificity, we thus find that <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> - formerly seen as general training - is very heterogeneous in its specificity.

40|$|In Germany, {{there is}} {{currently}} {{a discussion about the}} implementation of penalty charges if firms refuse to offer <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> positions to school graduates. This paper aims at analyzing the policy instrument of penalty charges by a theoretical model that systematically compares its costs and benefits. Building on recent training literature, a two-period partialequilibrium model is designed that allows for worker heterogeneity in ability and covers special features of the German apprenticeship system. With respect to overall welfare, the implementation of penalty charges solves a trade-off. On the one hand, penalty charges increase the number of <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> positions and thus the fraction of trained workers in the workforce. On the other hand, some firms will leave the market to avoid the financial burden, which generates unemployment among workers with low ability. Altogether, we demonstrate that optimal penalty charges increase the overall welfare compared to the laissez-faire equilibrium if the productivity-enhancement of <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> exceeds some lower bound.

Secondly, for firms that train, {{the effect on the}} amount of investments in <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> (intensive margin) is analyzed.

30|$|<b>Apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> {{may also}} serve as a signal for good working conditions, thereby also facilitating the {{recruitment}} process for skilled workers from the external labour market (Backes-Gellner and Tuor 2010). More generally, <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training</b> may increase a firm’s reputation (e.g., social responsibility), which may indirectly increase profits (Sadowski 1980) through advantages on the product market. However, the latter benefits are difficult to measure, and there are therefore few empirical studies that address this issue. Niederalt (2005) argues that rather than the benefit from a positive reputation effect, social pressure might be the reason for the increase in a firm’s supply of <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>training.</b> The latter is more likely to occur if a firm operates in a rural area with a low number of employers, clients and potential apprentices.|$|R
