25|$|In the mid-1970s, under Mengistu's leadership, the Derg regime {{began an}} {{aggressive}} program of changing Ethiopia's system from a mixed feudo-capitalist emergent economy to an Eastern Bloc-style command economy. Shortly after coming to power, all <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> was nationalized, <b>stripping</b> the Ethiopian Church, the Imperial {{family and the}} nobility of all their sizable estates and {{the bulk of their}} wealth. During this same period, all foreign-owned and locally owned companies were nationalized without compensation in an effort to redistribute the country's wealth. All undeveloped urban property and all rental property was also nationalized. Private businesses such as banks and insurance companies, large retail businesses, etc. were also taken over by the government. All this nationalized property was brought under the administration of large bureaucracies set up to administer them. Farmers who had once worked on land owned by absentee landlords were now compelled to join collective farms. All agricultural products were no longer to be offered on the free market, but were to be controlled and distributed by the government. Despite progressive agricultural reforms, under the Derg, agricultural output suffered due to civil war, drought and misguided economic policies. There was also a famine in 1984, which was the 10th anniversary of the Derg.|$|R

40|$|Key Words: <b>Rural</b> <b>land</b> prices, farm {{investment}} returns, <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> appraisal. <b>Rural</b> <b>land</b> prices, in developed, {{free trade}} real estate markets, are influenced {{not only by}} prevailing economic conditions but also physical factors such as climate, topography and soil type. In broadacre farming and grazing operations, both commodity price and yields determine farm income. Yields, in turn, are a function of climate, topography and soil type. The strength of a <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> market {{is influenced by the}} overall rural economy in a Country, State or region. These differences in <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> markets can also vary within smaller regions. It has been held that <b>rural</b> <b>land,</b> in relative safe production areas, is less effected by adverse economic and climatic factors than land in more marginal agricultural areas. This paper will analyse <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> sales in both traditional cropping areas and marginal cropping areas for the period 1975 to 1996. The analysis will determine the overall trend in <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> prices over the period, compare the average annual return between marginal and established farming areas and determine which economic and production factors have influenced this change. The impact of this analysis will also be discussed in relation to <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> appraisal...|$|R
40|$|There are a {{multitude}} of interdisciplinary values that people derive from <b>rural</b> <b>land.</b> Productivism focuses on the commodity values of <b>rural</b> <b>land,</b> {{such as the use}} of land as a commercial input into agricultural production, timber harvesting and mineral extraction. Productivistic uses and values of <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> have been the traditional focus of <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> policy and management in the United States. Many rural areas in the United States are moving into a postproductivism era. Postproductivism focuses on both commodity and amenity values of <b>rural</b> <b>land.</b> Amenity values of <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> include recreational, aesthetic and ecological service values. When a rural area moves from productivism to postproductivism, value conflicts may arise between individuals and groups who have different preferences with respect to commodity and amenity values. Traditional rural institutions may not be set up to effectively handle such conflicts. There is a need to explore what types of institutions may be most effective in resolving <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> use problems related to the different and often competing values people place on <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> and landscapes. postproductivism, <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> values and preferences, commodity values, amenity values, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

50|$|It {{was decided}} that three grass <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> would be marked out at HMS Vulture II (between Tregonnick Tail and Treligga village, each around 580 metres long) so that if an {{aircraft}} sustained engine failure or ricochet damage whilst firing on the range, {{it would be possible}} to land. This involved a lot of earth moving and heavy machinery was brought in to complete the work. To the north of the tower, the head of a valley was filled and levelled. The ground on the <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> was considered too rough for normal take offs and landings. The <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> were intended only for belly landings (wheels-up), in an emergency. Later however the surface was improved and some traffic did use the <b>landing</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{clarifying}} and defining <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer, the necessity of <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer is analyzed. Land transfer is the necessity in terms of promoting agricultural scale operation and improving production efficiency; proving opportunities for narrowing urban and rural gap; realizing rural surplus labor transfer and facilitating urbanization. Major problems in the existing <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer are analyzed: unclear laws and regulations and <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer lacks relevant legal protection: rural social security system is imperfect and can not solve farmers' worries after land transfer; farmers and local governments are restricted by traditional ideas {{and it is hard}} to carry our the <b>land</b> transfer policies; <b>rural</b> system construction is relatively backward and the <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer market is immature. Countermeasures on the governmental behaviors in <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer are put forward: stipulating relevant administrative laws and regulations and perfecting the political system of <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer; perfecting <b>rural</b> social security system and solving farmers' worries after land transfer; changing the ideas and working style of local officials and leading farmers to form the scientific land transfer outlook; and vigorously promoting the construction of system and positively cultivating <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer market. <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> transfer, Major problems, Governmental behaviors, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R

The <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> with the potential production which is appropriate for the rural use is very important natural source. The natural source is very important for the quality of living and the spatial development. For this reason the assurance of the validity of the usage of the <b>rural</b> <b>lands</b> and to preserve the <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> is one of the basic ways of the strategy of the spatial development of Slovenia. The task is compose into two parts. The first part is theoretical. It informed us with the situations and achievements of the spatial development in Slovenia. In brief it shows the professional starting-point, which are {{for the use of the}} legally regime to preserve the <b>rural</b> <b>lands</b> and have been made by Dr. A.
