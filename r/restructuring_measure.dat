25|$|Between 2001 and 2015 {{the company}} was {{reported}} as having multiple rounds of layoffs. In 2001, 350 employees, or 24% of total workforce, were laid off. Then in January 2003, 176 employees were laid off and in June 2005, 89 employees were laid off. In August 2006, 30 to 40 employees were laid off.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{economic}} motives for and personnel-management consequences {{of reducing the}} number of hierarchical levels {{from the point of view}} of fairness aspects. A transition to flat hierarchies can, under certain circumstances, have serious consequences for employees who are directly or indirectly affected; these consequences include a loss of status and/or income, reduced chances of promotion and thus diminished career prospects. In particular well-qualified employees could respond to this by moving to other firms, whilst repercussions can be expected regarding the motivation and work effort of the remaining employees. It can therefore be crucial for the success of a firm that the employees accept their treatment in the course of reorganisation measures and assess it to be fair. A written survey conducted among students is to provide first information as to the acceptance of hierarchical levels being eliminated and the associated consequences for the employees. Special emphasis is placed here on the significance of various motives for delayering and different personnel-management measures for the assessment of fairness. One key finding is that reciprocity norms have a decisive influence on the perceived fairness of a <b>restructuring</b> <b>measure.</b> In particular, disadvantages resulting from a delayering of the hierarchy are apparently more likely to be accepted if they are associated with adequate compensation from the viewpoint of the employees affected.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the interaction between three phenomena: corporate restructuring, choice of law, and transaction avoidance. In this context, scholars have criticised Art. 13 of the European Insolvency Regulation for providing a possibility for forum shopping. This article enables firms to declare {{the law of the}} eu Member State where the provisions on transaction avoidance allow for the most freedom to take <b>restructuring</b> <b>measures</b> applicable to contracts. Literature on company restructuring shows that a combination of <b>restructuring</b> <b>measures</b> – usually additional credit for additional conditions and/or collateral - helps companies overcome financial distress. We argue that rules on transaction avoidance should take this balance into account when voidance is demanded. Using the example of Dutch and German rules on transaction avoidance, we argue that the German rules are more accommodative than the Dutch rules. Therefore, firms may benefit using the German rules on transaction avoidance rather than the Dutch rules...|$|R
