5|$|Many {{legends and}} fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. One {{is that she}} was {{secretly}} buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors.

Another is that her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.|$|E
5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> a quiet sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack {{was to be}} made by three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Melbourne for the Olympics, Morgan was not {{assured of}} {{a place in the}} final relay quartet.

Morgan swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.4 seconds, the fastest of the Australians, securing her position in the final four along with Leech. Australia qualified quickest for the final, winning the second heat by 3.1 seconds. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than the South Africans and Americans, respectively, both of which swam in the first heat.|$|E

In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the ashes of his younger daughter Princess Margaret, who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> the hands of the council.|$|E

5|$|Rindt was {{pronounced}} dead {{on the way to}} hospital and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> a garage near Milan.|$|E
5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> massive transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E
5|$|Sa'd al-Dawla was {{succeeded by}} his son, Sa'id Abu 'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla, but real power <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> {{the hands of}} Sa'd al-Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu'. Several of the Hamdanid ghilman, resenting the {{influence}} of Lu'lu', {{went over to the}} Fatimids, who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin. Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued existence as a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in 1002, Lu'lu' assassinated Sa'id al-Dawla and assumed control of Aleppo in his own name.|$|E

At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16.

5|$|The {{prospect}} of expanding KeyArena resurfaced on March 6, 2008, when Microsoft CEO {{at that time}} Steve Ballmer, promised that his investor group would pay half of the $300 million needed for an extensive renovation; the rest was to be provided by the city and county. However, when the state legislature did not give approval for the county to provide funds by an April 10 deadline, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said that the effort had failed and the city's hopes <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> its lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and his men}} <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> Texas {{for several}} months before {{returning}} to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the border area, Anderson led raids in Cooper and Johnson County, Missouri, robbing local residents. On June 12, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and robbing 12. After the attack, one of Anderson's guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in Southeast Jackson County, Anderson's group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce to declare that rebels {{had taken over the}} area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed hand signals to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|During the 44-year {{reign of}} Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang dynasty reached its height, {{a golden age}} with low {{economic}} inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court. Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished {{the death penalty in}} the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (these were relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730). Xuanzong bowed to the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions. His staunch Confucian chancellor Zhang Jiuling (673–740) worked to reduce deflation and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, while his aristocratic and technocratic successor Li Linfu (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage. After 737 most of Xuanzong's confidence <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> his long-standing chancellor Li Linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals. This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.|$|E
5|$|In Lancashire's first innings, King bowled 27 overs {{and took}} 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire's first innings score, but their lead was quickly {{overtaken}} in Lancashire's second innings. With the wind strong over King's left shoulder, {{the scene was}} set for him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he yorked one of Lancashire's opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. He clean bowled two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled a stump {{out of the ground}} in the third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> the field. One batsman was run out before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{was second}} in his heat of the 200m {{freestyle}} heat {{in a time of}} 1m 54.86s, but was four seconds off the pace and did not qualify for the final.

The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event.

5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by a draw against Lancashire at Old Trafford; {{this was the first time}} the tourists had failed to win since arriving in England. Barnes made 31 in both innings after the first day was washed out; the match ended in a draw. Barnes was <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent match against Nottinghamshire, which saw a second consecutive draw. He returned for the next game against Hampshire, as Australia had another scare. On a drying pitch, the hosts dismissed Australia for 117 in reply to 195; this was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. Barnes made 20. Hampshire fell for 103 in their second innings to leave Australia a target of 182, which was reached to seal an eight-wicket win, despite Barnes falling for a duck. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex and Barnes was rested as Australia dismissed the hosts for 86 and replied with 5/549 declared before completing another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} house {{located in}} the southern part of Van Cortlandt Park was erected by Frederick Van Cortlandt in 1748. This house still stands, making it the oldest surviving building in the Bronx. The estate the house sits on was of major importance during the American Revolution. Troops from both the British and Colonial American armies <b>rested</b> <b>in</b> this house during the time of war. The Van Cortlandt family owned the property until they decided to sell both the house and land to the City of New York in 1886. Ten years later, the house was restored as a museum displaying the culture and lifestyle of 18th-century families. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1967 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1976.|$|E
