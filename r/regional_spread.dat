50|$|Turkey {{considers}} its {{friendship with}} Albania as important {{due to the}} context of state relations with Greece and through policy have exploited difficulties arising in Albanian-Greek relations. Having a powerful ally in Turkey has suited Albania at times regarding difficult interstate relations with Greece. Albania's emergence in the Balkans as a key NATO partner contributed to good and stronger Albanian-Turkish relations, in particular relating to military matters. The military alliance during the 1990s between Turkey and Albania was also aimed against Serbia in case a war over Kosovo had a wider <b>regional</b> <b>spread.</b> Greece has expressed concerns regarding Turkish relations with Albania and interpreted them as an anti-Greek measure to isolate Greece within the wider context of Albania being a potential outlet for expanding Muslim influence and Turkey allying with Muslim populations in the Balkans. Turkey {{on the other hand}} claimed Greece increased tensions within the region and conveyed concerns relating to Albanian and Greek polemics with Ankara expressing a partial bias on Albania's side angering the Greeks. Greece, aware of Albanian-Turkish military agreements denounced Turkey's interference in Greek affairs. Though not officially considered in Turkey as a rival within Albania, during the unrest of 1997 Greece was able to become an influential actor in Albania and the early period of the Kosovo crisis (1998-1999) when Albanian officials looked to Greece for assistance.

50|$|Overall {{bilateral}} relations during the 1990s between Albania and Turkey {{continued to be}} good. Turkey considers its friendship with Albania as important due to the context of state relations with Greece and through policy have exploited difficulties arising in Albanian-Greek relations. Having a powerful ally in Turkey has suited Albania at times regarding difficult interstate relations with Greece. Relations with Albania allow Turkey to potentially exert pressure on Greece on two fronts. Reports during the 1990s alluded to Turkey obtaining military bases in Albania {{along the border with}} Greece allowing Turkey to encircle that country and such developments are viewed as a threat by the Greek side. The military alliance during the 1990s between Turkey and Albania was also aimed against Serbia in case a war over Kosovo had a wider <b>regional</b> <b>spread.</b> Greece has expressed concerns regarding Turkish relations with Albania and interpreted them as an anti-Greek measure to isolate Greece within the wider context of Albania being a potential outlet for expanding Muslim influence and Turkey allying with Muslim populations in the Balkans. Turkey on the other hand claimed Greece increased tensions within the region and conveyed concerns relating to Albanian and Greek polemics with Ankara expressing a partial bias on Albania's side angering the Greeks. Greece, aware of Albanian-Turkish military agreements denounced Turkey's interference in Greek affairs. Some conservative Serbs expressed concerns over Albanian-Turkish relations while some Greeks feared that Turkey was attempting to revive the Ottoman era. Turkey denied those charges and its activist approach in Albania during those years was toward generating stable and secular approaches with localised solutions for problems in the region and to safeguard economic interests in the Balkans. Though not officially considered in Turkey as a rival within Albania, during the unrest of 1997 Greece was able to become an influential actor in Albania and the early period of the Kosovo crisis (1998-1999) when Albanian officials looked to Greece for assistance. Turkey viewed the government (1997-1998) of Fatos Nano as having a pro-Greek orientation and expressed some dissatisfaction though during that time still maintained close military relations with Albania in rebuilding its armed forces and a military base. The resumption of closer Albanian-Turkish relations ensured during the Kosovo crisis that made both countries act along the same policy lines toward Slobodan Milošević and the issue of Greater Serbia.|$|E

40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) of tongue is an aggressive {{head and neck}} cancer with high propensity of <b>regional</b> <b>spreading</b> and invasion. Tongue carcinoma cells treated with curcumin, the major curcuminoid of the turmeric, demonstrated reduction in adhesion, migration, and invasion ability. High-throughput microarray analysis indicated that curcumin treatment suppressed matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP 10) expression. MMP 10 is overexpressed in tongue carcinoma tissues {{in comparison with the}} normal epithelia. Curcumin treatment on tongue carcinoma cell lines suppressed MMP 10 expression at both mRNA and protein levels.

Immunoblotting of fungal extracts showed that the gp 43 glycoprotein is responsible for adhesion. This was confirmed by binding assays using purified gp 43, with a Kd of 3. 7 nM. The coating of P. brasiliensis yeast forms with laminin before injection into hamster testicles enhanced the fungus virulence, resulting in a faster and more severe granulomatous disease.

A series of 74 patients with carcinoma of the tongue and floor of the mouth were analyzed. All the patients were surgically treated during the period 1991 - 1995.

40|$|Amyloid imaging is a {{valuable}} tool for research and diagnosis in dementing disorders. As positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have limited spatial resolution, measured signals are distorted by partial volume effects. Various techniques have been proposed for correcting partial volume effects, {{but there is no}} consensus as to whether these techniques are necessary in amyloid imaging, and, if so, how they should be implemented. We evaluated a two-component partial volume correction technique and a <b>regional</b> <b>spread</b> function technique using both simulated and human Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging data. Both correction techniques compensated for partial volume effects and yielded improved detection of subtle changes in PiB retention. However, the <b>regional</b> <b>spread</b> function technique was more accurate in application to simulated data. Because PiB retention estimates depend on the correction technique, standardization is necessary to compare results across groups. Partial volume correction has sometimes been avoided because it increases the sensitivity to inaccuracy in image registration and segmentation. However, our results indicate that appropriate PVC may enhance our ability to detect changes in amyloid deposition...|$|E
40|$|The 3 He/ 4 He {{ratio and}} helium {{concentration}} have been {{measured in the}} vent fluids and the dispersing plume of the Rainbow hydrothermal site, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The 3 He/ 4 He ratio (7. 51 Ra) and 3 He end-member concentration (25 pmol/kg) {{are in the range}} of observed values elsewhere on mid-ocean ridges, pointing to the relative homogeneity of the upper mantle with respect to helium isotope geochemistry. 3 He is linearly correlated with methane and manganese throughout the plume, with CH 4 / 3 He and Mn/ 3 He ratios identical to those measured in the hot fluids. The bulk residence time of the plume in the rift valley estimated from the plume 3 He budget is V 20 days. The 3 He flux transported by the plume, calculated from current-meter data, is 12. 3 : 3 nmol/s, requiring a flux of 490 kg/s of high-temperature fluid. The scaling of the heat flux emitted by the Rainbow site to that of 3 He, using the 3 He/heat ratio measured in the hydrothermal fluids (9. 3 : 2 U 10318 mol/J), indicates a heat output of 1320 MW. With a <b>regional</b> <b>spreading</b> rate of V 25 mm/year, we calculate that the annual 3 He flux for this section of the MAR is of the order of 0. 5 : 0. 2 mmol per kilometre of ridge per millimetre of newly formed crust. This figure compares well with the flux calculated for the neighbouring Lucky Strike segment. Although the uncertainties remain large, both fluxes are V 40 - 50 % above the world average (0. 33 mmol/km/mm), thus supporting earlier suggestions that the intensity of the hydrothermal activity south of the Azores is higher than expected from the <b>regional</b> <b>spreading</b> rate...|$|R
