25|$|Romansh is used {{to varying}} extents in newspapers, the radio, and {{television}}. Radio and television broadcasts in Romansh are produced by the Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha, {{which is part of}} the Swiss public broadcasting company SRG SSR. The radio Radio Rumantsch broadcasts a 24-hour program including informational and music broadcasts. The broadcasters generally speak their own <b>regional</b> <b>dialect</b> on the air, which is considered a key factor in familiarizing Romansh speakers with the dialects outside their home region. News broadcasts are generally in the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun. The two local radio stations Radio Grischa and Radio Engiadina occasionally broadcast in Romansh, but primarily use German. The Televisiun Rumantscha airs regular broadcasts on SF 1, which are subtitled in German. Programs include the informational broadcast Telesguard, which is broadcast daily from Monday to Friday. The children's show Minisguard and the informational broadcast Cuntrasts are aired on weekends. Additionally, the shows Controvers, Pled sin via, and others are broadcast during irregular intervals.|$|E

2500|$|By that moment, Straucher's {{option in}} favor of Jewish secularism and {{modernization}} possibly became a reevaluation of Yiddish as a national Jewish language. Reportedly, his advocacy of both autonomy and Yiddishist identity was largely shaped by the [...] "Folkist" [...] ideology of Jewish groups in the Russian Empire. The Yiddishist view, which placed him among the first Jewish intellectuals to identify with what had been hitherto viewed as a <b>regional</b> <b>dialect</b> of German (reportedly, Straucher himself had earlier designated Yiddish as merely a [...] "jargon"), brought him into conflict with Jewish traditionalists, who supported instead a Hebrew revival. However, Straucher did not support education in Yiddish, and favored German-language schools, for which he demanded special Jewish inspectors and teachers.|$|E

50|$|Such disdain {{may not be}} {{restricted}} to points of grammar; speakers often criticize regional accents and vocabulary as well. Arguments related to <b>regional</b> <b>dialects</b> must center on questions of what constitutes Standard English.

2500|$|Similarly, the moraic obstruent [...] {{corresponds}} to a reduced stop syllable. Contrary to the standard language, the moraic obstruent may occur word medially before any other sound except the moraic nasal. It may also occur in word-final position, which means that its phonetic realization cannot be immediately determined within the lexical unit. Like the moraic nasal, its place of articulation is mostly determined by the following consonant. Before other stops and fricatives, it assimilates, creating an effect of gemination. Before nasal syllables, the moraic obstruent may be realized, depending on the <b>regional</b> <b>dialect,</b> as a glottal stop , so that [...] "fox" [...] is pronounced [...] Other dialects exhibit gemination in this position, so that the latter is pronounced [...] instead. At the end of utterances and in isolation, the moraic obstruent is predictably realized as a glottal stop , which may also suggest that a parallelism exists between the glottal stop in interjections and the moraic obstruent in standard Japanese itself.|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1922 that Kenji began {{composing}} {{the poetry}} {{that would make}} up his first collection, Haru to Shura. The day his sister died, November 27, 1922, he composed three long poems commemorating her, which Keene states {{to be among the}} best of his work. Keene also remarks that the speed at which Kenji composed these poems was characteristic of the poet, as a few months prior he had composed three long poems, one more than 900 lines long, in three days. The first of these poems on the death of his sister was , which was the longest. Keene calls it the most affecting of the three. It is written {{in the form of a}} [...] "dialogue" [...] between Kenji and Toshi (or Toshiko, as he often calls her). Several lines uttered by his sister are written in a <b>regional</b> <b>dialect</b> so unlike Standard Japanese that Kenji provided translations at the end of the poem. The poem lacks any kind of regular meter, but draws its appeal from the raw emotion it expresses; Keene suggests that Kenji learned this poetic technique from Sakutarō Hagiwara.|$|E
2500|$|Old Church Slavonic {{language}} is {{developed in the}} First Bulgarian Empire and was taught in Preslav (Bulgarian capital between 893 and 972), and in Ohrid (Bulgarian capital between 991/997 and 1015). It did not represent one <b>regional</b> <b>dialect</b> but a generalized form of early eastern South Slavic, which cannot be localized. The existence of two major literary centres in the Empire led in the period from the 9th to the 11th centuries {{to the emergence of}} two recensions (otherwise called [...] "redactions"), termed [...] "Bulgarian" [...] and [...] "Macedonian" [...] respectively. Some researchers do not differentiate between manuscripts of the two recensions, preferring to group them together in a [...] "Macedo-Bulgarian" [...] or simply [...] "Bulgarian" [...] recension. Others, as Horace Lunt, have changed their opinion with time. In the mid-1970s, Lunt held that the differences in the initial OCS were neither great enough nor consistent enough to grant a distinction between a 'Macedonian' recension and a 'Bulgarian' one. A decade later, however, Lunt argued in favour of such a distinction, illustrating his point with paleographic, phonological and other differences. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighboring cultures, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity.|$|E

2500|$|One {{feature that}} {{separates}} the Rhenish varieties from Ladin is the retention of the rounded front vowels [...] and [...] (written ü and ö) in Ladin, which have been unrounded in the other dialects, as in Ladin , Sursilvan , Surmiran meir ‘wall’ or Ladin [...] to Rhenish [...] ‘cheese’. Another {{is the development of}} Latin -CT-, which has developed into /tɕ/ in the Rhenish varieties as in détg ‘said’ or fatg ‘did’, while developing into /t/ in Ladin (dit and fat). A feature separating Sursilvan from Central Romansh however, involves the extent of palatalization of Latin K in front of A, which is rare in Sursilvan but common in the other varieties: Sursilvan , Sutsilvan tgea, Surmiran tgesa, Putèr , and Vallader [...] 'house'. Overall however, the Central Romansh varieties do not share many unique features, but rather connect Sursilvan and Ladin through a succession of numerous small dialect differences from one village to the next. [...] The dialects of Romansh are not always mutually comprehensible. Speakers of Sursilvan and Ladin, in particular, are usually unable to understand each other initially. Because speakers usually identify themselves primarily with their <b>regional</b> <b>dialect,</b> many do not take the effort to attempt to understand unfamiliar dialects, and prefer to speak Swiss German with speakers of other varieties. A common Romansh identity is not widespread outside of intellectual circles, even though this has been changing among the younger generation.|$|E
