5|$|After the {{convention}} many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him {{as head of}} the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators.

5|$|Breckinridge {{was born}} near Lexington, Kentucky to a {{prominent}} local family. After non-combat service during the Mexican–American War, {{he was elected}} as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1849, where he took a states' rights position against interference with slavery. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850, he allied with Stephen A. Douglas {{in support of the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act. After <b>reapportionment</b> in 1854 made his re-election unlikely, he declined to run for another term. He was nominated for vice-president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention to balance a ticket headed by James Buchanan. The Democrats won the election, but Breckinridge had little influence with Buchanan and, as presiding officer of the Senate, could not express his opinions in debates. In 1859, he was elected to succeed Senator John J. Crittenden at the end of Crittenden's term in 1861. As vice president, Breckinridge joined Buchanan in supporting the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas, which led to a split in the Democratic Party.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of gerrymandering. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties. Rather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan redistricting commissions. The states of Washington, Arizona, and California's Proposition 11 (2008) and Proposition 20 (2010) have created standing committees for redistricting following the 2010 census.

5000|$|He {{represented}} the Central Valley {{in both the}} Assembly and Senate through three <b>reapportionments</b> - overcoming determined efforts to defeat him. His straightforward, no-nonsense approach to government earned him strong support in the district, {{as it did in}} the State Capitol. He served in the Assembly from 1970-1978. He was a candidate for Governor in 1978 and finished third in a crowded primary. Although he was not successful, the campaign elevated the [...] "unknown Assembly from Fresno" [...] to the ranks of state political leadership. It also raised the conscience of the state with respect to the power of the Central Valley and the agricultural vote. He was elected in a special election in 1979 to the State Senate where he served as Chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus 1979-1983. He served as Republican Leader of the State Senate 1987-1995. Term Limits ended his political career in 1998. In 1999, Maddy joined the international public relations and public affairs firm of Fleishman-Hillard as Senior Vice-President and Partner.|$|R
50|$|When Albertis Harrison {{was elected}} Attorney General, Hutcheson {{ran for the}} vacant seat and was elected and re-elected three times. This was a {{part-time}} position, and {{he also had a}} private legal practice with Larry N. Jones.

Mann in 1963). In 1957 and 1961, District 7 encompassed Brunswick, Lunenburg and Mecklenburg Counties. For the 1965 election, the city of Petersburg, Virginia and Dinwiddie County were added to the district and Lunenberg county moved into the 4th senatorial district. Major restructuring after the 1970 census for the 1971 elections moved Petersburg into the 16th district and Dinwiddie county into the 15th district; Brunswick, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg counties were combined with Amelia, Cumberland, Powhatan and Chesterfield Counties as the 17th District.

Turk also followed Dalton's footsteps in helping to end Massive Resistance and the domination of the Byrd Organization. For the 1963 elections, the district covering the same counties and city was renamed the 20th, and the 21st became what had been the 22nd. The restructuring in the 1965 elections was major: Montgomery and Franklin Counties and the city of Radford were now joined as the 13th district with Carroll and Floyd Counties and the city of Galax (which had been represented as the 14th district by Republican S. Floyd Landreth, who had been the only other Republican in the Senate when Turk began, and who now retired). Restructuring after the 1970 census also proved major: Turk was elected from the 37th district, which included the cities of Radford and Galax, as well as Carroll, Floyd, Grayson and Montgomery Counties.
