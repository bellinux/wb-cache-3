5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers {{got off to}} a 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's new approach to a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> became more inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Headley {{received}} {{news that}} his aunt {{had been killed}} by floods in Kingston which had also destroyed his home.

Instead, Berg sneaked onto {{the roof of the}} hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera. He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E

When the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, he {{wrote a letter to the}} PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal. Only Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when challenged in court.|$|E
50|$|While Parsons {{made little}} {{contribution}} with the bat, his, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's,</b> bowling against opponents Lancashire was expensive, as the match was played {{out to a}} draw.|$|R

5|$|The injury ended Larwood's tour at that point. While the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> {{fulfilled}} the final Australian fixtures before {{embarking on a}} short tour of New Zealand, Larwood returned to England on board SS Otranto. In the Test matches he had been England's most successful bowler, with 33 wickets at 19.52. As a batsman he had scored 145 runs, averaging 24.16.

Back on board Enterprise, he collapses on the transporter platform, and soon dies of heart-failure in Sickbay.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who {{were looking for a}} secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E
5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into Dreams....|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the match}} against Brazil, Rapinoe was named ESPN's Next Level Player of the Week for {{completing}} 5 of 10 crosses while the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> was 0 for 18. She served an {{assist in the}} semifinal against France in which the United States won 3–1. During the dramatic final match against Japan in front of 48,817 spectators at sold-out Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt and a record-breaking international television audience, Rapinoe served her third assist of the tournament to Alex Morgan who scored the game-opening goal in the 69th minute. The United States tied Japan 2–2 during regular and overtime leading to their second penalty kick shootout of the tournament. They were defeated 3–1 in penalties and concluded the tournament with a silver medal. Rapinoe's tournament record included one goal and three assists. She played in all six games for the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team.</b> It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control {{to make it an}} official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E

50|$|In July of that year, {{just two}} months after the league began, it folded. St. Catharines, <b>the</b> top <b>team</b> in <b>the</b> league, started the trend on July 21 and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> {{followed}} suit <b>the</b> next day.|$|R
5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up decent numbers; the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E
5|$|Joan Marie Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the {{navigator}} of the Nostromo and {{the only}} other woman on the ship besides Ripley. Disinclined to take risks beyond her console, she resents being chosen {{as part of the}} team to explore the Derelict. After Kane's infestation by the facehugger, she berates Ripley for refusing to allow her and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> aboard. When the Alien begins to kill her crew, Lambert insists that they evacuate the Nostromo. While preparing to leave on a shuttle, Lambert and Parker are confronted by the Alien which kills them. During Ripley's ICC tribunal, fifty-seven years after the first incident, a screen details the deceased members of the Nostromo crew (including Lambert, who is revealed as a trans woman).|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett's fall for 37. The {{following}} four batsmen {{were unable to}} establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20. Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving; it took a run out to remove Morris. Australia were eventually out for 389. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs as the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E
5000|$|Eight {{teams were}} divided into two groups, Oman (The host nation) was in group A, The UAE (The holder) in group B, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> were placed in a pot based on October 2008's FIFA ranking.|$|R
