A theoretical analysis of pulse shaper and bar size effects on the <b>rising</b> <b>time</b> of incident wave has been conducted.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} to the creating of pulse-shaping techniques that meet the requirements associated with operation of a large fusion laser are examined. These techniques are passive pulse-shaping with double-etalone devices that coherently add or stack short pulses from a modelocked oscillator, and active pulse-shaping with pockels cells to carve a shaped pulse from a much longer pulse generated by a q-switched oscillator. The passive pulse shaper consists of two high-reflectivity mirrors and a wedge with partially transmitting coatings and produces a train of pulses from a single input pulse. The principal advantage of the passive approach is that timing, pulse shape and attenuation depend solely on the device geometry and coatings. Pockels cells {{have been used for}} many years to slice a variable-width pulse from a longer q-switched pulse. Pulse-shaping applications require optical-pulse <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> under 200 ps. Measurements of optical <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> in cylindrical ring-electrode pockels cells of potassium-dideuterium phosphate indicate that 200 - to 300 -ps <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> can be reached in existing devices and somewhat shorter <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> can be achieved in the future.

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E
500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E
