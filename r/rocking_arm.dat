25|$|Drive {{was taken}} from the <b>rocking</b> <b>arm</b> of an exhaust valve, a lever fixed to the valve housing {{transmitting}} impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by Leutnant Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "first position", the {{receiver}} floats facing upward while the provider supports {{the receiver}}'s {{head in the}} crook of one arm and maintains gentle traction of the spine {{from the base of the}} skull (occiput) to the base of the spine (sacrum). The provider gently sways from leg to leg ("horse to horse stance") or forcefully moves in deep lunges in alternating directions ("warrior to warrior stance"), producing rocking and wave patterns in the receiver. Typical Watsu moves use turbulent drag to produce traction and softly stretch the limbs and torso. Movements include slow <b>rocking,</b> <b>arm</b> and leg stretches, trunk rotations and stretches, and various oscillation and pulsing patterns. Moves are repeated on both sides for balance.|$|E
50|$|Running {{through the}} middle of the drums are two {{separate}} shafts, for input and output. Both end with a cam (obscured in the attached sketch), which via a follower and a <b>rocking</b> <b>arm</b> holds one end of each rope. If the input shaft rotates from the null position, its cam raises or lowers the input follower, which via the rocking input arm tensions the rope on one drum and slackens the other. In that state, one drum applies much greater traction than the other, resulting in both the output shaft and a cage mounting the input and output arms moving to track the input. As soon as the cage and the output shaft have moved to the correct position, the tension in the two ropes regains equilibrium and relative motion stops. In this way, the motion of the output shaft closely tracks the motion of the input, although the torque applied to it is the torque of the motor driving the system, as opposed to the much smaller torque applied to the input shaft.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. LTCC films {{constrained}} by rigid substrate were sintered at different temperatures ranging from 760 °C to 800 °C. An optical dilatometer {{together with a}} <b>rocking</b> <b>arm</b> was employed to record sintering strains of the constrained films during the sintering process. The densification behavior of constrained films was systematically studied through the measured sintering strains by comparing with that of freely sintered films. For the constrained films, the final density was smaller and the activation energy for the densification was larger {{than that of the}} freely sintered ones. Moreover, anisotropic microstructure was induced by the tensile stress...|$|E

50|$|<b>Rock</b> River <b>Arms</b> {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by brothers Mark and Chuck Larson. Between 1981 and 1991 the Larsons worked at Springfield Armory, Inc., where Mark was the head armorer. From Springfield Armory, the Larsons went into partnership with Les Baer to form Les Baer Custom and build custom 1911 pistols. Parting ways with Les Baer in 1993, the Larsons began to build AR-15 type rifles for Eagle Arms in Coal Valley, Illinois. At around the same time, they began their own venture, Tolerance Plus (the name was later changed to <b>Rock</b> River <b>Arms),</b> producing custom 1911 pistols. The Larson brothers severed their connection with Eagle Arms in 1997 when that firm moved to Geneseo, Illinois. At the same time, <b>Rock</b> River <b>Arms</b> began to build AR-15 style rifles. For a time, <b>Rock</b> River <b>Arms</b> produced M1911 pattern pistols in addition to rifles, however eventually they dropped that line and now focus their production exclusively on AR-15 pattern rifles.|$|R

The referee, however, took it away from him, which led to an argument between Triple H and the referee; the mishap prompted Triple H to push the referee down. The referee disqualified Triple H for this action; thus, The Rock won the match. After the match, Mankind ran in to save The Rock from Triple H and Chyna.|$|R
