However, RBT may (and should) also be used for internal testing teams even though in such cases a penalty/reward mechanism is harder to implement.Another good use of RBT is for establishing the necessary framework for measured continuous improvement in which results from previous periods can serve as a baseline for following period’s targets.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the work}} of the Oxford Nutrition Survey was carried out by a small mobile team, which was sent to {{industrial}} towns, such as Accrington, Merthyr, Chesterfield, and Dundee. It was experience in organising and managing all the facets of this work that made Hugh the most clearly qualified person to be invited by the Dutch Government in exile to conduct surveys of the nutritional status of the Dutch population affected by the famine of the last months of the war in Europe. Following hectic preparations, Hugh and his team went to the Netherlands as the Nutrition Survey Group SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force), just before the German surrender. He found a base in Leiden, where 26,000 biochemical analyses were said to have been carried out in just two weeks. The pace was hectic without doubt for the Oxford team and for their Dutch colleagues, but the situation was dire. The actual state of the famine needed to be assessed, treatment and response recorded, and the <b>results</b> <b>set</b> out to inform future action in parallel circumstances. Medically, the best treatment needed to be discovered and applied.|$|E
5000|$|The first inter-zone {{semifinal}} between Denmark and Malaysia was the shocker of the series. The Danes {{once again}} fielded {{a squad of}} [...] "name" [...] players (complete with three alternates), though a few were now on the downside of their careers. By contrast the Malaysian team consisted of relative unknowns, though three consecutive hard-fought ties had given them valuable experience. The redoubtable Svend Pri, now 31, led off for Denmark with a decisive straight games win over Phu Ah Hua. In the next match, however, Flemming Delfs, {{less than a year}} away from capturing the World Singles Championship in the familiar Scandinavian climate, faltered in the heat and humidity after winning the first game against Saw Swee Leong. Those <b>results</b> <b>set</b> the pattern for the tie; Denmark could win matches that counted only when Pri was on the court. At 4 - 3 in favor of Malaysia Pri was finally unable to carry partner Steen Skovgaard to victory against Dominic Soong and Cheah Hong Chong. The jubillant young Malaysians had reached the Thomas Cup final against form, losing an anticlimactic final match to make the score 5 - 4.|$|E
