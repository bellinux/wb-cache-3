40|$|Vibrations {{associated}} with external disturbances and rotor faults, such as cracks, usually exhibit themselves as harmonic {{components of the}} synchronous frequency. The essence of the multi-frequency form of the synchronous recursive open loop adaptive controller (<b>ROLAC)</b> {{is that it can}} minimise a number of vibration components simultaneously, for example, synchronous rotor vibration at frequency Ω, its harmonics and sub-harmonics within any defined range. This requires on-line identification of the speed dependent partial receptance matrix by using a multifrequency test signal incorporating all of the pertinent harmonic components. The question arises: What is the degradation in performance if the rotor comes into contact with its retainer bearing? This may arise when a magnetically levitated rotor is installed on a movable base frame, for example on board a ship or an aircraft. A simulation study is described to examine this question. It comprises a flexible rotor supported by two active magnetic bearings. Eight displacement transducers are positioned along the rotor. A local PID controller is provided for each axis of the magnetic bearings to ensure stability and alignment of the rotor at a central position. An outer <b>ROLAC</b> loop is incorporated at each bearing to control the vibrations at discrete frequencies of 0. 5 Ω, Ω, 2 Ω and 3 Ω. In addition, a multi-frequency disturbance was applied to the rotor causing contact with its retainer bearing. The performance of the multi-frequency <b>ROLAC</b> is assessed in preventing contact, or recovering the rotor position if contact occurs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in magnetic bearing applications because of their advantages for contactless sup-port, high-speed operation, vibration control, condition mon-itoring and fault diagnostics. However, they have limited force capacity and have to incorporate retainer bearings to protect the laminations when vibration levels reach the clearance level. Retainer bearings can take {{a relatively small number}} of rotor drops followed by machine shutdown. There are many potential applications where transient events or sudden changes in operating conditions could drive the rotor into contact with retainer bearings. These include land, sea and air transport applications, which are exposed to external inputs and disturbances, and system shut down is not acceptable. This paper describes the application of a Recursive Open Loop Adaptive Controller (<b>ROLAC),</b> an adaptive and fast acting controller, to prevent contact between a flexible rotor and retainer bearing. If however contact does occur, then the control action will minimize the damage and recover the rotor position without the need to shut down the system. It is assumed that the magnetic bearings are fully operational and contact is due to external disturbances such as sudden un-balance, base excitation, blade loss or damage. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm. Index Terms — Magnetic bearings, contact dynamics, re-cursive Fourier transform, adaptive control...|$|E
40|$|This Final Report {{summarizes}} the IIASA {{contributions to the}} SLCP Assessment for LAC project. IIASA has delivered all agreed outputs with respect to modelling work required to develop baseline and mitigation scenarios where key SLCP mitigation measures were identified. The results in form of gridded emission fields were provided to the impact and climate modelling groups involved in the project. The developed protocol for data collection allowed to acquire a harmonized data set on emissions within the region for which {{a number of issues}} were identified and it was compared with the GAINS database, leading to its improvement. This exchange between the national experts and IIASA modelling team opens up a possibility for further collaboration where also <b>ROLAC</b> will play a role as the information has been stored there. The final historical inventories have been harmonized with the global GAINS database and served development of scenarios. While the GAINS model has been further developed to consider specific LAC circumstances and availability of new data, the baseline and mitigation scenarios were developed in a consistent way with the global UNEP/WMO Assessment allowing a comparison of the results. The finally selected SLCP measures include additional options which were not part of the global assessment, for example, reduction of gas flaring, introduction of Marques brick kilns, shale gas options, and options to mitigate HFCs...|$|E
40|$|Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) systems offer various {{advantages}} over conventional bearings {{but due to}} their limited force capacity, {{with high levels of}} vibrations the rotor may come into contact with retainer bearings. Under conventional PID control, when a rotor comes into contact with its retainer bearings it remains in contact, until the rotor is run down and the system shut down. This may not be acceptable in some applications, such as aerospace and automotive applications. In this paper, a recursive open-loop adaptive control (<b>ROLAC)</b> algorithm is presented, {{as an extension of the}} existing open loop adaptive controller (OLAC), that updates the control force amplitude and phase at each sampling period for rapid response to changes in external excitations. The effectiveness of the algorithm in counteracting a sudden change of rotor unbalance is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results. The experimental system consists of a flexible 2 m long rotor with a mass of 100 kg supported by two radial active magnetic bearings. A simulation model of the system, including the contact dynamics, was used to assess the feasibility of the suggested controller before applying it to the experimental system. Depending on excitation levels, it is shown that the proposed controller is fast enough to prevent contact in most cases. If contact does occur the impact is minimized, and the method is able to recover the rotor position quickly. The proposed controller is implemented in real time and applied to the experimental system. It is shown that the controller works efficiently as predicted by the simulation studies...|$|E
