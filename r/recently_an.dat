5|$|<b>Recently,</b> <b>an</b> {{analysis}} of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia {{have shown that}} the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|More <b>recently,</b> <b>an</b> {{alternative}} {{approach has been}} applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E

5|$|<b>Recently</b> <b>an</b> {{alternative}} proteasome {{was identified}} in human cells that lack the α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more <b>recently,</b> <b>an</b> additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is {{moving out of the}} ACC and into the Big Ten, the future of this series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. <b>Recently,</b> <b>an</b> emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E
50|$|Competing in the 5A Division for 25 years, {{the school}} {{captured}} several hundred championship titles (region and state). Such championships include 7 state crowns in baseball (most <b>recently</b> <b>a</b> 5A title in 2002, and a 4A-I title in 2009), 8 state titles in softball (most <b>recently</b> <b>a</b> 5A title in 2005, and 4A-I titles in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012), 11 team state titles in boys' tennis, 6 team state titles in girls' tennis, 9 team state titles in boys' golf (most <b>recently</b> <b>a</b> Division II title in 2011), and 4 team state titles in girls' {{track and field}} (most <b>recently</b> <b>a</b> 4A-I title in 2011).
