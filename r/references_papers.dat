60|$|The spring {{began to}} get far {{advanced}} toward summer. Franval {{paid a visit to}} London; came back {{in the middle of the}} season to Glenwith Grange; wrote to put off his departure for France; and at last (not at all to the surprise of anybody who was intimate with the Welwyns) proposed to Rosamond, and was accepted. He was candor and generosity itself when the preliminaries of the marriage-settlement were under discussion. He quite overpowered Mr. Welwyn and the lawyers with <b>references,</b> <b>papers,</b> and statements of the distribution and extent of his property, which were found to be perfectly correct. His sisters were written to, and returned the most cordial answers; saying that the state of their health would not allow them to come to England for the marriage; but adding a warm invitation to Normandy for the bride and her family. Nothing, in short, could be more straightforward and satisfactory than the baron's behavior, and the testimonies to his worth and integrity which the news of the approaching marriage produced from his relatives and his friends.|$|E
5000|$|At Medicine Lodge, Satanta, a tall, muscular man, came to {{be known}} as the [...] "Orator of the Plains," [...] (although that title may have been a humorous {{reference}} to his long-winded speeches rather than honest praise for his speaking abilities; this is disputed however by the <b>references</b> <b>papers</b> of the day made to his speeches). Like most treaties of the time, these agreements failed utterly to bring peace on the frontier. The treaty assured rule over the vast lands given by treaty to the Kiowa, but white settlers continued to pour across Kiowa lands, and tribesmen, unhappy with the provision that reduced their domain to a small reservation, continued to raid settlements and harass immigrants. This situation, unstable in and of itself, worsened significantly with the death of Dohäsan, the last Kiowa Chief, (over the entire Kiowa People) in 1866. Without his binding personal leadership, Kiowa unity dissolved as a number of subchiefs, Tene-angopte, and, on the other side, Satanta and Guipago (Gui-pah-gho, Lone Wolf), struggled for power and to fill his place. The competition between the three set off a wave of raids across the southern plains from Kansas to Texas during the fall of 1866 and into 1867. In one instance Satanta and a joint Kiowa-Comanche war party raided into the Texas panhandle and, after killing James Box, captured the man's wife and four children, whom they sold to the army at Fort Dodge, Kansas.It is alleged that at Fort Dodge that Satanta, begging for liquor, accidentally drank animal medicine and was given pills that only made him even more sick. In revenge Satanta burned Hay belonging to Mr. Coryell opposite the fort and killed three woodchoppers as well.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a series}} of cosmological {{simulations}} that includes one dark-matter-only (DM-only) run, one gas cooling-star formation-supernovae feedback (CSF) run and one that additionally includes feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we classify the large-scale structures with both a velocity-shear-tensor code (Vweb) and a tidal-tensor code (Pweb). We find that the baryonic processes have almost no impact on large-scale structures [...] at least not when classified using aforementioned techniques. More importantly, our results confirm that the gas component alone {{can be used to}} infer the filamentary structure of the Universe practically un-biased, which could be applied to cosmology constrains. In addition, the gas filaments are classified with its velocity (Vweb) and density (Pweb) fields, which can theoretically connect to the radio observations, such as HI surveys. This will help us to bias-freely link the radio observations with DM distributions at large scale. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, matched to the MNRAS accepted version (V 2).

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} the currently published scientific {{evidence for the}} venous flow effects of mechanical devices, particularly intermittent pneumatic compression, and the relation to prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Summary Background Data: While intermittent pneumatic compression is an established method of DVT prophylaxis, the variety of systems that are available can use very different compression techniques and sequences. In order for appropriate choices {{to be made to}} provide the optimum protection for patients, the general performance of systems, and physiological effects of particular properties, must be analyzed objectively. Methods: Medline was searched from 1970 to 2002, and all relevant papers were searched for further appropriate <b>references.</b> <b>Papers</b> were selected for inclusion when they addressed specifically the questions posed in this review. Results: All the major types of intermittent compression systems are successful in emptying deep veins of the lower limb and preventing stasis in a variety of subject groups. Compression stockings appear to function more by preventing distension of veins. Rapid inflation, high pressures, and graded sequential intermittent compression systems will have particular augmentation profiles, but {{there is no evidence that}} such features improve the prophylactic ability of the system. Conclusions: The most important factors in selecting a mechanical prophylactic system, particularly during and after surgery, are patient compliance and the appropriateness of the site of compression. There is no evidence that the peak venous velocity produced by a system is a valid measure of medical performance...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Qualitative {{systematic}} reviews or {{qualitative evidence}} syntheses (QES) are increasingly recognised {{as a way}} to enhance the value of systematic reviews (SRs) of clinical trials. They can explain the mechanisms by which interventions, evaluated within trials, might achieve their effect. They can investigate differences in effects between different population groups. They can identify which outcomes are most important to patients, carers, health professionals and other stakeholders. QES can explore the impact of acceptance, feasibility, meaningfulness and implementation-related factors within a real world setting and thus contribute to the design and further refinement of future interventions. To produce valid, reliable and meaningful QES requires systematic identification of relevant qualitative evidence. Although the methodologies of QES, including methods for information retrieval, are well-documented, little empirical evidence exists to inform their conduct and reporting. METHODS: This structured methodological overview examines papers on searching for qualitative research identified from the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group Methodology Register and from citation searches of 15 key papers. RESULTS: A single reviewer reviewed 1299 <b>references.</b> <b>Papers</b> reporting methodological guidance, use of innovative methodologies or empirical studies of retrieval methods were categorised under eight topical headings: overviews and methodological guidance, sampling, sources, structured questions, search procedures, search strategies and filters, supplementary strategies and standards. CONCLUSIONS: This structured overview presents a contemporaneous view of information retrieval for qualitative research and identifies a future research agenda. This review concludes that poor empirical evidence underpins current information practice in information retrieval of qualitative research. A trend towards improved transparency of search methods and further evaluation of key search procedures offers the prospect of rapid development of search methods...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the experiences of}} designing and producing an ongoing series of experimental interactive satellite transmissions, incorporating live studio broadcasts, ISDN based video conferencing, and asynchronous email/ISDN tutorials. A WWW site acts as a focus for these asynchronous activities, operating as a central hub, providing information and key <b>references</b> (<b>papers,</b> images, case studies, hyperlinks, etc). The convergence of these technologies generates a distributed digital 'space' (satellite footprint covering western Europe, studio space, screen space, WWW space, location/reception space). This space is further developed and extended by the quarterly publication of a paper-based interpretation of content inspired by, or translated from, the digital activity. The digital and paper-based versions of MEDIASP ACE explore a variety of 'spaces'; the WWW space, the computer screen, the studio space, the TV screen, and the printed page. There is also a novel and dynamic set of relationships established between the presenters (studio based), the participant/audience (located across Europe), and the reader. As an electronic publishing experiment in real time ('live' media) delivery, combined with a backbone of pre-packaged information ('dead' media content), the MEDIASP ACE transmissions provide a provocative model for the convergence of 'publishing', 'networked', and 'broadcast' forms and technologies. Whilst the focus {{for some of the}} MEDIASP ACE productions has been to provide a 'learning' environment for the audience/participants, this paper concentrates on the efforts to forge a coherent media 'form' through the convergence of the technologies used. A variety of visual and spatial metaphors were employed to help establish a common reference for locating the dispersed community. However, a variety of information design and 'packaging' techniques used to delivery facts, processes, ideas, and concepts through such a system are discussed...|$|E
