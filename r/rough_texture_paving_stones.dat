Both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the first true leaves of all plants treated by 500 and 700 Gy irradiation showed severe <b>rough</b> <b>texture.</b> For the 100 Gy treatments, the plants possessed either the severe <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> or normal first true leaves, {{and the proportion of}} the plants with textured first true leaves varied among varieties. However, only very light <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> of first true leaves of some of the plants was observed when the dose was 300 Gy. While lethality differed between varieties and with irradiation dosage, all of the varieties showed the same type and extent of appearance of textured first true leaves at each of the doses analysed. The <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> of first true leaves was caused by the rugged surface of those leaves, which most likely resulted from the irregular size and or uneven density of mesophyll cells in the palisade layer. Key words: Mungbean first true leaves, <b>rough</b> <b>texture,</b> gamma irradiation, radio-sensitivity, mesophyll cell...|$|R

40|$|In today {{numerical}} methods developing {{parallel with}} the development of computer technology widely used in the estimation of test results. One these methods Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence method. In this study, tensile strength values of <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> produced by rebound material was developed a model to predict using ANN. In study, 29 unit <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> samples were produced using the rebound material during shotcrete applications {{in order to determine the}} tensile strength of the <b>paving</b> <b>stone.</b> On the produced <b>paving</b> <b>stone</b> samples were made abrasion resistance tests. The performance of the developed ANN model to predict the values of tensile strength was evaluated by the correlation coefficient and average absolute error values. As a result, when evaluating the performance of the ANN model developed, has been shown usable in the tensile strength of the <b>paving</b> <b>stones</b> of ANN approac...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a case}} study on the <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> Company UPI Malang, who is engaged {{in the sale of}} <b>paving</b> <b>stone.</b> The title of this {{research is}} the "Analysis and Design of Accounting Openness in Malang UPI <b>Stone</b> <b>paving</b> company. " The purpose of this research is to assist the Company in preparing the financial statements as a means of accountability. The financial statements are the result of an accounting system should be designed in accordance with the needs so as to provide information about the condition of the Company <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> UPI Malang. These objectives can be achieved by performing two steps: 1). Analyze accounting systems operated by the Company <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> UPI Malang, 2). Based on the results of the analysis, prepared a proper accounting system design for <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> Company UPI Malang. These steps are carried out after it emerged that the company <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> UPI Malang not use an accounting system in the company's operations. The research results are made known to obtain the data that the company <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> UPI Malang not have or use financial statements {{to be able to see}} the company's financial condition, how many properties owned and how much profit is generated. The company so far only recorded sales and receipts in a simple, therefore the financial statements required to provide financial information as a basis for consideration in taking certain decisions of the company. Proper accounting system design can be achieved after the system analysis and improvement of the system operated by the Company. The accounting system is expected to provide recommendations made proper financial reports for UPI Malang <b>Stone</b> <b>Paving</b> Company in the future. The design of accounting systems made by the researchers include the design of transaction procedures, design accounts and account codes, the design cycle of recording, design documents that exist in the Company <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> UPI Malang, design governance structure and job description and design of the financial statements of the Company <b>Paving</b> <b>Stone</b> UPI Malang...|$|R
