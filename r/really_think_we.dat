500|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Junqueira felt {{he could}} have won the race had a caution flag not been displayed. Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame because I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, either. We were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or three abreast while racing in packs.|$|E
2500|$|Durbin {{has also}} been a major proponent of {{expanded}} Amtrak funding and support. In October 2007, he opposed a bill in the Illinois General Assembly that would allow three casinos to be built, saying, [...] "I really, <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to stop and catch our breath and say, 'Is this the future of Illinois? That every time we want to do something we'll just build more casinos?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear cousin, I cannot {{tell how}} it will be," [...] said she. [...] "But I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may suit one another much better than you suppose." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “There’s {{been a lot}} of {{talk about}} consolidation, but I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> are at the point where 2014 will see it happen,” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Odd!--queer!--why, do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> so? <b>We</b> are {{not very}} prudish, to be sure, here in the South--do pretty much as we please--enjoy life, and {{all that sort of}} thing, you know-" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, uncle George!" [...] said Rollo, [...] "that is {{only your}} politeness. But {{then if you}} <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> ought to have some more company, perhaps the Parkmans are going to Holland, and we might go with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. No, no, I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have. Oh, yes--that {{new girl}} Mrs. Bennet engaged {{last week for}} the dairy. What is her name? ...|$|E
6000|$|CLARE. Five years, {{and four}} of them like this! I'm sure we've served our time. Don't you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might get on better together--if I went away? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, that is {{a serious}} consideration," [...] replied Sibyl, {{assuming}} an air of mock alarm, [...] "if you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall be tired of life, whether or no." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miriam gave {{a little}} pull at his hair for reply. [...] "And there is another thing," [...] she continued. [...] "If that is our horse and wagon, don't you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> ought to sell them? They are awful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-night," [...] young Davenant declared, with {{something}} which was suspiciously like a yawn, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> must chuck {{it just a}} little earlier. Shall we say that we leave here at two, {{and get back to}} the hotel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was too bad," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "but <b>really</b> I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{were lucky}} in not doing these little people {{more harm than}} {{breaking}} a cow's leg and a church. They are all so brittle!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{can get the}} {{photographs}} your father wants, Shep?" [...] asked Snap. [...] "It wouldn't be fair to take the offer up and then disappoint him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, and don't you see," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "there {{in front}} of the altar is a space, where I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might make the cross and 'I H S' in holly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} have kept him, if only for Teddy's sake, he was so fond of him, and perhaps baby's love would have done for him what we failed to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> need go away," [...] she said. [...] "They won't notice us, and {{you will}} {{probably}} see something {{that is supposed to}} be characteristically western, though I'm not sure that it really is." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} looked round him, smiling still. [...] "Well, yes; on purpose. Does that {{sound as if}} we should bore you?" [...] he added. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall--I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall. We are rather fond of wandering, too; and we were glad of a pretext." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank goodness!" [...] said Hallett, [...] "that {{will last}} for some time; for really, tinned beef by itself, when a man is exhausted, is {{difficult}} to get down. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> should address a round robin to the P.M.O., begging him to order additional medical comforts, every night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} will go back now, Mr. Pearson. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought {{to be very much}} obliged to those fellows for not sinking us. I wonder what was their motive in letting us off so easily?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Carroll answered, with {{a desperate}} attempt to treat the matter humorously. [...] "But I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> both had a hand in the thing. My partner favored me with his views; I {{disclaim}} some of the responsibility." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I confess, I don't know. And do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could {{liberate}} {{ourselves from}} our belongings if they didn't belong to us? Wouldn't the eternal-womanly still keep putting them away for summer and taking {{them out for}} winter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How refreshing," [...] {{the parents}} would say, [...] "to {{come across a}} man who is not afraid to say what he <b>really</b> <b>thinks.</b> Why are <b>we</b> not all outspoken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And Alexandrina {{also was}} angry when Lady Julia {{repeated}} the same tidings in her hearing. [...] "I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> care {{very much about}} it, Lady Julia," [...] said she, with a little toss of her head. [...] "That's three times we've been told of Miss Dale's good fortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara smiled. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it is. <b>We</b> shall {{come to that}} later, but this, you see, isn't art, but {{something}} greater. It's nature untrammelled, and primeval force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, well; that's {{the same}} thing. It was Givantake, {{though of course}} he isn't going to sign his name to everything. If you could just have written a line to your friend the Postmaster-General, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could have squared it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's from Hetty Hume, and the English mail {{goes out}} to-day," [...] she said. [...] "She {{suggests}} that I should {{come over and}} spend a few months with her. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did what we could for {{her when she was}} here with the Major." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear lady," [...] remonstrated the rector, obediently {{taking his}} hat, [...] "whatever else we may doubt, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may feel {{sure about the}} man's name! It is so remarkably ugly {{that it must be}} genuine. No sane human being would assume such a name as Ozias Midwinter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we were,--and <b>really</b> I didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{had been}} so long. But, Dorothea, there was some one else over there besides Mrs. Sturt, and he kept us." ...|$|R
50|$|I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> what <b>we</b> got {{was a great}} bargain. Nothing we {{selected}} was a real winner that I'd {{fight to the death}} for. In terms of what we had to work with, though, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did the best we could.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saxton," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "is an utterly unprincipled man. I <b>really</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have many like {{him in this}} country. You {{probably}} mistook his reference to Mr. Brooke." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Arthur Wilkinson was {{becoming}} frightened in his mind. [...] "Upon my word," [...] said he, {{as he and}} George were walking the deck at sunrise the next morning, [...] "upon my word, I am getting very tired of this woman, and I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are making a show of ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do think--I do <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{must have}} the COURAGE to use the lower animal life for our needs. I do think there is {{something}} wrong, when we look on every living creature {{as if it were}} ourselves. I do feel, that it is false to project our own feelings on every animate creature. It is a lack of discrimination, a lack of criticism.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How we are improving!" [...] she murmured. [...] "We shall begin moralizing soon. Presently I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall {{compare notes}} about the books we have read and the theatres {{we have been}} to, and before we are gray-headed I think one of us will allude to the weather. Now isn't my brother a {{wonderful}} man? Look at that flush upon Miss Lalonde's cheeks. Aren't you jealous?" ...|$|E
500|$|I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> what <b>we</b> got {{was a great}} bargain. [...] Nothing we {{selected}} was a real winner that I'd {{fight to the death}} for. [...] In terms of what we had to work with, though, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did the best we could.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; I {{call him}} a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But <b>really</b> I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> are {{wandering}} rather far from the point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, Brownie,' Elsie mused once, 'I <b>really</b> {{begin to}} <b>think</b> <b>we</b> must have misjudged Higginson. He's so {{extremely}} polite. Perhaps, after all, {{he is really}} a count, who has been exiled and impoverished for his political opinions.' ...|$|R
