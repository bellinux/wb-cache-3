50|$|Later, {{lead and}} copper {{attracted}} the Romans to Britain. The Romans introduced iron tools and used local slaves to mine galena, an important lead ore mineral, {{from which they}} <b>refined</b> lead, <b>tin</b> and silver.

50|$|Toll tin was not {{the only}} way in which a miner's share of the tin {{extracted}} was reduced — he was also required to pay a tax to the crown on the <b>refined</b> <b>tin</b> known as tin coinage before the tin could legally be sold.|$|E
50|$|In Devon and Cornwall, tin coinage was {{a tax on}} <b>refined</b> <b>tin,</b> {{payable to}} the Duchy of Cornwall and {{administered}} in the Stannary Towns. The oldest surviving records of coinage show that it was collected in 1156. It was abolished by the Tin Duties Act 1838.|$|E
50|$|Toll tin became due {{as soon as}} the ore {{was broken}} from the ground and, {{although}} some freeholders may have taken it in this form, it is likely that others opted for the more practical approach of taking it as a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the <b>refined</b> <b>tin</b> (or white tin).|$|E
50|$|Black tin is the raw ore of tin, usually cassiterite, as sold by a tin mine to a {{smelting}} company.

50|$|The last Thursday - a clear {{week before}} Christmas Day - was {{formerly}} always {{claimed by the}} tinners as a holiday, and was called by them White-Thursday (Jew-whidn), because on this day, according to tradition, black tin (tin ore) was first melted and <b>refined</b> into white <b>tin.</b> From Jew-whidn to Chi-widden is an easy transition.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, the {{majority}} of mainstream pop music fell in two categories: guitar, drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra. Since early in the decade, it was common for pop producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados. At the same time, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from <b>refined</b> <b>Tin</b> Pan Alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched rock guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians.|$|E
5000|$|Yunnan {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{production}} bases of copper, lead, zinc, tin and aluminum in China.

Besides, reserves of germanium, indium, zirconium, platinum, rock salt, sylvite, nickel, phosphate, mirabilite, arsenic and blue asbestos are also high. Significant copper deposits are found at Dongchuan, iron ore at Wuding, and coal at Xuanwei and Kaiyuan. Economic policy to locate new industry in interior areas with substantial mineral wealth, led to major industrial development in Yunnan, especially in the Kunming area.|$|E
25|$|Tin {{production}} in Bolivia {{came to be}} concentrated {{in the hands of}} Bolivian nationals, although the regimes encouraged foreign investment. At first, foreign interests and Bolivians with foreign associations took the major share. This changed, however, when Bolivian tin-mining entrepreneurs realized that smelters in competing countries depended on Bolivian tin. Simón Patiño was the most successful of these tin magnates. Of poor mestizo background, he started as a mining apprentice. By 1924 he owned 50% of the national production and controlled the European <b>refining</b> of Bolivian <b>tin.</b> Although Patiño lived permanently abroad by the early 1920s, the two other leading tin-mining entrepreneurs, Carlos Aramayo and Mauricio Hochschild, resided primarily in Bolivia.|$|R

50|$|Bolivia was a {{founding}} member of the International Tin Council (ITC), a body of twenty-two consumer and producer countries that since 1930 had attempted to regulate tin markets through buffer stocks. Bolivia, however, did not sign the ITC's International Tin Agreements in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1983 Bolivia joined the newly formed Association of Tin Producing Countries, which attempted—unsuccessfully—to control tin prices through a cartel approach to commodity regulation. After a period of decline, tin prices rebounded in the late 1980s. Government policies since the early 1970s had sought to expand the percentage of metallic or <b>refined</b> <b>tin</b> exports that offered greater returns. As a result, smelting increased during the 1970s, but in the 1980s the excessive costs of the nation's highly underutilized smelting operations contributed to the decision to restructure Comibol.|$|E

5000|$|The old ferry {{crossings}} {{were later}} {{to develop into}} the busy river quays of {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries. In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock, four miles by track from the river port of Morwellham, was significant. Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of lime was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous limekilns on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not slaked before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning. Later, street sweepings and other refuse from Plymouth and Devonport, together with bones for the newly discovered bone fertiliser, were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from British Columbia and the Baltic, in large baulks for use as supports in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the mine pumping engines.Tavistock was one of the three stannary towns of Devon and large quantities of <b>refined</b> <b>tin</b> ore were exported through Morwellham from twelfth century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed. The opening of the Tavistock Canal, between Tavistock and Morwellham, in 1817 facilitated traffic. Later, the East Cornwall Mineral Railway provided an outlet through the quays of Calstock from the Cornish side of the valley. [...] Other significant cargoes exported were quarried granite and, later, copper, lead and manganese ores, with their important by-product of arsenic. Arsenic was extracted from mispickel, once regarded as a waste product but later offering an important source of revenue as copper and tin extraction declined in profitability. The refined product was exported worldwide, in particular to the southern United States, where it was used as an insecticide in the cotton fields.|$|E

Oxland believed the cinnabar ore at Sulphur Bank had been formed from hot springs. His thesis stated that hot springs brought metals in a dissolved state from igneous rock deep in the earth through a thick block of metamorphised ancient seabed to form cinnabar ore near the surface of the mine. Oxland also believed the cinnabar deposit was continually forming.Becker came to agree with the Oxland thesis.|$|R

40|$|Myanmar, {{formerly}} known as Burma, has large mineral resources of gemstones and considerable resources of offshore natural gas. Myanmar produced {{a wide variety of}} minerals, which included barite, carbonate rocks, chromium, clays, coal, copper, feldspar, gold, gypsum, lead, natural gas, nickel, petroleum, salt, silver, tin, tungsten, and zinc. The country also produced processed mineral products, which included cement, refined copper, polished precious gemstones, refined gold, refined lead, refined petroleum products, refined silver, crude steel, <b>refined</b> <b>tin,</b> and nitrogen fertilizer materials (table 1). With the exception of precious gemstones, Myanmar’s minerals production was small in quantity and was mostly for domestic consumption. None of Myanmar’s mineral production was of world significance.

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} for integrating multiresolution representations of terrain geometry and terrain texture data is presented. A terrain is modeled by a regular grid, {{which can be}} partially <b>refined</b> by local <b>TINs</b> in order to represent morphologically complex terrain parts. The multiresolution models for terrain texture data and geometry data are closely related: The rendering algorithm selects geometry and texture patches based on screen-space error criteria. Multiple texture hierarchies, which may represent different thematic information layers, can be bound to one terrain model. Multiple textures lead to a drastic improvement of visual quality: Topographic textures {{can be used to}} provide pixel-precise shading, alpha textures can be used to restrict or to highlight thematic textures. Multiple textures facilitate the development of visual interaction tools such as magic lenses, and texture animations. Multitexturing permits an efficient implementation of these conce [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This project {{investigates the}} use of triangulations (TINs) to {{represent}} and compute on very large terrains in GIS. While rasters are very popular, widely available and supported, in theory and in practice, TINs are not as well represented in GIS packages, and particularly in GRASS. However, because the resolution of TINs is not fixed, but adapts to the terrain, TINs {{have the potential to}} be more (space) efficient than rasters, especially for very large terrains. We study the problem of finding a scalable approach for simplifying a raster into a TIN that approximates it within a specified error threshold. By scalable we mean the algorithm should work well as the size of the input raster becomes very large, exceeding the amount of main memory avail-able on the machine. Our module, r. refine, is implemented in GRASS for use and experimentation by the GRASS community. The approach can be extended to simplifying arbitrary point-data and thus could be useful for processing LIDAR data. We present experimental results of r. <b>refine</b> showing that <b>TINs</b> of desired accuracy can be obtained efficiently from (very large) rasters; and, despite all the overhead of storing the topology, TINs are much more space-efficient than rasters of comparable accuracy. For example, for error thresholds of 0. 01 %, a grid of xxx MB can be represented as a TIN of xxx MB, which is a xxx reduction in size. Thus a raster of xxGB can be represented as a TIN of XXMB. This space reduction of TINs is a reason to believe that terrain analysis modules that operate on TINs would be much faster than their counterparts on rasters. ...|$|R
40|$|The role of iron in the {{emergence}} of Iron Age states in North Africa and the Near East has been poorly understood due to a paucity of contemporary, diachronic ferrous archaeometallurgical data. Excavations at Phoenician and Punic Carthage in the 2000 s recovered {{one of the largest and}} most diverse corpora of Iron Age iron production material culture from North Africa and the Near East, spanning the entire history of Carthage from its Tyrian colonial foundations to its destruction by Rome (historical dates 814 - 146 BC). Analysis of the materials employing metallography, portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF), and variable pressure scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy x-ray dispersive spectroscopy (VPSEM-EDS) indicates that Carthaginian smiths were smelting and smithing wrought iron and steel as an exchange good or tribute commodity to Tyre and the Assyrian empire, as well as producing, <b>refining,</b> and consuming <b>tin</b> and arsenical bronzes, leaded bronzes, lead, and cobalt. Archaeological evidence demonstrates a state industry of iron production, including the commissioning, decommissioning, and outsourcing of metallurgical precincts. There is an overwhelming difference exhibited between output capacity at industrial and household production sites. Epigraphic evidence in Punic illustrates the inherent economic and familial affiliations between the Carthaginian state and metalworkers. Ironsmiths, bronze casters, and goldsmiths were privileged engineers of one of the state's most strategic industries, and were stratified in a hierarchy of technical specialties and ranks. In order to conserve fuel and succeed in properly vitrifying ore or bloom impurities into slag, they recycled industrial byproducts in the form of murex shells from purple dye production as a metallurgical flux and lined the furnaces with quartz-rich heat insulation. Carthage was one colony in the Phoenician commodity procurement network, whose task it was to convert iron blooms into final products. By the time this colony became independent of Tyre ca. 650 - 550 BC, the smiths of Carthage already had around a century of expertise in the production of iron and steel implements which gave the state a competitive advantage in the strategic arena of ferrous technologies and the formation of empire...|$|R
