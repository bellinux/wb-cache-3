5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the <b>resulting</b> <b>amount</b> per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

25|$|The Mark-to-Market Margin (MTM margin) on {{the other}} hand is the margin {{collected}} to offset losses (if any) that have already been incurred on the positions held by a firm. This is computed as the difference between the cost of the position held and the current market value of that position. If the <b>resulting</b> <b>amount</b> is a loss, the amount is collected from the firm; else, the amount may be returned to the firm (the case with most clearing houses) or kept in reserve depending on local practice. In either case, the positions are 'marked-to-market' by setting their new cost to the market value used in computing this difference. The positions held by the clients of the exchange are marked-to-market daily and the MTM difference computation for the next day would use the new cost figure in its calculation.|$|E

50|$|Drawbacks of {{automated}} {{solutions are}} the costs for robots, maintenance and consumables {{as well as}} the complicated setup of the process.

The <b>resulting</b> <b>amount</b> of data from the subsequent automated MS analysis is another problem of high throughput systems as their quality is often questionable and the evaluation of these data takes significantly longer than the collection.|$|E

5000|$|A Polysomnography test (PSG) {{records the}} {{biological}} changes during sleep through monitoring the brain (Electroencephalography, EEG), eye movement (Electrooculography, EOG), heart rhythm (Electrocardiogram, ECG), and muscle activity (Electromyography, EMG). Typically a complete PSG requires {{a minimum of}} 12 channels and 22 wire attachments and produces a “score” or report. Sleep stages are identifiable through comparison of the EEG, EOG and EMG channels with stages 1 and 2 being defined as light sleep, 3 being slow wave sleep and 4 being REM sleep. Additionally a PSG can reveal “arousals” or sudden shifts in brain wave activity. [...] Analyzing the <b>resulting</b> <b>amount</b> of REM sleep in combination with patient reported dream experience has been the method of choice for recent dream studies. In particular researchers can wake the patient mid-REM sleep and ask for dream experience, which in normal patients would enhance their recollection and dream count. Absence of dream experience suggests the presence of CWS and this test method can also help to illustrate whether the patient is suffering from an inability to recall visual images or complete dream loss.|$|E
50|$|If we {{consider}} two consumption paths, each {{with the same}} trend and the same initial level of consumption - {{and as a result}} same level of consumption per period on average - but with different levels of volatility, then, according to economic theory, the less volatile consumption path will be preferred to the more volatile one. This is due to risk aversion on part of individual agents. One way to calculate how costly this greater volatility is in terms of individual (or, under some restrictive conditions, social) welfare is to ask what percentage of her annual average consumption would an individual be willing to sacrifice in order to eliminate this volatility entirely. Another way to express this is by asking how much an individual with a smooth consumption path would have to be compensated in terms of average consumption in order to accept the volatile path instead of the one without the volatility. The <b>resulting</b> <b>amount</b> of compensation, expressed as a percentage of average annual consumption, is the cost of the fluctuations calculated by Lucas. It is a function of people's degree of risk aversion and of the magnitude of the fluctuations which are to be eliminated, as measured by the standard deviation of the natural log of consumption.|$|E
