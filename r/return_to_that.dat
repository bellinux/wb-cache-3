5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, {{despite a lack of}} support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E
5|$|In August, Breckinridge {{traveled}} to Virginia's Sweet Springs {{to improve his}} health. He visited family and friends while there, but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known. At some point, he obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently-enacted Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret, and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life. In 1814, John Taylor revealed Jefferson's authorship; Breckinridge's grandson, John C. Breckinridge, wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor's claims. Cautioning that {{the passage of time}} and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details, Jefferson responded that he, Breckinridge, Wilson Nicholas, and possibly James Madison met at Monticello, at a date Jefferson could not recall, to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts. They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would introduce them in the Kentucky legislature upon his <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> state.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 2 {{features}} a few gameplay changes {{from the original}} Mega Man. A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Man’s health at any time. Also introduced is a password system. After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed, allowing the player to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> particular point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, {{as well as the}} number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, Mega Man 2 does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.|$|E

25|$|Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also {{known as}} Mormons or Latter-day Saints) believe that after Adam and Eve were {{expelled}} from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as Adam-ondi-Ahman, located in present-day Daviess County, Missouri. It is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that Adam blessed his posterity there {{and that he will}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place {{at the time of the}} final judgement in fulfillment of biblical prophecy.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{element of}} Wiccan {{morality}} is the Law of Threefold Return {{which holds that}} whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> person with triple force, or with equal force {{on each of the}} three levels of body, mind and spirit, similar to the eastern idea of karma. The Wiccan Rede was most likely introduced into Wicca by Gerald Gardner and formalised publicly by Doreen Valiente, one of his High Priestesses. The Threefold Law was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by Monique Wilson and further popularised by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca.|$|E

25|$|Nearly {{twice the}} size of an {{ordinary}} grizzly, Bigfoot for years has levied his tribute of prime steers and no one has been found brave enough or clever enough to catch or kill him. With a single blow of his giant paw he kills the largest and best animal he can find and he usually takes the pick of a herd. He makes a single meal of the animal, and it is usually a meal that would provide a camp full of men for a week, and disappears, never to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> locality again that season.|$|E
25|$|While in {{art school}} in the late 1940s, Andy Warhol painted {{a version of the}} photograph, the {{earliest}} of his many paintings based on photographs; the original artwork has not been located and may be lost. Warhol's Disaster Series in the 1960s was a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> format, to interpretations of the highly visible works produced by photojournalists. In 1977, Lowell Thomas, journalist and narrator for Hearst rival Movietone News, set the photo's influence in America as high as two of the most iconic World War II images: a French man grimacing in tears as his country's soldiers abandon France in June 1940, and Joe Rosenthal's Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, shot in February 1945.|$|E
25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, {{this has to do with}} the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E

25|$|Morazán {{used the}} {{proceeds}} to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela with Mariano Rivera Paz, {{a member of the}} Aycinena clan, although he did not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> clan any property confiscated in 1829. In revenge, Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol voted to dissolve the Central American Federation in San Salvador a little later, forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to fight for his federal mandate. Along the way, Morazán increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera. Knowing that Morazán had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take Salamá with the small force that remained, but was defeated, and lost his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to Sanarate. After recovering somewhat, he attacked a detachment in Jutiapa and got a small amount of booty which gave to the volunteers who accompanied him. He then prepared to attack Petapa near Guatemala City, where he was victorious, although with heavy casualties.|$|E

500|$|In 1878, Talbot won {{nomination}} as the Republican {{candidate for}} governor, {{in a large}} field occasioned by the impending retirement of Alexander H. Rice. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> party, and the Republican ticket won the general election, in part by highlighting the wage and benefit differences in mills owned by Butler and Talbot. The campaign was particularly vicious, with Republicans attacking Butler supporters as [...] "Repudiationists, Greenbackers, and Communists". Talbot served one term, and refused to run for reelection the following year. He supported women's suffrage and prison reform, and stronger state control over its railroads.|$|E

500|$|A {{political}} factor also restrained the Finns as {{they approached}} the border they had before the Russian attack of 1939. They came under increasing pressure from Britain and the United States to stop at the old border. There were element within Finland which favoured such a halt; and in their hour of peril in October–November 1941, the Soviet Union through the United States offered to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> border if Finland made peace. The euphoria caused by the same German victories which produced this Soviet offer misled the Finns into disregarding it and continuing in the war for expansionist objectives in eastern Karelia and in the far north. The British thereupon declared war on Finland, while, in fear that the United States would do the same, refrained from even further offensives.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive, noting its ability to [...] "capture some of the appeal from the pre-cancellation days." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode's story, writing that it had [...] "a great storyline and the right {{combination}} of irrelevant and relevant jokes", giving the episode an 8.4 out of 10. In another positive review, Brett Love of TV Squad called the episode [...] "solid," [...] and praised the scenes set in 1984, and the alternate world. Love went on to state, [...] "The show has lost a little of the luster that it once had, but that's no reason to count them out. There were enough bright spots to give hope for a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> old form when season six comes around in the fall." [...] He graded [...] "Meet the Quagmires" [...] 5 out of 7.|$|E
500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E
