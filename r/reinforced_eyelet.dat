5000|$|The manila {{envelope}} {{is a specific}} colored envelope designed for transporting documents. It is made of thick, durable Manila paper and sized so that full sheets of paper can fit inside without being folded. As with the manila folder, it is traditionally buff in color, and often has a mechanism on the closing flap that allows it to be opened without damaging the envelope so that the envelope can be re-used. There are two main methods to achieve thisâ€”the first incorporates a metal clasp of two prongs, which are put through a <b>reinforced</b> <b>eyelet</b> in the flap and then bent apart to hold. The other has a cardboard [...] "button" [...] secured tightly on the flap {{and a piece of}} string fastened on the envelope body (or the reverse arrangement) is wound around it to form a closure. In a more general sense, envelopes made of brown, unbleached paper, used for cheapness, are described as {{manila envelope}}s.|$|E

A single <b>eyelet</b> <b>reinforces</b> the spoke hole much like a hollow rivet. A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both walls of a double-walled rim.|$|R

Generally a basha is made of <b>reinforced</b> nylon with <b>eyelets</b> and loops or tabs located along all four sides of the sheet and sometimes across the two central lines of symmetry. The basha is an extremely versatile shelter that can be erected {{in many different ways}} to suit the particular conditions of the location. (The word also sometimes refers to a special type of bivouac sack (see below).|$|R
