5|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes.

5|$|Through the {{development}} of Pentangle, Jansch played a number of instruments: banjo, Appalachian dulcimer, <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> concertina—on rare occasions he has even been known to play electric guitar. However, it is his acoustic guitar playing that was most notable.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the event is based on a month-long {{preliminary}} hearing held afterward, generally known as the Spicer hearings. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from The Daily Nugget knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> the two newspapers varied greatly.|$|E

He was also designated as the clerk of the marketplace and the coroner for both the city and Albany County. Two alderman and two assistant aldermen were chosen from each ward {{and sat on the}} Common Council along with the mayor and recorder. The mayor, <b>recorder,</b> <b>and</b> aldermen were also justices, the assistants however did not have any judicial powers.|$|E
5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track <b>recorder,</b> <b>and</b> recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|Like most of McLachlan's albums, Surfacing was {{recorded}} at Marchand's Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Marchand, who produced, engineered and mixed the album, recorded {{it on an}} Otari RADAR <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> a Neumann 149 microphone. McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass and a drum machine {{as well as providing}} background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, Yves Desrosiers on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar and slide bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion and drums.|$|E

5|$|On May 16, the nine-person {{committee}} of James A. O'Neil, Robert Moore, William H. Gray, William P. Dougherty, David Hill, Robert Shortess, Thomas J. Hubbard, Robert Newell, and Alanson Beers met {{for three days}} to draft laws. The group met again for two days starting on June 16, with George LeBreton serving as the <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> Moore as the chairman for both sets of meetings. The laws drafted became the Organic Laws of Oregon and were ratified on July 5. Committees on land claims, appropriations, military, the judiciary, and districting were also formed at that meeting.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State <b>Recorder,</b> <b>and</b> repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|The Headphone Masterpiece is {{the debut}} album by American {{recording}} artist Cody Chesnutt. He recorded the album {{in his home}} bedroom with a 4-track <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an organ. A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a <b>recorder,</b> <b>and</b> two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{titles are}} {{accompanied}} by a mock-Elizabethan arrangement of Howard Goodall's Blackadder theme played on a <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> an electric guitar, and feature a black snake slithering about on a marble table. The snake, noncompliant to the wishes of its handler, is eventually removed and replaced with something related to the episode title, which in this series is always a single noun. The opening ominous string crescendo and imagery are a parody of the opening credits of the 1976 BBC television adaptation of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.|$|E
5|$|By 1829, Randolph {{had three}} {{commission}} warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern. In 1834, Randolph had {{a population of}} approximately 1,000. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, private schools, and more than ten saloons. In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the Randolph <b>Recorder</b> <b>and</b> the Randolph Whig. In the 1830s, the first bank was founded and a stagecoach line provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson twice a week. The commercial success of Randolph can be attributed {{in part to the}} use of slave labor, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves or offered rewards for runaway or stolen slaves.|$|E

5|$|Following their Star Search audition, Johnny and the Moondogs {{changed their}} name to Japage 3 (combining letters {{from each of}} the member's names: John, Paul, and George). Lennon had a friend from art school, named Derek Hodkin, who owned a tape <b>recorder,</b> <b>and</b> Lennon {{convinced}} him to record the group (along with McCartney's brother Mike on drums). The group then asked Hodkin to act as their manager, and he agreed. Despite Hodkin's management, bookings for the group dried up. Harrison began a stint as rhythm guitarist in the Les Stewart Quartet, who had a weekly club engagement. By May, Japage 3 was defunct, although the three continued to see each other socially, and Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together.|$|E
5|$|The VOR/DME {{system was}} {{tested by the}} Civil Aviation Administration on 7 May and found to be working correctly. AIBN {{established}} a base of operations at the hangar at Brønnøysund Airport and used a helicopter to freight {{the pieces of the}} wreck there and bodies to Trondheim University Hospital for identification. Technical investigations started on 9 May. The aircraft was equipped with a flight data <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> a cockpit voice recorder. Both were found intact and were decoded at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom. Improper use of the microphone made it difficult to hear the captain's voice, but it was possible to reconstruct the conversations and line of events. A memorial service was held on 10 May and was attended by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. The last Home Guard personnel concluded their work on 11 May and the police concluded their investigations at Torghatten on 13 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data <b>recorder</b> <b>and</b> cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
