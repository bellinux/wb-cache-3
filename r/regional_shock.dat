40|$|How {{the price}} of food is {{determined}} has become a critical issue, given the drastic surges in prices {{in recent years and}} the prevailing expectation of further increases. Along this line, this paper examines the sources of food price fluctuations in 11 developing Asian countries. The working model is a block vector autoregression (VAR), and 10 variables are classified into three blocks - world, region, and country - depending on their origin and nature. Empirical evidence shows that the <b>regional</b> <b>shock</b> plays a pivotal role in explaining the variations of domestic food prices, particularly at medium- to long-term horizons. Contrary to conventional belief, the world food price shock contributes little to the dynamics of domestic food prices in developing Asia. The findings suggest Asian food markets are more integrated regionally than with the world market. The short-run movements of domestic food prices are accounted for largely by the country's own shock. Taken together, our findings suggest that promoting food price stability would require efforts at the regional level {{as well as at the}} domestic level, reflecting the influence of region-specific factors. Extensions to the developing countries in other regions produce similar findings on the determination of food prices...|$|E

Objectives {{for this study}} were to (1) characterize shock effects in a complex polymineralic rock with a significant proportion of hydrous ferromagnesian minerals, both as a function of variable shock pressure and preshock temperature, and (2) to explore the effects of shock impedance contrast between component minerals on the respective abundances and distribution of these features. At any shock pressure, the order of decreasing intensity of shock metamorphic effects in component phases is: cordierite (Crd) biotite (Bt) plagioclase (Pl) K-feldspar (Kfs) quartz (Qtz) garnet (Grt) orthopyroxene (Opx). Samples shocked to pressures below 40 GPa (25 °C) were typically characterized by marked heterogeneous distribution of shock effects on both intragranular and intergranular scales. Shock heterogeneity is mainly attributed to shock impedance contrast between contiguous phases, and manifests as shock amplification locally where shock impedance contrast is greatest, and shock suppression where impedance contrast is least. The heterogeneous distribution of shock metamorphic effects in both experiments and natural rocks is a signature of extreme disequilibrium at the submillimeter scale. The heterogeneous distribution of shock metamorphic effects mitigates against the use of shock effects in minerals exclusively as <b>regional</b> <b>shock</b> pressure barometers, and ought to be augmented by additional constraints on shock pressure from numerical models...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} a {{dissecting}} aortic aneurysm, Type 1, developed acute pulmonary edema unexplained by the usual etiologic factors. Pathologic evidence that bronchial arterial circulation was interrupted led us to hypothesize that pulmonary edema {{could be due to}} ischemia of the bronchial circulation. To test this hypothesis, two chronic studies were done in dogs. The first study consisted of selective ligation of the right posterior bronchial artery at its origin at the fifth or sixth intercostal artery. After recovery from surgery, biopsies were taken from the ipsilateral and contralateral lung at time periods from 5 hours to 11 days. Ischemic damage was found in seven of eight dogs (87. 5 %), and was confined to the right lung. Histological examination revealed initial congestion within 8 hours, followed by pulmonary edema within 72 hours, and finally, disruption of alveolar septa with small emphysematous bullae on the eleventh postoperative day. The left lung remained normal in histological appearance. The second study consisted of transplanting the bronchial artery to the pulmonary artery to create a low pressure system and low O 2 content, and to simulate a <b>regional</b> <b>shock</b> situation. In five of six dogs (83. 3 %), the anastomosis was occluded within 72 hours, probably due to pressure competition from small collateral bronchial circulation. However, in these five dogs, pulmonary vascular resistance increased by 53 %, intrapulmonary shunting increased by 83 %, and the alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient increased by 150 mm Hg. Pulmonary edema was again confined to the right lung. Bronchial arteriograms demonstrated the extensive and variable distribution of the bronchial circulation in dogs. In the sixth dog, the anastomosis remained patent with a left-to-right shunt, due to a larger bronchial arterial collateral circulation. In this animal, the pulmonary arterial resistance, intrapulmonary shunting, and alveolar-arterial O 2 gradient were normal. Pulmonary edema was absent in lung biopsies...|$|E

To support this claim empirically, we develop a utility based measure of shock asymmetry and calculate it for each U. S. state. We regress it (using both {{ordinary least squares}} and instrumental variables) on a state-by-state 1 -digit industrial specialization index and a 2 -digit manufacturing specialization index, controlling for relevant economic and demographic variables. The main empirical result is that both specialization indices are positively and significantly correlated with the degree of shock asymmetry in both ordinary least squares and instrumental variables regressions.; This finding, combined with the causal relation running from inter-regional capital market integration to regional specialization in production found in Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, and Yosha (1999), points to the following chain of events: Economic integration fosters the development of institutions that facilitate inter-regional risk sharing. Equipped with better insurance against asymmetric shocks, regions can afford to increase their specialization in production which, in turn, renders shocks more asymmetric.
