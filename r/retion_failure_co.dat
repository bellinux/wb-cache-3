40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, an {{operation}} {{research on the}} performances of Tomakomai CCS project {{has been carried out}} for investigating the permeability uncertainty and the <b>failures</b> on <b>CO</b> 2 operation and transportation. Firstly, economical effects of estimation error in aquifer permeability were investigated by using a reservoir block modeling based on numerical simulation results on CO 2 injection rate. Secondary, economic loss resulted from <b>failure</b> of <b>CO</b> 2 injection was evaluated by assuming periodical injection halts. It is clear that CO 2 buffers, such as sphere gas tanks, should be installed to store CO 2 on the CCS process which can temporarily store CO 2 after it is captured when a trouble on transportation or injection processes occurs. Without a buffer, releasing the captured CO 2 to the atmosphere due to system failure or trouble in injection will add to capture costs, or will result in carbon tax or opportunity loss on CCS. The larger size of CO 2 buffer volume can potentially withstand against long-term trouble, however the larger buffer volume needs larger cost for initial construction and maintenance. The study also present the optimum CO 2 buffer volume based on economical evaluations for a commercial CCS model based on several simulations performed with and withou...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCO 2 {{transportation}} {{is an integral}} part of the CCS chain. After capture, CO 2 needs to be transported to locations whereby it is stored or alternatively used in various processes. CO 2 can be transported via ship or pipeline. In both cases, the required compression pressure can be 100 – 300 bar, depending on the distance and intended disposal or use of CO 2. The CO 2 rich stream can contain a lot of impurities which can modify the phase diagram and change the thermophysical properties of the stream in comparison with the ones of pure CO 2. Indeed, along with carbon dioxide, a great number of compounds such as water, O 2, N 2, Ar, SOx, NOx, H 2 and CO can be present at different levels of concentration. During transportation by pipeline, if the pipe suffers a major fracture due to an accidental release or a <b>failure,</b> <b>CO</b> 2 can rapidly expand and cool: vapour cloud followed by solid formation of CO 2 may appear. The impurities could change the characteristics of the leak and change the conditions and compositions of CO 2 clouds and solid. The presence of water can also be a source of gas hydrate formation, ice or corrosion. In this communication we will present new experimental data and their modelling concerning the phase diagrams of systems rich in CO 2 and their thermophysical properties.

BackgroundThe device was designed as a percutaneously insertable temporary support system for patients with acute left ventricular failure. MethodsThe pump catheter (introduction diameter 9 -F) is positioned in the left ventricle. The rotor is driven by an external motor through a flexible drive shaft. A model circuit was used to assess pump performance, hemolysis tests, and particle image velocimetry. The feasibility of the catheter placement and pump operation were examined in 12 anesthetized sheep. Cardiogenic shock was induced in seven of the animals. Cardiac output (CO) and mean aortic blood pressure (MAP) were recorded before and during shock, and during catheter pump action. ResultsThe catheter pump delivered a flow of 4. 1 l/min at a differential pressure of 60 mm Hg. The average modified index of hemolysis was 11. 6 (optimum, 1. 8). Fluoroscopically and echocardiographically guided in vivo placement and deployment of the device were quick and uncomplicated. Under simulation of acute left ventricular <b>failure</b> (<b>CO</b> 43 ± 22 % and MAP 55 ± 16 % of the baseline value), the catheter pump significantly improved CO to 67 ± 12 % and MAP to 74 ± 18 %. Maximum in vivo duration of operation was 6 h (average, 3. 1 ± 1. 4 h). These animal studies revealed: 1) no significant hemolysis (average plasma-free hemoglobin 26 ± 4 mg/l after 3 h); 2) no thrombotic deposits at rotor or pump housing; and 3) no damage to the endocardium or aortic valve.

40|$|A Markov chain dynamic {{programming}} model is presented for determining optimal range improvement strategies {{as well as}} accompanying livestock production practices. The model specification focuses on the improved representation of rangeland dynamics and livestock response under alternative range conditions. The model is applied to range management decision making in the Cross Timbers Region of central Oklahoma. Results indicate that tebuthiuron treatments are economically feasible over the range of treatment costs evaluated. Optimal utilization of forage production following a treatment requires the conjunctive employment of prescribed burning and variable stocking rates over the treatment's life. Key words: range improvements, rangeland dynamics, Markov chains, biophysical simulation. Economic assessment of long-term range improvements traditionally has been conducted through application of static investment criteria. Estimates of expected forage production over the treatment's life are developed and used to derive annual net cash flows based upon some fixed managerial policy (McBryde, Conner, and Scifres; Whitson and Scifres). Measures of net present value or {{internal rate of return}} are then calculated to determine the profitability of the investment. These static approaches ignore a number of the complexities of rangeland dynamics that affect the efficiency of range improvement investments. Timing and frequency of treatment significantly influence the stream of benefits that may be realized from a range improvement program. Stochastic weather conditions following the treatment also are critical. Numerous production practices, including stocking rates and maintenance measures used to extend the life of a treatment, interact with range improvement treatments to influence the resulting forage production and animal response. <b>Failure</b> to <b>co...</b>|$|R

The {{results suggest that the}} red color observed by Pieters et al at the Venera 9 and 10 landing sites is due to subaerial oxidation of Fe(2 +) -bearing basalt on the surface of Venus, and that hematite, instead of magnetite, is present on the surface of Venus. Well-characterized basalt powder was iosthermally heated in 1000 ppm CO-CO 2 gas mixtures at atmospheric pressure for several days. The starting material and reacted samples were analyzed by Mossbauer spectroscopy to determine the amount of Fe(2 +) and Fe(3 +) in the samples. X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy were also used to characterize samples. The basalt oxidation occurs because the CO and CO 2 do not equilibrate in the gas mixture at the low temperatures used. Thus, the basalt reacts with the more abundant CO 2 and is oxidized.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the load to <b>failure</b> of <b>COs</b> with extra-articular oblique osteotomies (OOs) as well as modified, extra-articular step osteotomies (SOs). METHODS These three osteotomies and their subsequent fixation utilizing a standardized tension band wiring technique were tested in 42 composite analog ulnae models at 20 ° and 70 ° of flexion. Triceps loading was simulated with a servo hydraulic testing machine. All specimens were isometrically loaded until failure. Kinematic and force data, as well as interfragmentary motion were recorded. RESULTS At 70 °, CO failed at a mean load of 963 N (SD 104 N), the OO at 1512 N (SD 208 N) and the SO at 1484 N (SD 153 N), (P< 0. 001). At 20 °, CO failed at a mean load of 707 N (SD 104 N) and OO at 1009 N (SD 85 N) (P= 0. 006). The highest load to failure was observed for the SO, which was 1277 N (SD 172 N). The load to failure of the SO was significantly higher than the CO as well as the OO.

Avoiding leakage is crucial to safe storage and hence caprock integrity and the avoidance of reactivation of otherwise sealing faults will be extremely important. We have performed several types of triaxial experiments on anhydrite, the caprock for many potential storage sites in The Netherlands and worldwide. First, we describe two hydrofracture experiments and one compression experiment on anhydrite cylinders using a triaxial compression apparatus. The results of these experiments have improved the Mohr-Coulomb and Mogi failure criteria (as derived by Hangx et al. (2009)) at low and at high normal stresses. These have constrained the tensile strength of anhydrite to approximately 5 MPa. Microstructures show shear fractures and axial cracks, with the density of axial cracks decreasing with increasing confining pressure. A simple geomechanical model indicates that there is no risk of caprock <b>failure</b> upon <b>CO</b> 2 injection. Second, we conducted saw-cut type sliding experiments on fine grained (median grain size 38 μm) anhydrite fault gouge, under dry, water-wet, wet/CO 2 and near-dry CO 2 conditions, using titanium driver blocks. In all experiments, velocity steps were carried out and some experiments were halted for a 65 h period using a standard slide-hold-slide procedure. The average steady state friction coefficient of anhydrite gouge is decreased from 0. 47 to 0. 39 upon addition of water, water plus CO 2 or dry CO 2. Anhydrite gouge without water exhibited unstable slip (“stick-slip”), consistent with velocity weakening behaviour.

We show that the axis associated protein ASY 1 is depleted during zygotene concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. Study of an Atpch 2 mutant demonstrates this requires the conserved AAA+ ATPase, PCH 2, which localizes to the sites of axis remodelling. Loss of PCH 2 leads to a failure to deplete ASY 1 from the axes and compromizes SC polymerisation.

The data presented in this paper demonstrate that CO can also act as a therapeutic (i. e., where exposure to CO is initiated after pathology is established). In three rodent models of PAH, a 1 hour/day exposure to CO reverses established PAH and right ventricular hypertrophy, restoring right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures, as well as the pulmonary vascular architecture, to near normal. The ability of CO to reverse PAH requires functional endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS/NOS 3) and NO generation, as indicated by the inability of CO to reverse chronic hypoxia-induced PAH in eNOS-deficient (nos 3 −/−) mice versus wild-type mice. The restorative function of CO was associated with a simultaneous increase in apoptosis and decrease in cellular proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, which was regulated in part by the endothelial cells in the hypertrophied vessels. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that CO reverses established PAH dependent on NO generation supporting the use of CO clinically to treat pulmonary hypertension...|$|R

We performed conventional triaxial creep experiments, combined with fluid flow-through experiments (brine and CO 2 -rich brine) on samples of poorly consolidated, carbonate- and quartz-cemented Captain Sandstone from the Goldeneye field. The main goal was to study the effect of carbonate cement dissolution on mechanical and ultrasonic properties, {{as well as on the}} failure strength of the material. Our experiments were performed under in situ reservoir conditions, mimicking reservoir depletion and injection. Although total dissolution of calcite was observed, and confirmed by microstructural and fluid chemistry analyses, it did not affect the rock mechanical properties, nor was any measurable rock strength reduction observed. This is most likely because grain-to-grain contacts were sufficiently quartz-cemented and quartz is not affected by CO 2 -rich brine. Failure data for the Captain Sandstone showed that the stress conditions under which CO 2 injection will take place remain far away from the <b>failure</b> envelope.

A simulation model of the custard supply chain was developed to compare scenarios with and without a quarantine of 48 h at the storage of the production plant. The model consists of 3 parts: 1) the distribution of a 24, 000 -L batch of custard over the supply chain over time is simulated; 2) the time to detect spoilage bacteria with a recontamination test procedure is simulated; and 3) the direct recall costs of custard over the {{different parts of the}} supply chain are calculated. Direct recall costs increase from about € 25, 000 /batch to € 36, 171 /batch from 57 to 135 h in the situation without quarantine and from € 25, 000 /batch to € 36, 648 /batch from 123 h to 163 h for the situation with quarantine. Then costs decrease because more and more custard is at the consumer level and only 0. 13 % of the consumers will ask for a refund. With low true contamination probabilities quarantine is not profitable, but at later detection moments with high probabilities it is. We conclude that a simulation model is a helpful tool to evaluate the efficiency of risk management strategies like end product testing and a quarantine situation.

The sample includes clusters with estimated total cooling rates Of m(CF) approximately 10 - 600 M. yr- 1, at redshifts between z approximately 0. 01 - 0. 06. None were detected either in emission or absorption.

If the steady state cooling flow model is correct, the cooling material must be converted efficiently to a non-gaseous state on a timescale of approximately 10 (7 - 8) yr, or the putative cold clouds must be accelerated to a velocity dispersion greater than or similar to 700 km s- 1 on a similar timescale.

40|$|In this paper, we use {{morphological}} and numerical {{methods to}} test the hypothesis that seasonally formed fracture patterns in the Martian polar regions result from the brittle <b>failure</b> of seasonal <b>CO</b> 2 slab ice. The observations by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) of polar regions of Mars show very narrow dark elongated linear patterns that are observed during some periods of time in spring, disappear in summer and re-appear again in the following spring. They are repeatedly formed in the same areas but they do not repeat the exact pattern from year to year. This leads to the conclusion that they are cracks formed in the seasonal ice layer. Some of models of seasonal surface processes rely on the existence of a transparent form of CO 2 ice, so-called slab ice. For the creation of the observed cracks the ice is required to be a continuous media, not an agglomeration of relatively separate particles like a firn. The best explanation for our observations is a slab ice with relatively high transparency in the visible wavelength range. This transparency allows a solid state green-house effect to act underneath the ice sheet raising the pressure by sublimation from below. The trapped gas creates overpressure and the ice sheet breaks at some point creating the observed cracks. We show that the times when the cracks appear are in agreement with the model calculation, providing one more piece of evidence that CO 2 slab ice covers polar areas in spring...|$|R
30|$|Shale {{formations}} in North America such as Bakken, Niobrara, and Eagle Ford {{have huge}} oil in place, 100 – 900 {{billion barrels of}} oil in Bakken only. However, the predicted primary recovery is still below 10 %. Therefore, seeking for techniques to enhance oil recovery in these complex plays is inevitable. Although most of the previous studies in this area recommended that CO 2 {{would be the best}} EOR technique to improve oil recovery in these formations, pilot tests showed that natural gases performance clearly exceeds CO 2 performance in the field scale. In this paper, two different approaches have been integrated to investigate the feasibility of three different miscible gases which are CO 2, lean gases, and rich gases. Firstly, numerical simulation methods of compositional models have been incorporated with local grid refinement of hydraulic fractures to mimic the performance of these miscible gases in shale reservoirs conditions. Implementation of a molecular diffusion model in the LS-LR-DK (logarithmically spaced, locally refined, and dual permeability) model has been also conducted. Secondly, different molar-diffusivity rates for miscible gases have been simulated to find the diffusivity level in the field scale by matching the performance for some EOR pilot tests which were conducted in Bakken formation of North Dakota, Montana, and South Saskatchewan. The simulated shale reservoirs scenarios confirmed that diffusion is the dominated flow among all flow regimes in these unconventional formations. Furthermore, the incremental oil recovery due to lean gases, rich gases, and CO 2 gas injection confirms the predicted flow regime. The effect of diffusion implementation has been verified with both of single porosity and dual-permeability model cases. However, some of CO 2 pilot tests showed a good match with the simulated cases which have low molar-diffusivity between the injected CO 2 and the formation oil. Accordingly, the rich and lean gases have shown a better performance to enhance oil recovery in these tight formations. However, rich gases need long soaking periods, and lean gases need large volumes to be injected for more successful results. Furthermore, the number of huff-n-puff cycles has a little effect on the all injected gases performance; however, the soaking period has a significant effect. This research project demonstrated how to select the best type of miscible gases to enhance oil recovery in unconventional reservoirs according to the field-candidate conditions and operating parameters. Finally, the reasons beyond the success of natural gases and <b>failure</b> of <b>CO</b> 2 in the pilot tests have been physically and numerically discussed.|$|R
40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} limitations on symbiotically grown soybean seedlings (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) were assessed by providing 0. 0, 1. 0, or 8. 0 millimolar NH 4 NO 3 and 320 or 1, 000 microliters CO 2 /liter for 22 days after planting. Maximum {{development of the}} Rhizobium-soybean symbiosis, as determined by acetylene reduction, was measured {{in the presence of}} 1. 0 millimolar NH 4 NO 3 under both levels of CO 2. Raising NH 4 NO 3 from 0. 0 to 8. 0 millimolar under 320 microliters CO 2 /liter increased plant dry weight by 251 % and Kjeldahl N content by 287 % at 22 days after planting. Increasing NH 4 NO 3 from 1. 0 to 8. 0 millimolar under 320 microliters CO 2 /liter increased total dry weight and Kjeldahl N by 100 and 168 %, respectively, on day 22. Raising CO 2 from 320 to 1, 000 microliters CO 2 /liter during the same period had no significant effect on Kjeldahl N content of plants grown with 0. 0 or 1. 0 millimolar NH 4 NO 3. The maximum CO 2 treatment effects were observed in plants supplied with 8. 0 millimolar NH 4 NO 3, where dry weight and Kjeldahl N content were increased 64 % and 20 %, respectively. An increase in shoot CO 2 -exchange rate associated with the CO 2 -enrichment treatment was reflected in a significant increase in leaf dry weight and starch content for plants grown with 1, 000 microliters CO 2 /liter under all combined N treatments. These data show directly that seedling growth in symbiotically grown soybeans was limited primarily by N availability. The <b>failure</b> of the <b>CO</b> 2 -enrichment treatment to increase total plant N significantly in Rhizobium-dependent plants indicates that root nodule development and functioning in such plants was not limited by photosynthate production...|$|R
40|$|Data link: [URL] {{chromosomes}} {{are organized}} into linear looped chromatin arrays by a protein axis localized along the loop-bases. Programmed remodelling of the axis occurs during prophase I of meiosis. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has revealed dynamic {{changes in the}} chromosome axis in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica oleracea. We show that the axis associated protein ASY 1 is depleted during zygotene concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. Study of an Atpch 2 mutant demonstrates this requires the conserved AAA+ ATPase, PCH 2, which localizes to the sites of axis remodelling. Loss of PCH 2 leads to a failure to deplete ASY 1 from the axes and compromizes SC polymerisation. Immunolocalization of recombination proteins in Atpch 2 indicates that recombination initiation and CO designation during early prophase I occur normally. Evidence suggests that CO interference is initially functional in the mutant {{but there is a}} defect in CO maturation following designation. This leads to a reduction in <b>COs</b> and a <b>failure</b> to form <b>COs</b> between some homologous chromosome pairs leading to univalent chromosomes at metaphase I. Genetic analysis reveals that CO distribution is also affected in some chromosome regions. Together these data indicate that the axis remodelling defect in Atpch 2 disrupts normal patterned formation of COs.

40|$|Faults and {{fracture}} networks {{at depth}} are important fluid pathways, especially in fine-grained, low permeability seal lithologies. Discontinues in sealing lithologies can create seal bypass systems, {{leading to the}} <b>failure</b> of <b>CO</b> 2 geosequestration sites or hydrocarbon traps. We characterize the occurrence of and changes in discontinuity patterns and the associated changes in elastic moduli across sedimentologic interfaces to document {{the importance of these}} discontinuities for fluid management in the subsurface and potential for re-activation in high-pressure injection scenarios. We evaluate well-exposed, fine-grained, low-permeability Mesozoic and Paleozoic units that are seals of potential CO 2 repositories on the Colorado Plateau and show evidence for open fractures and fluid flow in the subsurface. Field observations document changes in fracture distributions across lithologic boundaries allowing us to identify mechano-stratigraphic units and focus on the effect of lithologic interfaces on fracture distribution. An interface marks the boundary between facies in a seal and in this study the fractures are shown to deflect or arrest at the interface. In outcrop fracture intensity varies in from 1 to 18 fractures per meter and fracture apertures range from mm to cm. The mineralized fractures often have associated alteration halos along their boundaries; their general orientation follows that of discontinuities within the underlying reservoir facies or adjacent faults. The recognition of these changes in fracture distribution is important for forward modeling of fluid flow and risk management. Studying the occurrence of and changes in fracture patterns from outcrops and scaling it up for use in modeling at a field scale is difficult {{due to the lack of}} direct correlation between outcrop observations and subsurface data. Due to the size and amount of data needed to model fluid flow at the field scale the meso-scale (cm to m) variability of rock properties is often neglected. We evaluate this meso-scale variability in elastic moduli, where possible. We combine mechano-stratigraphic outcrop observations with elastic moduli calculated from publically available wire line log data to evaluate the variability in rock strength within the heterolithic top seal. Relationships between changes in Young’s modulus to resulting fracture distribution can then be observed. The outcome of this analysis can be used for modeling the effectiveness of seal for storage of CO 2 in the underlying reservoirs. Digitized publically available wire line well log data were used to calculate Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus over the Carmel Formation and upper most 3 m of the underlying Navajo Sandstone. Our calculations show that Young’s Modulus can range between 15 to 34 GPa across 60 cm of the intra-seal interfaces, and an average difference of 5 GPa across the reservoir seal interface. These variations will affect fracture distributions and fluid behavior in the subsurface. These data provide a means to closely tie outcrop observations to derived estimates of subsurface rock strength. The characterization of rock strength variability is especially important for modeling the response of seals to increased pressure, due to CO 2 injection, and will allow for better site screening and fluid management once injection projects are underway...|$|R
40|$|Observations of CO and O 3  from the Transport and Chemical Evolution {{over the}} Pacific (TRACE-P) {{campaign}} are compared with modeled distributions from the FRSGC/UCI CTM {{driven by the}} Oslo T 63 L 40 ECMWF forecast meteorology. The model-measurement comparison is made {{within the context of}} how well the TRACE-P observations represent the springtime chemistry and ozone distributions over eastern Asia and the western Pacific in March 2001 and uses the four-dimensional (4 -D) extended domain from the model to provide unbiased statistics. A key question is whether the limited sampling density or mission strategy led to a statistically biased sample. To address this question, we examine a diverse range of statistical analyses of the observations of CO and O 3. The middle percentiles of the cumulative probability functions for CO in the free troposphere are representative (and reproduced by the CTM), but those in the boundary layer are not. The frequency of low-CO, stratospheric influence is well matched along flight tracks but is atypical of the extended domain. The percentiles of the latitude-by-height distribution of lidar O 3  show how the CTM reproduces the nonrepresentative clumpy nature of the observations but has too low a tropopause about the jet region (30 – 35 N). Adaptive kernel estimation of the 2 -D probability density of O 3 -CO correlations shows a very good simulation of two different chemical regimes (stratospheric and polluted) that {{is quite different from the}} extended domain but also highlights the <b>failure</b> to predict <b>CO</b> > 400 ppb. Empirical orthogonal function analysis of the O 3  vertical profiles shows how six EOFs can effectively describe the 4 -D structures of O 3  over this entire domain. The latitude-by-longitude maps of the principal components provide an excellent test of the CTM simulation along flight tracks and clearly show the unique sampling of O 3 events by the TRACE-P flights. In many cases the ability of the model to simulate the nonrepresentative observations implies a clear skill in matching the unique meteorological and chemical features of the region...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Subjects who do {{not pass}} {{ventilator}} weaning parameters but whose ambient air oxyhemoglobin saturation can be normalized by mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) can be extubated to continuous noninvasive ventilatory support (CNVS) with MIE used to maintain ex-tubation. Our aim was to study MIE-associated changes in breathing tolerance, pulse oximetry, and vital capacity (VC) for consecutive unweanable subjects. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutively referred intubated subjects with single-organ (respiratory muscle) <b>failure.</b> At presentation, <b>CO</b> 2 was normalized by adjusting ventilator settings and VC was measured (point 1). Then, MIE was used via the tube up to every h until oximetry remained> 95 % on ambient air and VC was remeasured (point 2) immediately before extubation. Subjects who could not meet ventilator weaning criteria and had no ventilator-free breathing ability upon extubation to CNVS were enrolled. Post-extubation, the MIE was used to maintain oximetry> 95 % in room air. VC and breathing tolerance were remeasured within 3 weeks (point 3). RESULTS: Ninety-seven of 98 subjects were successfully extubated despite 45 having been CNVS-dependent for 4 months to 18 y before being intubated. Sixty-nine of the 98 were intubated for 24. 9 22 (range 1 – 158) d and failed 0 – 6 (mean 1. 7) extubation attempts before being transferred and successfully extubated in 2. 24 1. 78 (range< 1 – 8) d to CNVS. VC increased by 270 % (P <. 001) from points 1 to 3. Weaning from CNVS to part-time NVS was achieved by all 52 subjects {{who had not been}} CNVS-dependent before intubation. One subject underwent tracheotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Many unweanable subjects can be extubated to CNVS and MIE. The latter can normalize O 2 saturation, increase VC, and facilitate extubation.
