5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a <b>random</b> <b>selection</b> prior to taping.|$|E

30|$|In the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection,</b> M antenna {{elements}} are selected out of entire N antenna elements for each user. In the fixed antenna selection, {{on the other}} hand, M adjacent antenna {{elements are}} used for each user. Therefore, the effective aperture size of the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> for each user is larger {{than that of the}} fixed antenna selection. Since the beamwidth is proportional to the inverse of effective array size [15], the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> gives a narrower beamwidth. Finally, the interference with the signals for other users can be mitigated. In the massive antenna array system, we can take advantage of large effective array size by <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection.</b>|$|R

30|$|The detail {{descriptions}} of the conventional fixed antenna selection and the proposed <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> are presented in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3. In Section 4 and Section 5, we show that the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> mitigates the interference with signals for other users. Intuitively, this advantage {{comes from the fact}} that the effective array size of <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> scheme is larger than that of fixed antenna selection. In other words, the beamwidth becomes narrow which decreases the amount of interference.|$|R

This result {{implies that}} the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> {{mitigates}} the inter-user interference where the interference cannot be managed effectively by beamforming. Also, the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> can provide the fairness by reducing the interference to closer users and by allowing {{a small amount of}} interference to farther users who can be tolerant of the interference. As a result, the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> mitigates the inter-user interference, and this is directly related with the beamwidth analysis in (15) and (17).|$|R

25|$|For example, {{suppose we}} wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an {{expensive}} district (house No. 1000). A simple <b>random</b> <b>selection</b> of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly {{along the length of}} the street, representing all of these districts. (Note that if we always start at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Under the system, {{points are}} awarded {{individually}} for each skating element, and {{the sum of}} these points is the total element score (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to have a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its base value. The technical specialist uses instant replay video to verify things that distinguish different elements; e.g., the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. The decision of the technical specialist determines the base value of the element. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark is called the grade of execution (GOE) that is an integer from −3 to +3. The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized <b>random</b> <b>selection</b> of nine judges, then discarding {{the high and low}} value, and finally averaging the remaining seven. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to get the total value for the element.|$|E

30|$|In {{multi-user}} beamforming systems, the inter-user interference {{are controlled}} by spatial filtering. Since the implementation of digital beamforming is difficult due to high hardware cost of large array system, the analog beamforming system with one phase shifter at each antenna element is considered with antenna selection scheme. However, the beamwidth is not sufficiently narrow to perfectly remove the interference due to limited size of antenna arrays. To mitigate the interference, we propose the <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> system in millimeter wave channel. The <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> expands the effective array size so that the beamwidth becomes narrow. We compare the beamwidth of conventional fixed antenna <b>selection</b> with <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> and analyze the amount of interference for each selection scheme. Theoretical analysis and bit error rate simulation {{results indicate that the}} beamforming with <b>random</b> antenna <b>selection</b> can take advantage of large array.|$|R

40|$|Mutation {{testing is}} a {{standard}} technique to evaluate {{the quality of a}} test suite.

2500|$|<b>Random</b> <b>selection,</b> when {{narrowly}} {{associated with}} a simple random sample, is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population.
