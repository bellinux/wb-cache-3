Because {{of the relatively}} weak confinement of the FORT, we expect the hyperfine structure of the different isotopes to {{play a crucial role}} in the collision rates. This dependence on hyperfine structure allows us to measure collisions associated with long range interatomic potentials of different structure: such as long and short ranged; or such as purely attractive, purely repulsive, or mixed attractive and repulsive. We observe significantly different loss rates for different excited state potentials. Additionally, we observe that some collisional channels' loss rates are saturated at our operating intensities (~ 15 mW/cm$^{ 2 }$). These losses are important limitations in loading dual isotope optical traps. Comment: about 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of loading $^{ 87 }$Rb into a far off <b>resonant</b> <b>trap</b> (FORT) in the {{presence}} of an ultracold cloud of $^{ 85 }$Rb. The presence of the $^{ 85 }$Rb resulted in a marked decrease of the $^{ 87 }$Rb load rate. This decrease is consistent with a decrease in the laser cooling efficiency needed for effective loading. While many dynamics which disrupt loading efficency arise when cooling in a dense cloud of atoms (reabsorption, adverse optical pumping, etc.), the large detuning between the transitions of $^{ 85 }$Rb and $^{ 87 }$Rb should isolate the isotopes from these effects. For our optical molasses conditions we calculate that our cooling efficiencies require induced ground-state coherences. We present data and estimates which are consistent with heteronuclear long-ranged induced dipole-dipole collisions disrupting these ground state coherences, leading to a loss of optical trap loading efficiency.

40|$|Cyclotron {{resonant}} wave-particle {{interaction of}} whistler mode chorus emissions drives pitch angle scatterings {{of a wide}} range of energetic electrons in the magnetosphere. We study a coherent scattering process associated with generation of the whistler mode rising chorus emissions near the geomagnetic equator in a self-consistent electromagnetic full-particle simulation. The simulation shows that coherent whistler mode rising chorus emissions scatter energetic electrons very effectively through formation of an electromagnetic electron hole. The nonlinear interaction induces acceleration of <b>resonant</b> electrons <b>trapped</b> by the wave and deceleration of untrapped resonant electrons. When the frequency of a rising chorus element continuously increases in time from lower frequencies to higher frequencies, the parallel resonant velocity continuously decreases toward lower-velocity ranges resulting in significant scattering of resonant electrons. The lower limit of resonant parallel velocity is determined by the upper frequency limit of the rising chorus element. The unscattered electrons with low parallel velocities and the accelerated <b>resonant</b> electrons <b>trapped</b> by the wave result in the distribution clearly peaked at 90 °. Successive generation of rising chorus elements can scatter resonant electrons in the same resonance velocity range.

40|$|This paper studies general, non-Hamiltonian {{perturbations}} of integrable {{systems with}} two {{degrees of freedom}} and derives conditions for temporary and permanent resonance trapping. The analysis involves a noncanonical transformation of variables near the resonant manifold and averaging with respect to the fast phase to investigate oscillatory behavior on the intermediate timescale.

The final system so obtained reveals the possible existence of two- and three-dimensional invariant tori {{in the vicinity of the}} resonant manifold. An explicit divergence condition for general perturbations to be dissipative on the slow timescale follows from the analysis.

40|$|Two {{types of}} three-level quantum counters, {{based on the}} Bloembergen and the {{inverted}} scheme, are discussed {{with respect to their}} application for up-conversion of far-infrared (FIR) radiation to visible light. It is reported on a tunable quantum counter of the inverted type: in optically pumped ruby, photons at 29 cm- 1 are absorbed by the transitionbar{E}(2 E) → 2 bar{A}(2 E) and lead to an increased R 2 - fluorescence radiation. By Zeeman splitting of the 2 Elevels, tuning of the detected frequency from 29 cm- 1 to higher and lower frequencies is possible (with 1 cm- 1 /Tesla). Using the 891 -GHz radiation of an HCN laser we determine for the quantum counter a power conversion efficiency of the order of 10 - 6 and a frequency bandwidth of 360 MHz.

40|$|Migration of {{planetary}} systems {{caused by the}} action of dissipative forces may lead the planets to be trapped in a resonance. In this work we study the conditions and the dynamics of such <b>resonant</b> <b>trapping.</b> Particularly, we are interested in finding out whether resonant capture ends up in a long-term stable planetary configuration. For two planet systems we associate the evolution of migration with the existence of families of periodic orbits in the phase space of the three-body problem. The family of circular periodic orbits exhibits a gap at the 2 : 1 resonance and an instability and bifurcation at the 3 : 1 resonance. These properties explain the high probability of 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonant capture at low eccentricities. Furthermore, we study the resonant capture of three-planet systems. We show that such a resonant capture is possible and can occur under particular conditions. Then, from the migration path of the system, stable three-planet configurations, either symmetric or asymmetric, can be determined. Comment: 10 ages, 13 figures, 5 th Ph. D.

40|$|The {{properties}} of the iron Kalpha line emitted by a photoionized accretion disc in a Z-type X-ray binary system are determined for different values of the mass accretion rate and disc inclination angle. We consider a geometry where the accretion disc is illuminated by X-rays emitted from a spherical, optically thick Comptonized cloud, representing the magnetosphere on the horizontal branch, and the magnetosphere plus puffed accretion disc on the normal and flaring branches. We find that line profiles can be complex due to Doppler, relativistic, shadowing, line-blending, <b>resonant</b> <b>trapping</b> and other effects. The iron Kalpha line equivalent width, intrinsic width and centroid energy vary in a tortuous manner {{as a function of}} the accretion rate, cloud radius and inclination angle.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the disk of our Galaxy is shaped by a complex interplay of processes.

As an example, I will show how we have already detected some Galactic bar signatures in the RAVE catalogue, which has allowed us to measure the bar's pattern speed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of gas drag and gravitational perturbations by a planetary embryo on {{the orbit of}} a planetesimal in the solar nebula was examined. Non-Keplerian rotation of the gas causes secular decay of the orbit. If the planetesimal's orbit is exterior to the perturber's, resonant perturbations oppose this drag and can cause it to be trapped in a stable orbit at a commensurability of order j/(j + 1), where j is an integer. Numerical and analytical demonstrations show that <b>resonant</b> <b>trapping</b> occurs for wide ranges of perturbing mass, planetesimal size, and j. Induced eccentricities are large, causing overlap of orbits for bodies in different resonances with j greater than 2. Collisions between planetesimals in different resonances, or between resonant and nonresonant bodies, result in their disruption. Fragments smaller than a critical size can pass through resonances under the {{influence of}} drag and be accreted by the embryo. This effect speeds accretion and tends to prevent dynamical isolation of planetary embryos, making gas-rich scenarios for planetary formation more plausible...|$|E
