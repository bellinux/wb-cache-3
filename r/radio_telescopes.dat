5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes.</b> The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation (by droppings fouling, and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> suffer from.|$|E
50|$|The EPTA uses five European telescopes. These are the Westerbork Synthesis <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope,</b> the Effelsberg <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope,</b> the Lovell <b>Telescope,</b> the Nançay <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> and the Sardinia <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
5|$|The first non-visual {{study of}} galaxies, {{particularly}} active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5MHz and 30GHz. (The ionosphere blocks signals below this range.) Large radio interferometers {{have been used}} to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei. <b>Radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{can also be used to}} observe neutral hydrogen (via 21cm radiation), including, potentially, the non-ionized matter in the early Universe that later collapsed to form galaxies.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
50|$|The Effelsberg 100-m <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> is a <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> in the Ahrgebirge (part of the Eifel) in Bad Münstereifel, Germany. For 29 {{years the}} Effelsberg <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> {{was the largest}} fully {{steerable}} <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> on Earth. In 2000 it was surpassed by the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, US which has a slightly larger elliptical 100 by 110-metre aperture.|$|R

5|$|Ground-based radio {{images taken}} using the VLA {{revealed}} seven radio {{sources in the}} HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst {{predicted}} that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes,</b> hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{acetic acid}} was {{discovered}} in 1996 by {{a team led by}} David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
50|$|The {{resources}} of the IPTA are substantial. The EPTA uses large quantities of time on Europe’s five 100-meter class telescopes: the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank, England, the Effelsberg 100-m <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> in Germany, the Sardinia <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> in Italy, the Westerbork Synthesis <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> in the Netherlands, and the Nancay <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> in France. Together these 5 telescopes make up the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP) in which they operate together as a single 300-meter class telescope. NANOGrav uses about 1-day per month of time at the Green Bank 100-m telescope, and 0.5 days per month at the 300-m Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The PPTA uses several days per month at the 64-meter Parkes <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Algonquin 46m <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> (ARO) is a <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> at the Algonquin Radio Observatory, Canada. This <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> is {{historically}} famous for {{taking part in}} the first successful very long baseline interferometry experiment in the 1960s, where it was experimentally arrayed with the 26-metre Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, British Columbia.|$|R

These three projects have begun collaborating under the title of the International Pulsar Timing Array project.|$|R
5|$|This list {{of space}} telescopes (astronomical space observatories) is grouped by major {{frequency}} ranges: gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave and <b>radio.</b> <b>Telescopes</b> {{that work in}} multiple frequency bands are included {{in all of the}} appropriate sections. Space telescopes that collect particles, such as cosmic ray nuclei and/or electrons, as well as instruments that aim to detect gravitational waves, are also listed. Missions with specific targets within the Solar System (e.g. our Sun and its planets), are excluded; see List of Solar System probes for these, and List of Earth observation satellites for missions targeting our planet.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes,</b> {{one must}} identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
