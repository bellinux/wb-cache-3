40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> QC 20121221 </p...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, we reported the optimum operation scheduling method which can satisfy the environmental pollution constraint. In a general convenient method, the unit commitment of thermal power stations is {{decided by the}} priority method. But the priority method does not always decide the optimum unit commitment, {{and it may not}} consider the environmental pollution constraint. In this paper, we decide the unit commitment by the effect of stopping a thermal power station. This effect is calculated through considering the system’s cost increase when one thermal power station is stopped. We have considered the recirculating <b>type</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plants in our serial papers. In this paper, we consider the other energy storage units, for example, the multiple-use <b>type</b> <b>pumped</b> storage units, superconducting coils, or fly-wheels.

50|$|As the <b>RAM</b> <b>types</b> {{used for}} primary storage are {{volatile}} (uninitialized at start up), a computer containing only such storage {{would not have}} a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, non-volatile primary storage containing a small startup program (BIOS) is used to bootstrap the computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile secondary storage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for read-only memory (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of random access).|$|R
