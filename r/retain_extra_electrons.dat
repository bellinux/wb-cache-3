The Coulomb interaction and exchange interaction between the <b>extra</b> <b>electron</b> and {{the states of the}} Mn ion will mix the wavefunctions, split the impurity energy levels, break the previous selection rules and change the transition probabilities. Using this model of an <b>extra</b> <b>electron</b> in the doped quantum dot, we calculate the energy and the wave functions, the luminescence efficiency and the transition lifetime and compare with the experiments.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} molecular environment on the electronic and magnetic properties of the single-molecule magnet (SMM) Mn$_{ 12 }$, we explore two possible means for adding <b>extra</b> <b>electrons</b> to molecule. We explore both substitution of Mn ions by Fe ions and the inclusion of neighboring electronic donors. For both possibilities we calculate, within density-functional theory, the electronic structure, the total ground-state spin and ordering, the magnetic anisotropy barrier, the transverse magnetic anisotropy parameter $E$ {{which is responsible for}} some measured tunneling, and the tilting angle of the easy axis from the z axis. Our calculations show that the total spin increases with increasing number of <b>extra</b> <b>electrons</b> except for the case of Mn$_{ 8 }$Fe$_ 4 $ where the resulting ground state has a low spin. The calculated energy gaps between the unoccupied and the occupied orbitals exhibit no clear trend as a function of number of <b>extra</b> <b>electrons.</b> The calculated magnetic anisotropy barrier decreases with increasing number of <b>extra</b> <b>electrons</b> and can be directly chased to a quenching of Jahn-Teller distortions at the sites where the additional electrons are localized. The values of $E$ and the easy-axis tilting angles for the geometries with one- and two-extra electrons are significantly larger than those induced by solvent disorder. Comment: Submitted to Phys.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{to what extent the}} rigid-band-like {{electron}} doping scenario is applicable to the transition metal-substituted Fe-based superconductors, we have performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies of Ba(Fe_ 1 -xNi_x) _ 2 As_ 2 (Ni- 122) and Ba(Fe_ 1 -xCu_x) _ 2 As_ 2 (Cu- 122), and compared the results with Ba(Fe_ 1 -xCo_x) _ 2 As_ 2 (Co- 122). We find that Ni 3 d-derived features are formed below the Fe 3 d band and that Cu 3 d-derived ones further below it. The electron and hole Fermi surface (FS) volumes are found to increase and decrease with substitution, respectively, qualitatively consistent with the rigid-band model. However, the total <b>extra</b> <b>electron</b> number estimated from the FS volumes (the total electron FS volume minus the total hole FS volume) is found to decrease in going from Co-, Ni-, to Cu- 122 for a fixed nominal <b>extra</b> <b>electron</b> number, that is, the number of electrons that participate in the formation of FS decreases with increasing impurity potential. We find that the Néel temperature T_N and the critical temperature T_c maximum are determined by the FS volumes rather than the nominal <b>extra</b> <b>electron</b> concentration nor the substituted atom concentration.

40|$|Using {{classical}} and ab initio calculations we demonstrate that <b>extra</b> <b>electrons</b> can be trapped in pure crystalline and amorphous SiO 2 (a-SiO 2) in deep band gap states. The structure of trapped electron sites in pure a-SiO 2 {{is similar to}} that of Ge electron centers and so-called [SiO 4 /Li] 0 centers in α quartz. Classical potentials were used to generate amorphous silica models and density functional theory to characterize the geometrical and electronic structures of trapped electrons in crystalline and amorphous silica. The calculations demonstrate that an <b>extra</b> <b>electron</b> can be trapped at a Ge impurity in α quartz in six different configurations. An electron in the [SiO 4 /Li] 0 center is trapped on a regular Si ion with the Li ion residing nearby. <b>Extra</b> <b>electrons</b> can trap spontaneously on pre-existing structural precursors in amorphous SiO 2, while the electron self-trapping in α quartz requires overcoming a barrier of about 0. 6 eV. The precursors for electron trapping in amorphous SiO 2 comprise wide (≥ 132 ∘) O–Si–O angles and elongated Si–O bonds at the tails of corresponding distributions.
