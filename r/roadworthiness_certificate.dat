He soon purchased the Speyer plants for additional production capability, {{adding to the}} major assembly line in Karlsruhe. Given the location at the airfield, it appears {{he may have been}} planning to start aircraft production at Speyer as well.|$|E

50|$|Czech Republic {{requires}} emission inspection Měření emisí {{and safety}} inspection Technická kontrola {{every two years}} for passenger cars. New passenger cars have to obtain their first <b>roadworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> after four years. Until the end of 2014, an emission inspection decal (green) and a safety inspection decal (red) {{was placed on the}} rear license plate, after a vehicle has passed both emission and technical inspections. The expiration month and year was punched in each decal. Since 2015 only the safety inspection decal (red) is placed on the rear license plate, as passing the emission inspection was a prerequisite for admission to the safety inspection.|$|E
5000|$|In Austria, all {{vehicles}} must {{undergo a}} [...] "Wiederkehrende Begutachtung nach § 57a KFG" [...] (recurring inspection under section 57a {{of the motor}} vehicle statute). A decal is placed on the vehicle's windscreen (usually the upper left-hand corner as seen from outside the vehicle), hence the inspection itself is colloquially referred to as [...] "Pickerl" [...] (literally: sticker). The color of the decal is white for vehicles with a catalytic converter, and green for vehicles without one. Punch holes indicate the month and year that the next inspection is due. The actual inspection can be carried out one month in advance of that date and up to four months after the date indicated on the decal; the vehicle remains roadworthy during that time. Unless the inspection is overdue in the sense just described, the <b>roadworthiness</b> <b>certificate</b> is transferable, meaning a potential new owner will get a new decal with the same date, but the corrected license plate number upon registration of her vehicle. However, the latest official inspection report has to be presented for this purpose to the authority issuing the new registration documents and license plates.|$|E
