40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} expectation {{formation in}} a controlled experimental en-vironment. Subjects are asked to predict the price in a standard asset pricing model. They do not have knowledge of the underlying market equilibrium equa-tions, but they know all past <b>realized</b> <b>prices</b> and their own predictions. Aggregate demand of the risky asset depends upon the forecasts of the participants. The real-ized price is then obtained from market equilibrium with feedback from individual expectations. Each market is populated by six subjects and {{a small fraction of}} fundamentalist traders. <b>Realized</b> <b>prices</b> differ significantly from fundamental val-ues. In some groups the asset price converges slowly to the fundamental price, in other groups there are regular oscillations around the fundamental price. In all groups participants coordinate on a common prediction strategy. The individ-ual prediction strategies can be estimated and correspond, for a large majority of participants, to simple linear autoregressive forecasting rules...|$|R

50|$|Large block orders can {{generally}} not be executed immediately {{because there is}} no available counterparty with the same size. Instead, they must be sliced into smaller pieces which are sent to the market over time. Each slice has some impact on the price, so on average the <b>realized</b> <b>price</b> for a buy order will be higher than {{at the time of the}} decision, or less for a sell order.

50|$|VWAP {{is often}} used in {{algorithmic}} trading. Indeed, a broker may guarantee execution of an order at the VWAP and have a computer program enter the orders into the market in order to earn the trader's commission and create P&L. This is called a guaranteed VWAP execution. The broker can also trade in a best effort way and answer to the client the <b>realized</b> <b>price.</b> This is called a VWAP target execution; it incurs more dispersion in the answered price compared to the VWAP price for the client but a lower received/paid commission. Trading algorithms that use VWAP as a target belong to a class of algorithms known as volume participation algorithms.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{crop yield}} futures {{contracts}} is examined. The expectation being modeled here reflects {{that of an}} Illinois corn and soybeans producer at planting, of revenue realized at harvest. The effects of using price and crop yield contracts are measured {{by comparing the results}} of the expected distribution to the expected distribution found under five general alternatives: 1) a revenue hedge using just price futures, 2) a revenue hedge using crop yield futures, 3) an unhedged scenario where revenue is determined by <b>realized</b> <b>prices</b> and yields, 4) an unhedged scenario where revenue is determined by <b>realized</b> <b>prices</b> and yields and by participation in government support programs with deficiency payments, and 5) a no hedge scenario where revenue is determined by <b>realized</b> <b>prices</b> and yields and by participation in a proposed revenueassurance program. We draw four major conclusions from the results. First, hedging effectiveness using the new crop yield contract depends critically on yield basis risk which presumably can be reduced considerably by covering large geographical areas. Second, crop yield futures can be used in conjunction with price futures to derive risk management benefits significantly higher than using either of the two alone. Third, hedging using price and crop yield futures has a potential to offer benefits larger than those from the simulated revenue assurance program. However, the robustness of the findings depends largely on whether yield basis risk varies significantly across regions. Finally, the qualitative results described by the above three conclusions do not change depending on whether yields are distributed according to the beta or lognormal distribution. ...|$|R

50|$|Value Investors see {{securities}} {{as either}} priced correctly, under-priced, or over-priced. In contrast, MPT proponents insist that, by definition under the efficient-market hypothesis, a <b>realized</b> <b>price</b> {{of a stock}} is the correct price. Value investor purists reject the usefulness of capital asset pricing model (CAPM), in part, because it wrongly extrapolates historical volatility {{as a proxy for}} risk. For example, if equity prices of a company fell 75%, assuming the underlying fundamentals of the company were solid, an MPT practitioner would view it as volatile (risky); whereas, a value investor would determine whether it was undervalued, and if so, buy it, reasoning that the resulting downward risk is less than before. Therefore, value investors see MPT metrics—such as standard deviation, beta (relative standard deviation), alpha (excess return), and the Sharpe ratio (risk adjusted return)—as inadequate and even misleading.|$|E

This is forcefully argued by Friedrich von Hayek who therefore was skeptical about the objectivity of macroeconomic aggregations as such. However, this raises the question of [...] "what is the explanatory power of Austrian economics", if all we can say about a <b>realized</b> <b>price</b> is that it expresses a subjective preference, given that there are billions of subjective preferences which are all different.|$|E
