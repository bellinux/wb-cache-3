40|$|The Leak Path Factor {{analysis}} has been traditionally performed at Savannah River Site for various facilities subject to accident analysis. This paper addresses some recent {{work for the}} FB-Line building, which needed refinements to previous work {{that was based on}} a single volume approach. To model the entire building and all its simultaneous spills of contaminants in the different floors after a seismic event, a more complex multi-compartment analysis was performed using the CONTAIN 2. 01 computer code. This work enabled the analysts to improve the assessment of the source term for the subsequent evaluation of the onsite and offsite doses. The model developed for the FB-Line building includes 45 control volumes connected by 72 flow paths, and the contaminants were located at each floor of the building. The seismically qualified structures were modeled to bound the various volumes, and the interconnecting flow paths were modeled as closed doors with gaps, open doors, and doors opening with specified flow area time-history. Since the ventilation system is not seismically qualified, it was kept non-operational. The model included cracks in the expansion joints of the structural walls, and additional paths to the outside environment such as doorways and <b>roll-up</b> <b>doors.</b> The only forcing condition applied to the building was the wind pressure across th...|$|R

Self-storage facility operators frequently provide 24-hour access, climate controlled storage, outdoor storage for RVs and boats, and lights or power outlets inside the storage unit as amenities to set themselves apart from competitors.

The MP5 also gained more chrome trim, around the headlamps and elsewhere. April 1963 saw the introduction of automatic oil mixing for the two-stroke engine. In August 1969 new safety regulations required certain lighting changes, a driver's side headrest, and seatbelts. The MP5 remained in production until December 1971, and on sale into 1972.|$|E

50|$|The tornado {{initially}} {{touched down}} just inside western McCracken County, Kentucky and {{moved across the}} northern fringes of Paducah. The tornado was at EF2 strength in McCracken County, demolishing an abandoned mobile home, causing roof and siding damage to many structures (most of them being homes), destroying the foyer of a church, bending road signs, ripping a wooden fence out of the ground, and blowing over chain-link fences. At one building, three metal <b>roll-up</b> <b>doors</b> were blown in {{and part of a}} wall was blown out. The tops of three steel power transmission towers were bent over, power lines were downed, train car covers were blown off, and a sports utility vehicle was blown 30 yd into a ditch as well. Some damage to buildings and cooling towers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant was noted, though no hazardous materials were released. The tornado crossed the Ohio River into Massac County, Illinois where it went through Brookport at low-end EF3 strength and completely destroyed dozens of mobile homes, many of which were blown over 100 ft. Also in Brookport, a frail site-built home was leveled, and dozens of homes, garages, storage buildings, and businesses sustained structural damage. Hundreds of trees were downed and cars were tossed as well. The tornado caused some minor damage to guard rails on the Ohio River bridge that carries traffic from Paducah to Brookport on U.S. Highway 45. East of Brookport, the tornado maintained EF3 strength as it impacted the small rural community of Shady Grove. Mobile homes in Shady Grove were obliterated, with their frames wrapped around trees. An empty school bus was picked up and thrown, and a two-story home was pushed off of its foundation and had many of its first floor walls ripped off, along with its porch. Past Shady Grove, the tornado struck the neighboring community of Unionville, where additional low-end EF3 damage occurred. Many trees in Unionville were snapped, and a large double-wide mobile home was obliterated and swept away, with debris scattered 500 feet. The home's heavy 7-by-12 foot concrete porch slab was lifted and moved by the tornado. The tornado weakened to EF2 strength as it moved briefly through Pope County and then back across the Ohio River into Livingston County, destroying several mobile homes and barns in this area and snapping numerous trees. In Lyon County, the tornado downed additional trees before dissipating. Three people were killed and 33 additional people were injured along the tornado's 42-mile long path. All fatalities occurred in mobile homes that were destroyed in Brookport. Snow that fell in the area during the days following the tornado hindered cleanup efforts.|$|R

50|$|Made between 1932 and 1936, the {{original}} Contax, known as Contax I after later models were introduced, was markedly {{different from the}} corresponding Leica. Using a die-cast alloy body it housed a vertically travelling metal focal-plane shutter reminiscent of the one used in Contessa-Nettel cameras, made out of interlocking blackened brass slats somewhat like a <b>roll-up</b> garage <b>door.</b> This complex shutter became the characteristic of the Contax camera and its Super-Nettel derivative. By contrast, the competitive Leica followed the established design of using rubberized fabric shutter curtains wound around rollers, moving horizontally. The Contax design allowed a higher maximum shutter speed: the top speed was 1/1000s, then increased to 1/1250s in the Contax II. The fact the shutter ran across the shorter dimension of the format area was a significant factor for achieving this technical feat. The interlocking slats were aligned by specially woven silk ribbons, which were very strong but subject to wear. Replacing these ribbons was difficult but, contrary to modern cameras, made for a 400,000-cycle life.Zeiss also invented the System Camera, {{with all sorts of}} near-photo, wide-angle, mirror-house, long-focal-length lenses for specific situations. However Zeiss called it Universalkamera.One of the key design features was a coupled rangefinder with a very long baseline, with its own eyepiece next to that of the viewfinder. To enhance accuracy, a novel rotating wedge system was employed in lieu of the common swinging mirror mechanism. Other main features included focusing drive built into the camera body for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter-speed knob integral with film-wind knob placed {{at the front of the}} camera body, and black-enamelled finish.|$|R
