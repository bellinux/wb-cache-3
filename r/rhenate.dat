40|$|Single {{crystals}} of KSbO 3 -type rhenium oxides, La 4 Re 6 O 19, Pb 6 Re 6 O 19, Sr 2 Re 3 O 9 and Bi 3 Re 3 O 11, were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Their {{crystal structures}} {{can be regarded}} as a network of three-dimensional orthogonal-dimer lattice of edge-shared ReO 6 octahedra. All of them exhibit small magnitude of Pauli paramagnetism, indicating metallic electronic states without strong electron correlations. The resistivity of these <b>rhenates,</b> except Bi 3 Re 3 O 11, have a temperature dependence of rho(T) =ρ_ 0 +AT^n (n ≈ 1. 6) in a wide temperature range between 5 K and 300 K, which is extraordinary for three-dimensional metals without strong electron correlations. The resistivity of Bi 3 Re 3 O 11 shows an anomaly around at 50 K, where the magnetic susceptibility also detects a deviation from ordinary Pauli paramagnetism. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures. J. Phys.

40|$|Oxidation of [Re(CO) 5]- by a molar {{equivalent}} of PPh 2 Cl at ca. - 70 °C yielded three dinuclear complexes, Re 2 (μ-Cl) (μ-PPh 2) (CO) 8 (1), Re 2 (CO) 9 (PPh 2 H) (2) and Re 2 (μ-H) (μ-PPh 2) (CO) 8 (3), as major products. When PPh 2 Cl {{was present in}} two-fold excess, only 2 and ReCl(CO) 4 (PPh 2 H) (4) were isolated. All the complexes were characterized by IR and NMR (1 H and 31 P) spectroscopy. The crystal structures of 2 and 4 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Crystal data: ReCl(CO) 4 (PPh 2 H), space group P 21 /c, a = 11. 358 (1), b = 10. 365 (1), c = 14. 765 (3) Å, β = 96. 07 (1) °, final R = 0. 022 for 1891 observations; Re 2 (CO) 9 (PPh 2 H), space group P 21 /a, a = 12. 709 (1), b = 12. 072 (2), c = 15. 462 (2) Å, β = 92. 14 (1), final R = 0. 029 for 2093 observations. Complex 2 is the first structurally characterized Re 2 (CO) 9 (PR 3) complex with the phosphine substituent at the equatorial site. The complex Re 2 (η-PPh 2) 2 (CO) 8 was not detected {{and there is no}} evidence of direct nucleophilic attack of the <b>rhenate</b> on chlorodiphenylphosphine. © 1992.
