50|$|Traditionally {{circular}} with a fluted exterior, <b>ramekins</b> {{can also}} be found in novelty shapes like flowers, hearts, and stars.|$|R
50|$|Originally, cupcakes were {{baked in}} heavy pottery cups. Some bakers still use {{individual}} <b>ramekins,</b> small coffee mugs, large tea cups, or other small ovenproof pottery-type dishes for baking cupcakes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ramekins</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} to resist high temperatures, {{as they are}} frequently used in ovens or, {{in the case of}} crème brûlée, exposed to the flame of a cooking torch.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ramekin</b> ( [...] , also spelled ramequin) {{is a small}} glazed ceramic {{or glass}} bowl used for cooking and serving various dishes.|$|E
50|$|The company's {{products}} include <b>ramekin,</b> sharing puds, mini puds and mousses. Various {{styles are}} produced, including cheesecakes, puddings and tortes, in various flavours.|$|E
50|$|Soufflés are {{generally}} baked in individual ramekins {{of a few}} ounces or soufflé dishes of a few liters: these are typically glazed, flat-bottomed, round porcelain containers with unglazed bottoms, vertical or nearly vertical sides, and fluted exterior borders. The <b>ramekin,</b> or other baking vessel, may be coated with a thin film of butter to prevent the soufflé from sticking. Some preparations also include adding a coating of sugar, bread crumbs, or a grated hard cheese such as parmesan inside the <b>ramekin</b> {{in addition to the}} butter; some cooks believe this allows the soufflé to rise more easily.|$|E
5000|$|Custard may {{be cooked}} in a {{bain-marie}} {{to keep a}} crust from forming {{on the outside of}} the custard before the interior is fully cooked. In the case of the crème brûlée, placing the <b>ramekins</b> in a roasting pan and filling the pan with hot water until it is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the sides of the <b>ramekins</b> transfers the heat to the custard gently, which prevents the custard from curdling. The humidity from the steam that rises as the water heats helps keep the top of the custard from becoming too dry.|$|R
50|$|Gü {{launched}} in 2003 with three products: two chocolate mousses and a chocolate soufflé in glass <b>ramekins,</b> developed through {{a joint venture}} with a patisserie company in London. The venture had a seed capital of £65,000.|$|R
50|$|Turning out larger dishes {{requires}} care, as the custard easily splits. Larger dishes {{also require}} more care to avoid undercooking the interior or overcooking the exterior. Thus, crème caramel is often cooked {{and served in}} <b>ramekins.</b>|$|R
50|$|A simple {{presentation}} is the dip {{served in a}} small bowl or large <b>ramekin.</b> A bread bowl prepared using hollowed-out bread filled with spinach dip is another method of presentation. Spinach dips are sometimes served hot.|$|E
50|$|Another classic egg custard dish, crème brûlée {{tends to}} be {{prepared}} and served in a <b>ramekin</b> without any pastry or fruit topping and is given a fully caramelised top (by grilling a sugar topping until it is a hard, solid glaze).|$|E
50|$|For the gratinéed version, the croute is {{topped with}} cheese and broiled or baked. The soup is then {{immediately}} served in the bowl or <b>ramekin</b> {{in which it was}} broiled (or, in the United Kingdom, grilled), baked, or—in family-style—immediately transferred to individual serving bowls via a ladle.|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the dish}} most likely derives from the mortar and pestle used to prepare it. Terry Breverton, in The Tudor Kitchen: What the Tudors Ate & Drank (2015), {{suggests}} putting the mortis into individual <b>ramekins</b> and chilling them before serving.|$|R
5000|$|Yorkshire pudding {{is cooked}} by pouring a batter made from milk (or water), flour and eggs into preheated, oiled, baking pans, <b>ramekins</b> or muffin tins (in {{the case of}} {{miniature}} puddings). A basic formula uses [...] cup flour and [...] cup liquid per egg.|$|R
50|$|Crème brûlée {{is usually}} served in {{individual}} <b>ramekins.</b> Discs of caramel may be prepared separately {{and put on}} top just before serving, or the caramel may be formed directly {{on top of the}} custard, immediately before serving. To do this, sugar is sprinkled onto the custard, then caramelized under a salamander broiler or with a butane torch.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{presenting}} {{only the}} cake {{itself in a}} <b>ramekin</b> or on a plate, the baker may choose {{to make it more}} appealing. Fresh raspberries, a drizzling of raspberry and/or chocolate sauce, and dustings of powdered sugar may be added to enhance flavor, or a sprig of mint may look more appealing as well. For a more intense chocolate taste, the baker may also add a tablespoon of strong coffee.|$|E
50|$|The second {{method is}} to break the egg in an , {{porcelain}} cup or <b>ramekin</b> with a lid, and cook using a bain-marie. The inside of the egg coddler is first buttered in order to flavor the egg {{and allow it to}} be removed more easily. A raw egg (sometimes with additional flavorings) is broken into the coddler, which is then placed in a pan of near-boiling water for 7 to 8 minutes to achieve a solid white and yolk.|$|E
50|$|Molten {{chocolate}} cakes {{are nearly}} always baked in <b>ramekin</b> dishes and have four main ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar, and chocolate. Like most cakes, this recipe uses flour. The butter and chocolate are melted together, while {{the eggs are}} either whisked with the sugar to form a thick paste, producing a denser finished product, or are separated so the egg whites can be whipped into an egg foam to provide more lift (and thus a lighter cake) when the mixture is baked.|$|E
50|$|More than 750 million {{pieces of}} Corning Ware's range/oven-to-table service have been {{manufactured}} since its inception. A partial product list includes: browning skillets, cake pans, casserole dishes, coffee pots (drip), dinner service (Centura by Corning), Dutch ovens, frying pans, grab-it bowls, loaf pans, percolators, pie plates, <b>ramekins,</b> restaurant ware (Pyroceram), roasters, sauce pans, skillets, souffle dishes, and teapots.|$|R
50|$|With {{a normal}} {{capacity}} of 50 - 250 ml, <b>ramekins</b> {{are commonly used}} for preparing and serving individual portions {{of a variety of}} dishes, including crème brûlée, French onion soup, molten chocolate cake, moin moin, cheese or egg dishes, poi, macaroni and cheese, lasagna, potted shrimps, ice cream, soufflé, baked cocottes, crumbles, or scallops, or used to serve side garnishes and condiments alongside an entrée.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of serving dishes are used to {{transport}} food from kitchen to table or to serve it at table, {{in order to make}} food service easier and cleaner or more efficient and pleasant. Serving dishes include: butter dishes; casseroles; fruit bowls; <b>ramekins</b> or lidded serving bowls; compotes; pitchers or jugs; platters, salvers, and trays; salt and pepper shakers or salt cellars; sauce or gravy boats; tureens and tajines; vegetable or salad bowls.|$|R
50|$|Onion soups {{have been}} popular {{at least as}} far back as Roman times. Throughout history, they were seen as food for poor people, as onions were {{plentiful}} and easy to grow. The modern version of this soup originates in Paris, France in the 18th century, made from beef broth, and caramelized onions. It is often finished by being placed under a grill in a <b>ramekin</b> with croutons and Comté melted on top. The crouton on top is reminiscent of ancient soups (see history of soup).|$|E
50|$|Shirred {{eggs are}} eggs {{that have been}} baked in a gratin dish with a flat bottom. Traditionally they have been cooked in a dish called a shirrer, from which the dish gets its name, but the name now applies {{regardless}} {{of the type of}} dish in which they are baked. They differ from eggs en cocotte, which are baked in a <b>ramekin</b> sitting in a bain-marie, or water bath. Shirred eggs can be served at breakfast, brunch, lunch, or any other time of day. They are typically baked simply with butter until the whites have set and the yolks are thickened, and are usually served in the dish in which they were baked.|$|E
50|$|Bitterballen (plural of bitterbal) are a Dutch meat-based snack, {{typically}} {{containing a}} mixture of beef or veal (minced or chopped), beef broth, butter, flour for thickening, parsley, salt and pepper, resulting in a thick roux. Most recipes include nutmeg {{and there are also}} variations utilising curry powder or that add in finely chopped vegetables such as carrot. The ingredients are combined and cooked, then refrigerated for the mixture to firm up. Once firm, the filling is rolled into balls roughly 3 to 4 cm in diameter, then battered in a breadcrumb and egg mixture and deep-fried. They are typically served with a <b>ramekin</b> or small bowl of mustard for dipping. They are eaten in Suriname, the Netherlands Antilles, the Netherlands, Belgium, and to some degree in Indonesia. The very similar but spicy cutlets of Sri Lanka can also be made with fish instead of meat.|$|E
5000|$|Shirred eggs, {{also known}} as baked eggs, are eggs that have been baked in a {{flat-bottomed}} dish; the name originates from the type of dish {{in which it was}} traditionally baked. Shirred eggs are considered a simple and reliable dish that can be easily varied and expanded upon. An alternative way of cooking is to crack the eggs into individual <b>ramekins,</b> and cook them in a water bath, creating the French dish [...]|$|R
50|$|Puto kutsinta or kutsinta (also spelled kutchinta or cuchinta) {{is a type}} of steamed {{rice cake}} (puto) found {{throughout}} the Philippines. It is made from a mixture of rice flour, brown sugar and lye, enhanced with yellow food coloring or annatto extract, and steamed in small <b>ramekins.</b> The cooked cakes are topped with fresh grated meat from mature coconut. It is consumed year-round as a merienda or snack, and is frequently sold along with puto. Unlike its counterpart, which has a doughy texture, kutsina has a jelly-like, chewy consistency. It can be also enhanced by adding latik for a sweeter taste.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{there were two}} {{different}} uses for the name cup cake or cupcake. In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, <b>ramekins,</b> or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in. This {{is the use of}} the name that has remained, and the name of [...] "cupcake" [...] is now given to any small cake that {{is about the size of}} a teacup. While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcakes, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate icing.|$|R
40|$|With the {{discovery}} of conductivity in doped polyacetylene (PA), {{a new era in}} synthetic metals has emerged by breaking the traditionally accepted view that polymers were always insulating. Conducting polymers are essentially characterized by the presence of conjugated bonding on the polymeric back bone, which facilitates the formation of polarons and bipolarons as charge carriers. Among the numerous conducting polymers synthesized to date, polypyrrole (PPy) {{is by far the most}} extensively studied because of prodigious number of applications owing to its facile polymerizability, environmental stability, high electrical conductivity, biocompatibility, and redox state dependent physico-chemical properties. Electrochemically prepared PPy is more interesting than the chemically prepared polymer because it adheres to the electrode surface and can be directly used for applications such as supercapacitors, electrochemical sensors, electromechanical actuators and drug delivery systems. In quest for improvement in quality of the device performances in the mentioned applications, micro and nano structured polymeric materials which bring in large surface area are studied. Finding a simple and efficient method of synthesis is very important for producing devices of PPy microstructures. Till date, Hard and soft template methods are the most employed methods for synthesis of these structures. Soft template based electrochemical methods are better than hard template methods to grow clean PPy microstructures on electrode substrates as procedures for removal of hard templates after the growth of microstructures are very complex. As per the literature, there is no unique method available to grow PPy microstructures which can demonstrate several applications. Although gas bubble based soft template methods are exploited to grow conducting polymer microstructures of sizes in few hundreds of micrometers, studies on applications of the same are limited. Hence it is planned to develop procedures to grow microstructures that can be used in several applications. In the current work, PPy microstructures with high coverage densities are synthesized on various electrode substrates by soft template based electrochemical techniques. Hollow, hemispherical and spherical PPy microstructures are developed by a two step method using electro generated hydrogen bubble templates on SS 304 electrodes. In the first step, Hydrogen bubbles are electro generated and stabilized on the electrode in the presence of β- naphthalene sulfonic acid (β-NSA). In the second step, Pyrrole is oxidised over the bubble template to form PPy microstructures. Microstructures (open and closed cups) of average size 15 μm are uniformly spread on the surface with a coverage density of 2. 5 × 105 units /cm 2. Globular PPy microstructures are developed by a single step method using concomitantly electro generated oxygen bubble templates on SS 304 electrodes during electropolymerization. Microstructures of average size 4 μm are uniformly spread on the surface with a coverage density of 7 × 105 units/cm 2. Surfactant properties of Zwitterionic 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 1 -piperazine ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES) are exploited for the first time to grow conducting polymer microstructures. <b>Ramekin</b> shaped PPy microstructures are developed using HEPES as the surfactant to stabilize hydrogen bubble templates in a two step electrochemical synthesis method. Microramekins of size 100 µm are uniformly spread on the surface with a coverage density of 3000 units/cm 2. Micropipettes and microhorns of PPy are synthesised by a single step electrochemical route using HEPES as a surfactant. Hollow micropipettes of length 7 µm with an opening of 200 nm at the top of the structure are observed. Similarly microhorn/celia structures are observed with length 10 - 15 µm. Microcelia are uniformly distributed over the surface with each structure having a diameter of 2 µm at the base to 150 nm at the tip. Growth mechanism based on contact angle of the reactant solution droplets on the substrate is proposed. PPy microstructures are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy to study morphology, ‘chemical bonding and structure’, ‘defects and charge carriers’. Applicability of the electrodes with PPy microstructures in supercapacitors is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrical impedance spectroscopy. Electrodes developed by all the above methods demonstrated very good supercapacitance properties. Supercapacitor studies revealed very high specific capacitances (580, 915, 728 and 922 F/g,) and specific powers (20, 25, 13. 89 and 15. 91 kW/kg) for electrodes with PPy microstructures (H 2 bubble based two step method, O 2 bubble based single step method, HEPES stabilized H 2 bubbble method and HEPES based microhorn/celia structures respectively). Supercapacitive behavior of all the electrodes is retained even after an extended charge-discharge cycling in excess of 1500 cycles. Horseradish peroxidase entrapped, bowl shaped PPy microstructures are developed for H 2 O 2 biosensing. Amperometric biosensor has a performance comparable to the sensors reported in the literature with high sensitivity value of 12. 8 μA/(cm 2. mM) in the range 1. 0 mM to 10 mM. Glucose oxidase entrapped PPy amperometric biosensor is developed for Glucose sensing. Sensitivity of 1. 29 mA/(cm 2. mM) is observed for β-D-Glucose sensing in the 0. 1 mM to 5. 0 mM range while 58 μA/(cm 2. mM) is observed in the 5. 0 to 40 mM range. Potentiometric urea sensor with urease entrapped PPy microstructures on SS electrode is developed. It is able to sense urea in the micromolar ranges down to 0. 1 μM. It represented an excellent performance with sensitivity of 27 mV/decade. Sensitivity in the micromolar range is 4. 9 mV/(μM. cm 2). Drug encapsulation and delivery is successfully demonstrated by two actuation means (i) by electrochemical actuation, (ii) by actuation based on pH changes. Concepts are proved by delivering a fluorescent dye into neutral and acidic solutions. Drug delivery is confirmed by UV-Visible spectroscopy and Fluorescence microscopy. Finally, Micro/nanostructures with Tangerine, Hollow globular (Pani Poori), Chip, Flake, Rose, Worm, Horn and Celia shapes are synthesized electrochemically and scanning electron microscopic studies are presented. Controlled growth of microstructures on lithographically patterned gold interdigital electrodes is demonstrated with a future goal of creating addressable microstructures. The studies reported in the thesis provide an insight on various applications of PPy microstructures (supercapacitors, sensors and drug delivery systems) developed by a unique methodology based on electrochemically generated gas bubble templates...|$|E
