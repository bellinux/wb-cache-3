50|$|Clansman Control Harness {{refers to}} a range of {{accessories}} which were fitted into vehicles for the purpose of <b>controlling</b> the <b>set(s)</b> and providing other features such as loud speakers, a vehicle intercom system, and switching between two <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>Control</b> boxes provided the switching and facilities to plug the audio gear into.|$|R
5000|$|Ready {{and busy}} signal tones were {{adjusted}} by the <b>radio</b> <b>set's</b> volume <b>control.</b> This resulted {{in situations where}} users got a busy signal but could not hear it because the vehicle's siren was on or the patrol car windows were rolled down.|$|R
5000|$|A three radio theremin (Super Theremin, [...] ) {{invented by}} Tomoya Yamamoto (...) , {{composed}} of three independent <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>Radio</b> <b>set</b> #1 is {{to listen and}} to record the signal at around 1600kHz. <b>Radio</b> <b>set</b> #2 is tuned at 1145kHz so that its local oscillator of around 1600kHz is to be received by <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> #1. <b>Radio</b> <b>set</b> #3 is also tuned at 1145kHz so that its local oscillator may produce the beat with <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> #2. Operator's hand movement around bar antenna of <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> #3 may affect the local oscillator to produce tonal change.|$|R
50|$|As the {{conductivity}} of {{a medium}} increases, the more a radio signal passing through it is attenuated. High frequencies are also attenuated more than low frequencies, {{and tend to}} reflect off {{the surface of the}} water more. As is well known communication with military submarines uses very low frequency electromagnetic radiation for this reason. Military frequencies are well below allocated hobby radio control bands, but the lowest hobby bands - typically around 27Mhz/40Mhz - can penetrate several feet of water at short distances - typically less than 50 yards. Penetration at these frequencies is better in fresh water - a lake or swimming pool, and difficult to impossible in sea water. Modern <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> <b>sets</b> using the 2.4Ghz band penetrate water very badly, and are of no use to a model submariner who wishes to dive.|$|R

40|$|When {{more than}} one <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> is {{operating}} simultaneously in the same platform, the inter modulation frequencies are generated due to sum and difference frequencies of their carriers which could affect these <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> mutually. Also these sum and difference interfering frequencies will have sufficient radiated field intensity especially the third order mixing products {{that could lead to}} blocking of signals in the receivers co located in nearby platforms also. Therefore it is necessary to evolve a frequency table for the entire operating band of frequencies of <b>Radio</b> <b>sets,</b> especially when it is more than two carriers. For three <b>Radio</b> <b>sets</b> mutual EMI problem this computation was carried out for a tactical vehicle equipped with HF, VHF-VHF Communication configuration. Besides inter modulation EMI in <b>radio</b> <b>sets,</b> there are EMI issues connected with Communication system installation aspects including grounding and other EMI contributions from co located electronic subsystems of same vehicular platform. This paper addresses those issues in brief and concludes with a consolidated flow chart for resolving them, illustrating the actions necessary for meeting the EMC goals of multi <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> Communication System...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, U.S. troops {{sometimes}} employed {{hand crank}} generators, GN-35 and GN-45, to power Signal Corps <b>Radio</b> <b>sets.</b> The hand cranking was laborious, but generated sufficient current for smaller <b>radio</b> <b>sets,</b> {{such as the}} SCR-131, SCR-161, SCR-171, SCR-284, and SCR-694.|$|R
