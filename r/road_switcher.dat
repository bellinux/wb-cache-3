Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the cab roof. Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their road switchers for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|E

2500|$|ALCO-GE was EMD's {{most serious}} {{competitor}} during the Dieselization era, having produced the first road-switcher Diesel locomotives in 1941 and gained about a 40% {{market share of}} Diesel locomotives, mostly for switching and short-haul applications, as of 1948. [...] ALCO's attempts to develop higher powered locomotives for mainline service had been less successful, as they were plagued by reliability problems. [...] In 1948 the ALCO-GE partnership developed a prototype gas-turbine-electric locomotive; customer delivery began in 1952. [...] Baldwin's early ventures into road Diesel production, while innovative, borrowed ill-suited design and production concepts from steam and electric locomotives, and were not sufficiently reliable to gain acceptance. [...] Baldwin's postwar steam turbine-electric locomotives were spectacularly unsuccessful. [...] Fairbanks-Morse entered the locomotive industry {{at the end of}} the war by partnering with General Electric to produce [...] "Erie-built" [...] locomotives using F-M's opposed-piston engine that they had developed for marine use. [...] In early 1949 GE ended the partnership, undermining F-M's tentative foothold in the industry. Facing desperation as the market for steam power collapsed, Lima-Hamilton produced a total of 174 Diesel locomotives of various models starting in 1949 but it was too little too late to make the company a serious player in the Diesel business. [...] By 1950 it was clear that EMD's competitors could not crack their position in mainline road Diesels and their introduction of the EMD GP7 <b>road</b> <b>switcher</b> locomotive in 1949 marked their arrival in the mainstay of ALCO's business.|$|E

50|$|A <b>road</b> <b>switcher</b> {{is a type}} of {{railroad}} locomotive which was originally employed for delivering or picking up railcars outside of a railroad yard. Both type and term are North American in origin, although similar types have been used elsewhere. Since the <b>road</b> <b>switcher</b> must work some distance away from a yard, it must be able to operate at road speeds, it must also have high-visibility while it is switching, and it must have the ability to run in both directions. Additionally, a <b>road</b> <b>switcher</b> must have the power rating and cooling capacity of a traditional road engine, and a <b>road</b> <b>switcher</b> must have high-speed (i.e., road) trucks, not low-speed (i.e., switcher) trucks. Modern road trucks are always equipped with (frictionless) roller bearings; switcher trucks were almost always equipped with (friction) plain bearings, until such bearings were outlawed in interchange service on railcars and locomotives.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the above locomotives the Massachusetts Central Railroad would on occasion lease power from the B&L. Small 4-4-0, 4-6-0, and 0-4-0 locomotives predominated through 1900 partially due to weight restrictions over the line's bridges. After 1900 the 4-4-0 locomotives continued to provide {{the bulk of the}} power for passenger service with class B-14 and B-15 2-6-0, class L-1 4-8-0, and class A-41-f 4-4-0 locomotives mixed in for longer and freight trips. During WWII K-8-b and K-8-c class 2-8-0 locomotives worked the larger ammunition trains on the eastern end of the line. J-1 class 4-4-2 locomotives generally handled passenger service during the war and into the 1950s. Diesel power arrived in the mid-1950s with EMD SW9 switchers regularly assigned to the Marlborough local freight starting in June 1953. <b>Road</b> <b>switchers</b> equipped with steam generators took over passenger service on the Central Massachusetts Branch starting in 1956.
