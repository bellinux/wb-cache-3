DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The apparatus for feeding a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building platform {{for the production of}} an object in the way of a generative production process, where the object is linearly movable mounted relative to a material reservoir and the building platform along a moving plane, to which the material reservoir and the building platform are deflectable in an orthogonal manner, comprises a belt (13) that tightly circulates around two rigid shaped bodies and fits onto the shaped bodies in an areawise manner, and a drive transferring the belt in circulation around the shaped bodies. The belt has a belt portion (17), which is fixedly arrangeable relative to one of the shaped bodies, in belt longitudinal extension around the shaped bodies, where the belt portion areawisely contacts with the material during the linear movement from the material reservoir to the building platform. A belt surface area is assigned to the belt portion and is inclined at an angle (alpha) against the moving plane. The shaped bodies are formed as cylinder rollers (11, 12, 12 ') with roller axes running parallel to each other. The shaped bodies are formed as rigid sliding bodies, where the belt is slidably guided to a partial surface of the sliding bodies that serves for supporting the belt surface area inclined at the angle of alpha. The shaped body has a partial surface that serves for supporting the belt surface area inclined at the angle of alpha. The roller bodies, over which the belt is <b>rollably</b> mounted, are provided on the partial surface of the shaped body. The inclination of the belt surface area at the angle (alpha) is adjustable by using cylinder rollers differently sized in roller diameter. One of the cylinder rollers is pivotably mounted relative to the other cylinder roller. The drive is formed as motorically driven cylinder roller. The belt has a coating made of polytetrafluoroethylene. The belt surface turned to the material has a nanocoating. The belt has continuous pores. The belt portion, which contacts with the material, has a belt rolling direction turned away from the moving plane. A vibrating unit is integrated in one shaped body for generating vibrations. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for feeding a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building platform for the production of an object in the way of a generative production process. USE - Apparatus for feeding a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building platform for the production of an object in the way of a generative production process. ADVANTAGE - The apparatus is capable of simply and effectively feeding the material coating on the building platform without material shrinkage or shape distortion...|$|E
