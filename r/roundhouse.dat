5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original <b>roundhouse,</b> located {{on the end of a}} spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger <b>roundhouse,</b> located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new <b>roundhouse,</b> where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are stored and maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E

5|$|In 1972 Jonathan Miller {{directed}} his first opera with {{a production of}} Noye's Fludde, staged during 21–23 December at the <b>Roundhouse</b> Theatre, London. The adult roles were taken by Michael Williams (God), Bryan Drake (Noah) and Isabelle Lucas (Mrs Noah), and the conductor was John Lubbock.|$|E
50|$|Whilst the North Ipswich, and Willowburn (1928-9) <b>roundhouses</b> were {{developed}} using a two-thirds circular design, Rockhampton was unique in Queensland in featuring a fully enclosed space. The ambitious plans for two <b>roundhouses</b> at Rockhampton was similarly mirrored {{in the development}} of the Mayne steam locomotive depot where three semi-circular <b>roundhouses</b> were planned. These plans were later altered for the construction of a through engine shed design based on American patterning (c.1918).|$|R
50|$|Found in July 2015 by {{students}} from Bournemouth University {{as part of}} the Durotriges Big Dig project, the remains of 16 Iron Age <b>roundhouses</b> have been excavated while geophysical survey shows a total of at least 150 <b>roundhouses</b> and other features in the area.|$|R
50|$|After {{the last}} <b>roundhouses</b> (Numbers 3 and 4) were closed in 1967 and steam {{locomotives}} {{ceased to be}} allocated to York, the remaining allocation of diesel locomotives were maintained in the straight shed which had been built to replace <b>roundhouses</b> no 1 and 2 in 1954.|$|R
5|$|The WDWRR {{does not}} run during {{fireworks}} shows, given that its track runs {{close to the}} fireworks staging area. Since 1999, a separately-priced tour of the WDWRR named Disney's The Magic Behind Our Steam Trains Tour has been available once daily, and includes access to the railroad's otherwise-restricted <b>roundhouse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The museum hosts {{a number}} of annual events and some {{one-time}} railroading events that bring rail fans from across the country. In 2012, the Bob Julian <b>Roundhouse</b> was the stage for all 20 of Norfolk Southern's Heritage locomotives during a two-day photographic event. In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives gathered around the Bob Julian <b>Roundhouse</b> turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam Passenger locomotive, visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation. This notable locomotive remained in Spencer for repair and restoration work {{to allow it to}} once again pull passenger excursions across the southeast.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the village, Felin Uchaf is an {{educational}} centre exploring ways of living and working in partnership with the environment. Developed on a redundant farm, it provides residential courses in rural skills and sustainable agriculture. A traditional Iron Age <b>roundhouse</b> has been built on the site.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>roundhouses</b> built in the US and Canada no longer exist, lie in ruins, or have been repurposed; however, {{a small number of}} them still exist and continue to operate in their intended capacity as facilities used for storing and servicing locomotives. Below is a list of notable locations with operational <b>roundhouses.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{foundations}} of iron age <b>roundhouses,</b> of the 2nd century BC. The largest was 14.5 m in diameter: there are {{remains of a}} ring of seven or eight postholes and a central hearth. The building, {{one of the largest}} such <b>roundhouses</b> found in Cornwall, may have been a meeting place, rather than a dwelling.|$|R
5|$|At its peak, around 1917, Thistle {{had about}} 600 residents. The town's {{railroad}} infrastructure included a five-stall <b>roundhouse,</b> depot, machine shop, and structures to restock passing trains with sand, coal and water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} feuding, the Western Railroad {{joined with the}} Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B). The Housatonic Railroad was {{acquired}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH) as its Berkshire Division in 1892, with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport. In 1900, the New York Central Railroad (NYC) leased the B, though the latter retained its independent identity for decades after. The B operated a rail yard and <b>roundhouse</b> just north of Union Station.|$|E
5|$|An {{option to}} ride on {{a seat in the}} tenders of the DRR's {{locomotives}} is available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the start of each operating day. The option to ride in the DRR's Lilly Belle parlor car is also available upon request at Main Street, U.S.A. Station when a Disneyland employee is available to monitor the passengers aboard it and no heavy rain is falling. The DRR's <b>roundhouse,</b> which cannot normally be viewed by the public, is made available for viewing to participants of specific runDisney events where the race course organized for the runners goes past the facility.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the great}} {{dieselisation}} {{era of the}} 1940s and 1950s, many <b>roundhouses</b> have been demolished or put to other uses, but a few still stand and remain in use on the railroads. Early <b>roundhouses</b> were too small for later locomotives. The unusual shape of the buildings can make them difficult to adapt to new uses, but can also be aesthetically appealing.|$|R
50|$|Archeology {{has also}} {{discovered}} a substantial late Iron Age settlement of <b>roundhouses</b> in nearby Hayton.|$|R
5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's <b>roundhouse</b> where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Devin Townsend Project being {{originally}} a four-album series, Townsend decided {{to continue working}} under the moniker and released the fifth album, Epicloud on September 18, 2012. Again featuring Anneke van Giersbergen on vocals, Epicloud appeared on several European charts, peaking at number 8 in Finland. On October 27, 2012, Devin Townsend performed a one-off show covering his musical career called The Retinal Circus at <b>Roundhouse</b> in London. The 3-hour performance was recorded in high definition and released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 30, 2013. Also in 2012, Townsend played bass on the debut Bent Sea album Noistalgia. He also produced the record.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Waugh {{accepted}} {{a fee of}} £250 from the BBC for an adaptation of Pinfold, as a radio play, by Michael Bakewell. The broadcast, on 7 June 1960, was well received by the critics, although Waugh did not listen to it. In September 1977 a staged version of the book, written by Ronald Harwood and directed by Michael Elliott, opened at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester. The play was brought to London, and performed at the <b>Roundhouse</b> Theatre in February 1979, where Michael Hordern's depiction of Pinfold was highly praised—"a man suffering from chronic indigestion of the soul".|$|E

5|$|Not {{wanting a}} tainted victory, Cena broke the hold and {{attacked}} Laurinaitis. As Cena {{returned to the}} ring, Punk performed a Go to Sleep on Cena and pinned him to win the WWE Championship. McMahon ordered {{the winner of the}} Raw Money in the Bank match, Alberto Del Rio, to cash in his contract on Punk. When Del Rio ran out and tried to cash in his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match, Punk performed a <b>roundhouse</b> kick on Del Rio before he could do so. After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon, Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a tag team match {{featuring}} {{the team of}} Trish Stratus and Ashley against the team of Victoria and Torrie Wilson (with Candice Michelle as Victoria and Wilson's manager). The match started off with Wilson and Stratus in the ring. Wilson tagged in Victoria, who applied a full-body choke on Stratus, but Stratus started to work on Victoria's arm. Victoria countered Stratus' arm takedown. Stratus then performed a Headscissors Takedown. Back and forth action continued; the match, however, {{came to an end}} when Stratus was able to perform a <b>roundhouse</b> kick on Victoria, giving the victory to Stratus and Ashley.|$|E
5|$|Their 2000's demo was {{followed}} by a full-length album released through Prime Directive Records entitled Dust to Ashes in April 2001. Just prior to entering the studio, Vijay Kumar (of <b>Roundhouse</b> and Cat Burglar) took the bass position and Molly Street enrolled as keyboard player. The addition of keyboards was an unconventional move for a metalcore act as it brought some black metal influences into the music. Just as the album saw issue Born quit the band but a quickfire substitute was located in Derek Youngsma of Cast in Stone repute.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, from {{the seventh century}} BCE, {{cellular}} houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic <b>roundhouses,</b> substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic <b>roundhouses</b> began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness.|$|R

5|$|Three stone hearths and {{traces of}} red ochre found on Jura and dated to 6000BC are the {{earliest}} stone-built structures found {{so far in}} Scotland. However, in general the Neolithic sites in the Inner Hebrides lack the scale and drama of those found in Orkney and the Western Isles. There are numerous Iron Age sites including the remains of Dun Ringill fort on Skye, which are similar in layout to that of both a broch and a complex Atlantic <b>roundhouse.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to New Orleans, Billy tells Ross {{that he intends}} to retire {{at the end of the}} month and live with his girlfriend Sophia. Later, Ross is forced to accept a mission from CIA operative Mr. Church to retrieve an item from a downed airplane in Albania. Church sends technical expert Maggie Chan with the team. In Albania the Expendables retrieve the item, but are then ambushed by international criminal and arms dealer Jean Vilain, his right-hand man Hector and his mercenary group (the Sangs), who have captured Billy. Vilain demands the item in exchange for Billy's life. The team gives up the item, but Vilain <b>roundhouse</b> kicks a knife through Billy's heart and flees with the Sangs by helicopter. Ross recovers a note for Sophia from Billy's body; the team buries their fallen comrade, swearing vengeance on Vilain.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{since the}} 1960s have {{distinguished}} brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest {{evidence of the}} occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they {{would continue to be}} used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a <b>roundhouse</b> with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
