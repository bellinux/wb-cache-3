40|$|Normal human {{limitations}} {{mean that}} when people decide how to act, they often have to base their decisions on flawed information or reasoning. Even when agents <b>reason</b> {{to the best of}} their ability, and form intentions consistent with that reasoning, they sometimes get things wrong. Dominant theories about <b>reasons</b> for action argue that all good, or ‘normative’, <b>reasons</b> for acting are objective normative <b>reasons.</b> But objective normative <b>reasons</b> for action are derived from facts about the world that ignore certain facts about human agents. On these accounts of <b>reasons,</b> real human agents can be unable to learn what they have normative <b>reason</b> to do. A common response to this problem is to say that in such situations people act in a praiseworthy way, but their actions are based on false beliefs, and false beliefs cannot be good <b>reasons.</b> I argue that when agents <b>reason</b> {{to the best of their}} ability and form intentions consistent with that reasoning, agents act appropriately in response to states of the world that are normative <b>reasons</b> for action. To support my claim, I develop an account of what I call ‘justifiable reasons’, normative <b>reasons</b> for action that human agents can always use as a basis for action, and the form of <b>reason</b> that underpins rationality. I discuss the similarities and differences between my account of justifiable <b>reasons</b> and several approaches to <b>reasons</b> that resemble my account. I show that, in spite of objections, justifiable <b>reasons</b> are normative <b>reasons,</b> not motivating <b>reasons.</b> Accounts of subjective normative <b>reasons</b> are based on examples that look similar to mine. So, I explain why justifiable <b>reasons</b> are not subjective normative <b>reasons.</b> Some features of internal <b>reasons</b> also resemble features of justifiable <b>reasons.</b> But, I show that there is nothing about justifiable <b>reasons</b> that entails that they must be internal or external <b>reasons.</b> I take it that justifiable and objective normative <b>reasons</b> serve different purposes, so I explain these different purposes. Finally, I argue in support of my claim that to be rational, agents must act appropriately in response to justifiable <b>reasons...</b>|$|R

5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf <b>reasoned</b> that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart <b>reasoned</b> that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

For example, Bernard Williams (1981) argues that there are really only internal <b>reasons</b> for action. Such a view is called internalism about <b>reasons</b> (or <b>reasons</b> internalism). Externalism about <b>reasons</b> (or <b>reasons</b> externalism) is the denial of <b>reasons</b> internalism.

In later discussions, Nagel treats his former view as an incomplete attempt to convey {{the fact that there are}} distinct classes of <b>reasons</b> and values, and speaks instead of [...] "agent-relative" [...] and [...] "agent-neutral" [...] <b>reasons.</b> In the case of agent-relative <b>reasons</b> (the successor to subjective <b>reasons)</b> specifying the content of the <b>reason</b> makes essential reference back to the agent for whom it is a <b>reason.</b> An example of this might be: [...] "Anyone has a <b>reason</b> to honor his or her parents."

40|$|Scattered {{remarks on}} {{different}} types of <b>reason</b> {{can be found in}} Emil Cioran’s books. In the here presented essay it was shown that all the distinguished varieties of <b>reason</b> are connected to each other and it is possible to talk about emerging of another type from the previous one. These types are: naïve <b>reason,</b> rationalistic <b>reason,</b> negating <b>reason,</b> doubtful <b>reason</b> and expanded <b>reason.</b> Naïve <b>reason</b> is the one that serves life without self-consciousness. Rationalistic <b>reason</b> makes decrees on reality. In his critical remarks Cioran describes rationalistic <b>reason</b> as being dangerous. Two other types of <b>reason</b> are the negating and the doubtful one. Cioran proves that affirmation leads human beings to giving up themselves and that liberation always comes through constant fight for negation. Negating <b>reason</b> is always turned towards something external to itself. Doubtful <b>reason</b> goes much further by actually turning against itself, it is in constant struggle against itself. Cioran describes this process as separating the <b>reason</b> and standing face to face with yourself. Therefore he is aware that only the <b>reason</b> itself can become a judge of <b>reason.</b> The fifth type of <b>reason</b> which can be distinguished in Cioran’s philosophy might be called the extended <b>reason</b> as it is a demand for unfolding the <b>reason.</b> When one realizes that there is nothing permanent in the world and cognition can’t bring any permanent results either, the <b>reason</b> according to Cioran might become active again by turning back towards reality – however without any further dogma of objective truth – and by using “flowing” ideas it can unite with reality...|$|R
40|$|An action's {{illegality}} can {{be irrelevant}} to a <b>reason</b> not to perform it. A plausible {{example of a}} <b>reason</b> not to assault is that assault causes suffering. Since assault is illegal, the <b>reason</b> pertains to a legally proscribed action. Still, assault's illegality is irrelevant in this case: the <b>reason</b> would pertain (assault would cause suffering; we would have <b>reason</b> not to assault) even if assault were not legally proscribed. On the other hand, it appears that a <b>reason</b> can be one that derives from the interposition of law. This thesis is about <b>reasons</b> of this second type (legal <b>reasons).</b> In particular, it is about their formal features. For example, it is about their individuating conditions (when are p and q two legal <b>reasons</b> rather than one?) and about how legal <b>reasons</b> can be second-order rather than first-order (what follows when p is a <b>reason</b> not to have another <b>reason</b> figure in deliberation about action?). Most particularly, however, it is about their identity conditions (if p is a <b>reason,</b> when and only when is p a legal <b>reason?).</b> I argue against three widely-accepted claims {{about the nature of}} legal reasons: (i) p is a legal <b>reason</b> only if p is a content-independent <b>reason</b> (chapters 5 and 6); (ii) if p is a legal <b>reason</b> to ¢, p could be a complete <b>reason</b> to ¢ or a part of a complete <b>reason</b> to ¢ (chapters 2, 3 and 4); (iii) a legal <b>reason</b> p has a significant formal feature when p is an exclusionary <b>reason</b> (chapter 8).

40|$|What {{an agent}} {{ought to do}} is {{determined}} by competition between <b>reasons</b> bearing on the options open to her. The popular metaphor of balancing or weighing <b>reasons</b> on a scale to represent this competition encourages a focus on competition between <b>reasons</b> for competing options. But what an agent ought to do also depends on the <b>reasons</b> against those options. The balancing metaphor does not provide an obvious way to represent <b>reasons</b> against. Partly as a result of this, there is a serious lack of work on <b>reasons</b> against. A simple view {{is that there is no}} problem here, since <b>reasons</b> against an option are really just more <b>reasons</b> for—in particular, <b>reasons</b> for certain alternatives. This simple view lets us maintain the balancing metaphor, and more importantly, it simplifies theorizing about the competition between <b>reasons.</b> This is because if it’s true, there is really just one kind of competition, the competition between <b>reasons</b> for competing options. This paper challenges the simple view, arguing against several ways of identifying which alternatives to an option the <b>reasons</b> against it are <b>reasons</b> for. I also sketch a competing view, according to which <b>reasons</b> against are distinct from <b>reasons</b> for—these are two different normative relations. If this kind of view is correct, then our theory of the competition between <b>reasons</b> will need to recognize at least two kinds of competition: the one between <b>reasons</b> for competing options, and the one between the <b>reasons</b> for an option and the <b>reasons</b> against it.
