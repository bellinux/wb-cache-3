40|$|We {{introduce}} a new instrument for the measurement of in situ ambient aerosol extinction over the 300 – 700 nm wavelength range, the spectral aerosol extinction (SpEx) instrument. This measurement capability is envisioned to complement existing in situ instrumentation, allowing for simultaneous measurement {{of the evolution of}} aerosol optical, chemical, and physical characteristics in the ambient environment. In this work, {{a detailed description of the}} instrument is provided along with characterization tests performed in the laboratory. Measured spectra of NO 2 and polystyrene latex spheres (PSLs) agreed well with theoretical calculations. Good agreement was also found with simultaneous aerosol extinction measurements at 450, 530, and 630 nm using CAPS PMex instruments in a series of 22 tests including nonabsorbing compounds, dusts, soot, and black and brown carbon analogs. SpEx measurements are expected to help identify the presence of ambient brown carbon due to its 300 nm lower wavelength limit compared to measurements limited to longer UV and visible wavelengths. Extinction spectra obtained with SpEx contain more information than can be conveyed by a simple power law fit (typically represented by Ångström exponents).

40|$|Low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf- (COTS-) based science {{cameras are}} {{intended}} for lab use only and are not suitable for flight deployment as they are difficult to <b>ruggedize</b> and repackage into instruments. Also, COTS implementation may not be suitable since mission science objectives are tied to specific measurement requirements, and often require performance beyond that required by the commercial market. Custom camera development for each application is cost prohibitive for the International Space Station (ISS) or midrange science payloads due to nonrecurring expenses (~$ 2, 000 K) for ground-up camera electronics design. While each new science mission has a different suite of requirements for camera performance (detector noise, speed of image acquisition, charge-coupled device (CCD) size, operation temperature, packaging, etc.), the analog-to-digital conversion, power supply, and communications can be standardized to accommodate many different applications. The low noise camera for suborbital applications is a rugged standard camera platform that can accommodate a range of detector types and science requirements for use in inexpensive to mid range payloads supporting Earth science, solar physics, robotic vision, or astronomy experiments.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{processes are}} based on the controlled selective deposition of material by which a part is manufactured or remanufactured (repaired), layer by layer. Research in AM is drastically on the increase {{in the last several years}} owing to the benefits that AM provides over conventional manufacturing i. e. reduction in material usage, time-to-market reduction, improved functionality, increased ability to customize and near-net shape manufacturing. There has been a number of AM techniques focused on non-metallic materials. In addition, many industries have already embraced the use of AM for metallic parts using laser as an efficient machining tool, including automotive, die & mold, aerospace & defense, industrial products, consumer products and health care. However, the research on metallic materials has been facing a lot of obstacles due to the complexity involved in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) process. This complexity arrives from a multitude variables involved in the process itself i. e. system design as well as process design variables. As a result, there are nowadays limited AM technologies commercially available. This can motivate researchers to focus their work in order to <b>ruggedize</b> LAM processes for commercial large-scale. In this regard, this paper gives the definition and classification of additive manufacturing processes according to ASTM Standard F 2792 - 12 a, followed by a description of principles and future perspectives for fabrication of parts via LAM focused on hotwork tool steels, and potential future applications of LAM for industries i. e. die & mold, forging and cutting tools and automotive.

40|$|There are {{currently}} 7 known serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) classified upon non-cross reactivity of neutralizing immunoglobulins. Non-neutralizing immunoglobulins, however, can exhibit cross-reactivities between 2 or more serotypes, particularly mosaic forms, which can hamper {{the development of}} highly specific immunoassays, especially if based on polyclonal antisera. Here we employ facile recombinant antibody technology to subtractively select ligands {{to each of the}} 7 BoNT serotypes, resulting in populations with very high specificity for their intended serotype. A single llama was immunized with a cocktail of 7 BoNT toxoids to generate a phage display library of single domain antibodies (sdAb, VHH or nanobodies) which were selected on live toxins. Resulting sdAb were capable of detecting both toxin and toxin complex with the best combinations able to detect 100 s- 10 s of pg per 50 microL sample in a liquid bead array. The most sensitive sdAb were combined in a heptaplex assay to identify each of the BoNT serotypes in buffer and milk {{and to a lesser extent}} in carrot juice, orange juice and cola. Several anti-A(1) sdAb recognized A 2 complex, showing that subtype cross-reactivity within a serotype was evident. Many of our sdAb could act as both captor and tracer for several toxin and toxin complexes suggesting sdAb can be used as architectural probes to indicate BoNT oligomerisation. Six of 14 anti-A clones exhibited inhibition of SNAP- 25 cleavage in the neuro- 2 A assay indicating some sdAb had toxin neutralizing capabilities. Many sdAb were also shown to be refoldable after exposure to high temperatures in contrast to polyclonal antisera, as monitored by circular dichroism. Our panel of molecularly flexible antibodies should not only serve as a good starting point for <b>ruggedizing</b> assays and inhibitors, but enable the intricate architectures of BoNT toxins and complexes to be probed more extensively...|$|R
