5|$|A {{downline}} is a rope {{leading from}} the surface down to the underwater workplace.

5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> due to the inability to flare (reduce the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

5000|$|Later, {{flying a}} U.S. Navy Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter, Fisher {{developed}} {{a way to}} fly [...] "zero-g", vertical dives. From 20,000 ft, the F8F would be nosed down into a vertical dive, while he simultaneously reversed the propeller pitch. This technique allowed a controlled vertical dive at <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> that varied between 30,000 and 37,000 fpm.|$|R

25|$|Insects first flew in the Carboniferous, some 350 {{million years}} ago. Wings may have evolved from {{appendages}} {{on the sides}} of existing limbs, which already had nerves, joints, and muscles used for other purposes.

25|$|The Captain then {{ordered the}} First Officer to {{increase}} Flight 992's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> however the First Officer refused, {{stating that the}} gradual descent was far more effective {{in order to maintain}} their height. The crew was then cleared by Lagos for an approach to Runway 18L. The crew later asked for clearance for an approach to Runway 18R and was subsequently cleared by Lagos ATC.|$|E
40|$|Using an {{experimental}} pressure chamber the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and the maximum depths of buoyancy equilibrium of some cichlid fishes were tested. Tilapia mossambica juveniles could descend to depths greater than 30 metres very rapidly. At 22 °C small sub adult male fish (length ± 160 mm) could descend {{to a maximum}} buoyancy depth of 20 metres, small sub adult females to 13 metres while large adults (length ± 200 mm) of both sexes could descend to 11 metres. The fish generally take 4 to 5 days to reach their maximum equilibration depth. At 30 °C mature adult male and female T. mossambica increased their maximum equilibration depth to 20 metres and at 15 °C showed a decrease to a maximum depth of 6. 7 metres. Temperature affects the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> in a similar manner. T. rendalli can descend to 7. 5 metres at 22 °C. T. sparmanii can descend to 15 metres at 22 °C. Hemihaplochromis philander fry and young juveniles are not affected by pressure. Adult males can descend to 16 metres at 22 °C and 20 metres at 30 °C. Adult females can descend to 26 metres at 22 °C and 27 metres at 30 °C. In T. mossambica oxygen {{appears to be the}} only gas secreted into the swimbladder to compensate for buoyancy loss. The haemoglobin of T. mossambica showed a marked Bohr and Root effect. Increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> with increased temperature are believed to be due to increased O₂ uptake, heart output etc. rather than as a direct effect of blood chemistry. The swimbladder wall of T. mossambica is extremely thin (2. 8 ∕∪ m) and consequently a large amount of gas is lost through passive diffusion. Diffusion is not affected by temperature, consequently the increased secretory rates at higher temperatures are not balanced by a proportionately higher diffusion loss, thus enabling the fish to maintain a deeper buoyancy equilibrium at higher temperatures.

40|$|A {{model of}} the Convair Y 2 - 2 {{airplane}} was tested in Langley tank no. 2 to determine whether satisfactory stability in yawed landings was possible with a certain ventral fin. Free-body landings were made in smooth and rough water at two speeds and two <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> with the model yawed 15 deg. The behavior of the model was determined by visual observations and from motion-picture re. cords.

25|$|The final report, {{published}} by Indonesian investigator NTSC, {{concluded that the}} crash was caused due to pilot error. The evidence indicates that during the final segment of the flight, both crew member were looking outside the aircraft to sight the runway. During this period the flight path of the aircraft varied between 376 and 585 feet and the bank angle increased from 11 to 38 degree to the left. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> then increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and finally the aircraft impacted into the sea.|$|E
25|$|Abseiling can be dangerous, and {{presents}} risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during abseiling, most commonly due to failing anchors. Another frequent cause of accidents is abseiling beyond {{the end of}} the rope. Backing up the rope set-up with a friction knot (autoblock, Kleimheist, or prusik) such that the slipping of the rope is stopped even if the climber lets go of the control rope provides a measure of safety with regard to the control of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b>|$|E
25|$|The NTSC {{concluded}} that the flight path became unstable below minimum descent altitude with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> exceeding 1000 feet per minute. The flight crew lost situational awareness and visual references as the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descent altitude. The Captain’s go-around decision and execution was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient {{for it to be}} executed successfully. The pilots were not provided with timely and accurate weather information considering the weather around the airport and particularly on final approach was changing rapidly.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described {{for determining the}} trims and quasi-static derivatives of a flight vehicle {{for use in a}} linear perturbation model; both the coupled and uncoupled forms of the linear perturbation model are included. Since this technique requires a nonlinear vehicle model, detailed equations with constants and nonlinear functions for the CH- 47 B tandem rotor helicopter are presented. Tables of trims and derivatives are included for airspeeds between - 40 and 160 knots and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> between + or - 10. 16 m/sec (+ or - 200 ft/min). As a verification, the calculated and referenced values of comparable trims, derivatives, and linear model poles are shown to have acceptable agreement...|$|R

25|$|To dive safely, divers must {{control their}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and ascent {{in the water}} and be able to {{maintain}} a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} approach, the plane descended along the ILS {{glideslope}} until at about 700ft, the crew visually acquired the runway. They disengaged the autopilot but left the autothrottle on. During the flare, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> was not arrested, the plane landed {{with the right}} wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the fuselage. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the grass strip next to the runway. The spilled fuel caught fire.|$|E
25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E
40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that {{touchdown}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> (sink <b>rates)</b> are higher in aircraft simulators than in aircraft under similar conditions. The objective of this paper was to use a psychophysical technique to investigate a pilot's ability to distinguish between two different sink rates close to the ground. The pilots observed a collimated computer graphics display of a typical runway with edge, zone, and centerline lights. The results showed that with a forward velocity of 120 knots, pilots could reliably distinguish between a sink <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 0. 5 m/sec (1. 7 ft/sec) and 0. 9 m/sec (2. 9 ft/sec). The results also showed that the absolute <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> sink did not significantly affect the perception <b>of</b> sink <b>rate.</b> Time <b>of</b> sink and total height drop during the sink did affect the minimum detectable difference between sink rates (the differential threshold). The effects were such that a greater time of sink and greater height drop produced lower threshold...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, the captain was the chief pilot of the airline and was {{responsible}} for recruiting, selecting and training new pilots for the airline. He had 17 years experience as a pilot, but less than a year's experience as a chief pilot. His friends and family told investigators that in the weeks before the crash, he was exhibiting symptoms of extreme stress. The First Officer had been with the airline for two months and had only flown single-engine aircraft before joining Downeast. He was reported to have had problems with instrument approaches in the past, including excessive <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> Examination <b>of</b> the crew members' bodies after the crash determined that the First Officer was likely flying at {{the time of}} the crash, as he had suffered a broken thumb.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} is being {{conducted to determine}} the dynamic stability and control characteristics of a 0. 13 -scale flying model of Convair XFY- 1 vertically rising airplane.

The tests indicated that landings, including vertical descent from altitudes representing up to 400 feet for the full-scale airplane and at <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> up to 15 or 20 feet per second (full scale), can be performed satisfactorily. Sustained vertical descent in still air probably will be more difficult to perform because of large random trim changes that become greater as the descent velocity is increased.

25|$|Flight 5719 {{was cleared}} {{for a landing}} on runway 31 at Hibbing, but the flight crew {{requested}} an approach to runway 13 instead {{because there was a}} tailwind on the approach to runway 31 and 31 was covered with precipitation. The flight crew initiated the approach procedure by joining the HIB 20 DME arc from the HIB VOR and intercepting the localizer at 8000 feet MSL.This delayed the start of the descent and thus required an excessive <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> The aircraft descended at 2250 ft/min and was 1200 feet above the minimum altitude when overhead the KINNY final approach fix. The Jetstream BA-3100 was not equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System that was required on larger aircraft.|$|E
25|$|For {{five years}} the boat lift {{operated}} successfully, the longest closures being during spells of cold weather when the canal froze over. In 1882 a cast iron hydraulic cylinder burst while the caisson it supported was at canal level with a boat in it. The caisson descended rapidly, but water escaping from the burst cylinder slowed the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and the water-filled dock at river level softened the impact. No-one was hurt {{and there was no}} damage to the lift's superstructure. As a precaution, tests were carried out on the second hydraulic cylinder. During these tests the second cylinder failed too. As a result the boat lift was closed for six months while sections of both cylinders were replaced and the connecting pipework, which was thought to have contributed to their failure, was redesigned.|$|E

40|$|The {{current and}} future trend towards {{fly-by-wire}} (FBW) control architectures on helicopters is aimed at bringing improved handling and enhanced safety. By giving a direct input through electrical signals, commands are much more precise enhancing overall safety. Furthermore, the pilot commands are monitored by the FBW control system to ensure the helicopter is kept within the flight protection envelope. As a result, the pilot always can get the maximum performance out of the helicopter without running the risk of exceeding safety margins. Vortex Ring State (VRS) conditions are among adverse flight conditions which mostly occur within a boundary confined to {{a part of the}} flight envelope at low forward airspeeds and at steep angles <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> or high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent.</b> The contribution <b>of</b> the present paper is to incorporate VRS boundaries inside a FBW flight control law in order to prevent the helicopter from entering the VRS region. The stability margin given by the heave mode damping is used as a metric to quantify the safety margin. Simulations show the good performance of the VRS-protection function...|$|R

500|$|L'Estrange survived an {{even more}} {{disastrous}} attempt in Melbourne {{less than six months}} later at the grounds of the Agricultural Society in a balloon named Aurora. Having been supplied with a much higher quality gas from the Metropolitan Gas Company he miscalculated the speed at which the balloon would ascend. Having floated much higher than originally anticipated the balloon greatly expanded and a weak seam in the calico fabric suddenly burst.

500|$|The variometer, {{also known}} as the {{vertical}} speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|E

40|$|The {{restricted}} strong convexity is {{an effective}} tool for deriving globally linear convergence <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> methods in convex minimization. Recently, the global error bound and quadratic growth properties appeared as new competitors. In this paper, {{with the help of}} Ekeland's variational principle, we show the equivalence between these three notions. To deal with convex minimization over a closed convex set and structured convex optimization, we propose a group of modified versions and a group of extended versions of these three notions by using gradient mapping and proximal gradient mapping separately, and prove that the equivalence for the modified and extended versions still holds. Based on these equivalence notions, we establish new asymptotically linear convergence results for the proximal gradient method. Finally, we revisit the problem of minimizing the composition of an affine mapping with a strongly convex differentiable function over a polyhedral set, and obtain a strengthened property of the restricted strong convex type under mild assumptions.

40|$|A {{concept for}} forced reentry of small orbital debris with {{characteristic}} dimension ~ 10 cm from the highly populated sun synchronous orbit by injecting micron scale dust grains to artificially enhance drag is discussed. The drag enhancement {{is most effective}} when dust grains counter rotate {{with respect to the}} debris resulting in hypervelocity dust/debris impacts. While the natural drag on small debris with ballistic coefficient ~ 5 kg/m 2 in orbits with perigee above 900 km is negligible, it is sufficient to decay the orbit of the injected dust grains at a significant rate. This offers a unique opportunity to synchronize the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> the dust and debris to create a sweeping (snow-plow-like) effect on the debris by a descending narrow dust layer. The dust density necessary to de-orbit small debris is sufficiently low such that the orbits of active satellites which have larger ballistic coefficients are minimally affected.
