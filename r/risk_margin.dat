40|$|A {{critical}} {{problem in}} {{property and casualty}} insurance is forecasting incurred but as yet unpaid losses. Forecasts and <b>risk</b> <b>margins</b> are often based on individual loss triangles with each triangle corresponding to a different line of business. Different lines of business are often dependent, and overall <b>risk</b> <b>margins</b> must reflect this dependence. This article develops, implements, and applies a model for loss triangle dependence. The model facilitates the structuring and measurement of dependence. One possible structure is where payments in different triangles in the same calendar year are related. Dependence is modeled with a Gaussian copula, and it is moderated by quantities called communalities that measure the relative impact of cross-dependence in each triangle. Dependence can be structured in terms of factor models. Methods reduce to relatively simple calculations {{in the case of}} marginal normal distributions. Procedures are applied to U.

40|$|Under new {{solvency}} regulations, {{general insurance}} companies need to calculate a <b>risk</b> <b>margin</b> to cover possible shortfalls in their liability runoff. A popular approach for {{the calculation of}} the <b>risk</b> <b>margin</b> is the so-called cost-of-capital approach. A comprehensive cost-of-capital approach involves the consideration of multiperiod risk measures. Because multiperiod risk measures are rather complex mathematical objects, various proxies are used to estimate this <b>risk</b> <b>margin.</b> Of course, the use of proxies {{and the study of}} their quality raises many questions, see IAA position paper [8]. In the present paper we provide a first discourse on multiperiod solvency considerations for a general insurance liability runoff.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that, {{in the absence of}} a trading market for loss reserves, a reasonable estimate of the “fair value ” of unpaid losses is the risk-free present value of an unbiased estimate of those losses plus a market-based <b>risk</b> <b>margin.</b> If the <b>risk</b> <b>margin</b> is defined as the risk-free present value of the market-clearing cost of the capital required to support the unpaid losses during the run-off period, the size of the <b>risk</b> <b>margin</b> depends on the amount of required capital.

However, the European Solvency II directive defines the capital requirement as of any given date as an endogenous variable equal to the amount needed to ensure solvency over a one-year time horizon with 99. 5 % confidence. This paper derives and illustrates an integrated framework for quantifying the required capital, the implied cost-of-capital-based <b>risk</b> <b>margin</b> and the fair value reserve from the expected volatility, payment and other characteristics of an unpaid loss portfolio consistent with the Solvency II standard.

In this paper, we {{compare and contrast}} several existing stochastic reserving methods under the new Australian prudential regulatory framework. These methods include Bayesian estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, the chain ladder method with bootstrapping, generalised linear models (GLMs) with bootstrapping, the Kalman filter on state-space models, the Mack model, and the stochastic chain ladder method. With regard to the qualitative aspects, we investigate the methods' underlying structures, assumptions, and estimation mechanics. In particular, we devise our own structure and estimation mechanics for the stochastic chain ladder method, derive some new approximation formulae for both GLMs and the stochastic chain ladder method, and derive the covariance matrices for the Kalman filter and state-space models adopted. We find that the methods have different levels of flexibility and are suitable to different situations in practice.

Two modelling frameworks are considered based around parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models which we develop specifically in this insurance setting.

The Bayesian posterior quantile regression models in each case are studied via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies. In the nonparametric quantile regression framework, that we contrast to the parametric Bayesian models, we adopted an AL distribution as a proxy and together with the parametric AL model, we expressed the solution as a scale mixture of uniform distributions to facilitate implementation.

These fibers are very stiff, but their compression performances are poor. To decrease the <b>risk</b> <b>margins</b> during the sizing process, {{it is necessary}} to determine their compression behavior as accurately as possible. Two tests were carried out on two types of high-modulus carbon fibers (M 55 J fibers and K 63712 fibers) : the pure compression Celanese test, which gives poor strain results, and a new pure bending test, which allows large displacements and generates higher strain levels. This bending test makes it possible to know without inverse calculation the load for any sections and to use machine specimens in order to avoid tab effects. An elastic nonlinear model (a power function of the strain) is proposed to describe the loss of compressive rigidity until the brittle rupture. Model coefficients are identified for the two materials with a simple inverse calculation. The pure bending test brought to light a highly nonlinear behavior of the unidirectional K 63712 fibers.
