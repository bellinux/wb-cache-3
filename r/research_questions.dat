5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned with a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating the Aryan invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.|$|E

25|$|Structuration theory allows {{researchers}} {{to focus on}} any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes ontology over epistemology. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, agent expectations, relative degrees of routine, tradition, behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and tacit knowledge, dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to provide an analysis of the 166 homicidal deaths that occurred in Southern Denmark during 25 years. The inspiration came from increased press coverage of certain homicides that I as a forensic pathologist felt did not mirror the real situation. Extensive press coverage of a few serious cases has left the public with the impression that the number of homicides was escalating, and this has been cause for public concern, and has prompted various harsh legislative steps. A lot of public interest has been focused on knife homicides, on honor killings among Muslims, on gang homicides and on homicides committed by psychotic individuals. The political response to public opinion has to some degree been focused on increased punishment for violence. With this in mind, the aim of the investigation was to answer the following <b>research</b> questions:: <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 1 : What was the homicide rate in the study area, and has it changed during the 25 -year study period? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 2 : How were the homicides distributed according to motive? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 3 : How often was the homicide motivated by a psychosis? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 4 : Has the ratio between intra- and extra-family homicides changed? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 5 : How often were weapons used? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 6 : Is it possible to identify some important social factors characterizing homicide victims? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 7 : Has the homicide pattern described changed over time? <b>Research</b> <b>Question</b> 8 : What are the implications of this study for homicide prevention strategies...|$|R
