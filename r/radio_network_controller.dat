There are several benefits of IP-based RAN including lower costs, flexibility of merging wired and wireless networks, and network scalability and reliability. While Quality of Service issues in IP-based RAN have been addressed by a number of researchers, the question of connectivity, i. e., how best to connect base stations to the <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Controllers</b> (RNC) in an IP-based RAN, has not been addressed by any research literature. Furthermore, given a connection configuration, an RNC selection algorithm that assigns an incoming call to an RNC is also necessary. This paper examines <b>Radio</b> Access <b>Network</b> (RAN) connectivity {{and its impact on the}} performance and resiliency of the wireless network using different RNC selection algorithms. The proposed Min-Load- 1 algorithm, which allows at most one hard handoff in order to accommodate each incoming request, delivers performance close to the standard Min-Load algorithm using a RAN of much higher connectivity and is close to the optimal algorithm using the same RAN. We also find that using Min-Load- 1 algorithm and allowing the base stations to connect to two RNCs result in resiliency to RNC failures that is similar to having full-mesh connectivity between base stations and RNCs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks, {{there have}} been several efforts aimed at having mobile devices equipped with multiple interfaces connect optimally to the access network that minimizes their power consumption. However, a study of existing schemes notes that in the idle state, a device with both a WLAN and a WWAN interface need to keep both interfaces “on ” in order to receive periodic beacon messages from the AP (WLAN) and downlink control information from the base station (WWAN), resulting in significant power consumption. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Power-efficient Communication Protocol that includes turning off the WLAN interface after it enters the idle state and using the existing paging of WWAN in order to wake up the WLAN interface when there is incoming long-lived multimedia data. Further, we propose turning on the WLAN interface when the number of packets in the <b>radio</b> <b>network</b> <b>controller’s</b> buffer reaches a certain threshold level in order to avoid repeatedly turning on and off WLAN interfaces, that consumes a significant amount of power. The tradeoffs between the power saving and the number of packets dropped at the buffer are investigated analytically. Simulation results for scenarios of interest are also provided. I...|$|R

The question of connectivity, i. e., how best to connect base stations to the <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Controllers</b> (RNC) in an IP-based RAN, has not been addressed by researchers. Furthermore, given a connection configuration, an RNC selection algorithm that assigns an incoming call to an RNC is also necessary. This paper examines RAN connectivity {{and its impact on the}} performance and resiliency of the wireless network using different RNC selection algorithms. For homogeneous networks, we show that the proposed Min-Load- 1 algorithm, which allows at most one hard handoff in order to accommodate each incoming call request, delivers performance close to the optimal algorithm. We also show that allowing a few base stations to connect to two RNCs (a 10 percent increase in the number of links in our network) results in resiliency to RNC failures that is comparable to the resiliency of RANs with full-mesh connectivity. Finally, for heterogeneous networks, we show that the Min-Load-k algorithm (with at most k hard handoffs per call) is effective in handling load imbalances. These results provide strong motivation for deploying IP-based RAN, as they suggest that enhancing current point-to-point RAN with few additional links and allowing a few hard handoffs to accommodate incoming calls can result in significant gains in performance and resiliency.

40|$|Transport channel {{synchronization}} is {{a function}} of 3 G access networks that operates in the link between <b>Radio</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Controllers</b> (RNCs) and Base Stations (Nodes B) and is required to support macro-diversity in the downlink direction. Its objective is to assure that every frame sent by the RNC arrives at the Node B on time to be transmitted over the air interface avoiding excessive buffering at the Node B. This is achieved by means of a timing adjustment algorithm that tracks the delay of the link and corrects the sending time of the frames in the RNC. However, when the link experiences abrupt delay variations, e. g. because of a sudden traffic increment in an intermediate node, the classic algorithm may loss frames and, depending on its configuration and the transport delay, it can show an undesired oscillatory behaviour. In this paper we analyze the response of this mechanism under sudden delay increments, providing useful guidelines to configure it in order to prevent oscillations, avoiding excessive signalling and eventual frame losses. Moreover, we propose a simple algorithm that overcomes the limitations of the classic scheme. The configuration of our proposal is addressed by means of discrete-time control theory focusing on stability and performance considerations. We show the influence of the delay on these issues and present an adaptive strategy to make the system robust under delay variations...|$|R

An analytical model is presented for approximating the user distributions in multi-cell third generation Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) networks using 2 -dimensional Gaussian distributions by determining the means and the standard de-viations of the distributions for every cell. This allows for the calculation of the inter-cell interference and the reverse-link capacity of the network. An analytical model for optimizing capacity in multi-cell WCDMA networks is presented. Capacity is optimized for different spreading factors and for perfect and imperfect power control. Numerical results show that the SIR threshold for the received signals is decreased by 0. 5 to 1. 5 dB due to the imperfect power control. The results also show that the determined parameters of the 2 -dimensional Gaussian model matches well with traditional methods for modeling user distribution. A Call Admission Control algorithm is designed that maximizes the throughput in multi-cell WCDMA networks. Numerical results are presented for different spreading factors and for several mobility scenarios. Our methods of optimizing capacity and throughput are computational efficient, accurate, and can be implemented in large WCDMA networks...|$|R
