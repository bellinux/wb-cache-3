5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Vel√°zquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E

[...] Through reconciliation it is believed that the change of the human heart is attained, the basis for all social change.|$|E
2500|$|The complex plainchant {{setting in}} the Roman Gradual {{requires}} {{a high degree of}} skill and is mostly used only in monasteries and seminaries. This melismatic Gregorian chant opens with the cantor singing [...] "Alleluia". The choir repeats it, adding to the final syllable a long melisma called a jubilus. (The Liber Usualis notates the <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman numeral [...] "ij" [...] (2) and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings {{the main part of the}} verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. The cantor then repeats the opening Alleluia, and the choir repeats only the jubilus. The music is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an ambitus of only a perfect fifth, a rather extreme example.|$|E

We {{have gone through}} one dreadful scene, in company, and, I confess, Corny, I should feel far happier, if another is to occur, that you and yours, should be with us, here, behind the defences of this house, than exposed, as you otherwise might be, in the forest.

6000|$|... (4) Don't say, [...] "There is no true creed; {{for each}} creed {{believes}} itself {{right and the}} others wrong." [...] Probably one of the creeds is right {{and the others are}} wrong. Diversity does show that most of the views must be wrong. It does not by the faintest logic show that they all must be wrong. I suppose there is no subject on which opinions differ with more desperate sincerity than about which horse will win the Derby. These are certainly solemn convictions; men risk ruin for them. The man who puts his shirt on Potosi must believe in that animal, and each of the other men putting their last garments upon other quadrupeds must believe in them quite as sincerely. They are all serious, {{and most of them are}} wrong. But one of them is right. One of the faiths is justified; one of the horses does win; not always even the dark horse which might stand for Agnosticism, but often the obvious and popular horse of Orthodoxy. Democracy has its occasional victories; and even the Favourite has been known to come in first. But the point here is that something comes in first. That there were many beliefs does not destroy the fact that there was one well-founded belief. I believe (merely upon authority) that the world is round. That there may be tribes who believe it to be triangular or oblong does not alter the fact that it is certainly some shape, and therefore not any other shape. Therefore I <b>repeat,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wail of imprecation, don't say that the variety of creeds prevents you from accepting any creed. It is an unintelligent remark.|$|E
6000|$|I {{will indeed}} {{let you have}} the whole of my MS. on the very first {{possible}} day, now not far off; but I have still, absolutely, to finish, and to finish right.... I {{have been working on}} the book with unremitting intensity the whole of every blessed morning since I began it, some thirteen months ago, and I am at present within but some twelve or fifteen thousand words of Finis. But I can work only in my own way--a deucedly good one, by the same token!--and am producing the best book, I seem to conceive, that I have ever done. I have really done it fast, for what it is, and for the way I do it--the way I seem condemned to; which is to overtreat my subject by developments and amplifications that have, in large part, eventually to be greatly compressed, but to the prior operation of which the thing afterwards owes what is most durable in its quality. I have written, in perfection, 200,000 words of the G.B.--with the rarest perfection!--and you can imagine how much of that, which has taken time, has had to come out. It is not, assuredly, an economical way of work in the short run, but it is, for me, in the long; and at any rate one can proceed but in one's own manner. My manner however is, at present, to be making every day--it is now a question of a very moderate number of days--a straight step nearer my last page, comparatively close at hand. You shall have it, I <b>repeat,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> very minimum further delay of which I am capable. I do not seem to know, by the way, when it is Methuen's desire that the volume shall appear--I mean after the postponements we have had. The best time for me, I think, especially in America, will be about next October, and I promise you the thing in distinct time for that. But you will say that I am [...] "over-treating" [...] this subject too! Believe me yours ever, ...|$|E

Due to the higher rate of fire, accelerated fire was limited to a maximum of two minutes per gun, since the guns would be so heated after firing 6 magazines each, they would be ready to overheat, even with a minute to cool down after the first 3 magazines.|$|E

The progression of the harmonies <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bar form, always establishing the key of the piece. With a pianissimo and larghetto marking and the piano part light in texture, Schubert sets up the poem for the first few lines, [...] "You are peace, the mild peace," [...] in the introduction.|$|E

5000|$|While {{these were}} treated as {{the fourth and fifth}} Hitchhiker's Guide radio series, they were {{broadcast}} in one eight-week stretch in May and June 2005. The tradition of [...] "Fits" [...] continues; these were known as Fit the Nineteenth through Fit the Twenty-Sixth. The manner of broadcasting these episodes carries over from the Tertiary Phase: the original broadcast was on Tuesday, with a Thursday <b>repeat</b> (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of Fit the Nineteenth, which was not repeated due to election coverage). After the initial Tuesday broadcast, audio streams of the episode were available until the following Tuesday. For these final phases, the core cast (Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern, Mark Wing-Davey, Susan Sheridan and Stephen Moore) returned, along with William Franklyn as the new voice of The Book (assisted by Rula Lenska). In addition, David Dixon, Sandra Dickinson, Bill Paterson, Roy Hudd and Jonathan Pryce, who had roles in the TV adaptation or the original radio series, all returned, though Dixon and Paterson both play new roles.|$|E

50|$|The 2010 season {{started off}} {{seemingly}} like a potential title <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Menace racing to a 4-1-0 start and qualifying for the Open Cup {{for the first}} time in four years. However, four straight league ties broke up the team's momentum. The Menace then stepped away from PDL play to host 2nd division AC St. Louis in first round play of the Open Cup, where they suffered a heartbreaking 1-0 loss. A 7-2 shellacking at arch-rival Thunder Bay was followed by two more draws. Despite a pair of dominating shutouts (6-0 against Springfield and 3-0 against the Brass), a 3-1 loss to the Chill all but knocked the Menace from playoff contention. The season ended on a fitting note: after rallying to take a 2-1 lead on the Lions, the Menace conceded late for their 7th draw of the year. Despite losing just three matches all season, seven draws in sixteen matches left them eight points out of playoff qualification in fourth. Captain Clark Bradford and defender Logan McDaniel shared the scoring lead with five goals each.|$|E
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 ¬∞F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. <b>Repeat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> remaining fastnachts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{traditional}} Gregorian chant, this responsorial chant {{opens with}} the cantor singing [...] "Alleluia", {{after which the}} choir repeats it, and adds a long melisma on the final vowel (called a [...] "jubilus"). (The Liber Usualis notates the <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman numeral [...] "ij" [...] and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings {{the main part of}} the verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. At the end of the chant, the opening Alleluia is repeated, but instead of the choir repeating the word, they repeat only the jubilus. When a Sequence follows the Alleluia, this final repeat is omitted, as it was in other cases in the Middle Ages. The musical style of a plainchant Alleluia is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an ambitus of only a perfect fifth, but this example is rather extreme. Alleluias were frequently troped, both with added music and text. It is believed that some early Sequences derived from syllabic text being added to the jubilus, and may be named after the opening words of the Alleluia verse. Alleluias were also among the more frequently used chants to create early organa, such as in the Winchester Troper.|$|E
