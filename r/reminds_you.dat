He reported, [...] "for every familiar bit of music or a level background that <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> of Mario games past, you have new abilities to use and deviously designed platforming sections that feel completely unique", while stating that the inclusion of 3D was mostly a gimmick.|$|E

[...] Natasha Tripney from musicOMH said: [...] "'Did It Again' <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> of her valiant but wildly misjudged attempt to morph into Indie Kylie circa 1997, only really serving to highlight the limitations of her voice in the process." [...] Michael R. Smith from Daily Vault felt the song represented the album [...] "perfectly" [...] and had labelled the songs as [...] "undiscovered gems".

500|$|Affleck {{subsequently}} starred as an autistic accountant in {{the action}} thriller The Accountant. The film was a commercial success, greatly exceeding box office expectations. Peter Debruge of Variety felt Affleck's [...] "boy-next-door" [...] demeanour– [...] "so normal and non-actorly {{that most of his}} performances feel like watching one of your buddies up on screen"– was [...] "a terrific fit" [...] for the role. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why Affleck, [...] "looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable," [...] committed himself to the film. Live by Night, which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, the Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of The Atlantic described it as [...] "a fascinating mess of a movie" [...] and criticized Affleck's [...] "stiff, uncomfortable" [...] performance. But he noted that one of the last action scenes [...] "is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and easy to follow, that it <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> what skill Affleck has with the camera". In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the Good Will Hunting screenplay at New York's Skirball Theater.|$|E
500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After Everything Changed, was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't sure {{what to expect when}} the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture."

500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands {{stand the test of}} time, but this <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E

Sheffield added that, in the song, by comparison, [...] "she <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> what a smart job she normally does of keeping the tempo jumping." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believed [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was one of the}} songs on Fearless that expanded on the success of Swift's eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006), because of how prominently its hook stands out. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times, which stated Swift [...] "quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade", and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, [...] "And indeed, we think we got a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' [...] isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses," [...] despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette compared [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] to a [...] "chanteuse a la Tori Amos".|$|E

[...] On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral Simpsons characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the Simpsons universe [...] "as the town's brilliant mad scientist." [...] They highlighted a scene from the episode [...] "The PTA Disbands", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children [...] "wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels" [...] as he did. Nick Griffiths of Radio Times named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has [...] "always loved Professor Frink", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word [...] "the", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. The Sydney Morning Heralds David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of [...] "TV's great tech figures", writing that apart from being smart, the professor {{is best known for his}} [...] "rather idiosyncratic speech patterns— hmmguyvin-whey-hey." [...] Joe Rhodes of TV Guide listed the following as the professor's most memorable line: [...] "Sorry I'm late.

Written and directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, Kaminey requires patience and attention but the pay off is more than worth it." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote [...] "Kaminey is bold, stark, funny and unpredictable and is a film with an attitude.

He also said, [...] "Its lyrics are the blow-up-your-brains-out kind...and its music, composed by the multi-talented Bharadwaj is perfectly in sync with a narrative that doesn't pause for breath." [...] Namrata Joshi from Outlook gave {{a rating of}} 4 out 5 and called Kaminey [...] "a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film". Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu gave the film 4 stars and wrote, [...] "Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn't used to.

500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E
