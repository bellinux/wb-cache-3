Some retailers with banking operations also award points for every pound spent on their credit cards, and bonus points for purchasing financial services.

40|$|In {{traditional}} Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), the nodes {{can take}} advantage of intermittent contact opportunities to forward messages. However, in noncooperative DTNs, the nodes may be selfish and reluctant to cooperate with each other in message forwarding. Therefore, it is necessary to motivate the nodes to cooperate with each other in such DTNs. The previously proposed incentive mechanisms have obvious limitations such as the security vulnerability. To resolve such kind of drawbacks, in this paper we propose two credit-based <b>rewarding</b> <b>schemes,</b> called earliest path singular <b>rewarding</b> <b>scheme</b> and earliest path cumulative <b>rewarding</b> <b>scheme</b> respectively, to ensure the nodes truthfully forward the messages. The proposed <b>rewarding</b> <b>schemes</b> are incentive compatible. They also ensure that the payment for each delivered message is upper bounded. Furthermore, the proposed <b>rewarding</b> <b>schemes</b> can prevent selfish nodes from having malicious behaviors. Simulations based on the real trace are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed <b>rewarding</b> <b>schemes.</b> Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R

Webster (1988) is of {{the view that the}} cornerstone of developing a market-driven or customer-oriented business organisation is how management is evaluated and rewarded. Jaworski and Kohli (1993) contend that organisations that reward their management and employees based on certain factors, such as customer satisfaction and building customer relationships, tend to be more market-oriented.

30|$|For each {{respondent}} 30 repeated {{trials were}} observed. The {{motivation for the}} respondent was, at each trial, to reach the destination {{in time for a}} meeting (or to attend a class). The more punctual the respondents were able to be, the higher the assigned score was (50 points maximum). Moreover, a bonus of 10 points was assigned to each trial if the respondent was able to choose the fastest route (see [13]). The bonus sums up to the standard punctuality-related score. The <b>rewards</b> <b>scheme</b> was chosen by means of a pre-pilot study among ten friends of the SP platform developer (who is {{one of the authors of}} this paper). With this <b>rewards</b> <b>scheme,</b> most of the pre-pilot group were able to achieve almost the same score by acting in two different explicitly requested ways. The first was to consider the fastest-route bonus score as the main goal and the punctuality score as the secondary one, and vice versa for the second way. During the balancing of the <b>rewards</b> <b>scheme</b> only a context without ATIS was applied by the SP platform. Half of the pre-sample was asked to first act with the fastest-route goal and then in the more conservative way; vice versa for the other half of the pre-sample. Because of the balancing of the <b>rewards</b> <b>scheme,</b> we are confident that it does not discourage risk-adverse (preferring punctuality) or risk-seeking (preferring the bonus) route choice behaviour.|$|R

40|$|Summary Background Pay for {{performance}} (P 4 P) {{programs have been}} widely analysed in literature, and the results regarding their impact on performance are mixed. Moreover, in the real-life setting, <b>reward</b> <b>schemes</b> are designed combining multiple elements altogether, yet, {{it is not clear}} what happens when they are applied using different combinations. Objectives To provide insights on how P 4 P programs are influenced by 5 key elements: whom, what, how, how many targets, and how much to reward. Methods A qualitative longitudinal analysis of 10 years of P 4 P <b>reward</b> <b>schemes</b> adopted by the regional administrations of Tuscany and Lombardy (Italy) was conducted. The effects of the P 4 P features on performance are discussed considering both overall and specific indicators. Results Both regions applied financial <b>reward</b> <b>schemes</b> for General Managers by linking the variable pay to performance. While Tuscany maintained a relatively stable financial incentive design and governance tools, Lombardy changed some elements of the design and introduced, in 2012, a P 4 P program aimed to reward the providers. The main differences between the 2 cases regard the number of targets (how many), the type (what), and the method applied to set targets (how). Conclusion Considering the overall performance obtained by the 2 regions, it seems that whom, how, and how much to reward are not relevant in the success of P 4 P programs; instead, the number (how many) and the type (what) of targets set may influence the performance improvement processes driven by financial <b>reward</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

The nodes in DTNs {{can take advantage}} of their contact opportunities to forward messages.

To resolve the drawback of the previous incentive mechanisms, we first propose a credit-based <b>rewarding</b> <b>scheme</b> called the earliest path singular <b>rewarding</b> (EPSR) <b>scheme</b> to motivate the nodes to truthfully forward the messages during every contact opportunity. Then, we propose another credit-based <b>rewarding</b> <b>scheme</b> called the earliest path cumulative <b>rewarding</b> (EPCR) <b>scheme</b> by further considering that a node may get more contact information on others. We prove that both the EPSR and EPCR schemes are incentive compatible, and the payment for each delivered message is upper bounded.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of limited {{liability}} on corporate architecture. Corporate architecture is to be interpreted as the organizational instruments firms use to organize themselves into a coordinating, hierarchical ordered association of people. In this paper, it specifically refers {{to the use of}} four governance instruments within the firm to control the behavior of employees. These four are decision control rights, <b>reward</b> <b>schemes,</b> information systems and conflict resolution rules. Limited liability influences the way in which an incorporated group of firms employs each of these instruments. The most important effects are that limited liability makes it advantageous to allocate decision rights lower in the organization, use higher-powered <b>reward</b> <b>schemes</b> and economize on information systems. The effects lead to a saving of coordination costs within incorporated groups compared to unincorporated groups. Corporate groups thus differ in their governance arrangement from firms that have not organized in corporate groups. Alternatives that restrict limited liability have {{the effect of}} centralizing rights, flattening <b>reward</b> <b>schemes</b> and increasing investment in information systems. If corporate groups have attuned their architecture optimally, then restricting, or abolishing, limited liability generates additional coordination costs. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple case of team production, where {{a set of}} workers have to contribute a single input (say labour) and then share the joint output amongst themselves. Different incentive issues arise when the skills {{as well as the}} levels of effort expended by workers are not publicly observable. We study one of these issues in terms of a very simple model in which two types of workers, skilled and unskilled, supply effort inelastically. Thus, we assume away the problem of moral hazard in order to focus on that of adverse selection. We also {{consider a}} hierarchical structure of production in which the workers need to be organised in two tiers. We look for <b>reward</b> <b>schemes</b> which specify higher payments to workers who have been assigned to the top-level jobs when the principal detects no lies, distribute the entire output in all circumstances, and induce workers to revel their true abilities.
