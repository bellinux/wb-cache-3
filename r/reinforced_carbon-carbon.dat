5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and <b>Reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
25|$|The board {{determined}} that the probable cause of the accident was that the foam impact caused a breach of a <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> panel along {{the leading edge of}} Columbia left wing, allowing hot gases generated during re-entry to enter the wing and cause structural collapse. This caused Columbia to tumble out of control, breaking up with the loss of the entire crew.|$|E
40|$|We {{applied the}} surface {{build-up}} Cu-polyimide flex-circuit technology with laser vias to the ATLAS SCT barrel hybrid {{to be made}} in one piece from the connector to the electronics sections including cables. The hybrids, <b>reinforced</b> with <b>carbon-carbon</b> substrates, provide mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, low-radiation length, and stability in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) operation. By following the design rules, we experienced little trouble in breaking the traces. The pitch adapter between the sensor and the ASICs was made of aluminum traces on glass substrate. We identified that the generation of whiskers around the wire-bonding feet was correlated with the hardness of metallized aluminum. The appropriate hardness has been achieved by keeping the temperature of the glasses as low as room temperature during the metallization. The argon plasma cleaning procedure cleaned the contamination on the gold pads of the hybrids for successful wire bonding, although it was unsuccessful in the aluminum of the pitch adapters...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to assess the feasibility of and benefits derived from the use of high temperature composite materials in aircraft turbine engine combustor liners. The study included a survey and screening of the properties of three candidate composite materials including tungsten <b>reinforced</b> superalloys, <b>carbon-carbon</b> and silicon carbide (SiC) fibers reinforcing a ceramic matrix of lithium aluminosilicate (LAS). The SiC-LAS material was selected as offering the greatest near term potential primarily on the basis of high temperature capability. A limited experimental investigation was conducted to quantify some of the more critical mechanical properties of the SiC-LAS composite having a multidirection 0 / 45 /- 45 / 90 deg fiber orientation favored for the combustor linear application. Rigorous cyclic thermal tests demonstrated that SiC-LAS was extremely resistant to the thermal fatigue mechanisms that usually limit the life of metallic combustor liners. A thermal design study led to the definition of a composite liner concept that incorporated film cooled SiC-LAS shingles mounted on a Hastelloy X shell. With coolant fluxes consistent with the most advanced metallic liner technology, the calculated hot surface temperatures of the shingles were within the apparent near term capability of the material. Structural analyses indicated that the stresses in the composite panels were low, primarily because of the low coefficient of expansion of the material and it was concluded that the dominant failure mode of the liner would be an as yet unidentified deterioration of the composite from prolonged exposure to high temperature. An economic study, based on a medium thrust size commercial aircraft engine, indicated that the SiC-LAS combustor liner would weigh 22. 8 N (11. 27 lb) less and cost less to manufacture than advanced metallic liner concepts intended for use in the late 1980 's...|$|R
25|$|Standard late {{inspections}} of the Thermal Protection System took place later on Flight Day 10. About 12:15 UTC, Wilmore and Melvin began grappling and unberthing the OBSS for {{the survey of}} the shuttle’s heat shield. With help from Bresnik, they inspected the <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> of the right wing leading edge, then the nose cap and the left wing leading edge. The inspection tasks took more than five hours.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon–carbon</b> or ceramic matrix composites. This {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads, mounted on the brake caliper, is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|This {{image from}} the NASA {{archives}} shows several missing tiles on the STS-1 OMS pods. The problem on Columbia was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> leading edge panel of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the risk}} {{assessment}} hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system. These fall into two categories: damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface, and damage to the <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> (RCC) leading-edge panels. The TPS includes a third category of components, thermal insulating blankets, but damage predictions are not typically performed on them. Damage assessments on the thermal blankets can be performed after an anomaly has been observed, {{and this has been}} done at least once after the return to flight following Columbia's loss.|$|E
25|$|Prior to a ship's docking to the ISS, {{navigation}} and attitude control (GNC) is {{handed over to}} the ground control of the ships' country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. When a NASA Space Shuttle docked to the station, other ships were grounded, as the Shuttle's <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> wing leading edges, cameras, windows, and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships' movements.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 12, {{the crew}} of space shuttle Discovery secured the MPLM Leonardo in the payload bay for return to earth. Mission {{specialist}} Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger activated the latches to secure Leonardo in the payload bay at 07:15 UTC (03:15 EDT). After Leonardo was secured, Metcalf-Lindenburger, pilot Jim Dutton began the late inspection of Discoverys heat shield. The pair were joined by commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki to complete the inspection of the shuttle's <b>Reinforced</b> <b>Carbon-Carbon</b> (RCC) panels on the wings and nose and the heat-resistant tiles. The scan which takes about 7 hours was completed 3 hours ahead of schedule, and was done while still docked to the International Space Station (ISS) due {{to the loss of}} the shuttles Ku-Band antenna.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} Enterprise {{was not the}} same as that planned for , the first flight model; the aft {{fuselage}} was constructed differently, and it did not have the interfaces to mount OMS pods. A large number of subsystems—ranging from main engines to radar equipment—were not installed on Enterprise, but the capacity to add them in the future was retained, as NASA originally intended to refit the orbiter for spaceflight at the conclusion of its testing. Instead of a thermal protection system, its surface was primarily covered with simulated tiles made from polyurethane foam. Fiberglass was used for the leading edge panels in place of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon–carbon</b> ones of spaceflight-worthy orbiters. Only a few sample thermal tiles and some Nomex blankets were real. Enterprise used fuel cells to generate its electrical power, but these were not sufficient to power the orbiter for spaceflight.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the day was}} to inspect Atlantiss thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to look for any signs of launch damage. To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon–carbon</b> wing leading edges and the nose cap of the shuttle. The robotic arm grappled the OBSS at 6:58a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and laser sensor package on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The nose cap was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 UTC, was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut Stephen Robinson who communicated with them during the survey.|$|E
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} carbon composite materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a hydropneumatic suspension system for the BT49C in which soft air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension had to be very stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres. A lightweight qualifying chassis was produced, featuring a small fuel tank and lighter <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> brake discs and pads.|$|E
2500|$|About 82seconds after launch from Kennedy Space Center's LC-39-A, a suitcase-sized {{piece of}} foam broke {{off from the}} External Tank (ET), {{striking}} Columbias left wing <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> (RCC) panels. As demonstrated by ground experiments conducted by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, this likely created a [...] diameter hole, allowing hot gases to enter the wing when Columbia later re-entered the atmosphere. At {{the time of the}} foam strike, the orbiter was at an altitude of about , traveling at Mach2.46 (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Graphite (carbon) {{fiber and}} carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are also used}} in carbon fiber reinforced plastics, and in heat-resistant composites such as <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> (RCC). Commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include fishing rods, golf club shafts, bicycle frames, sports car body panels, the fuselage of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and pool cue sticks and have been successfully employed in reinforced concrete, [...] The mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite-reinforced plastic composites and grey cast iron are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials. In this context, the term [...] "(100%) graphite" [...] is often loosely {{used to refer to}} a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and resin, while the term [...] "composite" [...] is used for composite materials with additional ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{lift-off}} of STS-107 on January 16, 2003, a {{piece of}} foam insulation detached {{from one of the}} tank's bipod ramps and struck the leading edge of Space Shuttle Columbia's wing at a few hundred miles per hour. [...] The impact is believed to have damaged one comparatively large <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> panel on {{the leading edge of the}} left wing, believed to be about the size of a basketball which then allowed super-heated gas to enter the wing superstructure several days later during re-entry. [...] This resulted in the destruction of Columbia and the loss of its crew. [...] The report determined that the external fuel tank, ET-93, [...] "had been constructed with BX-250", a closeout foam whose blowing agent was CFC-11 and not the newer HCFC 141b.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 {{after the}} breakup of [...] during re-entry, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{conducted}} tests at Southwest Research Institute, which used an air gun to shoot foam blocks of similar size, mass and speed to that which struck Columbia at a test structure which mechanically replicated the orbiter wing leading edge. They removed a fiberglass panel from Enterprise wing to perform analysis of the material and attached it to the test structure, then shot a foam block at it. [...] While the panel was not broken {{as a result of}} the test, the impact was enough to permanently deform a seal. Since the <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> (RCC) panel on Columbia had only 40% of the strength of the test panel from Enterprise, this result suggested that the RCC leading edge would have been shattered. Additional tests on the fiberglass were canceled in order not to risk damaging the test apparatus, and a panel from Discovery was tested to determine the effects of the foam on a similarly-aged RCC leading edge. On July 7, 2003, a foam impact test created a hole [...] in the protective RCC panel. The tests clearly demonstrated that a foam impact of the type Columbia sustained could seriously breach the protective RCC panels on the wing leading edge.|$|E
50|$|The hottest {{areas of}} all, the nose-cap and the leading {{edges of the}} fins, were made of <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon,</b> as {{they were on the}} Shuttle.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, {{anti-lock}} braking systems became standard on most Group C cars {{as a safety}} measure, making it less likely that cars lose control at high speeds. By the late 1990s, <b>reinforced</b> <b>carbon-carbon</b> brakes were adapted for better stopping power.|$|E

50|$|A thermal soak {{heat shield}} uses an {{insulating}} material to absorb and radiate the heat {{away from the}} spacecraft structure.
