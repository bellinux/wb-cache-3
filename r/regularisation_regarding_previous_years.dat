In decreasing orderthe main species in biomass terms in this survey are Scyliorhinus canicula, Raja clavata, Galeus melastomus, Raja montagui, Etmopterus spinaxand Leucoraja naevus. Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. A marked increase in biomass of almost all species with <b>regard</b> to <b>previous</b> <b>years</b> was found, especially in S. canicula and R. clavata in IXa Division.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was carried out}} in Galicia, NW Spain, in order to estimate the magnitude of honey bee colony losses and to identify potential risk factors involved. A total of 99 samples from 99 apiaries were collected in spring using simple random sampling. According to international guidelines, the apiaries were classified as affected by colony loss or asymptomatic. Each sample consisted of worker bees, brood and comb-stored pollen. All worker bees and brood samples were analysed individually in order to detect the main honey bee pathogens. Moreover, the presence of residues of the most prevalent agrotoxic insecticides and acaricides was assessed in comb-stored pollen. The general characteristics of the apiaries and sanitary information <b>regarding</b> <b>previous</b> <b>years</b> was evaluated through questionnaires, while the vegetation surrounding the apiaries sampled was assessed by palynological analysis of comb-stored pollen. The colony loss prevalence was 53. 5 % (CI 95 %= 43. 2 - 63. 9) and Nosema ceranae was found to be the only risk factor strongly associated with colony loss. The decision tree also pointed out the impact of the Varroa mite presence while variables such as apiary size, the incorrect application of Varroa mite treatments, and the presence of Acarapis woodi and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) were identified as possible co-factors...|$|R

During the year 2004 the rate of exploitation (E= 0. 69 y- 1) was significantly bigger than the values of 2003 and the monthly landings (maximum of 335 t) and fishing effort (maximum of 848 trips) were twice increased.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : To propose a {{methodology}} to establish motivations underlying wildland fire episodes by analyzing both the socioeconomics {{of the affected}} territory and the geographical distribution of the wildfire. Area of study : The wildfires occurred during 2006 in Galicia, in the NW of Spain, were analyzed and compared <b>regard</b> to the <b>previous</b> <b>years.</b> Material and methods : The proposed methodology {{in this study is}} divided into four steps: (a) definition of the forest context, (b) fire episode and socioeconomic data collection, (c) geospatial representation through map production, and (d) joint analysis and data interpretation. A combined analysis of the spatial and temporal coincidence of wildfire and the socioeconomic activities is performed. Main results : A combined analysis of the spatial and temporal coincidence of wildfire dynamics and the socioeconomic activitiesallow us to assess and to interpret wildfire causes and motivations of socioeconomic groups. In our area study, a broad analysis indicates that wildfire recurrence within this region is related to an accelerated rural flight process which exacerbates the conflict between rural and urban models. Research highlights : The socio-geographical analysis of a territory’s wildfire dynamics enables us to establish possible causes and motivations of their origins. Providing the specific contextual and socioeconomic information, this methodology has potential applicability across varied study locations.
