A person only needs to be 18 to own a liquor license, or to sell or serve alcohol (for example, a waiter or supermarket cashier). State law also prohibits an underage person from misrepresenting their age in a licensed establishment.|$|E

The following day Steve Madden shoes, opened the first <b>retail</b> <b>establishment</b> in the structure. As of February 2012, the theatre, food court and gym had not opened and were no longer planned. The building remained only 26 percent occupied at that time due to hesitance by retailers to commit to leases while lender Bank of America and developer Joseph Freed battled in bankruptcy court.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{barriers}} to entry for large <b>retail</b> <b>establishments</b> in Spain have been increased in the last decade. Using information on local markets, we test whether the entry of large <b>retail</b> <b>establishments</b> was effectively limited by regional regulation and whether it effectively protected in-town shops from competition. We find that if entry barriers were reduced to their average level in 1997, the number of large <b>retail</b> <b>establishments</b> would increase by 11. 7 %. We also find that over-regulation in 1997 has improved in-town shops’ market position, with their number increasing by 13. 8 %. Barriers to entry, retail distribution, regulation...|$|R
25|$|Henry Search {{opened a}} butcher's shop in 1850, on the {{south-west}} corner of Albert Street and Sydney Road. This {{was the first}} <b>retail</b> <b>establishment</b> in Brunswick. By 1851, gold diggers began making {{their way through the}} area, on their journey from the populous suburbs of Fitzroy and Collingwood. Brunswick provided a convenient place for lunch, before the diggers reached the beginnings of the roads to the goldfields, near present-day Essendon. A small village sprang up {{to meet the needs of}} the travellers, near the present day Cumberland Arms Hotel. The village included a tent market, described as being like a bazaar, where miners could buy goods needed for the goldfields. Brunswick Post Office opened on 1 January 1854.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} economic activities in the borough are manufacturing and commerce. Sixty-three percent of all business establishments are dedicated to commerce, which employ 42% {{of the people and}} accounts for 45% of the borough’s GDP. Commerce and services together employ 63.3% of the population. Twenty-four percent of this commerce is wholesale, much of which is tied to the Central de Abasto and the La Nueva Viga markets. However, wholesale businesses have declined 2.8% while <b>retail</b> <b>establishment</b> have increased 8.1%. This has a positive effect on employment, but this activity adds less to the GDP. The largest sector of retail sales is in street markets called tianguis, followed by public markets, street peddlers and lastly through the Central de Abasto.|$|E

He founded Simpsons of Piccadilly when the Geological Museum had closed and the site to be auctioned. The new {{building}} was designed by architect Joseph Emberton as a new and revolutionary <b>retail</b> <b>establishment,</b> the shop front windows exhibited the first curved glass display in Great Britain and the largest in the world at the time, these were designed so that no reflection would be cast to obscure the displays inside. The outstanding feature of the shop's interior was the travertine staircase that ran up through the centre of the store lit by a continuous window up the height of the building. The current lighting structure suspended through the staircase centre is the original from the 1930s as the building has since become a listed building.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{develops}} {{models to}} formulate the optimal density of <b>retail</b> <b>establishments</b> by considering interactions between logistics cost and consumer demand. Commodities {{are assumed to}} be distributed from a depot directly or through single intermediate terminal to many <b>retail</b> <b>establishments.</b> Average lo-gistic cost per item, consumer demand, and the interrelationship between them are analyzed. The optimal density of <b>retail</b> <b>establishments</b> and local terminals are determined by minimizing average logistic cost, or maximizing total supply subject to the demand-supply equality. The envelope curves for the optimal con-figuration strategies corresponding to different values of total market area and terminal cost are derived. JEL classification: R 4...|$|R

6000|$|The {{audience}} brightened considerably when {{item number}} {{five of the}} programme was signalled. The orchestra struck up a rollicking measure and Tony Luton made his entrance amid a rousing storm of applause. He was dressed as an errand-boy of some West End shop, with a livery and box- tricycle, as spruce and decorative as the most ambitious errand-boy could see himself in his most ambitious dreams. His song was a lively and very audacious chronicle of life {{behind the scenes of}} a big <b>retail</b> <b>establishment,</b> and sparkled with allusions which might fitly have been described as suggestive--at any rate they appeared to suggest meanings to the audience quite as clearly as Gorla Mustelford's dances were likely to do, even with the aid, in her case, of long explanations on the programmes. When the final verse seemed about to reach an unpardonable climax a stage policeman opportunely appeared and moved the lively songster on for obstructing the imaginary traffic of an imaginary Bond Street. The house received the new number with genial enthusiasm, and mingled its applause with demands for an earlier favourite. The orchestra struck up the familiar air, and in a few moments the smart errand-boy, transformed now into a smart jockey, was singing [...] "They quaff the gay bubbly in Eccleston Square" [...] to an audience that hummed and nodded its unstinted approval.|$|E

60|$|The second detective was {{assisted}} to clamber up {{into the}} car. It seemed, however, as though the whole force of Scotland Yard could scarcely do much towards elucidating an affair which, with every question which was asked and answered, grew more mysterious. The papers upon the table before the dead man were simply circulars and prospectuses of no possible importance. His suitcase contained merely a few toilet necessaries and some clean linen. There was not {{a scrap of paper}} or even an envelope of any sort in his pockets. In a small leather case they found a thousand dollars in American notes, five ten-pound Bank of England notes, and a single visiting card on which was engraved the name of Mr. Hamilton Fynes. In his trousers pocket was a handful of gold. He had no other personal belongings of any sort. The space between the lining of his coat and the material itself was duly noticed, but it was empty. His watch was a cheap one, his linen unmarked, and his clothes bore only the name of a great New York <b>retail</b> <b>establishment.</b> He had certainly entered the train alone, and both the guard and attendant were ready to declare positively that no person could have been concealed in it. The engine-driver, on his part, was equally ready to swear that not once from the moment when they had steamed out of Liverpool Station until they had arrived within twenty miles of London, had they travelled at less than forty miles an hour. At Willington he had found a signal against him which had brought him nearly to a standstill, and under the regulations he had passed through the station at ten miles an hour. These were the only occasions, however, on which he had slackened speed at all. The train attendant, who was a nervous man, began to shiver again and imagine unmentionable things. The guard, who had never left his own brake, went home and dreamed that his effigy had been added to the collection of Madame Tussaud. The reporters were the only people who were really happy, with the exception, perhaps of Inspector Jacks, who had a weakness for a difficult case.|$|E
