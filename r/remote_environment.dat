50|$|Up {{until the}} end of the 18th Century, {{beginning}} in what is known as the Middle Ages, forests were considered places for travelers and ordinary folk to stay away from, as they were home to bandits and were believed to be inhabited by evil spirits.

In this paper we describe insights from a qualitative study examining the benefits and continued challenges of using networked technologies for work purposes in rural and remote communities.

5000|$|Long {{after the}} Glen Canyon Dam was built and {{continuing}} to the present day, controversy remains between supporters of dam removal and those who believe it should be left in place. One of the earliest debates regarding the dam was its impact on Rainbow Bridge National Monument, whose 290 ft high natural arch is the highest in North America, and is a sacred site to the Navajo people. The environmental lobby wanted the Bureau of Reclamation to keep Lake Powell at or below a level of 3600 ft, {{to prevent it from}} intruding into the monument. The Bureau of Reclamation proposed to build a barrier dam and pump system in order to keep water out of the monument.

5000|$|The Brother Assassin, {{written by}} Fred Saberhagen in 1969, {{introduced}} the complete concept for a telepresence master-slave humanoid system. In the novel, {{the concept is}} described as follows: [...] "And a moment later it seemed to all his senses {{that he had been}} transported from the master down into the body of the slave-unit standing beneath it on the floor. As the control of its movements passed over to him, the slave started gradually to lean to one side, and he moved its foot to maintain balance as naturally as he moved his own. Tilting back his head, he could look up through the slave's eyes to see the master-unit, with himself inside, maintaining the same attitude on its complex suspension."The term telepresence was coined in a 1980 article by Minsky, who outlined his vision for an adapted version of the older concept of teleoperation that focused on giving a remote participant a feeling of actually being present at a different location. [...] One of the first systems to create a fully immersive illusion of presence in a remote location was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed in 1992 at the U.S. Air Force, Armstrong Labs by inventor Louis Rosenberg. The system included stereoscopic image display from the <b>remote</b> <b>environment</b> as well as immersive touch feedback using a full upper-body exoskeleton.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2006, the {{population}} of prairie falcons {{was estimated to be}} stable or increasing at over 5,000 pairs, with perhaps 200 pairs breeding at the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in Idaho. By contrast, in the years before DDT contamination extirpated the eastern U.S. peregrine falcon population in the 1950s and 1960s, the number of eastern peregrines in the United States had already dropped to about 350 pairs. [...] It is thought the prairie falcon mostly avoided {{the population}} loss suffered by the peregrine from DDT induced egg shell thinning due to its more <b>remote</b> <b>environment</b> partly insulating it from pesticide contamination. The loss of peregrine population allowed the expansion of prairie falcon range to cliff nesting sites in areas formerly occupied by peregrines moderately outside historic prairie falcon territory. The successful reintroduction of peregrines to eastern and central United States brought peregrine and prairie falcons back into competition in these areas. The reintroduction program led by the Peregrine Fund bred and released more than 4,000 peregrine falcons from 1974 to 1997. The program necessarily made use of available captive bred peregrine stock with a strong genetic influence from larger bodied peregrine subspecies. The created strain of mixed subspecies peregrine tends to be heavier and stronger than the prairie falcon, and where they conflict over nesting sites they often displace prairie falcons. However, these reintroduced peregrines are little threat to prairie falcon populations within their natural range, as the prairie falcon with its greater heat tolerance, lower daily food requirement, and wider prey base has the survival advantage in the harsh high desert environment in which it has evolved to prosper.|$|E

This system is able to interpret and execute the commands formulated by the operator in natural language, according to the elements present in the <b>remote</b> <b>environment.</b> An error feedback module has been designed in order {{to take into account the}} on-line correcting information expressed by the operator during the execution of a task in the <b>remote</b> <b>environment.</b> The proposed voice assis-tance tool has been designed as a module in a novel teleoperation architecture, which allows to integrate multiple assistance tools.

This paper reviews how the {{original}} telexistence (tele-existence) {{technology has been}} developed, and describes a newly developed method of mutual telexistence using projection technology onto retro-reflective objects dubbed RPT (Retro-reflective Projection Technology). Telexistence is fundamentally a concept named for the general technology that enables a human being to have a real-time sensation of being at a place other than {{where he or she}} actually exists, and being able to interact with the <b>remote</b> <b>environment,</b> which may be real, virtual, or a combination of both. It also refers to an advanced type of teleoperation system that enables an operator at the control to perform remote tasks dexterously with the feeling of existing in a surrogate robot working in a <b>remote</b> <b>environment.</b> Telexistence in the real environment through a virtual environment is also possible. Although conventional telexistence systems provide an operator the real-time sensation of being in a <b>remote</b> <b>environment,</b> persons in the <b>remote</b> <b>environment</b> have only a feeling that a surrogate robot is presented, not the operator.
