2500|$|Portland {{cement clinker}} {{is made by}} heating, in a cement kiln, a mixture of raw {{materials}} to a calcining temperature of above [...] and then a fusion temperature, which is about [...] for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker. The materials in cement clinker are alite, belite, tri-calcium aluminate, and tetra-calcium alumino ferrite. The aluminium, iron, and magnesium oxides are present as a flux allowing the calcium silicates to form at a lower temperature, and contribute little to the strength. For special cements, such as Low Heat (LH) and Sulfate Resistant (SR) types, {{it is necessary to}} limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3CaO·Al2O3) formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone (CaCO3) mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or SiO2 is used. The CaCO3 content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials (materials in the <b>raw</b> <b>mix</b> other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the materials used are clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash, and slag. When a cement kiln is fired by coal, the ash of the coal acts as a secondary raw material.|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{in the field of}} MDF materials, which has not been followed or indicated by now, are the options of improvement of cross-linking through intensified mixing of dry MDF <b>raw</b> <b>mixes</b> of cement and polymer. The potential of mechanochemical treatment to intensify the atomic level of cross-linking already in the <b>raw</b> <b>mixes</b> and, thus, the activation of <b>raw</b> <b>mixes</b> has been critically verified earlier. Processes of the mutual MDF syntheses of both standard and activated <b>raw</b> <b>mixes</b> are presented and discussed in this paper. The scope of cross-linking as a key item of the successful MDF synthesis has been studied by two independent experimental methods – thermal analysis and IR spectroscopy. The knowledge has been achieved about (i) phenomenon of internal pressure during MDF synthesis from mechanochemically activated raw mixtures and (ii) increase of the content of cross-links by one third in MDF materials synthesized from mechanochemically activated raw mixtures in comparison with these synthesized from standard raw mixtures. Mechanochemical activation of raw mixtures undoubtedly leads to the intensification of cross-linking in MDF materials; if applied (prior to water addition and pressure application) it increases the rate of cross-links formation in the system through the effect of internal pressure. The reported approach and results represent besides the contribution to the knowledge about MDF materials themselves also the challenge {{for the development of a}} variety of new and innovative materials strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} of hepatitis A virus (HAV) was determined both in mixtures of septic tank effluent (STE) with dairy cattle manure slurry (DCMS) and in mixtures of STE with swine manure slurry (SMS). HAV was consistently inactivated more {{rapidly in the}} two types of mixed wastes than in STE alone or in the control Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 5 degrees C, the D values (time, in days, for a 90 % reduction of virus titer) were 34. 6 for the mixed STE and DCMS, 48. 5 for the mixed STE and SMS, 58. 5 for STE, and 217. 4 for the Dulbecco's PBS control. At 22 degrees C, the D values were 23. 0, 17. 1, 35. 1, and 90. 1 for the four suspension media, respectively. A comparison of HAV inactivation in mixed wastes subjected to different treatments at the same pH and temperatures showed that the virus inactivation in the mixed wastes was related, at least in part, to microbial activity.

5000|$|The key {{component}} of the gas-suspension preheater is the cyclone. A cyclone is a conical vessel into which a dust-bearing gas-stream is passed tangentially. This produces a vortex within the vessel. The gas leaves the vessel through a co-axial [...] "vortex-finder". The solids are thrown to the outside edge of the vessel by centrifugal action, and leave through a valve in the vertex of the cone. Cyclones were originally used {{to clean up the}} dust-laden gases leaving simple dry process kilns. If, instead, the entire feed of rawmix is encouraged to pass through the cyclone, it is found that a very efficient heat exchange takes place: the gas is efficiently cooled, hence producing less waste of heat to the atmosphere, and the <b>raw</b> <b>mix</b> is efficiently heated. This efficiency is further increased if a number of cyclones are connected in series.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} in the kiln is not necessarily higher than gray clinker production but it appears higher due to the reflectance especially in gas fired kilns (which do have a higher flame temperature). With off-white clinker coal firing can be used which has many advantages for costs and output. It is important to finely grind the coal and have a burner which gives a very short bright flame (high velocity low primary air) so that the excess oxygen can be kept low close to zero with maybe 0.1% CO. There {{is no need for}} a second flame if combustion in the coal flame is rapid and controlled. The Off-white clinker has a light greenish colour due to Fe(II). Rotary kilns have limitations on output based on the surface area required for the heat transfer. Few old kiln process can reach the surface area limits due to limits in auxiliary equipment such as fuel input (e.g. lack of precalcination), grinding of coal and raw materials, exhaust fan capacity, chemical control of <b>raw</b> <b>mix,</b> burner quality, kiln control etc. With well operated off-white clinker production kiln output can be only a few percent lower than gray clinker production.|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of poliovirus type 1 (PO 1) in mixed septic tank effluent and swine manure slurry was determined, and the antiviral effects of several bacterial cultures isolated from swine manure slurry were demonstrated. In two field experiments, PO 1 was consistently inactivated more {{rapidly in the}} mixed waste than in the control Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS). D values (time [in days] for a 90 % reduction of virus titer) were 18. 7 and 29. 9 for the mixed waste and 56. 5 and 51. 8 for the D-PBS control, respectively. The virus inactivation in the mixed waste was temperature dependent. A comparison of PO 1 inactivation in <b>raw</b> <b>mixed</b> waste, autoclaved mixed waste, and bacterium-free filtrate of <b>raw</b> <b>mixed</b> waste at the same pH and temperatures provided an initial demonstration that the virus inactivation in the mixed waste is related, at least in part, to microbial activity.
