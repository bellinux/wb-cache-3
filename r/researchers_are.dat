5|$|Gallium maltolate, an oral, highly {{absorbable}} form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells, particularly {{cancer cells}} and some bacteria that accept {{it in place}} of ferric iron (Fe3+). <b>Researchers</b> <b>are</b> conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment {{for a number of}} cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.|$|E

5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>are</b> {{concerned}} that trucking colonies {{around the country}} to pollinate crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant to all sorts of systemic disorder.|$|E

5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean <b>researchers</b> <b>are</b> skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.|$|E
5000|$|As already mentioned, it is {{an ethical}} {{principle}} that the researcher should not inflict on volunteers anything that the <b>researcher</b> would not <b>be</b> willing to do to him- or herself, but the <b>researcher</b> <b>is</b> not always a suitable, or even possible, subject for the experiment. For instance, the <b>researcher</b> may <b>be</b> the wrong gender if the research is into hormone treatment for women, or may be too old, or too young.

Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Braun was {{a member}} of Hoffman's staff when she {{attended}} the Nuremberg Rally {{for the first time in}} 1935. Hitler's half-sister, Angela Raubal (the dead Geli's mother), took exception to her presence there, and was later dismissed from her position as housekeeper at his house in Berchtesgaden. <b>Researchers</b> <b>are</b> unable to ascertain if her dislike for Braun was the only reason for her departure, but other members of Hitler's entourage saw Braun as untouchable from then on.|$|E

5|$|GTRI's {{research}} spans {{a variety}} of disciplines, including national defense, homeland security, public health, education, mobile and wireless technologies, and economic development. Major customers for GTRI research include United States Department of Defense agencies, the state of Georgia, non-defense federal agencies, and private industry. Overall, contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI's total research funding. Since it was established, GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include science, economics, policy, and other areas that leverage GTRI's partnership with Georgia Tech. GTRI <b>researchers</b> <b>are</b> named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents.|$|E

5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary <b>researchers</b> <b>are</b> taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>are</b> {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant {{because of the}} availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E
