5000|$|... 100% sand root {{zones are}} used often {{and are more}} cost {{effective}} from a construction standpoint. Selection {{of the type of}} sand is very crucial, as there are variations in particle size and shape. One main type being <b>rounded</b> <b>sands,</b> that provide efficient filtration for water and other aqueous solutions, enabling the turf to take more rainfall. The downside of <b>rounded</b> <b>sands</b> is that their shape prohibits them from forming a firm seedbed. This makes the turf less durable which can be problematic for high trafficked areas during sporting seasons. Another type is angular sands, that are able to provide this firm seed bed, thus establishing durable turf. Angular sands achieve this firmness as they are able to settle and form together more efficiently than <b>rounded</b> <b>sands.</b> However, because of this firmness, angular sands do have the potential to cut into roots, thus inhibiting water an nutrient uptake and leaving the turf susceptible to plant pathogens. Both types of sands have potential pros and cons, but in the end, {{it is up to the}} turf manager to determine which type of sand will be most beneficial to the turf. Once a sand is selected and it is determined if an amendment will be used, the layout of the root zone profile must be determined.|$|R

The physical interpretation of the flow test is investigated by conducting image-monitored flow tests on mortars prepared with mixtures of natural <b>round</b> <b>sand</b> and crushed angular sand to evaluate the progression of flow and the effect of aggregate shape characteristics on cement mortar rheology. The evolution of flow with the number of drops follows a hyperbolic trend. When analyzed within an energy-based framework, it is found that both the base shear at the mortar-plate interface and the internal energy loss in shear deformation are functions of the shear resistance within the mortar. This is further confirmed with mortars prepared with varying quantities of round particles. It is also shown that particle shape affects packing density and the mobilized friction between aggregates; therefore, particle shape defines the amount of paste required to reduce grain interaction to attain adequate flow...|$|E

Yet, there is an attraction to golf for many people, including me. And, not only do we play the game, but we also do the following: • Keep our score and compare it to a target known as par. • Keep track of our scores and establish a personal benchmark known as a handicap. • Compare our new scores to the bench-mark and adjust it when necessary. • Analyze what we did right. • Analyze what we could do to improve. • Like to talk about it … usually! • Do benchmark studies when we com-pare our scores and handicaps with others and categorize ourselves in groupings and rankings. • Chart our progress as well as how we are doing compared to others. • Create sub-measures such as putts per <b>round,</b> <b>sand</b> saves, driving accuracy, and driving distance to help us under-stand our strengths and weaknesses and to identify and prioritize where we need to improve.

40|$|Experimental {{pressure}} {{solution of}} quartz {{was conducted in}} hydrothermal reactors. Loads ranged from 2500 psi to 12, 000 psi, with temperatures ranging from 270 °C to 55 O 0 C. Pressure solution occurred in distilled water {{as well as in}} solutions of NaOH, NaCOa, NaCI, and natural brines. Clearly defined pressure solution pits were readily observed on faces of quartz crystals which had been surrounded by small zircon grains and subjected to load. The rate of compaction of fine sand was much greater than that of coarse sand, resulting in a pore space reduction of 70 percent in fine sand compared to a 45 percent reduction in coarse sand. The rate of compac-tion of fine angular sand was approximately 2. 3 times that of fine <b>round</b> <b>sand.</b> As a result of pressure solution and growth, the appearance of the angular grains was little {{different from that of the}} round grains after comparable pressure solution. Simultaneous pressure solution and quartz growth in sand samples produced aggregates which were considerably stronger than those resulting from cementation alone. Samples composed of grains of chert responded to pressure solution much more rapidly than monocrys-talline quartz. The chert did not completely recrystallize, but grain boundaries became very indistinct and the resulting product resembled a solid mass of chert. The experimental studies show that as a result of pressure solution, initial differences in texture and com-position of natural sands may lead to striking differences in final porosity. The phenomenon of pressure solution refers to the solution of quartz a t the point of grain contact as a result of stress, generally from load pressure. The effects of pressure solution have been widely observed and reported from petro-graphic studies of sedimentary rocks. Probably the most dramatic expression of pressure solu-tion takes the form of stylolite seams. Heald (1955) described the formation of stylolites in sandstones and stated that the silica produced by stylolitic solution could be an important source of silica cement in sediments.

40|$|Dans cet article, nous présentons des travaux mettant en évidence les capacités de {{traitement}} biologique des eaux résiduaires urbaines au sein des milieux poreux de textures différentes. Une étude comparative du développement de la biomasse couplé aux mécanismes généraux de transferts gazeux à travers deux réacteurs biologiques est menée. Des lits d’infiltration percolation sont simulés par des colonnes garnies de sables d’origine et de structures différentes. Ils sont alimentés périodiquement via un automate de commande avec un influent d’une charge de 525 mgDCO/l et de 54 mgNK/l. Les résultats obtenus établissent le fait qu’un développement équilibré de la biomasse incluant les phases de croissance et de régression est intrinsèquement lié à {{la nature}} physique du matériau support. A l’aide des carottes prélevées sur les massifs filtrants et des sondes d’oxymétrie introduites à différentes hauteurs des lits d’infiltration, nous montrons que la répartition verticale du biofilm dans les colonnes ainsi que l’oxygénation des milieux poreux lors des périodes de repos sont également corrélées à la structure des supports pourtant de diamètres moyens similaires. L’efficacité de traitement biologique du carbone est supérieure pour un sable d’origine alluvionnaire comparativement à un sable concassé; la tendance s’inversant significativement lorsqu’il s’agit de la diminution de l’azote. In this article, we present work highlighting {{the capacity of}} variously textured porous media to biologically process urban waste water. A comparative study was undertaken that coupled biomass development with general gas transfer mechanisms through two biological engines. Infiltration/percolation beds are biological systems that treat water using a purifying bacterial culture that develops on a mineral support. Used in domestic wastewater treatment, they are regarded as being well suited to rural areas. These infiltration/percolation beds are {{easy to use and}} attain a high quality in their output, two factors that constitute assets for small communities. Infiltration/percolation beds were simulated in the present work by columns lined with sands of varying origin and structure. They were fed automatically, at set intervals, with waste water containing 525 mg/L of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 54 mg/L of Kjeldahl nitrogen. A balanced development of the biomass, including the phases of growth and regression, was intrinsically related to the physical nature of the material used as a support. First, during the supply period, balanced growth of the biomass was quickly reached within the crushed sand. Secondly, within <b>round</b> <b>sand,</b> the regression of the biofilm was less significant and more regular over several weeks. In both supports, the regression was well correlated with an exponential decay. Lastly, the frequency of the supply periods, the organic loads involved, and the rest periods imposed are all factors that contribute to a lack of accumulation of living and/or inert organic matter in the columns. After obtaining a balanced development of the biomass, the abilities of the columns to reduce the concentrations of carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia were evaluated. Samples of effluent were taken downstream, both before the beginning of the supply period and as it came out of the column approximately thirty minutes after beginning the drainage period. The percentage of suspended matter coming out of the columns gave rather precise information on the scrubbing of the solid mass caused by various shearing speeds or by the structure of the base. Generally, it appeared that :- The reduction of the overall DOC was higher than 70 %, regardless of which type of sand base was used. - In the water coming out of the column made up of <b>round</b> <b>sand,</b> the overall DOC content was without exception lower than 125 mg/L, as would be expected for an infiltration-percolation process. - The treatment of carbon in the columns based on stream sand was in general more effective than that obtained in columns with crushed sand. Concerning the treatment of nitrogen, crushed sand yielded outputs with a reduction in ammonia that was a lot higher than 80 % (mean ± SD: 92 ± 4 %) and was systematically higher than those obtained with stream sand (mean ± SD: 72 ± 7 %). The suspended matter content was extremely low in the effluent; since no suspended matter was introduced into the effluent, the concentration coming out of the column was the direct result of the biofilm becoming detached and/or, to a lesser extent, of the transport of the biomass in the liquid phase. As could be expected, because of the roughness causing more shearing, more particles became detached when the interior solid mass was made up of crushed sand. Using core samples taken from the filter's solid mass, as well as oxygen probes inserted at various levels into the biological engines, we showed that the vertical distribution of the biofilm in the columns, as well as the oxygenation of the porous media during the rest periods, were all correlated with the structure of the solid supports (note that all sands had similar average diameters). Gaseous exchanges within the filter's solid mass were dependent on both the type of coating and the depth at which they took place. The oxygen probes were inserted at depths of 14 cm and 18 cm respectively, to determine the percentage of oxygen saturation in the liquid phase within the filter during one week while the columns were operating. Two phases were characteristic of the exchanges observed in {{the upper part of the}} filter's solid mass. First we noted an instantaneous reduction in the oxygen content of the liquid phase, linked to the arrival of a batch, followed by a reoxygenation of this portion. Next there was a long phase, lasting approximately 94 % of the time between batches, during which time the oxygen content in the residual moisture remained constant. In the lower part of the solid mass, variation in oxygen content was different. Partial deoxygenation in the liquid phase of the porous media here was primarily due to the biochemical oxidation of the organic matter (i. e., consumption by the biomass). It was also due, to a lesser extent, to the augmentation in moisture content that occurs after each batch, and leads to a reduction in porosity and a decrease in oxygen transfer. During the final phase of drainage, a balance was created between the open porous space with air, and the space containing stagnant moisture. The diffusion of oxygen in the former and its transfer towards the latter thus compensated for this consumption, and it therefore remained constant. If the medium was left to dry out longer, the diffusion and transfer phenomena increased, and we observed an increase in oxygen content. With respect to the vertical distribution of biomass in the columns, we found that it was almost homogeneous inside the stream sand, up to a depth of 28 cm (total depth = 40 cm). Generally, the organic matter content at each point of measurement in the column was higher in the stream sand than in the crushed sand. The variation was greater around 28 cm, where there was a more significant quantity of moisture inside the sand...|$|E

The purpose {{was to determine the}} effects of eolian shape sorting and abrasion upon the shapes of eolian sand grains. Two conclusions are reached. The first is that the wind preferentially transports spherical, <b>rounded</b> <b>sand</b> grains, and this can result in the isolation and accumulation of such grains in an eolian deposit after a relatively short transport distance. The second is that eolian abrasion can greatly increase the roundness of sand grains during their transport over a distance of less than 160 kin.
