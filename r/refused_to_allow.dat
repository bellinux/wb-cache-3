5|$|The Netherlands and Belgium {{wished to}} remain neutral and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the RAF to {{establish}} bases, to fly deeper into Germany. They also forbade overflying by British bombers {{to and from}} Germany. After the outbreak of war, the French <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields. The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line, but their air force did not possess the modern bombers to deliver a pre-emptive strike against the Luftwaffe. French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either. A fear of retaliation was the main French reason. The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were within easy reach. This state of affairs suited the British, in particular, the Admiralty.|$|E
