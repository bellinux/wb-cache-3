5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

Experiments have been performed on the <b>ring</b> <b>tone.</b> The lower figure on the right shows the relationship of frequency to Reynolds number. If the Strouhal number were graphed in lieu of the frequency, it would have shown that contours were reasonably constant similar to those for the hole tone. Close examination of the data in the figure showed a slight negative dependence of Strouhal number on Reynolds number.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "ring" [...] here {{refers to}} {{something}} akin to that worn on the finger and not the sound from a cellphone. The flow from a circular orifice impinging on a toroidal ring of the same diameter as the orifice {{will result in a}} tone; it is called a <b>ring</b> <b>tone.</b> It is similar to the hole tone described above except that because the plate was replaced by a ring a fundamental change in the resultant sound field occurs. Small disturbances at the ring feed back to the orifice to be amplified by the flow instability (Class I). The unstable flow creates a set of symmetric (ring) vortices that later impinge on the physical ring.|$|E
