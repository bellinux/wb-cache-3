40|$|<b>Relative</b> scotopic <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> depends {{only on the}} {{rhodopsin}} photopigment and ocular media absorption spectra. Rhodopsin is well characterised so the <b>relative</b> scotopic <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function can {{be calculated}} for intraocular lenses (IOLs) of known spectral density. In a recent perspective, Mainster and Sparrow concluded that an IOL with short wave absorbing chromophores would provide more retinal protection than conventional IOLs, but the practical consequences for scotopic vision are unclear. This paper uses published experiments to examine the implications for scotopic vision of the IOLs analysed by Mainster and Sparrow. A 14. 6 % reduction in scotopic sensitivity is expected for a SN 60 AT (AcrySof Natural) compared to a SA 60 AT (Conventional AcrySof) IOL under broadband illumination (equal quantum spectrum). This effect (0. 07 log unit) is visually insignificant {{in relation to the}} ∼ 4. 0 log unit range of scotopic sensitivity. More importantly, it is expected that scotopic contrast sensitivity would be reduced by only ∼ 0. 01 log unit. It is thus improbable that a difference in scotopic vision between observers with the Natural and Conventional IOLs could be reliably detected using broadband stimuli...|$|R

A bilateral preirradiation with 450 -nm light at a fluence greater than about 0. 1 micromole per square meter causes a rapid desensitization to a subsequent 450 -nanometer unilateral irradiation at 0. 5 micromole per square meter. Following a refractory period, the capacity to respond phototropically recovers to the predesensitization level, and the response is then enhanced. The length of the refractory period is between 10 and 20 minutes. Both the time needed for recovery {{and the extent of}} enhancement increase with increasing fluence of the bilateral preirradiation. Based on the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of desensitization and enhancement, these responses can be separated. Desensitization is induced by blue light but not by red light. Enhancement, however, is induced by both blue and red light. Thus, enhancement can be induced without desensitization but not vice versa. Both desensitization and enhancement affect only the magnitude of the response and do not affect the fluence threshold...|$|R

Secondary eyes have maximum relative sensitivities at 505 – 510 nm which are unchanged by chromatic adaptations. Principal eyes have ultraviolet sensitivities which are 10 to 100 times greater at 380 nm than at 505 nm. However, two animals' eyes initially had greater blue-green sensitivities, then in 7 to 10 wk dropped 4 to 6 log units in absolute sensitivity in the visible, {{less in the}} ultraviolet. Chromatic adaptations of both types of principal eyes hardly changed <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Small decreases in relative sensitivity in the visible with orange adaptations were possibly retinomotor in origin. Second peaks in ERG waveforms were elicited from ultraviolet-adapted principal eyes by wavelengths 400 nm and longer, and from blue-, yellow-, and orange-adapted secondary eyes by wavelengths 580 nm and longer. The second peaks in waveforms were most likely responses of unilluminated eyes to scattered light. It is concluded that both principal and secondary eyes contain cells with a visual pigment absorbing maximally at 505 – 510 nm. The variable absolute and ultraviolet sensitivities of principal eyes {{may be due to}} a second pigment in the same cells or to an ultraviolet-absorbing accessory pigment which excites the 505 nm absorbing visual pigment by radiationless energy transfer...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{circadian}} biology {{over the}} past decade has paid increasing attention to the photoreceptor mechanisms that align the molecular clock to the 24 -h light/dark cycle, and some of the results to emerge are surprising. For example, the rods and cones within the mammalian eye are not required for entrainment. A population of directly light-sensitive ganglion cells exists within the retina and acts as brightness detectors. This article provides a brief history of the discovery of these novel ocular photoreceptors and then describes the methods that have been used to study the photopigments mediating these responses to light. Photopigment characterization has traditionally been based on a number of complementary approaches, {{but one of the most}} useful techniques has been action spectroscopy. A photopigment has a discrete absorbance spectrum, which describes the probability of photons being absorbed as a function of wavelength, and the magnitude of any light-dependent response depends on the number of photons absorbed by the photopigment. Thus, a description of the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> profile (action spectrum) of any light-dependent response must, by necessity, match absorbance spectra of the photopigment mediating the response. We provide a step-by-step approach to conducting action spectra, including the construction of irradiance response curves, the calculation of <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> and photopigment template fitting, and discuss the underlying assumptions behind this approach. We then illustrate action spectrum methodologies by an in-depth analysis of action spectra obtained from rodless/coneless (rd/rd cl) mice and discuss, for the first time, the full implications of these findings...|$|R

40|$|Research {{over the}} past decade has focused {{increasingly}} on the photoreceptor mechanisms that regulate the circadian system in all forms of life. Some of the results to emerge are surprising. For example, the rods and cones within the mammalian eye are not required for the alignment (entrainment) of circadian rhythms to the dawn-dusk cycle. There exists a population of directly light-sensitive ganglion cells within the eye that act as brightness detectors; these regulate both circadian rhythms and melatonin synthesis. An understanding of these "circadian photoreceptor" pathways, and the features of the light environment used for entrainment, have been {{and will continue to be}} heavily dependent on the appropriate use and measurement of light stimuli. Furthermore, if results from different laboratories, or species, are to be compared in any meaningful sense, standardized methods for light measurement and manipulation need to be adopted by circadian biologists. To this end, we describe light measurement in terms of both radiometric and photometric units and consider the appropriate use of light as a stimulus in circadian experiments. In addition, the construction of action spectra has been very helpful in associating photopigments with particular responses in a broad range of photobiological systems. Because the identity of the photopigments mediating circadian responses to light are often not known, we have also taken this opportunity to provide a step-by-step approach to conducting action spectra, including the construction of irradiance response curves, the calculation of <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> photopigment template fitting, and the underlying assumptions behind this approach. The aims of this chapter are to provide an accessible introduction to photobiological methods and explain why these approaches need to be applied to the study of circadian systems...|$|R

The depth of the congenital colour defect can be quantified by the colour contrast threshold measured in equiluminous conditions along a single red-green axis identical for all types of red-green colour defectives.

If species exhibit evolutionary adaptations of their visual system or signals to habitat light conditions, then these conditions can directly influence the structure of communities.

We found that each species occupies a distinct microhabitat with respect to light intensity and spectral quality. We measured the <b>relative</b> retinal <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and found significant differences between the species that correlate with differences in habitat spectral quality. We measured the spectral reflectance of the dewlaps (colourful throat fans used in communication), and found that the A. cooki dewlap reflects little ultraviolet (UV), while that of A. cristatellus reflects strongly in the UV. For both species downwelling light (irradiance) is rich in UV. However the background light (radiance) is rich in UV for A. cooki, but low in UV for A. cristatellus. Thus, the dewlap of each species creates a high contrast with the background in the UV. Our findings strongly suggest that these two species are partitioning their habitat through specializations of the visual system and signal design to microhabitat light conditions...|$|R

This paper details a step by step methodology for identifying the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of modified (to be response to near infra-red wavelengths) and un-modified COTS digital cameras, showing the results of its application for three different models of camera. Six digital still cameras, which are being used as imaging systems on-board different UAVs, were selected to have their <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> measured by a monochromator. Each camera was exposed to monochromatic light ranging from 370 nm to 1100 nm in 10 nm steps, with images of each step recorded in RAW format.

This study aimed to determine whether this change of red light sensitivity is specifically related to reproductive physiology. The mRNA levels of opsin genes were examined in the retinae of sexually mature and immature fish, as well as in sham-operated males, castrated control males, or castrated males implanted with androgen 11 -ketoandrostenedione (11 KA), maintained under stimulatory (L 16 :D 8) or inhibitory (L 8 :D 16) photoperiods. In both sexes, red-sensitive opsin gene (lws) mRNA levels were higher in sexually mature than in immature fish. Under L 16 :D 8, lws mRNA levels were higher in intact than in castrated males, and were up-regulated by 11 KA treatment in castrated males. Moreover, electroretinogram data confirmed that sexual maturation resulted in higher <b>relative</b> red <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Mature males under L 16 :D 8 were more sensitive to red light than males under L 8 :D 16. Red light sensitivity under L 16 :D 8 was diminished by castration, but increased by 11 KA treatment.

40|$|Light is the {{principal}} cue that entrains the circadian timing system, but the threshold of entrainment and the relative contributions of the retinal photoreceptors—rods, cones and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells—are not known. We measured thresholds of entrainment of wheel-running rhythms at three wavelengths, and compared these to thresholds of two other non-image-forming visual system functions: masking and the pupillary light reflex (PLR). At the entrainment threshold, the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and absolute photon flux suggest that this threshold is determined by rods. Dim light that entrained mice failed to elicit either masking or PLR; in general, circadian entrainment is more sensitive by 1 – 2 log units than other measures of the non-image-forming visual system. Importantly, {{the results indicate that}} dim light can entrain circadian rhythms even when it fails to produce more easily measurable acute responses to light such as phase shifting and melatonin suppression. Photosensitivity to one response, therefore, cannot be generalized to other non-image-forming functions.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of prolonged periods of darkness on the responses of luminosity-type horizontal cells (L-HCs) in the freshwater cyprinid, Rutilus rutilus. Two groups of retinae were compared, those recorded after 10 min dark adaptation (SA) and those recorded after 3 h dark adaptation (LA). The results suggest that long-term light history does not modify the general responsiveness of the L-HCs in this species. However, there are apparent changes in the receptive field of the cells and modifications to the kinetics of the light-evoked response. The kinetics changes involve both a delay in the onset of light response and a selective effect on the hyperpolarizing light-ON response. Thus the mean time constant (tau) for the SA cells was 32. 4 +/- 2. 39 ms (n= 62), whilst that for the LA cells was 53. 4 +/- 3. 03 ms (n= 61). These effects occur in the absence of changes in the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> or threshold sensitivity of the HCs. The results suggest that in some vertebrate retinae, prolonged darkness (light-history) may regulate long-term plasticity in the kinetics of the cone-HC pathway...|$|E

We discuss approximations and limitations inherent in the present methodology, and we estimate their contributions to systematic photometric uncertainties. We propose an alternative conceptual scheme for the relative calibration of astronomical apparatus: the availability of calibrated detectors whose <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is known to better than one part in 10 3 opens up the possibility of in situ relative throughput measurements, normalized to a precision calibrated detector, using a stable but uncalibrated narrowband light source.

A fundamental unresolved {{problem is the}} great variation in color vision even among those classified as having the same color-vision defect. Several physiological hypotheses have been proposed to account for this variation but little consideration {{has been given to}} how (and how much) color matching and discrimination are affected by the posited physiological mechanisms. Advances in molecular genetics have renewed interest in this problem, which is at the foundation of the relation between genotype and phenotype. We report here theoretical Rayleigh ranges (chromatic discrimination) and quantal matches for deuteranomalous trichromats with photopigments in the red/green range that vary in their separation and optical density. The results show there is relatively little loss of discrimination with pigments of normal optical density separated by as little as 2 – 3 nm. With pigments separated by 4 nm or less, however, optical density can strongly influence discrimination when varied independently in the two types of cone. Moderately lower (or higher) optical density in only one cone-type affects discrimination by altering the shape of the cone's <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function.

Background: short wavelength stimuli in the light-adapted eye evoke small rounded b-waves which have been considered to be S-cone responses. We have recorded such responses from tritanopes, which called the assumptions into question. Methods: small ERGs were recorded to blue and green flashes. The stimulus was a Ganzfeld which employed light emitting diodes. ERGs were obtained in both the dark-adapted eye and after light adaptation to intense orange light (peak wavelength 610 nm). The change in sensitivity with light adaptation and the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was determined from the voltage/log light intensity functions, using a 10 μV criterion. Results: (1) peak times and changes in sensitivity did not help distinguish light-adapted rod from possible S-cone responses; (2) analysis {{of the change in}} the ratio of blue:green sensitivity from darkness to 4. 4 log Td. 610 nm background suggests that in seven normal subjects, 90 % or more of the ERG evoked by 440 nm flashes is generated by S-cones; (3) three tritanopes have insignificantly reduced S-cone responses.

CIE technical committee 1 - 36 (TC 1 - 36) was established for proposing chromaticity diagrams based on the best set of colour-matching functions and cone fundamentals available to date. Cone fundamental is the name given to the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of long-wave sensitive (L-), medium-wave sensitive (M-) and shortwave sensitive (Scones es. As explicated by Judd (1966), the cone fundamentals represent the spectral absorptances of the retinal photopigments included in cones multiplied by the spectral transmittances of the ocular media through which light passes to reach the retina. The CIE 2006 (Stockman and Sharpe, 2000; CIE, 2006) cone fundamentals are based on Stiles and Burch (1959) experimental colour matches and are validated by Physiology. A physiologically designed chromaticity diagram named the MacLeod-Boynton chromaticity diagram (MacLeod and Boynton, 1979) is proposed as well as a cone-fundamental-based (x F, y F) chromaticity diagram. All data are now fixed. Tables are available in the CIE publications (CIE, 2006; CIE in press). 1 Deriving the cone fundamentals The primary goal was to propose cone fundamentals that are securely grounded on colour-matching experiments with real observers and that would comply with Physiology. A comprehensive set of colour-matching data has been collected by Stiles and Burch (1959) from 49 colour normal observers. The colour matches were obtained at clearly photopic luminance levels, on 10 ° field, using spectral red, green and blue (RGB) primaries expressed in energy units. The Stiles-Burch colour matching data are recognised as the most secure experimental basis for founding cone fundamentals. Independently, a physiological approach has allowed Stockman and Sharpe (2000) to derive estimates of the cone spectral sensitivities for 2 ° viewing angle. Given the fact that dichromats lack one family of cone pigment, and that Scone responses can be cancelled by appropriate chromatic adaptation, these authors were able, using heterochromatic flicker photometry, to isolate and directly measure the Land M-cone spectral sensitivities. In parallel, the gene sequence associated with every L-cone photopigment was analysed in order to associate each spectral sensitivity with a known genotype. Such piece of information has enabled taking account of the incidence of two variants of the L-cones in the normal population. The Scone spectral sensitivities has been isolated in blue-cone monochromats and in chromatically adapted colour normal observers. Thus, at this stage, an intermediate step of calculation was introduced by Stockman and Sharpe (2000). In 1955, a small (interim) set of colour matches had been collected by Stiles (1955) on 2 ° field which could be compared with the well-characterized cone spectral sensitivities for 2 ° viewing angle. Provided the individual dichromatic data was adjusted in macular pigment and lens density, an appropriate linear fit between the data could be found, thus validating the spectral sensitivity for every cone family. To reinforce the colorimetric validity of the cone fundamentals, a linear transformation between the 10 ° cone spectral sensitivities and the 10 ° Stiles-Burch colour-matching functions had to be fixed...|$|E
40|$|Colour vision greatly {{enhances the}} discriminatory and {{cognitive}} capabilities of visual systems and {{is found in}} a great majority of vertebrates and many invertebrates. However, colour coding visual systems are confronted {{with the fact that}} the external stimuli are ambiguous because they are subject to constant variations of luminance and spectral composition. Furthermore, the transmittance of the ocular media, the spectral sensitivity of visual pigments and the ratio of spectral cone types are also variable. This results in a situation where there is no fixed relationship between a stimulus and a colour percept. Colour constancy has been identified as a powerful mechanism to deal with this set of problems; however, it is active only in a short-term time range. Changes covering longer periods of time require additional tuning mechanisms at the photoreceptor level or at postreceptoral stages of chromatic processing. We have used the trichromatic blue acara (Aequidens pulcher, Cichlidae) as a model system and studied retinal morphology and physiology, and visually evoked behaviour after rearing fish for 1 - 2 years under various conditions including near monochromatic lights (spectral deprivation) and two intensities of white light (controls). In general, long-term exposure to long wavelengths light had lesser effects than light of middle and short wavelengths. Within the cone photoreceptors, spectral deprivation did not change the absorption characteristics of the visual pigments. By contrast, the outer segment length of middle and long-wave-sensitive cones was markedly increased in the blue rearing group. Furthermore, in the same group, we observed a loss of 65 % short-wave-sensitive cones after 2 years. These changes may be interpreted as manifestations of compensatory mechanisms aimed at restoring the balance between the chromatic channels. At the horizontal cell level, the connectivity between short-wave-sensitive cones and the H 2 cone horizontal cells, and the spinule dynamics were both affected in the blue light group. This observation rules out the role of spinules as sites of chromatic feedback synapses. The light-evoked responses of H 2 horizontal cells were also sensitive to spectral deprivation showing a shift of the neutral point towards short wavelengths in the blue rearing group. Interestingly, we also found an intensity effect because in the group reared in bright white light the neutral point was more towards longer wavelength than in the dim light group. Like the changes in the cones, the reactions of horizontal cells to spectral deprivation in the long wave domain can be characterised as compensatory. We also tested the spectral sensitivity of the various experimental groups of blue acara in visually evoked behaviour using the optomotor response paradigm. In this case, the changes in the <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were more complex and could not be explained by a simple extrapolation of the adaptive and compensatory processes in the outer retina. We conclude that the inner retina, and/or the optic tectum are also involved and react to the changes of the spectral environment. In summary, we have shown a considerable developmental plasticity in the colour vision system of the blue acara, where epigenetic adaptive processes at various levels of the visual system respond to the specific spectral composition of the surroundings and provide a powerful mechanism to ensure functional colour vision in different visual environments. We suggest that processes involving an active fine-tuning of the photoreceptors and the postreceptoral processing of chromatic information during ontogenetic development are a general feature of all colour vision systems. Such mechanisms would establish a functional balance between the various chromatic channels. This appears to be an essential condition for the cognitive systems to extract the relevant and stable information from the unstable and changing stimulus situation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> {{of single}} Limulus median ocellus photoreceptors have been {{determined}} from records of receptor potentials obtained using intracellular microelectrodes. One class of receptors, called UV cells (ultraviolet cells), depolarizes to near-UV light and is maximally sensitive at 360 nm; a Dartnall template fits the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve. A second class of receptors, called visible cells, depolarizes to visible light; the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve is fit by a Dartnall template with km,x at 530 nm. Dark-adapted UV cells are about 2 log units {{more sensitive than}} dark-adapted visible cells. UV ceils respond with a small hyperpolarization to visible light and the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve for this hyperpolarization peaks at 525 - 550 nm. Visible cells respond with a small hyperpolarization to UV light, and the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve for this response peaks at 350 - 375 nm. Rarely, a double-peaked (360 and 530 nm) <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curve is obtained; two photopigments are involved, as revealed by chromatic adaptation experiments. Thus {{there may be a}} small third class of receptor cells containing two photopigments...|$|R
40|$|Stomatopods (mantis shrimps) possess one of {{the most}} complex eyes in the world with photoreceptors {{detecting}} up to 12 different colors. It is not yet understood why stomatopods have almost four times the number of spectral photoreceptors compared with most other animals. It has, however, been suggested that these seemingly redundant photoreceptors could encode color through a new mechanism. Here we compare the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> across five species of stomatopods within the superfamily Gonodactyloidea using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. The results show that the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> across species of stomatopods are remarkably similar apart from some variation in the long-wavelength receptors. We relate these results to <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> estimates previously obtained using microspectrophotometry and discuss the variation in the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maxima (λmax) of the long-wavelength receptors in regard to the previous findings that stomatopods are able to tune their <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> according to their respective light environment. We further discuss the similarities of the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> across species of stomatopods in regard to how color information might be processed by their visual systems...|$|R
