40|$|The {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide coenzymes [NAD(P) (H) ] {{are strong}} redox agents naturally present in wheat flour, and are indispensable cofactors in many redox reactions. Hence, it is not inconceivable that they affect gluten cross-linking during breadmaking. We investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of NAD(P) (H) on gluten cross-linking, dough properties, and bread volume using two flours <b>of</b> different <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b> Separate addition <b>of</b> the four nicotinamide coenzymes did not significantly affect mixograph properties. While addition of NAD(+) hardly affected bread volume, supplementation with NADP(H) and NADH significantly decreased loaf volumes of breads made using flour <b>of</b> high <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b> Wheat flour incubation with NAD(P) H under anaerobic conditions increased wheat flour thiol content. while NAD(P) (+) increased the extractability in SDS-containing medium of the protein <b>of</b> the strong <b>breadmaking</b> flour. Based on the results, {{it was hypothesized that}} at least three reactions, competing for NAD(P) (H), occur during breadmaking that determine the final effect on protein, dough, and loaf properties. Next to coenzyme hydrolysis, the experiments pointed to coenzyme oxidation and NAD(P) (H) dependent redox reactions affecting protein properties. status: publishe...|$|R

Gluten {{plays a key}} role within the solid phase of dough in the formation and the retention of gas bubbles during breadmaking. Rheological tests are usually performed to predict breadmaking potential. The aim here was to investigate the ability of ultrasound to discriminate wheat doughs based on <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities.</b> The ultimate goal is the development of an on-line quality control system currently unavailable in the baked goods industry, rendering this work innovative. Samples were prepared from a strong wheat flour, with one control sample and one added with inulin and distilled monoglycerides, producing doughs <b>of</b> distinct <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b> Doughs were subjected to density determination, elongation tests, and ultrasound analysis. The ultrasound tests were performed in the frequency range of 300 kHz- 6 MHz. Ultrasonic phase velocity increased with increasing frequency to about 2 MHz, becoming constant and then decreasing from 3 MHz for the control sample. Distinct differences in attenuation coefficient between the fibre-enriched and control doughs were observed. Ultrasound can potentially add {{to a better understanding of}} dough quality and can discriminate between doughs of contrasting properties...|$|R
40|$|Wheat grain high {{molecular}} weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are the major determinants of dough elasticity and viscosity, and thus <b>of</b> <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b> Most known HMW-GS genes in bread wheat have been already cloned except for very few such as 1 By 18 and 1 By 19. In this study, HMW-GS 1 By 18 gene was isolated from bread wheat for the first time. In the past, this subunit has been considered to have positive effect on gluten quality. Molecular characterization of the 1 By 18 subunit gene showed that its complete coding nucleotide sequence was 2163 bp long, being highly identical to 1 By 8, with only three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at sites 231, 233 and 1976 of the coding sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of 1 By 18 exhibited two substitutions compared to 1 By 8. The deduced protein was further verified by expression in E. coli and LC–MS/MS analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 1 By 18 was {{more closely related to}} 1 By 8, 1 By 9 and 1 By 16 than to 1 By 15 and 1 By 20. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Glu-B 1 i allele emerged after the formation of modern hexaploid wheat. Two sets of SNP-based AS-PCR markers for 1 By 18 gene were developed and validated on 110 bread wheat varieties with different Glu-Bly alleles, and five recombinant inbred lines. Both markers could effectively distinguish 1 By 18 from the other genes at the Glu-B 1 locus, thus making them valuable for marker-assisted selection in wheat quality improvement programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} stability <b>of</b> <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wheat flours i. e. {{the absence}} of fluctuation across environments and genotype X environment interactions {{is as important as}} their performance in milling and baking. Many statistical approaches have been used to assess cultivar stability parameters across environments. Quality stability parameters were studied using a set of eleven bread wheat cultivars and five hybrid wheats grown in France at eight locations in two consecutive years. Three different statistical variances: ecovalence Wi, environmental variance S-Xi(2) and genotypic stability were used to assess the stability of quality parameters measured on wheat kernels at harvest, on the technological properties of their flours and on the molecular weight distribution of total endosperm proteins extracted using 2 % SDS in phosphate buffer with sonication. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation coupled with a multi-angle laser light scattering photometer allowed the molar masses of polymeric glutenins to be measured without size limits. Marked variation in the quality parameters was observed due to genetic and environmental effects. The three stability values calculated for protein content were not significantly correlated to the stability of the polymeric fraction, the bread loaf volume (LV) or the bread quality score (BQS). The three stability values of LV and BQS were significantly correlated to the stability of the weight-average (w) molecular weight of the polymeric fraction. Multiple regressions showed that 60 - 84 % of the stability values of LV and BQS were explained by the stability of only few quality parameters among which the (M) w of polymers played the major role...|$|R

The picture was completed by dough mixing and extensional properties, flour protein size distribution determined by SE-HPLC, and high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) composition. The sample set comprised 20 wheat cultivars grown at two different levels of nitrogen fertilizer in one location. Flours yielding stiffer and more elastic glutens, with higher elastic and viscous moduli (G' and G") and lower tan 8 values in SAOS, gave doughs that were better able to retain their shape during proving and baking, resulting in breads of high form ratios. Creep recovery measurements after short application of stress showed that glutens from flours <b>of</b> good <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> had high relative elastic recovery. The nitrogen fertilizer level affected the protein size distribution by an increase in monomeric proteins (gliadins), which gave glutens of higher tan delta and flatter bread loaves (lower form ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of gas cell walls in bread doughs {{are considered to}} be important in relation to their stability and gas retention during proof and baking. Large deformation {{rheological properties}} of gas cell walls were measured using biaxial extension for a number of doughs <b>of</b> varying <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> at constant strain rate and elevated temperatures of 25 - 60 degreesC. Strain hardening and failure strain of cell walls both decreased with temperature, with cell walls in good breadmaking doughs remaining stable and retaining their strain hardening properties at higher temperatures (60 degreesC), while the cell walls <b>of</b> poor <b>breadmaking</b> doughs became unstable at lower temperatures (45 - 50 degreesC) and had lower strain hardening. Strain hardening measured at 50 degreesC gave good correlations with baking volume, with the best correlations achieved between rheological measurements and baking tests that used similar mixing conditions. As predicted by the considered failure criterion, a strain hardening value of I defines a region below which gas cell walls become unstable, and discriminates well between the baking quality of a range of commercial flour blends of varying quality. This indicates that the stability of gas cell walls during baking is strongly related to strain hardening properties, and that extensional rheological measurements can be used as indicators of baking quality...|$|R

Knowledge of the genetic structure {{and the level of}} H. chilense genetic diversity within its distribution zone may be important to decide on breeding strategies as well as management procedures. The pattern of genetic variation within and among different regions of the distribution area of H. chilense, was analysed by endosperm storage proteins (gliadin and low-molecularweight glutenin subunits). Several analyses were performed including AMOVA, direct correlation between phenotypic and geographic distance matrices and spatial genetics differentiation. Most genetic diversity was caused by differences among individuals within a population, although all the analyses performed suggest the existence of a low degree of differentiation within regions. Correlation values between phenotypic and geographic distances were low but significant. The spatial genetics analysis revealed that the average phenotypic distances of each of the spatial distance class were not lower (or higher) than that expected by chance. These results are explained by their neutral behaviour towards a selection of endosperm storage proteins and could be very useful in optimising future sample collecting strategies.

40|$|Wheat is {{extensively}} {{used for}} food, feed, seed and wet-milling. Wheat starch and {{vital wheat gluten}} isolated by wet-milling of wheat flour are utilized in numerous food and nonfood applications. Five commercial wet-milling processes, namely Martin, Batter, Alfa-Laval/Raisio, Hydrocyclone and High-Pressure Disintegration (HD), have been employed to co-produce wheat starch and vital gluten. Martin and Batter are the traditional processes, whereas Alfa-Laval/Raisio, Hydrocyclone and HD are the modern-day processes. In the traditional processes, separation of starch and gluten starts with a stiff dough or batter with optimally developed gluten and proceeds with kneading and/or screening to separate starch granules from gluten mass. In the modern-day processes, however, separation starts with a sheared flour-water or dough-water dispersion with partially developed gluten and proceeds with centrifugation to separate starch granules from gluten network. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the pasting properties <b>of</b> starches and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> vital glutens isolated from RBS- 98 wheat flour by three different laboratory wet-milling methods, namely highly sheared flour-water dispersion (HS-FWD), moderately sheared dough-water dispersion (MS-DWD) and dough-washing (Martin), which respectively represent the commercial wet-milling processes of HD, Hydrocyclone and Martin. Three wet-milling methods were found to be somewhat comparable in many respects, yet they differed in certain wet-milling parameters. Damaged starch levels and RVA pasting properties of A-starch fractions isolated by all three wet-milling methods were quite similar, indicating that starch was neither mechanically damaged nor physico-chemically altered during shear treatment of HS-FWD or MS-DWD methods. Similarly, <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> vital glutens isolated by all wet-milling methods did not fluctuate extensively, suggesting that gluten proteins were not damaged nor altered during shear treatment of HS-FWD or MS-DWD methods.

40|$|Molecular {{size and}} {{structure}} of the gluten polymers that make up the major structural components of wheat are related to their rheological properties via modem polymer rheology concepts. Interactions between polymer chain entanglements and branching are seen to be the key mechanisms determining the rheology of HMW polymers. Recent work confirms the observation that dynamic shear plateau modulus is essentially independent of variations in MW amongst wheat varieties of varying baking performance and is not related to variations in baking performance, and {{that it is not the}} size of the soluble glutenin polymers, but the structural and rheological properties of the insoluble polymer fraction that are mainly responsible for variations in baking performance. The rheological properties of gas cell walls in bread doughs are considered to be important in relation to their stability and gas retention during proof and baking, in particular their extensional strain hardening properties. Large deformation rheological properties of gas cell walls were measured using biaxial extension for a number of doughs <b>of</b> varying <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> at constant strain rate and elevated temperatures in the range 25 - 60 degrees C.

Strain hardening measured at 50 degrees C gave good correlations with baking volume, with the best correlations achieved between those rheological measurements and baking tests which used similar mixing conditions. As predicted by the Considere failure criterion, a strain hardening value of I defines a region below which gas cell walls become unstable, and discriminates well between the baking quality of a range of commercial flour blends of varying quality. This indicates that the stability of gas cell walls during baking is strongly related to their strain hardening properties, and that extensional rheological measurements can be used as predictors of baking quality.

The Sudanese cultivars (Elneelain, Debaira, and Wadi Elneel) were compared with an Australian bread wheat cultivar. Baking test, farinograph characteristics, sedimentation value, gluten and gluten index were determined in wheat flours of 68 % extraction rate. Wadi Elneel cultivar showed a better <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> than Elneelain and Debaira. Samples of whole wheat flours from the three Sudanese wheat cultivars and the Australian wheat were fractionated by a modified Osborne fractionation procedure into five solubility fractions: (i) the water-soluble albumins, (ii) the salt-soluble globulins, (iii) the aqueous alcohol-soluble gliadins, (iv) the acetic acid-soluble glutenins, and (v) the residue-glutenin fraction. The residue glutenin, calculated on flour basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with total protein, wet gluten, dry gluten, sedimentation value, gluten index and specific loaf volume. The residue glutenin, on total protein basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with total protein, gluten index and specific loaf volume.

40|$|There {{is still}} {{considerable}} {{debate in the}} literature about the respective roles of starch and gluten in both the linear and non-linear rheology of wheat flour dough. Hence, to elucidate the individual contributions of gluten and starch to the overall dough behaviour, the rheological properties of dough and mixtures of different gluten-starch ratios were studied systematically in shear and extension, {{by means of an}} adequate rheological toolbox consisting of linear small amplitude oscillatory shear tests and non-linear tests such as creep-recovery in shear and uniaxial extension. The starch component plays a pivotal role in linear dough rheology. With increasing starch content, the linearity limit observed in oscillatory shear tests decreases as a power-law function. Starch also clearly affects the extensional viscosity at small strains. Consequently, in the linear region differences between different gluten systems may become obscured by the presence <b>of</b> starch. As <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities</b> are known to be intrinsically linked to the gluten network, it is imperative to probe the non-linear behaviour of dough in order to expose differences in flour quality. The quality differences between a strong and a weak flour type were revealed most clearly {{in the value of the}} strain-hardening index in uniaxial extension and the total recovery compliance in non-linear creep-recovery tests. Notwithstanding its earlier successful application to pure gluten gels, the accuracy of the critical gel model in predicting the linear rheological properties of dough was found to be limited, due to dough having a small linearity limit and a finite longest relaxation time...|$|R

SDS-sedimentation value {{was used as an}} indirect criterion for <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b>  Correlation coefficients revealed a closer relationship between low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits and variation in SDS-sedimentation value. Principal component analysis confirmed the presence of association between some of the glutenin subunits and SDS-sedimentation value.

On the basis {{of the results of the}} stepwise regression analysis, a discriminant function was developed. The great efficiency of discriminant function in correct classification of completely different genotypes (Iranian landraces and cultivars) showed that the observed relationship between glutenin subunits and SDS-sedimentation value has a genetic basis and the effects of LMW and HMW glutenin subunits on SDS-sedimentation value are additive. Therefore, it seems that this method based on more protein components (rather than only on HMW glutenin subunits) can be used to predict <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wheat against many genetic backgrounds...|$|R

Grain crude protein concentration (CP) and Hagberg falling number (HFN) were significantly reduced once following Septoria tritici control, and HFN alone was reduced a second time following powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) control. Despite reductions in CP and/or HFN, overall loaf quality was improved by fungicide application. Fungicide application increased the rate of grain filling rather than its duration and delayed grain drying.

In the glasshouse experiment the fungicide controlled powdery mildew and significantly increased CP. It was concluded that recommendations on fungicide use, based on obtaining an economic yield response, do not need to be altered to take effects on <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> into account.

40|$|French organic {{farmers are}} asked to {{increase}} Grain Protein Content (GPC) of organic winter wheat to guarantee the <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> required from millers. Facing with the recent depletion of organic products, farmers also need to stabilize and increase the yield performance. The aim of our study {{is to give the}} explanations of the yield and GPC variability generally observed in organic production. A diagnostic method will be implemented on a network of ca. 10 fields per year during two crop years added with previous field network (77 fields) and experi-ments (4 experiments on cultivars). We will under-stand yield and GPC performance from environmental and agronomic conditions and relate the observed limiting factors with crop management, climatic con-ditions and characteristics of the cropping systems...|$|R

The SDS-SV initially increased {{as a function of}} heating time when dry gluten was heated at 80 degrees C. However, after reaching a maximum value, further heat treatment resulted in decreased SDS-SV. The heat-induced changes in the gluten occurred more rapidly with increasing heating temperature. Farinograph and Mixograph rheological properties and <b>breadmaking</b> performance <b>of</b> mixtures of a standard flour (96. 0 %) and heat-treated (80 degrees C) gluten (4. 0 %) were evaluated as a function of heating times leading to higher SDS-SV values. Although Farinograms, Mixograms and SDS-SV measurements suggested important changes when dry gluten was heated at 80 degrees C; none of these changes affected <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> in a straight-dough breadmaking test.

40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of naturally occurring zeolite and diatomaceous earth, as inert dusts approved for insect pest control in certified organic crop production, on trading and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> treated wheat. The treatments significantly reduced the trading quality of wheat which was reflected through lowering of test weight. This effect was more marked in the case of low-vitreous wheat rather than in high-vitreous one. Investigation of rheological properties of flours made from the treated wheat demonstrated that treatments with natural zeolite and diatomaceous earth at all applied doses significantly increased the water absorption, which consequently increased the bread yield. However, these changes in the flour properties were not high enough to modify the quality attributes of bread as was shown by instrumentally measuring crumb hardness and springiness as well as sensory evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} regarding the influ-ence of N and P 2 O 5 fertilization of winter wheat, cult i-vated in rotation with soybean and maize, in stationary long-term experiments under dry-land conditions at A. R. S. Turda. Crude protein content, protein yield, wet gluten, dry gluten and Pelshenke index are positively {{influenced by the}} applied nitrogen quantity. The maxi-mum values of these indices were obtained by the appli-cation of 120 kg N/ha {{in the case of}} wheat-soybean rota-tion and 160 kg N/ha in the case of wheat-maize rotation, on a common basal dressing of 80 kg P 2 O 5 /ha. Phospho-rus had a little influence on the analysed indices, its positive effect taking place only when this nutritive ele-ment was applied together with nitrogen. From among the wheat preceding crops (soybean and maize) soybean proved to be the most suitable. Key words: <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality,</b> nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer...|$|R

Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for nobility. Breads enriched with eggs, butter, and sugar or honey were served in the palaces and were known as [...] "royal bread" [...] or [...] "golden bread".|$|R

30|$|Drought stress {{research}} {{is always an}} important aspect for the resistance and quality study of wheat. To struggle with drought, many proteins in grains were involved in this stress resistance process. Among them, antioxidant enzymes were the common proteins. The contents of the common ROS-detoxifying enzymes, for instance peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, were generally upregulated under water deficit (Ge et al. 2012). In the previous work, the protease inhibitors such as alpha-amylase inhibitors and serpins were found induced by drought stress in grains (Jiang et al. 2012). As for the experimental material, CS substitution line CS- 1 Sl(1 B) is an achievement of chromosomal engineering, that showed {{to be a better}} <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> according to the previous work (Wang et al. 2013). However, the gene resources for drought resistance in 1 Sl genome have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the specifically encoded proteins of the 1 Sl chromosome and their responses to drought stress.|$|R
