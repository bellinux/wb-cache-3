Using such languages may thus be helpful to mitigate this issue. However, in some such languages, situations are still possible where an integer overflow can occur. An example is explicit optimization of a code path which is considered a bottleneck by the profiler. In the case of Common Lisp, this is possible by using an explicit declaration to type-annotate a variable to a machine-size word (fixnum) and lower the type safety level to zero for a particular code block.|$|E

In this paper, we address a more general placement constraint called <b>range</b> <b>constraint,</b> in which a module must be placed within a given rectangular region in the floorplan. This is a more general formulation because any pre-placed constraint can be written as a <b>range</b> <b>constraint.</b> We extend the Wong-Liu algorithm [11] to handle <b>range</b> <b>constraint.</b> Our main contribution is a novel shape curve computation which takes <b>range</b> <b>constraint</b> into consideration.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an asymptotic {{theory for}} integrated and near-integrated time series whose range is constrained in some ways. Such a framework arises when integration and cointegration analysis {{are applied to}} persistent series which are bounded either by construction or because {{they are subject to}} control. The asymptotic properties of some commonly used integration tests are discussed; the bounded unit root distribution is introduced to describe the limiting distribution of the first-order autoregressive coefficient of a random walk under <b>range</b> <b>constraints.</b> The theoretical results show that the presence of such constraints can lead to drastically different asymptotics. Since deviations from the standard unit root theory are measured through noncentrality parameters, simple measures of the impact of <b>range</b> <b>constraints</b> on the asymptotic distributions are obtained.

40|$|Point cloud {{filtering}} is {{an essential}} preprocessing step in 3 D (three-dimensional) LiDAR (light detection and ranging) point cloud processing. The filtering of mobile LiDAR scanning point clouds is much more challenging due to their non-uniform distribution, the large-scale of missing data areas {{and the existence of}} both large size objects and small land features. This paper proposes a new filtering method that combines <b>range</b> <b>constraint,</b> slope constraint and angular position constraint to filter ground surface points from mobile LiDAR point clouds. Firstly, a cylindrical coordinate system (CCS) is established for each block of mobile LiDAR point clouds and three attributes of mobile LiDAR points, i. e., the angular position attribute (AA), longitudinal distance attribute (LA) and range attribute (RA), are computed. Then, the mobile LiDAR point clouds are structured into a grid according to the AA and LA. Finally, the point clouds are filtered by a single cross-section filter (SCSF) using <b>range</b> <b>constraint</b> and slope constraint, followed by a multiple cross-section filter (MCSF) using <b>range</b> <b>constraint</b> and angular position constraint. Five datasets are used to validate the proposed method.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} the sensor selection problem {{which is a}} very important issue where many sensors are available to track a target. In this problem, we need to select an appropriate group of sensors at each time to perform tracking in a wireless sensor network (WSN). As the theoretical tracking performance is bounded by posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB), it is used as a criterion to select sensors. Based on the PCRLB, sensor selection algorithms with and without sensing <b>range</b> <b>constraint</b> are developed. Without sensing range limit, exhaustive enumeration is first adopted to search all possible combinations for sensor selection. To reduce complexity of enumeration, second, we restrict the selected sensors to be within a fixed area in the WSN. With sensing <b>range</b> <b>constraint,</b> a circle will be drawn with the help of communication range for sensor selection. In a similar manner, two approaches, namely, selecting all sensors inside the circle or using enumeration to select sensors within the circle are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated by computer simulation results in target tracking for WSNs. 1...|$|E

40|$|Image deconvolution, {{also known}} as image restoration, is {{concerned}} with the estimation of an uncorrupted image from a noisy, degraded one. The degradation of this image may be caused by defects of optical lenses, nonlinearity of the electro-optical sensor, relative motion between an object and camera, wrong focus, etc. By assuming a degradation model, one can formulate and develop a restoration algorithm. In this thesis, the developed algorithms are iterative deconvolution methods based on noise moment and pixel <b>range</b> <b>constraints.</b> The moments were used to ensure that noise associated with the deconvolution solution satisfies predetermined statistics. The pixel <b>range</b> <b>constraints</b> were also used to ensure the solution is within predetermined pixel value bounds. This addresses the critical issue of noise amplification at those frequencies where the point-spread function (the blurring function) contains frequency nulls. The solution’s dependence on the number of moments is examined and the performance of the deconvolution approach is compared with existing and well established deconvolution methods such as Wiener filtering and inverse filtering...|$|R
