Designing the investment mechanisms, {{the government has to}} take account of stepwise investment and asymmetric information of the network owners' willingness to pay for a capacity increase. We show that investment mechanisms allocating capacity based on the principle of Vickrey's second-price auction combined with <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> equal to marginal costs would be preferable.

Historically, access rights to entry capacity on the British gas network were granted by the monopoly network owner via negotiation; rights were later based on <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> with an increasing reliance on market based constraint resolution by the system operator. In 1999 an auction mechanism for allocating rights was introduced. Comparing the different allocation methods we conclude that where there is competition at entry terminals auctions have been successful with respect to anticipating spot prices, capturing producer rents and reducing the costs of alleviating network constraints. Moreover, auctions are more transparent and better facilitate entry. gas, network, access, auction, regulation...|$|E

30|$|The {{regulatory}} framework defines the cost at which electricity can be offered by prosumers for {{trading on the}} LEM. It is highest when using the public grid, as the entirety of <b>regulated</b> German <b>tariff</b> components has to be paid {{in addition to an}} opportunity cost from a lost feed-in tariff. Prosumers in Germany are currently guaranteed a specific feed-in tariff cF for RES feed-in into the public grid. Thus, this opportunity cost with the addition of taxes, fees and levies stipulates the lower cost bound for selling RES generation on the LEM. In a physical microgrid certain <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> components do not apply. This decreases the possible offer price and opens up a trading window as compared to the national reference tariff of the public grid. With the third case of a favorable {{regulatory framework}} for LEM trading, we study the impact of omitting the renewable surcharge in a LEM. A detailed overview {{of the impact of the}} regulatory framework on possible bid prices is given by Table  1. In a public grid, trading on the LEM would only be possible above the reference tariff. As we only consider LEM trading between the feed-in <b>tariff</b> plus <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> components and the reference tariff, trading will not be economic and is thus not applied in our simulation. However, both the microgrid and favorable regulation scenario offer a trading window between the considered lower and upper LEM price bounds.|$|R

However, due to the deep economic and financial crisis of the last years, a change in the energy paradigm is taking place increasing the perceived risk factors for RES electricity producers. Therefore, this paper focus on identifying and assessing the impact of those risks associated with an investment in a small hydropower (SHP). Although the independent analysis of each risk variable showed that the project is worthwhile, the possibility of having a negative outcome was evident for the investment costs, discount rate and feed-in-tariffs variables. On the other hand, the results of the combined analysis are much less optimistic demonstrating that even under <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> the probability of having a negative NPV largely surpasses the probability of obtaining a positive value...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to apply the {{mechanism}} of cross-differentiated electricity tariffication to the existing system of <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> {{in accordance with the}} structure chain of ?prices-tariffs-contracts?. With this purpose methods of regulated pricing are divided into three groups of methods which are one way or another orientated towards the processes of electricity supply or electricity consumption according to their mechanism of regulated prices (tariffs) calculation. It is shown that cross-differentiated tariffication makes use of system approach to form electricity tariffs and that is more powerful mechanism than discriminatory pricing. Correspondence between electricity tariffs and possible indications of differentiation has been analyzed. The mechanism of cross-differentiated tariffication has been illustrated. As a result in the existing system of electricity tariffs integrated and differentiated by time, subsystems of one-part and multipart tariffs have been formed as well as subsystems of one-component and multicomponent tariffs. Connections between the formed tariffs subsystems are established. Correspondence between the formed electricity tariffs subsystems and contracts using for electricity supply is shown (forward, call option, put option). ????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????-??????-??????????. ? ???? ????? ?????? ????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???

40|$|Beyond the {{different}} approaches to set regulated prices {{for the use of}} infrastructure, a key parameter to determine <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> is the concept of asset life and how it changes with changes in the economic and regulatory context, which determines the optimal infrastructure investment and replacement policies.

We find that as the electric industry becomes more competitive, a negative effect on the economic service life of electric electricity transmission should be expected. Also, numerical experiments illustrate an inverse relation between scale economies on investment and the ESL of electricity transmission infrastructure. Further, we look at the biases on optimal investment that happen when optimal plans do not observe the life cycle of the investments and the ESL of the equipment, as well as the inconsistency and biases on optimal investment and replacement policies that might result when the Social Planner optimal investment plan lacks of a long-term commitment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the Spanish electricity industry and its current regulatory regime. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} description and discussion of market design issues (including stranded cost recovery), the evolution of market structure, investment in generation capacity and network activities. We also provide a critical assessment of the 1997 regulatory reform, which did not succeed in introducing effective competition, but retained an opaque regulation which has been subject to continuous governmental interventionism. Furthermore, the implementation of the Kyoto agreement could show the lack of robustness of the regulatory regime. Competition is good for society because it increases efficiency and it is good for consumers because they benefit from efficiency gains through price cuts. This general principle could well have applied to the Spanish electricity industry, if only effective competition had been introduced. In 1997, the Spanish regulatory authorities reached an agreement with the electricity companies to reform the industry, 1 starting on January 1998. The main innovation introduced by the new regulatory regime was the reliance on a spot market (dominated by two large producers) as a way to allocate production and determine wholesale prices. Nevertheless, the industry remained heavily regulated in ways that made the wholesale market unable to transmit efficiency signals. Regardless of market prices, what consumers end up paying and firms receiving is ultimately determined by <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs,</b> set by the government on a multi-year basis. Hence, contrary to the authorities ’ claims, the reduction in retail prices since the 1997 reform (a 16. 6 % in nominal terms, and a 35. 6 % in real terms) does not prove its success. 2 Rather, we argue that the retail price decrease hides the lack of a real reform. 1 Protocolo para el Establecimiento de una Nueva Regulación del Sistema Eléctrico Nacional, December 1996; (text, in Spanish, available a...|$|E

The market participants considered by the model are pipeline operators, producers, storage operators, peak gas operators, marketers and consumers. Pipeline operators are described with <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> but also involve "congestion pricing" as a mechanism to allocate scarce pipeline capacity. Marketers are modeled as Nash-Cournot players in sales to the residential and commercial sectors but price-takers in all other aspects. Consumers are represented by demand functions in the marketers' problem. Producers, storage operators and peak gas operators are price-takers consistent with perfect competition. Also, two types of the natural gas markets are included: the long-term and spot markets. Market participants make both high-level planning decisions (first-stage decisions) in the long-term market and daily operational decisions (recourse decisions) in the spot market subject to their engineering, resource and political constraints as well as market constraints on both the demand and the supply side, so as to simultaneously maximize their expected profits given others' decisions. The model is shown to be an instance of a mixed complementarity problem (MiCP) under minor conditions. The MiCP formulation is derived from applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of the optimization problems faced by the market participants. Some theoretical results regarding the market prices in both markets are shown. We also illustrate the model on a representative, sample network of two production nodes, two consumption nodes with discretely distributed end-user demand and three seasons using four cases...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} American model is not suitable for Europe, yet North America is the only large and working competitive gas market in the world. The paper shows how its model could be adapted as a target for market design within the European institutional framework. It starts from analysis of the main peculiar economic features of the gas transportation industry, which should underpin any efficient model. After the Third Package is properly implemented the EU will share several building blocks of the American model: effective unbundling of transportation and supply; <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> which, for long distance transportation, are in fact largely related to capacity and distance; investments based mostly on industry’s initiative and resources, and the related decisions are increasingly made after open and public processes. Yet Europe needs to harmonize tariff regulation criteria, which could be achieved through a monitoring process. National separation of main investment decisions should be overcome, possibly by organising a common platform where market forces and public authorities interact with private suppliers to require existing and develop new capacity, whereas industry competitively offers its solutions. Such platform would allow for long term capacity reservation, subject to caps and congestion management provisions. Auctions and possibly market coupling would {{play an important role}} in the allocation of short term capacity but a limited one in long term. Market architecture and the organisation of hubs would also be developed mostly by market forces under regulatory oversight. The continental nature of the market suggests a likely concentration of trading in a very limited number of main markets, whereas minor markets would have a limited role and would be connected to major ones, with price differences reflecting transportation costs and market conditions. Excessive interference or pursuit of political goals in less than transparent ways involves the risk of slower liquidity development and higher market fragmentation. With this view as a background, regulatory work aimed at completing the European market should be based on ensuring the viability of interconnections between current markets and on the establishment of common platforms and co-ordinated tariff systems, fostering the conditions for upstream and transportation capacity development.
