5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only thing is that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the <b>revamping.</b> On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} <b>REVAMP,</b> a mixed-initiative tool for real-time management of paratransit vehicle schedules. Like many applications, paratransit scheduling is a dynamic, execution-driven process, where unexpected events (e. g., traffic, breakdowns, new requests, cancelations) continually force changes to precomputed schedules. The design of RE-VAMP aims at {{support for this}} dynamic, real-time scheduling process. Real-time information on the status and location of vehicles and pending trips is used by <b>REVAMP</b> to maintain a “live ” schedule and provide the coordinating Dispatcher with early visibility of potential delays. In response to detected problems or opportunities, <b>REVAMP</b> {{can be used to}} generate options for rearranging vehicle schedules to achieve better quality of service. <b>REVAMP</b> is being developed to support daily operations at ACCESS transportation systems, which provides an advance reservation, shared ride paratransit ser-vice for the greater Pittsburgh area in southwestern Pennsyl-vania. We are currently integrating <b>REVAMP</b> into the existing technology base used to support daily operations by one of ACCESS’s service providers for an initial pilot test.
