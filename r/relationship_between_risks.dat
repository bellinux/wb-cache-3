This study uses both expect value questions and the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure subjects’ risk propensity and uses various scenarios to investigate subjects’ general trust. And by these results we discuss about the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risk</b> propensity and general trust. The results show (1) there is significant correlation <b>between</b> explicit <b>risk</b> propensity and general trust in the scenarios of borrowing money (Eckel &Wilson， 2003) and PD/R game (Yamagishi, 2005), (2) there is significant correlation <b>between</b> implicit <b>risk</b> propensity and general trust in the scenario of borrowing money, (3) there are {{significant differences between the}} rating of different trust scenarios regarding to trust and risk.

After defining the two concepts, it analyses how risks influence the functioning of markets, {{by means of the}} theory elaborated by Knight (1921). The Knightian focus on the role of judgments in risks analysis implies that the concept of rationality has to be enlarged beyond the rational choice theory. Similarly, markets cannot be defined anymore as simply an equilibrium between supply and demand: they are a special type of institution. Therefore, the analysis centres on how people make decisions and apprehend risks in relation to market structures. In the rest of the paper, two of the most prominent food safety crises in recent years are analysed based on this conceptual framework: the milk powder crisis in China (2008) and the sanitary crisis following the Fukushima nuclear accident (2011).

This is important {{in view of the}} projected spectacular rise of ionizing imaging tests in next years; yet their explosive growth in performance is challenging to be interpreted as it may represent an added value when appropriate, and an added cost when inappropriate or overused. In order to define this, over the past thirty years researchers have conducted several studies to examine the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks</b> and perceived usefulness, attitudes, and the usage of ionizing examinations, embracing the risk-benefit relation as a suggested policy for improving health services. However, until relatively recently, little had been done on these issues, and even now, both patients and physicians generally ignore the potential harmful effects of the inappropriate use of diagnostic medical procedures. So, the aim of this review is to discover, basing on the literature, why inappropriateness is still so high and to show that many of the difficulties faced by National Health Services in the reduction of inappropriateness are caused by a lack of awareness of, and training in, communication strategies...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by what we perceive to be important gaps {{in the literature on}} climate change: lack of attention to how risks associated with climate change might affect households; inconsistent use of key terms such as risk, vulnerability, and adaptation; and lack of clarity on the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks</b> associated with climate change, adaptation, and vulnerability. These factors limit the ability to effectively formulate adaptation strategies aimed at reducing human vulnerability. Risks associated with climate changes could increase household vulnerability to poverty, hunger, disease, mortality, displacement, and violent conflict in many developing countries. Threats to household well-being stem from both the direct risks (changes in climate variables) and the indirect risks (e. g., increased prevalence of pests and diseases; degradation of natural resources; food price and employment risks; displacement; potential conflicts) associated with climate change. Many interventions, however, tend to focus on direct risks and direct impacts with insufficient attention to indirect risks and to impacts on households.

We provide an operational framework to address risk and uncertainty by an integrated approach that can be easily understood by third parties and applied to different property types.

40|$|The milk {{price from}} a {{cooperative}} institution to farmer {{does not fully}} cover the production cost. Though, dairy farmers encounter various risks and uncertainties in conducting their business. The highest risk in milk supply lies in the activities at the farm. This {{study was designed to}} formulate a model for calculating milk price at farmer’s level based on risk. Risks that occur on farms include the risk of cow breeding, sanitation, health care, cattle feed management, milking and milk sales. This research used the location of the farm in West Java region. There were five main stages in the preparation of this model, (1) identification and analysis of influential factors, (2) development of a conceptual model, (3) structural analysis and the amount of production costs, (4) model calculation of production cost with risk factors, and (5) risk based milk pricing model. This research built a <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks</b> on smallholder dairy farms with the production costs to be incurred by the farmers. It was also obtained the formulation of risk adjustment factor calculation for the variable costs of production in dairy cattle farm. The difference in production costs with risk and the total production cost without risk was about 8 % to 10 %. It could be concluded that the basic price of milk proposed based on the research was around IDR 4, 250 -IDR 4, 350 /L for 3 to 4 cows ownership. Increasing farmer income was expected to be obtained by entering the value of this risk in the calculation of production costs.  </p...|$|E

However, construction projects are perceived to have more inherent risks due to the involvement of many contracting parties such as owners, designers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. Construction projects are unique and built only once. During the bidding stage contractor is facing {{a greater risk of}} having mistakes in pricing Bill of quantities and preparing project schedule, due to lack of details about site, client, construction drawings, etc. It is a tiresome exercise for the Quantity surveyors to accurately price a bill of quantities which normally comprises over two hundred measured work items. Contractor’s risk exposure to have errors (mistakes) commences with the receipt of tender and in order to arrive at a commercially viable and competitive tender price, the tenders often adopt rule of thumb and various guesswork within the restricted time frame available for submission of duly completed tender. This research discusses about the risk areas in the construction industry and what are the errors happened to contractors and their importance and contribution in a dispute case. Also it discuss what are the procedures to be followed to minimize disputes. To collect data, an industry – wide survey was undertaken covering roads and building projects.

The existence of a well-functioning capital market allows investors with different time patterns of income and desired consumption to agree on whether real estate investment projects should be undertaken. In order to estimate discount rates for real estate assets, firstly we {{need to know how to}} measure risks and identify the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks</b> borne and risk premiums demanded by investors. Risk affects investments and cannot be fully eliminated. Increases in both idiosyncratic and systematic risk lead developers to delay new real estate investments because they feel not confident in the estimated values and the assessment of the project’s riskiness. Investors have to determine how much risk they can tolerate, the return they need and its timing. Aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework to address risk and uncertainty in real estate investment valuation procedures. The paper proposes a model for risks assessment that will help to evaluate risks and opportunities of real estate assets and investments taking into consideration different aspects of the project and related risks (market risk, valuation risk, market growth risk, operating risk, etc.). Real estate development is in fact a multiphase process involving land development, followed by residential and/or commercial development, ending with the eventual marketing phase of the development through the sale or leasing of the completed site. While all three phases of the housing industry are interrelated, each stage involves various risks which are differently allocated between landowners, land developers, and the homebuilders. More rigorous risk assessment measures within the property investment industry are here designed to operate initially at the level of the individual asset and then extended to the framework drawn from conventional theory which operates primarily at the portfolio level...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a risk-driven investment process model for analysing human factors that allows information security managers to capture possible risk– investment relationships and to reason about them. The overall success of an information security system depends on analysis of the risks and threats so that appropriate protection mechanism can be in place to protect them. However, lack of appropriate analysis of risks may potentially results in failure of information security systems. Existing literature does not provide adequate guidelines for a systematic process or an appropriate modelling language to support such analysis. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing the process and reason about the risks considering human factors. Design/methodology/approach – To develop risk-driven investment model along with the activities that support the process. These objectives were achieved through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data utilising requirements engineering and secure tropos methods. Findings – The proposed process and model lead to define a clear <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks,</b> incidents and investment and allows organisations to calculate them based on their own figures. Research limitations/implications – One of the major limitations of this model is that it only supports incident-based investment. This creates some sort of difficulties to be presented to the executive board. Secondly, because of the nature of human factors, quantification does not exactly reflect the monetary value of the factors. Practical implications – Applying the information security risk-driven investment model in a real case study shows that this can help organisations apply and use it in other incidents, and more importantly, to the incidents which critical human factors are a grave concern of organisations. The importance of providing a financial justification is clearly highlighted and provided for seeking investment in information security. Social implications – It has a big social impact that technically could lead for cost justifications and decision-making process. This would impact the whole society by helping individuals to keep their data safe. Originality/value – The novel contribution of this work is to analyse specific critical human factors which have subjective natures in an objective and dynamic domain of risk, security and investment...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how risks and costs can be reduced when working with {{incoterms}} in purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region. To fulfil this purpose, the following two research questions have been developed: 1. How does the case company currently work with incoterms when purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region? 2. How can risks and costs be reduced when working with incoterms when purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region? Method - Theories relevant for the study's purpose were collected through a literature study. To apply the theoretical framework to empirical data, a case study was conducted at a company. The empirical data was gathered through interviews and document studies. Findings - Use of the standard Incoterms 2010 is considered to be a good tool for reducing risks and costs when purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region, where risk management is a necessary complement. It is required that all employees working with incoterms have the right knowledge about the incoterms in order to use them correctly. The knowledge can be disseminated through the organisation by using knowledge management. It is also considered important to understand the differences between countries, in order to reduce the risk of misunderstanding. Contributions - The result of the study facilitates for companies who do not know how to work correctly with incoterms. The study contributes to decreasing the gap in theory regarding working with incoterms in the APAC region. It also facilitates for companies who do not know how to disseminate knowledge internally. Limitations - The case study was conducted at a company based in Thailand, which limited the ability to communicate, due to linguistic differences. Future research - It would be of interest to conduct an empirical study at other case companies of different sizes within the APAC region and in other trade regions. In addition, it would be interesting to study how internal courses about working with incoterms can be implemented in different types of organisations.

Violence against children in homes has been banned in Sweden for more than 30 years {{but it is still}} a considerable problem in the society and a threat to public health. The overall aim of this thesis was to create comprehensive knowledge of the phenomenon Child Physical Abuse (CPA) in Sweden after the ban on corporal punishment. The focus has been on examining the characteristics of cases reported to the police as well as self-reported CPA, prevalence of CPA and finally associations between CPA and health-problems/risk-taking behaviors among adolescents. Two samples are used in this thesis. The first comprises cases reported to the police during 11 years (n= 142) in a Swedish police-district and the second is a population-based youth survey {{of the total number of}} pupils in three different school grades (13, 15 and 17 years old) in Södermanland County, Sweden. Cases of severe abuse constituted 14 % of the total number of cases reported to the police. The main difference between the group of severe cases and the remaining was the higher occurrence of convictions in court in the severe cases and the pattern of reporting to the police. The severe cases were reported by agencies to a greater degree than minor cases. Cases of severe abuse were characterized by an accumulation of risk factors in different areas as perpetrator factors, stress- and strain factors, factors of insufficient social network and finally child-related factors. In the cross-sectional study a prevalence of 15 % was found for self-reported CPA (n= 8 494). There were associations between risk factors in different areas and abuse and there was a dos-response <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks</b> and reported abuse. It was shown that children who reported parental intimate-partner violence were at considerably higher risk for CPA than other children and that only 7 % of the children exposed to violence had disclosed this to authorities. The study of associations between health and risk-taking behaviors, were performed among the 15 and 17 years old pupils (n= 5 933). Associations with health-problems and risk-taking behaviors were shown and the associations became stronger when the pupils reported repeated abuse. Finally there was a cumulative effect of multiple abuse in the form of being exposed to child physical abuse plus other types of abuse (parental intimate partner violence, bullying and being forced to engage in sexual acts) and the associations increased with the number of concurrent abuse...|$|E
40|$|Consumers are now {{faced with}} more food choices 'than ever and are {{increasingly}} {{concerned with the}} risks associated with food and issues of healthy eating. This study investigated the consumer's risk benefit decisionmaking process, with respect to the' nutritional aspects of food choice. To achieve this aim, a four phase mixed methodological approach was adopted. The purpose of Phase One was to select three generic food produ~ts, with different perceived levels of nutritional quality, to be used as the basis of this research. In order to do this a survey approach was adopted to measure respondents' estimation and evaluation of risks and benefits associated with 18 generic foods. Twenty seven nutritional experts and 80 food consumers completed the survey. No significant differences were detected between expert and lay person estimations of risk and benefit. Subsequently, three of these foods (milk, bread and beefburgers) were selected to be used in Phase Two of the research. This phase utilised two focus groups and eight semistructured interviews to determine the most important nutritional attributes and levels associated with each of the foods. Using the attributes and levels selected a conjoint experiment was designed to be used in Phase Three of the research. The aim of this phase was to examine the nutritional trade-offs that occur during the consumers decision-making process. Information was also collected, during this phase, on consumer risk and benefit perception associated with four individual product profiles within each generic food group. Two hundred and seventy Northern Ireland food purchasers. participated in this phase of research. The theoretical mathematical model that was derived from the conjoint analysis experiment could be used to predict the consumer's intention to choose a range of products with a known nutritional profile. On examination of the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risks</b> and benefits at generic product level a strong inverse relationship was identified (,- 2 - 0. 926), indicating that consumers tend to weigh up risks and benefits together when making a decision. In contrast, at specific product profile level a very weak inverse relationship was identified (- 0. 045 to - 0. 273) across all three foods, indicating that consumers tend to use a rational decision-making process at this stage, where risks and benefits are considered separately. The importance of risk and benefit perception in determining behavioural intention was also investigated using multiple linear regression analysis. Results implied that benefit perception forms. a more important component of the decision-making process, with its relative importance increasing as the overall impression of the generic product becomes more favourable. Ã‚Â· This relationship was further substantiated in Phase Four of the research, which investigated the risk benefit decision-making process with a food marketed as a healthy alternative (spreads). The overall impression of the generic product also affected the decision. making strategy used, as the lJlore favourable the overall impression became, trade-offs became less explicit, and a more relaxed decision making strategy was used. Socio-demographic and dietary factors as well as the characteristics of the risk were found to have no impact. It is concluded that the risk benefit decision-making process associated with the nutritional components of food is influenced by a unique mix of information and events to which the individual is subjected to {{over a long period of}} time. This is expressed as their 'nutritional echo'. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Using MIDAS, we report that, in most indices, {{there is a significant}} and positive <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risk</b> and expected return. This strongly contrasts with the result we obtain when we employ both symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models for conditional variance. We also find that asymmetric specifications of the variance process within the MIDAS framework improve the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>risk</b> and expected return. Finally, we introduce bivariate MIDAS and find some evidence of significant pricing of the hedging component for the intertemporal riskreturn trade-off.
