5|$|The Second Republic was {{a source}} of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all {{segments}} of society. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime minister of the Republic. The wealthier landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic {{because of the lack of}} any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> 94. Lerroux became foreign minister. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.|$|E

5|$|In October 1931 Alcalá Zamora and his {{interior}} minister, Miguel Maura, resigned. Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister. Desiring {{the job for}} himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> {{switched to}} the opposition, leaving Azaña dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected {{to the lack of}} progress. The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right. Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced. Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops. Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities. Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly improve the situation for rural workers. By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment in absentia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Vojislav Šešelj taught {{political}} science at the University of Michigan after being expelled by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1981. In June 1989, he traveled to the United States again to meet with Momčilo Đujić in San Marcos, California, where Đujić named him Chetnik Vojvoda (duke in Serbian). He went on to form the Serbian <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> in 1991 and was accused by the ICTY tribunal of leading the Beli Orlovi militants in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in war-state Republic of Serbian Krajina. Radovan Karadžić pursued post-graduate medical studies at Columbia University from 1974 to 1975, but did so without any specific political agenda at the time being; he later became the war-time president of the Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War and subsequently went into hiding in Serbia until his capture in 2008 for ICTY charges of war crimes and genocide.|$|E

40|$|What is a <b>radical</b> right <b>party?</b> <b>Radical</b> right <b>parties</b> {{are not new}} to the {{political}} scene. Different parties {{have come and gone}} over the last century. What is different about the <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> of the 1980 s and 1990 s is their staying power, and their impact on the mainstream parties. The rise of new parties on the right in the 1980 s led to a great deal of controversy over how these parties would be defined. On the other hand, there is little argument regarding their challenge to established party systems in Western Europe. I will argue in this paper that there are many similarities between the <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> in France, Germany and Austria. I begin by comparing different authors' definitions of extreme or <b>radical</b> right <b>parties,</b> and develop my own definition of a <b>radical</b> right <b>party.</b> I then describe the <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> and their histories in section III. Section IV provides a description of the nationalism that defines <b>radical</b> right <b>parties,</b> and the positions they have taken on immigration, economics, and the mainstream parties. Despite differences in their historical development, the parties I will be describing have taken very similar positions on issues such as immigration and the European Union...|$|R
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian <b>Radical</b> <b>Party</b> (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} the Velepromet camp formed part of three {{different}} ICTY indictments, although none resulted in a conviction. In the trial of Slobodan Milošević, the charges brought against Milošević by the ICTY prosecutors included unlawful confinement, imprisonment, torture and inhumane acts against Croat and other non-Serb civilians, including one hundred detainees held in the Velepromet camp. Milošević died before his trial was completed. Vojislav Šešelj, {{the leader of the}} Serb <b>Radical</b> <b>Party,</b> associated with the White Eagles paramilitaries, was charged with the unlawful confinement and killing of at least six people at the Velepromet camp who were buried in a mass grave near the site of the Ovčara massacre, near the village of Grabovo south of Vukovar, as well as an unspecified {{number of people in the}} brick yard adjacent to the Velepromet camp. He was acquitted of all charges in 2016. Goran Hadžić, a Croatian Serb policial leader in eastern Slavonia, who held the office of President of SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, was charged with the unlawful confinement and murder of the 17 people in Velepromet who were later buried within the compound. His trial was abandoned in 2014 as a result of Hadžić being diagnosed with terminal cancer.|$|E

40|$|Europe has {{undergone}} a “Right turn” in politics {{over the last three}} decades, as evidenced by the continued success of <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> in Western European countries. Early studies of Western European <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> examined country level sociostructural factors for explaining variation in electoral support of <b>radical</b> right <b>parties,</b> but studies left unanswered if the same aggregate level factors are sufficient for explaining different levels of support that <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> secure outside of Western Europe.

The findings show that these factors are associated with support for <b>radical</b> right <b>parties</b> in some countries but not others. The paper then draws on theories of democratization to show that civic participation is a potentially important factor for understanding differences in support for <b>radical</b> right <b>parties.</b> This study contributes to a growing literature on the role of civic organizations in democratization and the body of knowledge on right-wing politics in Europe...|$|R
