40|$|A flux-difference split {{explicit}} finite-difference {{algorithm is}} presented for solving the parabolized {{form of the}} equations governing three-dimensional nonequilibrium chemically reacting flows. The algorithm {{is based on an}} explicit noniterative, upwind space-marching scheme developed by Korte, but differs in that the unsteady Riemann problem, rather than the steady Riemann problem, is solved. The algorithm allows either a second or an approximately third-order accurate upwind treatment of the convection terms by employing the unsteady approximate Riemann solver of Roe. The source terms of the species transport equations are treated in either an explicit or implicit manner, and the species diffusion terms are modeled with either a Fickian or a multicomponent model. A validation of the algorithm is performed by comparing computational results with the 2 -D Mach 14, 15 degree compression-corner data of Holden. The three-dimensional capability of the algorithm is demonstrated by computing Mach 2. 7 flow over a swept wedge scramjet fuel injector, and three-dimensional <b>reacting</b> <b>flow</b> <b>capability</b> is demonstrated by a computing a shock-jet interaction concept for mixing and combustion enhancement...|$|E

40|$|Summary. During {{the last}} years the {{interest}} in the numerical simulation of <b>reacting</b> <b>flows</b> has grown considerably. Numerical methods are available, which allow to couple chemical kinetics with flow and molecular transport. However, the use of detailed physical and chemical models, involving more than 100 chemical species, and thus more than 100 species conservation equations, is restricted to very simple flow configurations like one-dimensional systems or two-dimensional systems with very simple geometries, and models are required, which simplify chemistry without sacrificing accuracy In many chemically <b>reacting</b> <b>flows</b> chemical processes occur with time scales differing by many orders of magnitude (e. g., 10 ~ s to I s in combustion processes), whereas the time scales of flow, molecular transport, and turbulence usually cover a much smaller range of time scales. Based on local time scale analyses {{it is possible to}} decouple the fast (and thus not rate limiting) chemical processes. In this way the chemistry can be described in terms of a small number of governing reaction progress variables, and computations of complex <b>reacting</b> <b>flow</b> problems become possible.

The calculated normalized temperature profiles for the non-reacting flow field agree qualitatively well with the normalized conserved variable isopleths for the <b>reacting</b> <b>flow</b> field indicating that non-reacting mixing experiments are appropriate for screening and ranking potential rapid mixing concepts. For a given set of jet momentum-flux ratio, mass flow ratio, and density ratio (J, MR, and DR), the <b>reacting</b> <b>flow</b> calculations show a reduced level of mixing compared to the non-reacting cases.

40|$|To enable high {{fidelity}} simulation of combustion phenomena in realistic devices, an embedded boundary method is implemented into direct numerical simulations (DNS) of <b>reacting</b> <b>flows.</b> One {{of the additional}} numerical issues associated with <b>reacting</b> <b>flows</b> is the stable treatment of the embedded boundaries {{in the presence of}} multicomponent species and reactions. The implemented method is validated in two test con gurations: a pre-mixed hydrogen/air flame stabilized in a backward-facing step configuration, and reactive flows around a square prism. The former is of interest in practical gas turbine combustor applications in which the thermo-acoustic instabilities are a strong concern, and the latter serves as a good model problem to capture the vortex shedding behind a bluff body.

40|$|Nowadays the {{mathematical}} description of chemically <b>reacting</b> <b>flows</b> uses very often reaction mechanisms with far above hundred or even thousand chemical species (and, therefore, {{a large number}} of partial differential equations must be solved), which possibly react within more than a thousand of elementary reactions. These chemical kinetic processes cover time scales from nanoseconds to seconds. An analogous scaling problem arises for the length scales. Due to these scaling problems the detailed simulation of three-dimensional turbulent flows in practical systems is beyond the capacity of even today 2 ̆ 7 s super-computers. Using simplified sub-models is {{a way out of this}} problem. The question arising in mathematical modeling of <b>reacting</b> <b>flows</b> is then: How detailed, or down to which scale has each process to be resolved (chemical reaction, chemistry-turbulence-interaction, molecular transport processes) in order to allow a reliable description of the entire process. Both the chemical source term and the transport term have one important property, namely, they cause the existence of low-dimensional attractors in composition space. When these manifolds can be constructed (described) and parametrized by a small number of variables, it can be used to reformulate and reduce {{the mathematical}} description for modeling <b>reacting</b> <b>flows.</b> In this work the hierarchical nature of these low-dimensional manifolds of slow motions is discussed.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{outlines}} {{the current state}} in the model reduction of systems governing <b>reacting</b> <b>flows</b> by manifold methods. The main idea of such approaches {{is based on the}} fact that any reduced model defines a manifold of low dimen-sion imbedded in the system composition/state space. In this respect the decomposition into relatively fast and slow mo-tions due to multiple time scales present in the system is a crucial property of the reacting system. It allows the application of the geometrical framework of slow and fast invariant manifolds to model reduction. Recently developed approaches, namely, the so-called Reaction-Diffusion Manifolds (REDIMs) and Global-Quasi Linearization (GQL) are in the focus of this work.
