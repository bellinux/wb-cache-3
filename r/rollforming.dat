50|$|Roll forming, also spelled <b>rollforming,</b> {{is a type}} {{of rolling}} {{involving}} the continuous bending of a long strip of sheet metal (typically coiled steel) into a desired cross-section. The strip passed through sets of rolls mounted on consecutive stands, each set performing only an incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section (profile) is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing constant-profile parts with long lengths and in large quantities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of residual stresses and strain hardening due to the cold <b>rollforming</b> process on the load carrying capacity of perforated rack columns. First of all, a residual strain distribution of the manufacturing process is obtained via a finite element analysis and then it is introduced in the model as initial state {{to carry out a}} nonlinear buckling analysis. Two different methodologies to introduce the residual strain pattern are presented in order to reproduce the local stress effects because of perforations. Moreover, the changes of the mechanical properties of the material by strain hardening are evaluated through experimental tests and its influence on the rack column behaviour is investigated. The results obtained agree well with experimental tests and show a method to predict the load carrying capacity of perforated rack column taking into account the effects of the cold roll-forming process.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{continuous}} <b>rollforming</b> {{process for the}} folding of thin-films was proposed and studied as a key step in the continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets. HPMC and PEG based polymeric thin-films were considered for this application. An experimental apparatus was designed and developed to test the folding of thin-films. The experimental apparatus was designed in a modular fashion to facilitate testing of various process parameters. Analysis was carried out for the folding operations, based on which two folding strategies were proposed - (i) without scoring and (ii) with scoring. The first strategy relies on elastic deformation of the thin-films, whereas the later depends on localized, plastic deformation caused by the scoring geometry. From the experiments on folding we identified three regimes of process operation namely: insufficient scoring, appropriate scoring, and excessive scoring. The implications of different levels of scoring were observed and understood carefully for the scoring and folding operation. Practical guidelines were developed for carrying out folding successfully and the scope of future work was discussed. by Ryan Slaughter. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Using {{solar energy}} {{is clearly an}} {{important}} part of creating a sustainable future. Thats exactly what the small company Absolicon Solar Collectors placed in Härnösand thinks and carries through. By developing and manufacturing concentrated solarcollectors with a complete runningcentral for producing steam intended for industrial purpose are they pushing the technology and industry forward. They have so far manufactured small volumes of pilot plants but will now have the ability to manufacture larger volumes. To accomplish that they will {{have to be able to}} speed up the manufacturing process regarding some of the processes in the manufacturing line. As a part of the first station in the line will they need a method to semi automatically bend the two longest edges of the collector. It is this method this thesis is all about. A functional prototyp is also a part of the desired result. Roll forming became the method of choice. After choosing method was a small research around the subject accomplished containing visits at companies and literature studying. The demands of the curvature of the bends were also more closely investigated to get a better grip of the demands on the roll forming mill. <b>Rollforming</b> is an effective way to change the profile of steel plates and strips. The higher rollspeed the faster <b>rollforming.</b> By calculating tension and elongation of the steel or by testing can the number of passes and the length of the mill be determined. In the part theory of the report is essential theory and rules regarding roll forming compiled for simple calculations and general understanding of some of aspects in roll and mill design. In the part method of the report is the work regarding planning and contructing the two hand made prototypes. Prototype one is manufactured for the purpose of testing stands, shafts and rolls. Derived from the results of testing prototype one is the final prototype constructed and made. The work is resulting in a final prototype containing two passes which is not producing the desired final bend angle but the function of the roll forming as a method can still be validated and presented. The steel strip is easily by hand dragged trough the mill and no defects or other problem were encountered. The final prototype is not fully meeting the demands of the final bend angle due to the short deadline it was made in. Two more passes are still needed do be added for the final angle. As a conclusion is roll forming as a method really suitable for this bending operation because of its simplicity, low cost, small physicall measurments and high forming speed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{roll-forming}} {{has been adopted}} as a technique to improve the strength against crack propagation in railway axles, but very few scientific analyses and studies of the phenomenon {{are available in the}} literature. For this reason, the Maraxil Project was started in order to give the opportunity of experimentally and theoretically investigating some aspects related to this technological process in the case of railway axles made of EA 4 T, a typical steel for manufacture of high speed axles. Firstly, an experimental campaign on small-scale SE(B) specimens was carried out for determining the crack propagation behavior at stress ratios below - 1, which correspond to the ones in presence of the high compressive residual stresses due to the roll-forming procedure. At the same time, the compressive residual stress field along the radial direction and due to the <b>rollforming</b> process was evaluated from axles coming from the production using both hole-drilling and x-ray diffractometry methods. The results obtained from crack propagation tests and residual stress field measurements were used together to build up a predictive crack growth model in presence of very high compressive stresses. This model was, then, validated through dedicated experimental crack propagation tests carried out on full-scale roll-formed axles made of EA 4 T; good agreement was found between the model and the experiments...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{some aspects of}} the fluidmechanics of paper-making,more {{specifically}} partial dewateringduring roll forming. The study is mainly experimental. Pressureand wire position measurements have been carried out in anexperimental facility, the KTH-Former,which models the <b>rollforming</b> zone of a paper machine. Measurements are carried out with pure water for threedifferent wires (fabrics) : A non-permeable,a semi-permeable anda conventional wire. Although not used in paper making,thenon-permeable wire is useful when trying to understand thefundamental mechanics of roll forming. The semi-permeable wirewith finite but low permeability is used to model the effectsof the fibre web on the drainage. Tests have mainly been carried out for different wiretensions and different jet speeds. It is shown that the localcurvature of the wire is strongly correlated to the dewateringpressure. The conventiona wire shows a single pressure peak causingcomplete de- watering {{in the first part of}} the dewateringzone. The pressure distributions for the non-and semi-permeablewires are found to show two consecutive pressure peaks followedby a suction peak where the wire is taken of the roll. Thisoscillating behaviour is due to capillary waves where the wiretension plays the role of surface tension on a free surface. Thewavy behaviour of the wire is recovered from an analyticalmodel and the effect is governed by a dimensionless Webernumber. The measured wave lengths correspond well to thosegiven by the theory. When the wire tension is high,i. e. a high dewateringpressure,the flow in the impingement region collapses when thedynamic pressure of the headbox jet is about half of thedewatering pressure. It is shown experimentally that the localdrainage shows a correlation to the dewatering pressure andhence to the wire curvature. NR 2014080...|$|E
