5000|$|A typical {{payday loan}} in the United Kingdom costs {{as much as}} £25 for every £100 {{borrowed}} per month, meaning a £300 loan would cost £375 to repay after one month. The UK imposes no legal limit on rolling over loans, {{and there are no}} restrictions on the interest rates payday loan companies can charge: one UK payday lender charges a [...] "typical APR" [...] of 1,355%, another lender advertises an APR of 2,225%. Most companies charge 25% for an <b>advance</b> <b>repayable</b> {{at the end of the}} month, a few charge 30%, which is equivalent to an APR of over 2000%. Failure to repay a payday loan leads to spiraling APR. According to Consumer Focus, [...] "the cost of obtaining a loan online (often £25-£30 month per £100) exceeds the costs of obtaining a loan on the High Street (often £13-£18 per £100)" [...] because the lenders reject fewer applicants and face higher rates of fraud and default. The providers charge a fee for the loan usually expressed as a flat fee per £100 borrowed for the stated short period, usually around £25.|$|R
