40|$|PURPOSE: Virtual {{planning}} and guided surgery {{with or without}} prebent or <b>milled</b> <b>plates</b> {{are becoming more and}} more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of {{planning and}} cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2 -year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was recorded. RESULTS: During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $ 47. 50. Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced from US $ 5, 098 to US $ 1, 231. 50 with a prebent plate and from US $ 6, 980 to US $ 3, 113. 50 for a <b>milled</b> <b>plate.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or <b>milled</b> <b>plates</b> are financially viable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It {{is still}} common {{practice}} in industry to handle the thickness control problem of a rolling mill around a working point. The assumption of linearity is no longer valid if the mill is operated in a wider working range. In a <b>reversing</b> <b>mill</b> this is especially the case when the plate enters and leaves the mill stand from pass to pass. A non-linear control strategy is proposed to improve the regularity of the thickness {{at the ends of}} the plate in order to decrease the amount of the plate to be cut off by the crop shear. The performance of the controller is examined using an advanced simulation model of a finishing mill. Copyright c ° 2005 IFA...|$|R

The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product.
