50|$|A draftsman's {{beam compass}} {{consists}} {{of a set of}} points and holders, mounted on a plated brass, aluminum, or electrum rod. One end is generally locked {{down at the end of}} the rod, while the other has both rough and fine adjustments, though some are opposite in construction. The locked tip holder {{consists of a}} needle, for the center of the radius, and the other holds either a lead clutch, or an inking nib. There are older variants which use a wooden beam. Another similar type is a Machinist or Engineers beam compass, which uses scribing points only, similar to ones used by woodworkers, except that its fine adjustment is generally more refined. These beam compasses can be extended by adding press-in rods, or by using a lockable <b>rod</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{backstay}} <b>rod</b> <b>connector</b> on {{a luxury}} yacht fractured while the vessel was docked. The fracture of this connector caused the backstay assembly {{to fall to}} the deck. A second connector contained a large crack. Both connectors were made from 17 - 4 PH stainless steel. One half of the fractured connector was recovered. The fracture initiated by pitting and crevice corrosion and was followed by stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) that ultimately led to the fracture. The second connector most probably cracked in the same way. Adverse conditions inherent to service use of the connectors could have facilitated the stress-corrosion process. Nevertheless, use of a stress-corrosion-susceptible material is unacceptable, and any connectors made from 17 - 4 PH steel aged below 866 K (1100 °F) should be replaced. Candidate replacement materials are stainless steels type 316, Nitronic 50, a duplex steel such as SAF 2205, and 17 - 4 PH in the H 1100 and H 1150 conditions. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{analysis of the}} pullout strength of bonded and axially loaded steel <b>rods</b> used as <b>connector</b> elements in log-concrete composite bridge decks. Static and cyclic tests were carried out to evaluate the fatigue of the connectors using two species of reforested wood, three types of commercial adhesives and three levels of wood moisture content. It was found that six failure modes (rod interface failure, timber interface failure, combined timber interface/rod interface failure, combined rod interface/timber substrate failure, rod failure, and adhesive failure) can occur in the geometry of a single test specimen. The results indicate the good performance of epoxy glued steel <b>rod</b> <b>connectors</b> for use in log-concrete composite bridge decks. FAPES...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. January 2016. Major: Biomedical Engineering. Advisors: Victor Barocas, Joan Bechtold. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 36 pages. Background: Early onset scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity {{of the spine}} and trunk – diagnosed {{before the age of}} 10 – and occurs in 3 to 5 out of 100, 000 infant and juvenile populations. Surgical intervention is often necessary for pediatric patients with severe curvatures. During thesis procedures, spinal rods – known as pediatric non-fusion devices (i. e. growing rods) – are placed in the patients to allow for spinal growth. ASTM standards exist for fusion constructs. Growing-rod constructs place greater demands on the rods as no fusion is performed and the rods are continually loaded. Also, the constructs are serially lengthened at 6 -month intervals placing additional demands on the construct. Currently, there are no standards on how to develop and utilize a finite element model – to predict durability of commonly used constructs within the patient. Methods: Finite element models representing static compression bending were implemented using Abaqus CAE (Dassault Systemés Simulia Corporation, Providence, Rhode Island). The model geometry and loading was based on ASTM standard 1537 and 136. The models were created with C 3 D 8 R type elements. The model applied a controlled displacement until failure or contact occurred between the superior and inferior UHMWPE blocks. Failure was defined as the point at which permanent deformation of the construct occurs, due to fracture, plastic deformation, or slip. Eight constructs were analyzed based on the rod material (titanium and cobalt chrome), active length (76 -mm and 376 -mm), and construct type (F 1717 and growing-rod). Results: The force-displacement curves and maximum principle stress for each whole model were evaluated. The longer active lengths required a smaller force for failure. Failure at the pedicle screw head was found on each model. Conclusions: A new ASTM standard for growing-rod constructs should be created based off of a longer active length, the overlap of the <b>rod</b> <b>connectors,</b> and location of the <b>rod</b> <b>connectors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pedicle screw-rod {{instrumentation}} {{is considered}} a standard treatment for spinal instability, and titanium {{is the most common}} material for this application. Cobalt-chromium has several advantages over titanium and is generating interest in orthopedic practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare titanium versus cobalt-chromium rods in posterior fusion, with and without transverse connectors, through in vitro biomechanical testing and determine the optimal configuration. Six cadaveric lumbar spines (L 1 -S 1) were used. Posterior and middle column injuries were simulated at L 3 -L 5 and different pedicle screw constructs were implanted. Specimens were subjected to flexibility tests and range of motion, intradiscal pressure and axial rotation energy loss were statistically compared among the following conditions: intact, titanium <b>rods</b> (without transverse <b>connectors),</b> titanium <b>rods</b> with transverse <b>connectors,</b> cobalt-chromium <b>rods</b> (without transverse <b>connectors)</b> and cobalt-chromium <b>rods</b> with transverse <b>connectors.</b> The novel measurement of energy loss was examined to determine its viability in fusion investigations. All fusion constructs significantly (p 0. 05) were observed in axial rotation among all conditions. Intradiscal pressure significantly increased (p≤ 0. 01) after fusion, except for the cobalt-chrome conditions in extension (p≥ 0. 06), and no significant differences (p 3 ̆e 0. 99) were found among fixation constructs. Energy loss, differences became significant between the cobalt-chrome with transverse connector condition with respect to the cobalt-chrome (p= 0. 05) and titanium (p There is not enough evidence to support that the cobalt-chrome rods performed biomechanically different than the titanium rods. The use of titanium rods may be more beneficial because there is a lower probability of corrosion. The inclusion of the transverse connector only increased stability for the cobalt-chromium construct in axial rotation, which suggests that it is beneficial in complete facetectomy procedures...|$|R

5000|$|The concept behind K'Nex was {{originally}} conceived by Joel Glickman. While {{he was at}} a wedding, he started thinking of what he could do with his straw if he could connect it with other straws. He and his brother Bob Glickman discussed the idea and started the K'Nex company. The original building system kept very closely to the idea that Joel Glickman had: The K'Nex building system is simply <b>Rods</b> and <b>Connectors</b> which can be easily attached together to make different things. Other parts such as wheels and pulleys are also included to allow more flexibility in construction. The first K'Nex Box was launched in the U.S. market in 1993. Original models with moving parts had a handcrank to make things move, but soon, gears and motors allowed models to move on their own.|$|R

40|$|Models {{estimating}} the slip modulus and the load capacity, including temperature dependent effects, of non-metallic timber connections are presented. Previous studies, including {{the work of}} Thomson, have shown that 'Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer' (GFRP) <b>rods</b> are suitable <b>connectors</b> for timber and that 'Densified Veneer Wood' (DVW) functions effectively as a flitch plate material. Thomson's model predicting the slip modulus of the connection with GFRP rods and DVW plates is revised in this paper. The revised model is used to predict the slip modulus and the failure load at room temperature and elevated temperatures. The latter is achieved by predicting local temperatures in the connection and taking corresponding reduced material properties into account...|$|R

40|$|A small, light, {{ball-joint}} {{device called}} PinFix, which can instantly convert a simple percutaneous cross pin fracture fixation system into a rigid external fracture fixation {{system based on}} truss structure, was developed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the mechanical load and breaking strength of this truss-structure-based fixation system to that of the conventionally used external cantilever structure-based fixation system. Three types of mechanical loading tests, axial, bending, and torsion, were performed on an artificial fractured bone treated with either three-dimensional PinFix fixation, two-dimensional PinFix fixation, or conventional external fixation. The three- and two-dimensional PinFix fixations showed significantly more stiffness than conventional fixation on all three loading tests. Finite element analysis was next performed to calculate the stress distribution of the parts in PinFix and in the conventional fixator. The applied stress to the <b>rod</b> and <b>connectors</b> of PinFix was much less than that of the conventional external fixator. These results reflected the physical characteristic of truss structure in which applied load is converted to pure tension or compression forces along the members of the PinFix. In conclusion, PinFix is a simple fracture fixation system that has a truss-structure with a high rigidity...|$|R
40|$|K’nex toys {{consist of}} various plastic <b>rods</b> and <b>connectors</b> cleverly-sized {{to allow the}} {{creation}} of a variety of structures. While the K’nex Corporation focuses on the K- 12 market, there are a myriad of engineering applications that have been demonstrated at the university level. Many of these occur at the lower division level in freshman experience courses or introductory statics courses. Other applications have included constructing structural models for structural design and capstone courses. This paper takes this use of classroom technology even further by demonstrating how K’nex pieces can be used effectively in an upper-division, highly technical structural dynamics / seismic design course. For the past several years, students in ARCE 483 Seismic Analysis and Design at xx university have been designing experiments using K’nex pieces. The types of experiments that have resulted include the effects of fixity on natural frequency, flexible versus rigid performance, seismic activity on a bridge structure, soft story behavior in buildings, the effect of floor system stiffness on the deflection of a system, the effect of mass dampers on tall buildings, identifying building mode shapes, and even modeling a viscous damper using K’nex, sponges and jello. This paper will demonstrate that K’nex toys can be an inexpensive yet very effective classroom technology for creating physical models and demonstrations in even the most technical engineering courses. This paper {{is part of a larger}} effort to develop a consortium of schools that use K’nex product in the classroom. The consortium members will share ideas, communicate best practices, and encourage each other to improve engineering education and understanding through physical models. This paper will hopefully be considered for the Civil Engineering Division session on Classroom Technology...|$|R
