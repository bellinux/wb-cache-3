5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 she had been {{replaced}} by Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 {{it was part of the}} Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order of the Brothers of Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner {{was part of}} the insignia of the head of statethe State Leader (Naczelnik Państwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It was plain red emblazoned with the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only {{to adjust to the}} changes in the official <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national coat of arms. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Neoclassicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The shade of red was first legally specified as vermilion by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} and extant <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus {{can be found}} in Book VI of the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet Ovid (Publius Ovidius Naso) (43 BC – AD 17/18), where the story reaches its full development during antiquity. It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus (2nd century BC), or sources that are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments—especially Sophocles' tragic drama Tereus (5th century BC).|$|E

5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an inaccurate <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms of the see, {{and the other with}} a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E
5|$|Ward's {{thesis is}} {{based on the fact that}} the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, is {{overwhelmingly}} influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous and more sophisticated Madonna Standing draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that Campin was never to resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body beneath the robes. He also points to the architectural similarities in Campin's Marriage of Mary, although this may be a matter of influence.|$|E
5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
5|$|Prototype {{released}} a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port of Ecstasy titled Little Busters! Converted Edition on December 24, 2009, which removed the adult {{elements of the}} game. The PS2 version was available to try at Key 10th Memorial Fes, an event held in commemoration of Key's ten-year anniversary between February 28 and March 1, 2009. A PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of Little Busters! Converted Edition, also by Prototype, was released on November 25, 2010. The Windows and PS2 versions had voice acting for only the major characters, but the PSP version contained full voice acting {{for all of the}} characters other than Riki. Prototype also {{released a}} version of Little Busters! Converted Edition ported to the PlayStation Vita (PS Vita) on March 22, 2012. Along with also having full voice acting, the PS Vita version contains 1.4x larger CGs than the Windows edition, and the limited edition came bundled with a drama CD. Prototype released a PlayStation 3 (PS3) version of Converted Edition with the additional content included in the previous consumer ports on March 20, 2013. An added feature in the PS3 version is a 3D <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minigame in Saya's route where the player must navigate a labyrinth. A downloadable version of the PS3 release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on May 29, 2013.|$|E
