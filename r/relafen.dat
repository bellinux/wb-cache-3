50|$|Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). Nabumetone {{has been}} developed by Beecham. It is available under numerous brand names, such as <b>Relafen,</b> Relifex, and Gambaran.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dietary {{compounds}} or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{may reduce}} cancer rates. Elevation of phase II detoxification enzymes {{might be one}} of the mechanisms leading to cancer prevention. We investigated the effects of dietary anticarcinogens and NSAIDs on rat gastrointestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diets of Wistar rats were supplemented with oltipraz, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), sulforaphane analogue compound- 30, indole- 3 -carbinol, D-limonene, <b>relafen,</b> indomethacin, ibuprofen, piroxicam, acetyl salicylic acid or sulindac. Hepatic and intestinal UGT enzyme activities were quantified by using 4 -nitrophenol and 4 -methylumbelliferone as substrates. RESULTS: Compound- 30, D-limonene, indomethacin, ibuprofen or sulindac enhanced proximal small intestinal UGT activities. Only compound- 30 was able to induce mid- and distal small intestinal UGT activities. Large intestinal UGT activities were increased by ibuprofen and sulindac, whereas oltipraz, PEITC and D-limonene gave enhanced hepatic UGT activities. CONCLUSION: Mainly rat proximal small intestinal and hepatic UGT enzyme activities were induced by dietary anticarcinogens or NSAIDs. Enhanced UGT activities might lead to a more efficient detoxification of carcinogenic compounds and thus could contribute to the prevention of gastrointestinal cancer...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{summarize}} current {{evidence that}} three new additions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) offer comparable efficacy with fewer adverse effects than established NSAIDs. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: No large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared all important NSAIDs. Several RCTs {{have shown that}} H 2 antagonists do not protect against NSAID side effects, but some RCTs compared the protective effect of misoprostol (Cytotec) used with other NSAIDs; others have compared etodolac (Ultradol) or nabumetone (<b>Relafen)</b> with placebo and naproxen (eg, Naprosyn). Postmarketing surveys {{have been used to}} support claims that the new NSAIDs have few gastric or renal side effects. MAIN FINDINGS: Using misoprostol in conjunction with traditional NSAIDs reduces gastric and renal adverse effects. Misoprostol can be taken {{at the same time as}} NSAIDs or in a combination tablet. Two new NSAIDS, etodolac and nabumetone, do not inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 prostaglandins, which occur in the stomach and kidneys, but more selectively block cyclooxygenase 2 prostaglandins, which cause arthritic inflammation. These two NSAIDs have efficacy profiles comparable to older NSAIDs but have markedly fewer side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Safer treatment for arthritis can be achieved by combining misoprostol with traditional NSAIDs or by using one of two new agents, nabumetone or etodolac...|$|E
