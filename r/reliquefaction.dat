40|$|The fact {{exists that}} since the {{acceleration}} induced in the saturated sand deposits during <b>reliquefaction</b> is smaller than that during past liquefaction, the <b>reliquefaction</b> potential of those deposits is quite large. In order to confirm this fact experimentally, liquefaction tests on saturated sand layer using Kjellman's shear box were carried out. It is found from the tests that the <b>reliquefaction</b> potential of a sand layer subjected to larger acceleration and shaking time during first liquefaction becomes much higher. Furthermore, {{it is confirmed that}} the <b>reliquefaction</b> potentials of the sand layers subjected to double amplitude of shear strain (γ_D) = 5. 0 % and 13. 4 % during first liquefaction are the same...|$|E

40|$|Because {{of the low}} boiling {{temperature}} of cryogenic propellants to be used on the Space Shuttle, loss of cryogens from boiloff could become very costly. This paper describes how this shuttle problem is being solved at Kennedy Space Center. Cryogenic losses are categorized relative to the particular cryogenic involved, the Space Shuttle servicing operation causing boiloff and {{the magnitude of the}} loss. The techniques under consideration are discussed in detail. These techniques include reclaiming the boiloff by <b>reliquefaction,</b> upgrading the reclaimed boiloff by purification, and interim boiloff storage in metal hydride prior to reprocessing. One of the <b>reliquefaction</b> processes discussed in detail utilizes the cooling effect of venting some of the liquid hydrogen boiloff to provide a simple hydrogen <b>reliquefaction</b> unit. Possible future applications of these cryogenics recovery techniques to industry and transportation systems using liquid hydrogen for energy storage and fuel are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cryogenic seal {{tests were}} {{performed}} and Rulon A {{was selected for}} the subject nutating positive displacement expander. A four-chamber expander was designed and fabricated. A nitrogen reliquefier flow system was also designed and constructed for testing the cold expander. Initial tests were unsatisfactory because of high internal friction attributed to nutating Rulon inlet and outlet valve plates. Replacement of the nutating valves with cam-actuated poppet valves improved performance. However, no net nitrogen <b>reliquefaction</b> was achieved due to high internal friction. Computer software was developed for accurate calculation of nitrogen <b>reliquefaction</b> from a system such as that proposed. These calculations indicated that practical <b>reliquefaction</b> rates of 15 to 19 percent could be obtained. Due to mechanical problems, the nutating expander did not demonstrate its feasibility nor that of the system. It was concluded that redesign and testing of a smaller nutating expander was required to prove concept feasibility...|$|E

40|$|Onboard {{boil-off}} gas (BOG) <b>reliquefaction</b> {{is a new}} technology that liquefies BOG and returns it to the cargo tanks instead of burning it off during a voyage. For the commercial development of this technology, an object-oriented dynamic simulation is presented which facilitates {{the design of the}} plant and control system for the thermal process. A <b>reliquefaction</b> process based on the reverse Brayton cycle has been designed, and its static thermodynamic states at the design BOG load are presented. To make the cycle work for any BOG load, an idea was sought that would achieve a heat balance with the work extracted by the expander. Dynamic simulations were conducted for all operating modes, including start-up and idle. It was found that the expander exit temperature is the key process variable for control and that the process control works successfully when three actuators are activated in three different BOG load regimes. The study also shows that control of the separator pressure to keep the vapor fraction at the throttle valve exit as low as possible is an efficient method for purging nitrogen from BOG.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the use of paleomagnetic {{directions}} of liquefied sands for correlating and dating paleoseismic events, I studied historic liquefaction deposits in the New Madrid seismic zone to verify their ability to record the ambient geomagnetic field direction {{at the time of}} liquefaction. Erupted sand from the 1811 - 1812 New Madrid events are shown to have a remanent magnetic direction in agreement with the field direction recorded in St. Louis in 1819. There is a large variation in the magnetic quality between two adjacent erupted sand layers. These beds show identical magnetic composition and sand grain-size. Lacking a magnetic explanation for their differing behavior, turbulent forces or deformation causing signal degradation during <b>reliquefaction</b> are the preferred explanation. A similar explanation is also suggested for the poor magnetic quality of an injected dike that is coarser-grained, but magnetically identical to the erupted sands...|$|E
40|$|Advanced dynamic {{insulation}} systems were analyzed from a thermodynamic point of view. A particular performance measure is proposed {{in order to}} characterize various insulations in a unique manner. This measure is related to a base quantity, the refrigeration power ratio. The latter is the minimum refrigeration power, for a particular {{dynamic insulation}} limit, to the actual <b>reliquefaction</b> power associated with cryoliquid boiloff. This ratio serves as reference quantity which is approximately constant for a specific ductless insulation at a chosen normal boiling point. Each real container with support structure, vent tube, and other transverse components requires a larger refrigeration power. The ratio of the actual experimental power to the theoretical value of the support-less system is a suitable measure of the entire insulation performance as far as parasitic heat leakage is concerned. The present characterization is illustrated using simple thermodynamic system examples including experiments with liquid nitrogen. Numerical values are presented and a comparison with liquid helium is given...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study has developed the major {{features of a}} large capacity orbital propellant depot for the space-based, cryogenic OTV. The study has treated both the Dual-Keel Space Station and co-orbiting platforms as the accommodations base for the propellant storage facilities, and trades have examined both tethered and hard-docked options. Five tank set concepts were developed for storing the propellants, and along with layout options for the station and platform, were evaluated from the standpoints of servicing, propellant delivery, boiloff, micrometeoroid/debris shielding, development requirements, and cost. These trades led to the recommendation that an all-passive storage concept be considered for the platform and an actively refrigerated concept providing for <b>reliquefaction</b> of all boiloff be considered for the Space Station. The tank sets are modular, each storing up to 45, 400 kg of LO 2 /LH 2, and employ many advanced features to provide for microgravity fluid management and to limit boiloff. The features include such technologies as zero-gravity mass gauging, total communication capillary liquid acquisition devices, autogenous pressurization, thermodynamic vent systems, thick multilayer insulation, vapor-cooled shields, solar-selective coatings, advanced micrometeoroid/debris protection systems, and long-lived cryogenic refrigeration systems...|$|E
40|$|The MHD power {{generation}} experiments {{were conducted in}} a high field strength cryomagnet which was adapted from an existing facility. In its original construction, it consisted of 12 high purity aluminum coils pool cooled in a bath of liquid neon. In this configuration, a peak field of 15 tesla was produced. For the present experiments, the center four coils were removed and a 23 cm diameter transverse warm bore tube was inserted to allow {{the placement of the}} MHD experiment between the remaining eight coils. In this configuration, a peak field of 6 tesla should be obtainable. The time duration of the experiment is limited by the neon supply which allows on the order of 1 minute of total operating time followed by an 18 -hour <b>reliquefaction</b> period. As a result, the experiments are run in a pulsed mode. The run duration for the data presented here was 5 sec. The magnetic field profile along the MHD duct is shown.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} for a heat {{exchanger}} with multicomponent phase change, part of <b>reliquefaction</b> cycle of natural gas, is developed. The finite control volume method is used to spatially discretize the heat exchange intro a series of lumps with constant volume. Vapor-liquid equilibrium is assumed in the vapor-liquid region of the phase envelope. The model is written in terms of differential and algebraic equations applied to each lump (or cell). Different algebraic equations are valid {{in each of the}} phase regions (e. g. vapor, liquid, vapor-liquid), namely the vapor-liquid equilibrium condition is not satisfied in either of the single phases. Therefore, each phase region has its own set of differential and algebraic equations. The number required to describe the two-phase region is higher compared to the single regions. Hence, dummy variables and equations (without a physical meaning) are used in the single regions to in order to have the same number of equations in all phases such that the same model can be used for simulating all phase regions. A logical conditions is implemented to select the corresponding set of equations. The model is written and implemented in Matlab® for simulation purposes. The phase change detection is automatically handled by an event function inside the solver. A few additional examples are used to investigate how the ode 15 s solver treats nonsmooth systems, or how the algebraic equations are solved. The possibility of formulating the model as a mathematical problem with complementarity constraints is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has first established {{that it is}} based on multiple methodologies developed to tackle the areas of engineering cargo handling systems, both at port and on-board vessels, {{as well as in the}} area of organisational self-assessment. It continued in reviewing the current status and future aspects of marine safety assessment together with an examination of a few major accidents. The major problems identified in marine safety assessment in this research are associated with inappropriate treatment of uncertainty in data and human error issues during the risk modelling estimation process and the calculation of failure probabilities. Following the identification of the research needs, this thesis has developed several analytical models for the safety assessment of cargo handling systems and organisational assessment structure. Such models can be effectively integrated into a risk-based framework using the marine formal safety assessment, safety case concepts. Bayesian network (BN) and evidential reasoning (ER) approaches applicable to cargo handling engineering systems have been proposed for systematically and effectively addressing uncertainty due to randomness and vagueness in data respectively. ER test cases for both a vessel selection process and a comparison of the safety maturity of different organisations in terms of self-assessment have been produced within a domain in which main and sub criteria have been developed for assessment reasons a long with the combination of the proposed model with existing organisational models. BN test case for a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) <b>reliquefaction</b> plant has been produced within a cause-effect domain in which Bayes' theorem is the focal mechanism of inference processing. A methodology aiming in finding the probability of failure when having variables ruled by uncertainty is established using certain variable transformation methods through the First and Second order reliability methodologies. Form/Sorm produces a most likely failure point, which is demonstrated through the application at a port cargo handling crane system. The outcomes have the potential to facilitate the decision-making process in a risk-based framework. Finally, the results of the research are summarised and areas where further research is required to improve the developed methodologies are outlined...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design and {{optimize}} a heat pump process to reliquefy Boil-Off-Gas from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) cryogenic tanks, and simulataneously vaporize LNG at high pressure. The process is meant for use onboard LNG fuelled ship different from LNG carriers, equipped with LNG fuel tanks at atmospheric pressure and 2 -strokes engines with high pressure gas injection, which is considered the most efficient propulsion arrangement for medium-large vessels. The studyis based on a patented concept from the norwegian companyLNG New Technlogies, within the thesis this concept is evolved to a more complex process layout, its distinctive features are low temperature suction of the heat pump refrigerant compressor, absence of heat discharge {{to the environment and}} condensation of the Boil-Off-Gas via recirculation of subcooled LNG. Four different operating scenarios of the process are simulated with the commercial software HYSYS&# 174;, the results of the simulations are presented in the form of case studies, sensitivity analyses, thermodynamic diagrams and tables, and analized in detail. Anumber of modifications to the selected layout are evaluated, e. g. Boil-Off-Gas feed to the Auxiliaryengine and compressor intercooling. Based on the simulation results a preliminary selection ofthe process equipment is outlined, with focus on the refrigerant compressor. The results prove that the proposed heat pump process can effectively refrigerate the LNG tank if the ship is operating in the normal mode or at half of the main engine load, however at lower engine loads, especially when the main engine is shut down, the system can not produce the required refrigeration effect. In this scenario the excess Boil-Off-Gas would be fed to the Auxiliary engines, or in the worst case burnt in Gas Combustion Units. The heat pump efficiency for the normal operation is 2 - 3 times higher than for commercial on-board Boil-Off-Gas <b>reliquefaction</b> processes, but the maximumreliquefaction capacity is intrinsically lower. The operating parameters of the compressor suggest the use of a reciprocating oil-free compressor with cryogenic material specifications, this is considered the most non-conventional and costly unit of the process. </p...|$|E
40|$|Transfer of {{renewable}} energy from remote areas to energy intensive industrial regions might be of prospective importance. The case study NHEG considers a system where Norwegian hydro energy is exported to Germany as hydrogen or electricity. The aim is to evaluate the technical and economical feasibility of a demonstration project {{paving the way for}} larger commercial projects in the future. Primarily hydrogen is considered as the energy carrier. Liquid hydrogen is produced in North-Norway, shipped to German ports and distributed to specific cities. Three alternatives are studied. The reference case is based on 100 MW hydro power, the two others on 20 MW. In the former a ship with fixed cryogenic tanks is applied for the LH_ 2 maritime transportation and cryogenic 40 ' containers with ISO standard dimensions for distribution to the users. In the latter ones the containers are supposed to be used for both transportation and distribution. In all cases evaporated GH_ 2 is assumed to be returned to the production plant for <b>reliquefaction.</b> The study indicates that the most interesting demonstration project should be a system using about 20 MW_e_l and having a production rate of 4. 000 Nm" 3 GH_ 2 per hour from an existing electrolysis plant. This may bring about 40. 000 m" 3 LH_ 2 per year to the customers and have an overall energy efficiency of about 58 %. The capital investment including storage in a German port may be about 87 MDEM and the cumulative product cost about 0, 25 DEM/kWh_t_h. Including distribution of LH_ 2 in Berlin as one example may increase the investment to about 114 MDEM and the product cost to about 0, 31 DEM/kWh_t_h on today's premises. Long distance transmission of electricity may be an alternative to hydrogen transport. If electricity from Norway is used for liquid hydrogen production in Germany, the product cost will under realistic conditions be nearly the same as for imported LH_ 2. (orig.)
