40|$|Namias has {{suggested}} cross-sections of potential temperature, {{which can be}} drawn very quickly. Since unsaturated air maintains a constant potential temperature during vertical motions, places in the cross-section where the potential temperature lines dip downward would probably represent subsidence (or a transition from a colder to a warmer air mass), and those where the potential temperature lines slope upw-ard would represent zones of rising air (or a transition from a warm to a colder air mass). To return {{to the question of}} time, it has been the experience in TWA 4 that to construct the adiabatic chart and the <b>Rossby</b> <b>diagram</b> requires about 10 minutes with the data received in the present Weather Bureau code.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 70 magnetically active stars toward the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region has been investigated. The {{positions}} of the sample stars on the <b>Rossby</b> <b>diagram</b> have been analyzed. All stars are shown {{to be in the}} regime of a saturated dynamo, where the X-ray luminosity reaches its maximum and does not depend on the Rossby number. A correlation has been found between the lithium line equivalent width and the age of a solar-mass (from 0. 7 to 1. 2 Msun) pre-main-sequence star. The older the age, the smaller the Li line equivalent width. Analysis of the long-term photometric variability of these stars has shown that the photometric activity of the youngest stars is appreciably higher than that of the older objects from the sample. This result can be an indirect confirmation of the evolution of the magnetic field in pre-main-sequence stars from predominantly dipole and axisymmetric to multipole and nonaxisymmetric.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1995. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 106 - 112). Microfiche. x, 112 leaves, bound ill. (some col.) 29 cmI {{have undertaken}} {{a program of}} ground- and space-based observations to measure photometric rotation periods and X-ray luminosities for late-type stars in the young open clusters IC 2391 and IC 2602. With cluster ages of ~ 30 Myr, IC 2391 and IC 2602 are ideal sites in which to observe conditions at the ZAMS since the solar-type stars in these clusters have not been on the main sequence long enough to undergo significant magnetic braking. The ROBAT survey of IC 2391 revealed 80 X-ray sources, 44 of which {{were found to be}} associated with stars which are now classified as new cluster members. Among the solar-type stars in both IC 2391 and IC 2602, I find a factor of ~ 25 spread in the distribution of rotation periods, which range from 0. 21 to 4. 86 day. I also find a factor of ~ 10 - 20 spread in the range of Lx about a median Lx value of ~ 10 ^ 30 erg S^- 1 for both clusters. These results show conclusively that stars arrive on the ZAMS {{with a wide range of}} rotation rates and coronal activity levels. When compared to data from older clusters, such as the Pleiades and the Hyades, there is an overall decline observed in both the rotation rates and median X-ray luminosity of cluster members with increasing age, however, while the spread in the range of rotation rates decreases to a small value, the spread in the range of Lx values as a fraction of the median is observed to increase with age. This behavior is best explained through a dependence of Lx on Prot which is weak in the young clusters and strong in the older clusters. The <b>Rossby</b> <b>diagram</b> shows there is a tight correlation between Lx/ Lbol and the Rossby number, Prot divided by the convective turnover time. Young, rapidly rotating, main sequence stars lie along a plateau of magnetic saturation, where Lx has a weak dependence on rotation period, while older, more slowly rotating stars lie in a region on the <b>Rossby</b> <b>diagram</b> where Lx has a strong dependence on rotation period...|$|E
40|$|We present new vsini {{measurements}} for 235 low-mass {{stars in the}} Pleiades. The differential rotational broadening has been resolved for all the stars in our sample. These results, combined with previously published measurements, provide a complete and unbiased rotation data set for stars in the mass range from 0. 6 to 1. 2 Msol. Applying a numerical inversion technique on the vsini distributions, we derive the distributions of velocities for low-mass Pleiades members. Comparison of the rotational distributions of low-mass members between IC 2602 / 2391 and the Pleiades suggests that G dwarfs behave like solid-bodies and follow Skumanich's law during this time span. However, comparison between Pleiades and older clusters (M 34 and Hyades) indicates that the braking of slow rotators on the early main sequence is weaker than predicted by an asymptotical Skumanich's law. This strongly supports the view that angular momentum tapped in the radiative core of slow rotators on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) resurfaces into the convective envelope between Pleiades and Hyades age. For the G-dwarfs, we derive a characteristic coupling time scale between the core and the envelope of about 100 [...] 200 Myr. The relationship between rotation and coronal activity in the Pleiades is in agreement with previous observations in other clusters and field stars. We show that the <b>Rossby</b> <b>diagram</b> provides an excellent description of the X-ray activity for all stars in the mass domain studied. The Pleiades data for slow and moderate rotators fills {{the gap between the}} X-ray [...] rotation correlation found for slow rotators and the X-ray ``saturation plateau'' observed for young fast rotators.
