5|$|The protagonist's {{mission is}} made clear when they <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sacred vessel called the Ark of the Heavens {{is the only}} thing that can {{penetrate}} Nelgel's defenses. The protagonist then travels 500 years into the past, where the Ark of the Heavens was last used in recorded history. After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of the Heavens. Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful. During the end credits, the protagonist is greeted by the sage from before, who informs them that despite Nelgel's defeat, the seal he had on the central continent was still active.|$|E
25|$|The sight {{distance}} {{needed for a}} given situation is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and maneuver time (MT). Perception-reaction time is {{the time it takes}} for a road user to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> reaction is needed to a road condition, decided what maneuver is appropriate, and start the maneuver. Maneuver time is {{the time it takes to}} complete the maneuver. The distance driven during perception-reaction time and maneuver time is the {{sight distance}} needed.|$|E

25|$|For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dialectical method {{could only}} be adopted {{if it could be}} applied to itself—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct {{previous}} false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox Marxism. Indeed, the material tensions and class struggles of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same revolutionary potential within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva {{who created the}} world. Rabbi Akiva {{answered}} that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof. Rabbi Akiva {{asked him what he}} was wearing. The heretic said that it was a garment. Rabbi Akiva asked him who made it. The heretic replied that a weaver had. Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he did not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he did not realize that the world was made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva's disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpenter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.|$|E
25|$|Produced on a shoestring, about 75% of {{the budget}} was funded by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (The Irish Film Board), plus some of Carney's own money. The {{director}} gave his salary to the two stars, and promised {{a share of the}} back-end for everyone if the film was a success. Shot with a skeleton crew on a 17-day shoot, the filmmakers saved money by using natural light and shooting at friends' houses. The musical party scene was filmed in Hansard's own flat, with his personal friends playing the partygoers/musicianshis mother, Catherine Hansard, is briefly featured singing solo. The Dublin street scenes were recorded without permits and with a long lens so that many passersby didn't even <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> film was being made. The long lens also helped the non-professional actors relax and forget about the camera, and some of the dialogue ended up being improvised.|$|E

500|$|This {{novel was}} widely popular {{and led to}} García Márquez's Nobel Prize {{as well as the}} Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1972. William Kennedy has called it [...] "the first piece of {{literature}} since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race," [...] and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published in response to it. Despite the many accolades the book received, García Márquez tended to downplay its success. He once remarked: [...] "Most critics don't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude {{is a bit of a}} joke, full of signals to close friends; and so, with some pre-ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves." ...|$|E

500|$|The ruling communist/military {{establishment}} {{slowly and}} gradually came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> deal {{of some sort}} with the opposition would eventually be necessary {{and would have to}} include the leading Solidarity figures. Solidarity as such, a labor union representing workers' interests, was unable to reassert itself after the martial law and later in the 1980s was practically destroyed, but preserved in the national consciousness as a myth that facilitated social acceptance of systemic changes previously deemed unthinkable. The Solidarity organization as a mass movement, and with it its dominant social democratic element (supporters of democratic socialism), had been defeated. Solidarity's name had continuously been used, but the opposition movement split to form rival groups of different political orientations. According to a new intellectual consensus, [...] "democracy was grounded not in an active citizenry, as had been argued from the mid-1970s through 1981, but in private property and a free market". The current view no longer entailed broad political participation, emphasizing instead elite leadership and a capitalist economy. Solidarity became a symbolic entity, its activists openly assumed ideological [...] "anti-communist" [...] positions and its leadership moved to the right. Solidarity was now represented by a small number of individuals, of whom Lech Wałęsa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Leszek Balcerowicz were about to assume particularly decisive roles. They were proponents of unfettered free market, strongly influenced by the American and West European financial and other interests.|$|E

Puck is still her boyfriend. She appears in [...] "Jagged Little Tapestry" [...] along with Tina to help Becky convince her new boyfriend that she is in every club of the school. Quinn, Tina, Sue, and Coach Roz get a huge surprise when they find out that Becky's boyfriend, Darrell, does not have Down syndrome like Becky does. They all get a big lesson when they confront him and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person with Down syndrome should be treated like everyone else. Despite being Santana and Brittany's best friend, she is notably absent during their wedding in [...] "A Wedding". She is mentioned several times during the Pilot's parallel episode [...] "2009", as Finn's cheerleader girlfriend. She is later seen during Don't Stop Believin' watching the performance with Sue and Santana.

Jane resolves to return to Mississippi with Hal, but she can't resist covering one more story, that of taking the confession of a gangster's moll. When the story is published, Jane is kidnapped by the gangster.

[...] Jane realizes that she is truly in love with Bill, and agrees to marry him, which is caught by the newsreel cameras. [...] Hal returns to his very staid life in Mississippi.|$|E
2500|$|Other gaffes {{are due to}} Margaret's ignorance; {{accustomed}} to London's chic salons, she is unaware that she is seen as wearing her shawl [...] "as an empress wears her drapery" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 7) and serving tea with [...] "the air of a proud reluctant slave". She receives marriage proposals awkwardly: Henry Lennox' declaration of love is [...] "unpleasant" [...] and makes her uncomfortable, and she feels [...] "offended" [...] and assaulted by John Thornton's proposal. Margaret naively believes that the rioters can be negotiated with and is unaware {{that she and her}} brother, Frederick, resemble a loving couple on a train-station platform (O'Farrell, 1997, p.68). Bodenheimer (1979) sees this [...] "mistakenness" [...] as purposeful: [...] "In its every situation, whether industrial politics or emotional life, traditional views and stances break down into confusing new ones, which are rendered in all the pain of mistakenness and conflict that real human change entails" [...] (Bodenheimer, 1979 p.282). Perhaps this is why Margaret's blunders do not always have negative consequences (O'Farrell, 1997, p 163); when she admits she is disappointed that Thornton has refused to hire Higgins, she is ashamed that he hears her remark. Thornton reconsiders, eventually offering Higgins a job. In the final chapter, she does not seem to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> [...] "simple proposition" [...] to bail out the factory (a business arrangement) could hurt Thornton's pride or be seen as shocking from a [...] "lady". Bodenheimer interprets scenes like this as [...] "deep confusion in a time of personal change and revision" [...] (Bodenheimer, 1979 p.293) which brings the lovers together (O'Farrell, 1997, p 163).|$|E
