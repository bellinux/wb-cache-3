40|$|For {{crosstalk}} noise calculation, computing switching windows of a net helps us identify noise sources accurately. Traditional approaches use a single continuous switching window for a net. Under this model, <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> {{is assumed to}} happen any time within the window. Although conservative and sound, this model can result in too much pessimism since in reality the exact timing of <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> is determined by a path delay up to the net, i. e. the underlying circuit structure does not always allow <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> at arbitrary time within the continuous switching window. To address this inherent inaccuracy of the continuous switching window, we propose a refinement of the traditional approaches, where <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> {{is characterized by a}} set of discontinuous switching windows instead of a single continuous window. Each continuous switching window is divided into multiple windows, called time slots, and the <b>signal</b> <b>switching</b> activity of each slot is analyzed separately to calculate the maximum noise with more accuracy. By controlling the size of a time slot we can trade off accuracy and runtime, which makes this approach highly scalable. We have confirmed by experiments on industrial circuits that up to 90 % of the noise violations detected by the traditional approach can be unreal. 1...|$|R

In the case of a manual tandem, operators had a special seven segment display which displayed the entire telephone number. In later mechanical tandems, PCI was used because it was a faster than <b>revertive</b> pulse <b>signaling,</b> and would thus allow for quicker call completion times.|$|R

Secondly, given a switched system, a sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} the proposed <b>switching</b> <b>signal</b> is derived by expressing the <b>switching</b> <b>signal</b> as an infinite walk on a directed graph representing the switched system.
