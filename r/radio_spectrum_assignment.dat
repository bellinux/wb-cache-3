30|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>assignment</b> and {{coordination}} {{has been under}} government administration. Licensing to a particular dominant operator {{for a long period}} has been the traditional method for spectrum assignment in order to avoid interference and collisions. This assignment method reduces the risk associated with spectrum acquisition so that relatively large investments of capital expenditure (CAPEX) can be made to develop wide area wireless communication services, which may take a relatively long time to become stable and to establish profitable businesses. On the other hand, timely spectrum allocation for new wireless network development is necessary to deal with increasing market demand. However, since existing wireless networks occupy extensive parts of the available radio spectrum, there is insufficient spectrum available to all new wireless networks. Thus, various regulatory bodies consider possibilities to address this problem via shared use of spectrum. For example, in the USA FCC [1 – 3] considers to allow sharing of unused portions of TV band [4 – 6], in Europe a comprehensive study for the European Commission on conditions and options in secondary spectrum trading is done [7], and in Japan the government implemented a frequency band on a registration basis (4.9 [*]GHz– 5.0 [*]GHz) to promote shared use of spectrum [8].|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{unprecedented}} growth of mobile broadband services, radio spectrum regulation is undergoing a substantial review in the European Union (EU). The radio spectrum presents a three-level regulatory context. At international level, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulates the allocation of radio spectrum. At regional level, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) promotes cooperation and coordination between European countries. At national level, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are responsible for assigning the radio spectrum. In addition, the EU has also the power to regulate the radio spectrum. The EU regulatory framework for radio spectrum has only recently been set up. Therefore, an exhaustive understanding {{of the role of the}} EU in the three-level regulatory context of radio spectrum is still lacking. Against this background, the purpose of this thesis is to shed light on the implications of the EU regulatory framework for radio spectrum. In other words, this thesis aims to address the following research question: how does the EU influence the three-level regulatory context of radio spectrum? In order to answer this research question, three academic papers are written, each focusing on the role of the EU in one regulatory level. Paper 1 focuses on the international level. Theories of international relations are employed to assess the effectiveness of the EU in influencing international negotiations on radio spectrum regulation. Paper 2 explores the regional level. Theories of EU integration provide the tools to understand the issue of competence distribution between EU and EU member states in the policy field of radio spectrum. Paper 3 deals with the national level. Theories on the regulation-innovation relation guide the assessment of a specific national regulatory regime, which has been particularly promoted by the EU. Although <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>assignment</b> is a national responsibility, the EU may indirectly impact on the national context by providing EU member states with ideas on innovative regulatory tools. A qualitative research strategy is adopted to conduct the research work described in this thesis. In particular, this research work is characterised by an iterative inductive-deductive process between theory and empirical data, whereby purpose, theoretical framework and data collected progressively and mutually shape one another. This thesis is mainly based on secondary data, retrieved from official documents, reports, news articles, academic papers and books. Backward and forward snowballing techniques are used to systematically find relevant secondary sources of data. This thesis concludes that the EU regulatory framework influences the three regulatory levels of radio spectrum to different extents. Firstly, the EU influences the international level thanks to the presence of the European Commission (EC) in international fora. The EC has the right to attend international negotiations on radio spectrum regulation and can oversee the actions of EU member states. Secondly, the EU impacts on the regional level by promoting harmonised availability of radio spectrum across the EU. To this objective, the EU adopts policy instruments which are legally binding for all EU member states. Furthermore, the EC cooperates with the CEPT in order to build consensus across the EU. Thirdly, the EU’s influence on the national regulatory level is confined to general regulatory principles for <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>assignment.</b> Nevertheless, the EU can still leverage on national regulation, by encouraging EU member states to adopt specific regulatory instruments. Although interesting implications of the EU regulatory framework for radio spectrum are ascertained in this thesis, the influence of the EU on the three-level regulatory context of radio spectrum has not been captured thoroughly. Future research in the form of a more systematic evaluation of the EU’s actorness (Bretherton & Vogler, 2006) is necessary to capture the relevance of the EU’s influence on both the international and regional regulatory levels. In addition, a detailed analysis of the issue of competence distribution between EU and EU member states is critical for better evaluating the extent to which the EU influences radio spectrum regulation at national level...|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} {{input to}} {{the exploitation of}} mobile broadband known as <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> is a scarce resource, whose allocation and eventual assignment by telecommunications regulator and spectrum authorities across the world is of outmost importance.

Current network scenario is experiencing the huge spectrum scarcity problem due to the fixed assignment policy so in this method great amount of spectrum remain unused. To overcome this limitation the spectrum allocation must be in dynamic manner. In this paper the spectrum allocation is discussed thoroughly. Interference is the most important factor that needs to be considered. It is caused by the environment (noise) or by other radio users. It limits the possibility of <b>spectrum</b> reuse. Channel <b>assignment</b> is one of the techniques used to control interference in the network. There exist a trade-off between network capacity and level of contention.

It is the process of simultaneous selection of operating central frequency and bandwidth. In doing so, the process of sensing the spectrum becomes very crucial; it must be reliable, accurate and efficient. The accuracy of sensing affects the overall operation of cognitive networks. Accurate results not only lead to higher utilization of the spectrum but also preserve the privacy of primary user. Accuracy of sensing is highly affected by the natural causes like noise, shadowing, fading etc. There are many other challenges as well, like, hardware requirements, hidden node problem, security, sensing frequency and duration, decision fusion etc. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

30|$|Mobile and {{wireless}} communications services have experienced an explosive {{growth over the}} last decades. Increasing demand for wireless communication makes the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> more preciously. But the electromagnetic <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> is a limited natural resource; the use of which is licensed by government agencies. The conventional spectrum management policies use inflexible <b>spectrum</b> <b>assignment</b> to prevent mutual interference all the time. This {{has led to the}} artificial <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> scarcity that most of the available <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> has already been allocated to various services. The frequency allocation chart [1] in the United States indicates multiple allocations over all of the frequency bands. On the other hand, careful studies of the spectrum usage pattern by Spectrum Policy Task Force (SPTF) have revealed that many portions of the allocated <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> experience low utilization and they are either unoccupied or partially occupied {{for long periods of time}} [2]. In fact, recent measurements have shown that 70 % of the allocated spectrum is not utilized [2]. Extensive measurements also indicate that many portions of licensed spectrum lie unused at any given time and location [3]. Even when a channel is actively used, the bursty arrivals of many applications result in abundant spectrum opportunities at the slot level.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{measurement}} results unveiled by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reports in [1, 2], precious <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> resources are underutilized {{and a large}} number of spectrum holes exist under traditional fixed <b>spectrum</b> <b>assignment</b> rules, which grant exclusive access to primary users (PU) and pay little attention to spectrum usage efficiency. Considering the changing radio environment and low spectrum usage efficiency, cognitive radio (CR) [3] technologies have been introduced with flexible <b>spectrum</b> <b>assignment</b> schemes to improve the spectrum usage efficiency. Furthermore, based on software-defined radio (SDR) [4] and CR [3] technologies, novel cognitive techniques with multi-domain radio environment cognition, autonomous decision making, self-reconfiguration, and intelligent learning abilities are proposed to improve both the spectrum usage efficiency and end-to-end (e 2 e) network performance in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) [5].|$|R

This paper proposes a learning automata‐based dynamic frame length TDMA scheme for slot assignment in clustered wireless ad‐hoc networks with unknown traffic parameters, where the intra‐cluster communications are scheduled by a TDMA scheme, and a CDMA scheme is overlaid on the TDMA to handle an interference‐free inter‐cluster communication. In this method, each cluster‐head is responsible for a collision‐free slot assignment within the cluster and determines the input traffic parameters of its own cluster members. It then takes these traffic parameters into consideration for an optimal channel access scheduling in the cluster. The medium access control (MAC) layer in each cluster is based on a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, in which each host is assigned a fraction of the TDMA frame proportional to its traffic load.
