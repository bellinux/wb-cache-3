25|$|Screening for {{glaucoma}} {{is usually}} performed {{as part of}} a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma should include measurements of the intraocular pressure via tonometry, anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy, and examination of the optic nerve to look for any visible damage to it, or change in the cup-to-disc ratio and also rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test should be performed. The <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and/or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).|$|E

These photoreceptors developed and made the necessary neural connections to the animal's <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> cells, a key step in the restoration of sight.

40|$|Purpose. To compare subfoveal choroidal, central <b>retinal,</b> and peripapillary <b>nerve</b> fiber layer (RNFL) {{thickness}} after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) {{with red}} and green laser in diabetic patients. Study Design. Randomized clinical trial. Methods. A total of 50 patients with bilateral proliferative diabetic retinopathy and no diabetic macular edema underwent PRP. One eye was randomly assigned to red or green laser. Subfoveal choroidal, central retinal, and RNFL thicknesses were evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks after treatment. Results. The mean subfoveal choroidal, central <b>retinal,</b> and peripapillary <b>nerve</b> fiber layer (RNFL) thickness increased significantly in each eye 6 weeks after PRP (P values in red laser group: < 0. 01, 0. 03, and < 0. 01, resp., and in green laser group < 0. 01, < 0. 01, and < 0. 01). There {{was no difference between}} red and green laser considering subfoveal choroidal, central <b>retinal,</b> and peripapillary <b>nerve</b> fiber layer (RNFL) thickness increase after PRP (P values: 0. 184, 0. 404, and 0. 726, resp.). Conclusion. Both red and green lasers increased mean subfoveal choroidal, central <b>retinal,</b> and peripapillary <b>nerve</b> fiber layer (RNFL) thickness significantly 6 weeks after PRP, but there is no difference between these two modalities in this regard...|$|R

2500|$|While {{generally}} considered {{invisible to the}} human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after Röntgen's landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint [...] "blue-gray" [...] glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself. Upon hearing this, Röntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube {{on the opposite side}} of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina), direct excitation of <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of phosphorescence in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.|$|E
50|$|Scanning laser {{polarimetry}} {{is the use}} of {{polarised light}} to measure the thickness of the <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber layer as part of a glaucoma workup. The GDx-VCC is one example.|$|E
50|$|The <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber layer (nerve fiber layer, stratum opticum, RNFL) {{is formed}} by the {{expansion}} of the fibers of the optic nerve; it is thickest near the porus opticus, gradually diminishing toward the ora serrata.|$|E

Developing an efficient algorithm for medical image segmentation has been a demanding area of growing research of interest during the last decades. The initial step in computer aided diagnosis of retinal medical image is generally to segment the nerves present in it. The second step is to analyze each area separately to find the presence of pathologies in it. This paper reports on segmenting of the nerves by separating the retinal images using the combination of Improved Fuzzy-C-Means Clustering along with the Enhanced multidimensional multiscale parser (EMMP) algorithm. The performance of this proposed approach is proved to be better for a threshold value of 120.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the status of}} treatment of ocular injuries in servicemen in grassroots hospitals,and the rate of misdiagnosis. Methods The data of 953 cases of ocular injury attended in 21 regimental hospitals from 2002 - 01 - 01 to 2008 - 12 - 31,were retrospectively analyzed. The course of diagnasis and trcatment of ocular injuries was investigated,including the interval between injury and the first surgery,the reason leading to delay of surgery,variety misdiagnosis,and the causes leading to misdiagnosis,etc. The collected data were then statistically analyzed by SPSS 13. 0 software. Results Among 109 cases of open ocular injury, 98 (89. 9 %) of them were closed with suture,and 68 (62. 4 %) were sutured primarily within 24 hours. The common cause of delayed operation was a delay of transfer. The longest interval for the operation of closed injury of eyeball was in region Ⅲ. The frequent misdiagnoses were <b>retinal</b> detachment,optic <b>nerve</b> injury,foreign objects in eyeball and false blindness.

5000|$|Building on his elucidations from Neuropaths Author Afterword, Bakker {{presents}} {{the metaphor of}} the Blind Brain Hypothesis as a magicians coin trick. By Bakkers argument the brain has evolved to process a prodigious amount of perceptual information regarding its local environment tracking natural objects with causal histories. Coin tricks through sleight of hand or misdirection exploit the brains need for that causal history, confounding the brains ability to process the coins causal history. Given the central assumption of Blind Brain Hypothesis, that [...] "information that finds its way to consciousness represents {{only a small fraction of}} the brain’s overall information load," [...] humans are likely likewise unable to account for the causal history of thoughts and behaviours. It supposes that our conscious awareness of information processed by the brain is preceded by what Bakker calls here information horizons. Again Bakker draws upon the analogy of the eyes perceptual thresholds, this time highlighting that half of all the <b>retinal</b> <b>nerves</b> process information exclusively from the receptor rich fovea, and also extends that metaphor to speculate about the information horizons of our temporal field and the experience of the [...] "Now." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a recent}} study of 26 {{patients}} with confirmed FA, all patients had evidence of optic nerve dysfunction, although only five were visually symptomatic. [...] The optic neuropathy differed from that of LHON or DOA, displaying a pattern of <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber layer (RNFL) loss and no preferential involvement of papillomacular bundle.|$|E
50|$|In binasal hemianopsia, {{vision is}} missing in the inner (nasal or medial) half of both {{the right and left}} visual fields. Information from the nasal visual field falls on the {{temporal}} (lateral) retina. Those lateral <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers do not cross in the optic chiasm. Calcification of the internal carotid arteries can impinge the uncrossed, lateral retinal fibers leading to loss of vision in the nasal field.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{examination}} of the optic nerve with an ophthalmoscope may reveal a swollen optic nerve, but the nerve may also appear normal. Presence of an afferent pupillary defect, decreased color vision, and visual field loss (often central) are suggestive of optic neuritis. Recovery of visual function is expected within 10 weeks. However, attacks may lead to permanent axonal loss and thinning of the <b>retinal</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber layer.|$|E

50|$|More recently, the {{development}} of a special technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) has allowed better visualization of the retinal layers.

50|$|Complete {{crossing}} (decussation) of {{the nerves}} at the optic chiasm in birds has also stimulated research.

40|$|PURPOSE: Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) has {{revolutionized the}} diagnosis and management of adult <b>retinal</b> and optic <b>nerve</b> disease. Children were deprived of this technology until the recent development of handheld spectral-domain OCT (HH-SDOCT). In this article, we review the applications of OCT imaging in pediatric ophthalmology. METHODS: This study was {{a review of the}} literature. RESULTS: The acquisition and interpretation of pediatric tomograms differ significantly from those for adults, with adjustments needed to account for the shorter axial lengths, higher refractive errors, and ongoing <b>retinal</b> and optic <b>nerve</b> development in the pediatric eye. Handheld SDOCT is increasingly being used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and nonaccidental injury (NAI) by providing additional morphologic information that is not normally clinically discernible. The role of HH-SDOCT in streamlining diagnosis in infantile nystagmus syndrome, retinal dystrophies, and degenerations has been established. Optical coherence tomography can also help differentiate between pediatric intraocular tumors, for example, hamartomas and retinoblastoma; monitor tumor progression; and monitor treatment response. In addition, HH-SDOCT is establishing its role as a noninvasive monitoring tool in children affected by optic nerve pathology such as glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy and hypoplasia, optic pathway glioma, and pseudotumor cerebri. CONCLUSIONS: Handheld SDOCT can provide novel insights into the natural history of <b>retinal</b> and optic <b>nerve</b> diseases in young children. For example, in achromatopsia and albinism, in vivo OCT studies have provided evidence of altered but ongoing retinal development in early childhood, which suggests that potentially targeting treatment at an earlier age may optimize visual function by normalizing retinal development.
