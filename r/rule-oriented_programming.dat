40|$|Abstract Data-centric, {{distributed}} {{programming for}} embedded systems with harsh resource constraints poses {{a heavy burden}} upon a developer. In this paper, we describe how rule-based programming can alleviate these problems by combining middleware and application at the programming level. We describe in detail the programming primitives and {{the implementation of the}} FACTS middleware architecture. Based on statistics derived from three representative tasks specific to wireless sensor networks, we illustrate how our approach allows for aggressive optimization as well as writing expressive application-level code. We summarize our experience by proposing several <b>rule-oriented</b> <b>programming</b> patterns...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{computer}} networking and {{the globalization of}} economy have forced enterprises to adopt a distributed structure which, in turn, implies distribution of resources, particularly their information systems. Therefore, {{it is important to}} provide enterprises with integration tools to consolidate the information available throughout their distributed information systems and databases. One approach to the integration problem that assures flexibility and scalability is the use of the metadata concept. This concept has {{led to the development of}} a Metadatabase system, that is, a knowledge base containing both logical and physical data characteristics of local systems. The Metadatabase may be seen as a specialized information warehouse which stores information about distributed information systems, their structures, and the mechanisms used to process and store the information. Based on the Metadatabase, a software infrastructure, the <b>Rule-Oriented</b> <b>Programming</b> Environment (ROPE), was deve [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Mobile and {{environmental}} sensing {{technology can be}} used to assess human behaviour and mental health trajectories outside of laboratories and in ecologically-relevant settings. To achieve maximum benefit, the set of equipment and the monitoring patterns must be personalised to respect individual needs and fit into individual lifestyles. We have developed a sensor network infrastructure for mobile phones and homecare using a <b>rule-oriented</b> <b>programming</b> architecture to monitor the activity signatures of people with Bipolar Disorder (BD). We believe that the use of this rule-based paradigm within the network for a mental health setting to be a contribution of this work. We are evaluating the effectiveness of the technology in an ongoing technical trial with control participants as a precursor to studying the effectiveness of the system for use with people with BD. In this paper, we report the design and development of the monitoring system along with preliminary findings from the technical trial of the system, and discuss future developments...|$|E
40|$|A <b>rule-oriented</b> {{approach}} to <b>programming</b> mobile psychiatric monitoring systems was designed. Initial simulations of rule processing have tested system personalisation issues and reviewed {{characteristics of the}} rule-oriented approach including the degree of task expressiveness and ease of expressing domain knowledge. A technical trial is being prepared to analyse the approach in a non-simulated environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} facing today’s manufacturing enterprises {{is not just}} how to integrate “islands ” of information across the enterprise, but also how {{to keep them in}} sync with the changing needs and technology. A new approach for solving some of the problems related to growth and change in an integrated environment involving multiple information systems working together is developed. This approach entails (1) a metadatabase serving as the knowledge base for enterprise integration, (2) a concurrent architecture using the metadatabase for integration, and (3) a <b>rule-oriented</b> <b>programming</b> environment (ROPE) for implementing and managing the concurrent architecture. The paper presents the ROPE method, which contributes in its own right to the concurrent processing of distributed rulebase systems. 1. ADAPTIVENESS AND INTEGRATION: A NEW APPROACH Manufacturing enterprises in today’s global market place are hard pressed to deal with diversity, in both products and technologies. They typically need to customize their products (and therefore processes) to respond to customer’s rapidly changing needs, and, at the sam...|$|E
