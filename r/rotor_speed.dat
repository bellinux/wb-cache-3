25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail <b>rotor</b> <b>speed</b> approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|Most CMGs hold <b>rotor</b> <b>speed</b> {{constant}} using {{relatively small}} motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects. [...] Some academic {{research has focused}} on the possibility of increasing and decreasing <b>rotor</b> <b>speed</b> while the CMG gimbals. [...] Variable-speed CMGs (VSCMGs) offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the output torque from the rotor is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion. The primary practical benefit of the VSCMG when compared to the conventional CMG is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous CMG singularity avoidance and VSCMG cluster reorientation. Research has shown that the rotor torques required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional CMG rotor motors. Thus, the practical benefits of VSCMGs are readily available using conventional CMGs with alterations to CMG cluster steering and CMG rotor motor control laws. The VSCMG also {{can be used as a}} mechanical battery to store electric energy as kinetic energy of the flywheels.|$|E

The corrected flow rate through the turbojet ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 55 lb/s. The pressure ratios for the compressor and turbine ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 3 and from 1. 7 to 4. 3, respectively. The resulting performance maps showed the correct overall trend of increasing flow rate and pressure ratio with higher <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds.</b> However, the individual speed lines were very inconsistent and lacked discernible trends.

Overall, the phase averaged wall-pressure distributions were consistent with previous results. The ??switch?? in the pressure distribution measured by Suryanarayanan (2003) and Robic (1999) from pressure to suction between the seal entrance and exit occurs at and above a whirl ratio of 0. 7 for 1800 RPM and 0. 4 for 3600 RPM. For both <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds,</b> decreasing the flow rate by one-half also decreases the wall pressure fluctuation distributions by one-half. For whirl ratios less than 0. 5, the phase averaged pressure field was relatively constant which leads to minimal forces being imparted on the rotor by the fluid in the annulus. Talyor-Gortler vortices are measured for 1800 RPM and Re= 24000 at whirl ratios 0. 1 and 0. 3 - 0. 7. As the whirl ratio increases past 0. 5, longitudinal vortices begin {{to emerge in the}} pressure contours and skew axially with 180 ?? shifts occurring when the Taylor-Reynolds ratio is large enough. Longitudinal vortices were measured for both <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds</b> when the whirling motion is greater than 1400 RPM for Re= 12000 and greater than 1600 RPM for Re= 24000. Attempts were made to apply Childs (1983) procedure for finding the rotordynamic coefficients of annular seals; however, the seal moves in a non-circular orbit about the seal??s center so Childs analysis cannot be applied...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a wind tunnel test program to {{determine}} the performance loads and dynamic characteristics of the Composite Flexbeam Tail Rotor (CFTR) for the AH- 64 Advanced Attack Helicopter are reported. The CFTR uses an elastomeric shear attachment of the flexbeam to the hub to provide soft-inplane S-mode and stiff-inplane C-mode configuration. The properties of the elastomer were selected for proper frequency placement and scale damping of the inplane S-mode. Kinematic pitch-lag coupling was introduced to provide the first cyclic inplane C-mode damping at high collective pitch. The CFTR was tested in a wind tunnel over the full slideslip envelop of the AH- 64. It is found that the rotor was aeroelastically stable throughout the complete collective pitch range and up to <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds</b> of 1403 rpm.

40|$|Owning to {{the rapid}} growth {{of the power of the}} modern computer, rotordynamic {{analysis}} of TC rotor-bearing systems has nowadays become feasible. The work in this book is concerned with the nonlinear rotordynamic modelling, simulation and analysis in the rotor-FRB system of TCs. The conventional linear eigenvalue analysis is shown first in a gradually deepening manner to provide a deeper insight into the results from nonlinear simulations and reported experimental results. It is subsequently found that the onset of first two nonlinear jumps can be effectively predicted by the linearized FRB model, although the rotordynamic characteristics at higher <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds</b> can hardly be linearly predicted. The desired oil-film forces for nonlinear simulations are calculated from a newly proposed analytical method, which is extended from the Capone’s journal bearing model. Stationary simulations under the perfectly balanced condition show two major subsynchronous components throughout the considered speed range, while the inclusion of in-phase unbalance places a considerable effect on the rotor response at relatively low speed and delays the occurrence of oil-film instability. However, at higher <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds,</b> the lower subsynchronous component can still establish the dominance. The engine induced vibrations are also considered, and it is seen that the rotor response over the lower end of the speed range will be considerably affected, whereas, at higher <b>rotor</b> <b>speeds,</b> the engine induced vibrations can be suppressed by the dominant lower subsynchronous vibrations. Through carrying out many run-up and run-down simulations, the FRB outer clearance is found to be a critical parameter of the rotordynamic performance of the investigated TC rotor-FRB system, since distinct frequency maps are obtained with varying FRB outer clearances. The nonlinear effects of unbalance are also investigated, and it is observed that the the rotor response can be considerably affected by the magnitude and distribution of the imposed unbalance...|$|R
