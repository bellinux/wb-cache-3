The results of the theraphy, were ten dogs survived and twelve dogs died due to Parvovirus infection. Fluidtheraphy {{supported}} by antibiotic, antiemetic or antacids administrations were essential for Parvovirus infection in dogs. The <b>recoveryrate</b> of this dogs was 45...|$|E
40|$|The use of cryoprotectants for the {{cryopreservation}} {{of human}} spermatozoa, oocytes, zygote, earlycleavage stage of embryos and blastocyst {{is an integral}} part of almost every human In Vitro Fertilizationprogram. Moreover, the cryopreservation of these types of cells by direct plunging into liquid nitrogen (- 196 °C) usually requires a high concentration of cryoprotectant with a consequent of cytotoxic effect. Theaim of this study was to observe the effect of ethylene glycol concentration on the spermatozoa <b>recoveryrate</b> following vitrification process. Earle’s balanced salt solution + 0. 25 M sukrosa + 1 % human albumineserum as basic solution supplemented with some different concentrations of etylene glycol (ie: 36. 25 %; 18. 25 %; 9. 12 %; 4. 56 %; 1. 14 % and 0. 57 %) were used to evaluate the motility and viability of spermatozoafollowing vitrification. Human’s spermatozoa from ejaculates with progressive motility and viability above 50 % were used as samples. Samples were mixed with vitrification solution and then loaded into 0. 25 mLstraws, equilibrated for 10 minutes at room temperature before plunged into liquid nitrogen. Spermatozoathawing was done at 24 hours after the vitrification. The results showed that, the decrease of spermatozoamotility and viability were observed at the highest (100 %, 96. 70 %, respectively) in the samples that wereadded with vitrification medium contained 36. 25 % of ethylene glycol. On the other hand, the decrease ofthe spermatozoa motility and viability were found at the lowest (14. 11 %, 43. 81 %, respectively) in thesamples without ethylene glycol supplementation. It can be concluded that the highest spermatozoa <b>recoveryrate</b> was obtained from the vitrification using a low concentration of ethylene glycol...|$|E
40|$|A {{fair price}} is one main factor {{that should be}} owned by {{organization}} which will affect the Cost <b>RecoveryRate</b> (CRR). Cost Recovery Rate in Functional Services Unit of Conservation in FKG UA Teeth and MouthHospital (RSGM FKG UA) in 2012 was only 81, 57 %. This research aimed to analyzed cost recovery rateoptimization based on unit cost calculation using activity based costing method. The results showed that thenumber of most frequently conducted in RSGM FKG UA was Teeth Filling in class III/IV /VI around 373 patients(the unit cost was Rp 57. 282, 00). The least frequently conducted was Pulpectomy (there were only 11 patientswith unit cost Rp 89. 078, 00). This study concluded that CRR optimization {{can be done by}} (a) evaluate the tariff,number of services, and considering the cost efficiency in RSGM FKG UAKeywords: Activity Based Costing, Cost Recovery Rat...|$|E
40|$|The {{neonicotinoid}} pesticide imidacloprid {{is among}} the top sold agrochemicals worldwide. Due to its widespread use in mixtures with different solvents and co-adjuvants, studying {{the environmental impact of}} its derived commercial formulations has become mandatory. In this study we used laboratory ecotoxicological tests to quantify the impact of the imidacloprid-containing formulation Confidor® 20 SL on the terrestrial and aquatic compartments. Lethal and sublethal effects of recommended application doses of the product were assessed on standard terrestrial invertebrates Eisenia fetida and Folsomia candida whereas the toxicity of leachates from contaminated soils was evaluated in the aquatic model organisms Daphnia magna and Raphidocelis subcapitata. The exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of imidacloprid causedno mortality to earthworms (LC 50 of 4. 23 mg imidaclopridkg- 1 dry soil) but altered their behavior and reproductionpatterns (EC 50 values for avoidance and reproduction testsof 0. 43 and 1. 40 mg imidacloprid kg- 1 dry soil, respectively). Effects on collembolans F. candida were negligible. Imidacloprid presented moderate leachability, with <b>recoveryrates</b> that ranged from 25. 4 to 50. 4 % of the amountpresent in soils and concentrations in water extracts from 13. 05 to 71. 8 μg L- 1. Standard aquatic ecotoxicity testswere not able detect chronic or acute toxicity in standardtest organisms. Nonetheless, concentrations of the insecticidein water extracts were high enough to pose a lethalthreat to several other non-standard aquatic organisms...|$|R
