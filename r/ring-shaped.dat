Another toxin is phallolysin, which has shown some hemolytic (red blood cell–destroying) activity in vitro. An unrelated compound, antamanide, has also been isolated.|$|E
5|$|The titular Halo is an enormous, <b>ring-shaped</b> {{artificial}} space station/planet, which (according to Bungie Studios) has {{a diameter}} of ten thousand kilometers. Halo sits at a Lagrange point between a planet and its moon. Centrifugal force created by {{the rotation of the}} station provides the ring's gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect <b>ring-shaped</b> {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first pharyngeal arch and usually attached to {{the spine of the}} sphenoid bone, may be found attached to the rim of the foramen.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive <b>ring-shaped</b> or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore follows {{a boy and}} his pet dog as they are {{inadvertently}} transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The player guides both {{the boy and his}} shapeshifting dog through Evermore, a world that is composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a <b>ring-shaped</b> menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series.|$|E
5|$|South of the Eagle Nebula on {{the border}} with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary W Serpentis, whose primary is a white giant that is {{interacting}} with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an accretion disk, {{and was one of the}} first discovered Serpentids, which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong far-ultraviolet spectral lines. It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase, and will evolve first into double periodic variables and then classical Algol variables. Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing Wolf–Rayet binary CV Serpentis, consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a <b>ring-shaped</b> nebula, likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary. The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.|$|E
5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two <b>ring-shaped</b> clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.|$|E
5|$|Master Chief first {{appears in}} the games as the protagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization, Halo: The Flood. During the opening {{cinematic}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting slipspace, the Pillar of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo, a <b>ring-shaped</b> megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a {{last line of defense}} against an alien parasite called the Flood. The Covenant accidentally release the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. At the request of the installation's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death. Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactor core. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a Longsword spacecraft, believing they are the only survivors.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear pores, {{which provide}} aqueous {{channels}} through the envelope, {{are composed of}} multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9nm wide, due {{to the presence of}} regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric <b>ring-shaped</b> structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and <b>ring-shaped</b> pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E

25|$|In {{some parts}} of Austria, <b>ring-shaped</b> {{pastries}} called Beugel are sold {{in the weeks before}} Easter. Like a bagel, the yeasted wheat dough, usually flavored with caraway, is boiled before baking. However, the Beugel is crispy and can be stored for weeks. Traditionally it has to be torn apart by two individuals before eating.|$|E
25|$|Item #1 {{rules out}} the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. As one {{moves from the}} center of a galaxy to its furthest extremity, the ability to support life rises then falls. Hence the galactic {{habitable}} zone may be <b>ring-shaped,</b> sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{authored}} important {{works on}} astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved {{the existence of}} equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including <b>ring-shaped</b> and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).|$|E
25|$|Liostenogaster vechti {{is a type}} of eusocial hover wasp {{within the}} family Vespidae. They are {{typically}} brown and yellow in color and are considered a passive aggressive species. Their stings are less painful to humans than other social wasps, and they engage in associative nest foundation. They are mostly found on the Malaysian peninsula and are known for living in large clusters of small <b>ring-shaped</b> nests.|$|E
25|$|The bublik in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the obwarzanek (in {{particular}} obwarzanek krakowski) in Poland {{are essentially}} larger bagels {{with a wider}} hole. Similar to bagels, these breads are usually topped with sesame and poppy seeds.

In Lithuania, similar breads are called riestainiai and sometimes by their Slavic name baronkos.|$|E
25|$|C-reactive protein (CRP) is an annular (<b>ring-shaped),</b> pentameric protein {{found in}} blood plasma, whose levels rise in {{response}} to inflammation. It is an acute-phase protein of hepatic origin that increases following interleukin-6 secretion by macrophages and T cells. Its physiological role is to bind to lysophosphatidylcholine expressed {{on the surface of}} dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate the complement system via the C1Q complex.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, {{the term}} {{aromaticity}} {{is used to}} describe a cyclic (<b>ring-shaped),</b> planar (flat) molecule with a ring of resonance bonds that exhibits more stability than other geometric or connective arrangements with {{the same set of}} atoms. Aromatic molecules are very stable, and do not break apart easily to react with other substances. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compounds—they might be cyclic, but only aromatic rings have special stability (low reactivity).|$|E
25|$|In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell {{demonstrated}} that a nonuniform solid ring, solid ringlets or a continuous fluid ring would also not be stable, {{indicating that the}} ring must be composed of numerous small particles, all independently orbiting Saturn. Later, Sofia Kovalevskaya also found that Saturn's rings cannot be liquid <b>ring-shaped</b> bodies. Spectroscopic studies of the rings carried out in 1895 by James Keeler of Allegheny Observatory and Aristarkh Belopolsky of Pulkovo Observatory showed Maxwell's analysis was correct.|$|E
25|$|In CT, an X-ray tube {{opposite}} an X-ray detector (or detectors) in a <b>ring-shaped</b> apparatus rotate {{around a}} patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram). CT is {{acquired in the}} axial plane, with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.|$|E
25|$|In 1886 Eiffel also {{designed}} the dome for the Astronomical Observatory in Nice. This {{was the most}} important building in a complex designed by Charles Garnier, later among the most prominent critics of the Tower. The dome, with a diameter of , was the largest in the world when built and used an ingenious bearing device: rather than running on wheels or rollers, it was supported by a <b>ring-shaped</b> hollow girder floating in a circular trough containing a solution of magnesium chloride in water. This had been patented by Eiffel in 1881.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{problems}} following tick bites {{were recognized}} {{starting in the}} 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, <b>ring-shaped</b> rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström {{was the first to}} propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{red blood}} cells, the merozoites grow first to a <b>ring-shaped</b> form {{and then to}} a larger form called a trophozoite. Trophozoites then mature to schizonts which divide several times to produce new merozoites. The {{infected}} red blood cell eventually bursts, allowing the new merozoites to travel within the bloodstream to infect new red blood cells. Most merozoites continue this replicative cycle, however some merozoites upon infecting red blood cells differentiate into male or female sexual forms called gametocytes. These gametocytes circulate in the blood until they are taken up when a mosquito feeds on the infected vertebrate host, taking up blood which includes the gametocytes.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric <b>ring-shaped</b> oligomer. This <b>ring-shaped</b> oligomer {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E
25|$|Binding of {{the cell}} {{division}} cycle 6 (Cdc6) protein to the origin recognition complex (ORC) is an essential step in the assembly of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication. Cdc6 binds to the ORC on DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, which induces {{a change in the}} pattern of origin binding that requires Orc10 ATPase. Cdc6 requires ORC in order to associate with chromatin and is in turn required for the minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7) to bind to the chromatin. The ORC-Cdc6 complex forms a <b>ring-shaped</b> structure and is analogous to other ATP-dependent protein machines. The levels and activity of Cdc6 regulate the frequency with which the origins of replication are utilized during the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The Saturn V Instrument Unit is a <b>ring-shaped</b> {{structure}} {{fitted to}} the top of the Saturn V rocket's third stage (S-IVB) and the Saturn IB's second stage (also an S-IVB). It was immediately below the SLA (Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter) panels that contained the Lunar Module. The Instrument Unit contains the guidance system for the Saturn V rocket. Some of the electronics contained within the Instrument Unit are a digital computer, analog flight control computer, emergency detection system, inertial guidance platform, control accelerometers and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU. NASA's contractor to construct the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines (IBM).|$|E
25|$|In Turkey, a salty and fattier form {{is called}} açma. However, the <b>ring-shaped</b> simit, is {{sometimes}} marketed as Turkish bagel. Archival sources {{show that the}} simit has been produced in Istanbul since 1525. Based on Üsküdar court records (Şer’iyye Sicili) dated 1593, the weight and price of simit was standardized for the first time. Famous 17th-century traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote that there were 70 simit bakeries in Istanbul during the 1630s Jean Brindesi's early 19th-century oil paintings about Istanbul daily life show simit sellers on the streets. Warwick Goble made an illustration of the simit sellers of Istanbul in 1906. Surprisingly, simit {{is very similar to}} the twisted sesame-sprinkled bagels pictured being sold in early 20th century Poland. Simit are also sold on the street in baskets or carts, like bagels were then.|$|E
25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a <b>ring-shaped</b> floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E
