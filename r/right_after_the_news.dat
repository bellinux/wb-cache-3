40|$|This {{article is}} {{a study of the}} doping scandal that broke out in April 2011 and {{concerned}} the esteemed Estonian sportsman and Olympic gold medal winner, Andrus Veerpalu. The current analysis is based on the material collected from the Estonian online media throughout two years, from April 2011 to March 2013, during which Andrus Veerpalu’s court case was actively followed by the Estonian sports circles and laymen alike. We will analyse how the image of Andrus Veerpalu as a national hero (almost as a demigod) is constructed on the Internet and how it relates to analogous stories about athletes from earlier times (e. g., to folk stories about Georg Lurich). In the current case, the main reason why the majority of the nation supported Andrus Veerpalu was because they believed in him. This pervading thread emerged <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> spread, and was present in various contexts: the online comments of the articles that dealt with the scandal, Facebook community posts in the group entitled “We believe in Andrus Veerpalu” (“Usume Andrus Veerpalu”), which was created to show solidarity with the sportsman, etc. All this indicated the high status of the athlete and laid a foundation for a sincere and positive discourse. This was in opposition to the negative discourse of irony, which questioned the honesty of the athlete and foregrounded subversive emotions like indifference and superiority towards the topic. The analysis will address the emergence of the Olympic hero as a national myth, and point at various narratives that deal with the scandal through the present-day genres of urban legends, conspiracy stories, and Internet humour...|$|E

5000|$|The {{motif of}} Everyman {{has been used}} in various works of art and {{literature}} all around the world. Ludwika Amber and her poems might be a particularly interesting example. Being a Polish poet living in Australia, she wrote about her alter ego inspired by Mr. Cogito, bearing the name of Mrs. Tree ("Pani Drzewo"). It's the main character of [...] "Mrs. Tree tells the story of Australia" [...] ("Pani Drzewo opowiada o Australii", 1994) and [...] "The Talk with Mr. Cogito" [...] ("Rozmowa z Panem Cogito"). She wrote it in 1998, to pay tribute to Zbigniew Herbert, <b>right</b> <b>after</b> hearing <b>the</b> <b>news</b> about his death. However, Amber {{was not the only one}} to refer to Mr. Cogito. For instance, he inspired The Russian Graduate Seminar Group, appeared in articles, like the one in Boston Review and became an object of multiple academic and non-academic researches.|$|R

But his son had actually planned a surprise visit to his dad, when his band was taking his first national tour, which was taking them through Nashville and Memphis. He never had the chance...|$|R
5000|$|Kuno Becker as Drew Ramos (season 3; recurring, season 2; main), Elena's troubled brother. He {{witnessed}} his father's death, {{which turned}} him into an angry juvenile delinquent. He ended up enlisting in <b>the</b> military and <b>after</b> a tour in Iraq straightened him up, he found work on oil rigs all over the globe. He is on <b>the</b> run now <b>after</b> blowing up <b>the</b> Ewing rig. In the episode Denial, Anger, and Acceptance, it is revealed that he started the Southfork fire with an IED disguised as an air freshener (which served as a heat sensor) and using rocket fuel as a catalyst. He acted out of anger after learning of JR's deception from Elena; however, it must be known that Drew thought no one was home when he set the fire, just as he thought the rig would be unoccupied {{at the time the}} bomb went off. At first, Sue Ellen thought she started <b>the</b> fire <b>after</b> drunkenly setting fire to John Ross's wedding invitation and initially took the blame for it. Once Drew learned that Nicolas was using his sister as {{a means to an end}} and not because Nicolas truly wanted justice for the Ramos family, Drew threatened to expose him and then is executed by Luis, one of the cartel enforcers. Nicolas gave <b>the</b> order <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> official <b>news</b> that Sue Ellen started the fire, who made Drew's execution looked like an apparent suicide.|$|R
