The catalytic activity of zeolite for the toluene alkylation is approximately proportional {{to the number of}} its mid-strength acidic sites, except for SAPO- 34 with small channels and MOR with strong acidity. Moreover, the acidic sites for catalyzing toluene alkylation are weaker in strength than those for catalyzing toluene disproportionation, but slightly stronger than those for catalyzing the reaction of methanol to hydrocarbons. On the other hand, zeolites with 12 -membered <b>ring</b> <b>channels</b> may lead to the further alkylation of xylene and the rapid deactivation by coking.

40|$|The {{deactivation}} of the 10 -membered ring zeolites MFI, FER and TON was studied {{during the}} skeletal isomerization of n-butene {{in the presence}} of butadiene. The rate of deactivation per butadiene molecule was found to increase with the concentration of butadiene and the contact time. It decreased {{in the presence of}} Pt and hydrogen.
