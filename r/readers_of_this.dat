The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E
25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young <b>readers</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E
500|$|Baker {{finds the}} most {{striking}} feature of the parable to be the absence of description of the fish. Baker asks: [...] "Do <b>readers</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> anecdote learn about the fish, or rather about {{a certain kind of}} authoritarian teaching practice?" [...] Baker claims that Pound's images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and the scientific method. The reader, following Pound's student, reaches knowledge through intuition alone; the decomposing fish, so far as epistemology is concerned, has become [...] "transparent".|$|E
