40|$|Quinine is a bitter-tasting, {{crystalline}} white powder. It {{is obtained}} from the bark of the cinchona tree and belongs {{to the group of}} alkaloids. In medicine quinine is used to treat malaria and nocturnal leg cramps. In the food sector, quinine is used as a flavouring mainly in beverages like bitter lemon and tonic water. When larger amounts of quinine are consumed, it can constitute a health problem for some consumer groups. BfR sees risks in particular for quinine intakes during pregnancy. For instance, a newborn baby, whose mother had drunk more than 1 litre tonic water a day in the weeks up to its birth, suffered health disorders. Already today quinine must be mentioned by name in the list of ingredients of quinine-containing products. BfR also believes {{that there is a need}} for information which attracts the attention more particularly of pregnant women and other risk groups to possible health impairments. Motor vehicle drivers should be informed that larger amounts of quinine-containing bitter beverages can cause visual disturbances. BfR recommends raising awareness about the possible health risks from quinine to consumers. Specific information should be provided about the symptoms of quinine hypersensitivity and cinchonism (typical adverse reactions to quinine). Consumers should be advised to immediately stop their quinine intake if these symptoms occur, and to consult a doctor. BfR is of the opinion that the problems of quinine-containing bitter soft drinks underline the importance of the systematic recording of adverse reactions that occur in conjunction with the consumption of foods. The Institute, therefore, explicitly supports the setting up of a central <b>reporting</b> <b>office...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{cultivation of}} genetically modified (GM) crops in the European Union (EU) necessitates, according to EU legislation, the setting up of a General Surveillance (GS) system that {{should be able to}} detect unanticipated effects of GM crops on the environment. Although the applicant is responsible for setting up GS as well as for reporting the results, EU Member States may implement additional supporting surveillance programmes. Devising a GS system to detect unanticipated effects is not straightforward and requires clearly defined protection goals, suitable indicators that are linked to measurable parameters and an objective system for assessing the data. This paper describes a number of recommendations {{for the development of a}} General Surveillance system of the soil ecosystem specifically focussed on the situation in the Netherlands. The overarching protection goal of General Surveillance is ‘soil quality’, which is translated into more practical terms of ecosystem services that are relevant for soil quality, and that can be used to select measurable parameters and thus make a link with actual measurements. Ultimately, if and when effects on ecosystem services are detected, decision makers will have to decide whether these effects are acceptable or not. As a support for these decision-making processes, this paper discusses the modalities for the development of a stakeholder participation model. The model involves three groups of persons: the land users, the soil scientists and the decision makers. For reasons of cost effectiveness, a GS system of the soil ecosystem will have to make use of existing networks. The Dutch Soil Quality Network (DSQN) offers an existing infrastructure for soil sampling for GS. Finally, the GS system may be extended to contain data from the Dutch Ecological Monitoring Network, earth observation systems as well as other data resources such as farmers questionnaires or reports form organisations involved in nature conservation. Ideally these data are compiled by a Central <b>Reporting</b> <b>Office</b> (CRO) and maintained in a Geographic Information System (GIS) based database...|$|E
