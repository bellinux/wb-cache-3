Before a studbook was established it was thought that this captive population was too small and lacking in genetic diversity for any <b>re-population</b> program to be successful, but {{since the start of the}} central register more and more South China tigers have been identified in zoos across China.|$|E

25|$|Following the sack, Mehmed's {{main concern}} with Constantinople {{had to do}} with {{rebuilding}} the city's defenses and <b>re-population.</b> Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace. Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be deported to Constantinople by September.|$|E
25|$|From 1946-1949 the IPSFC put several severe {{restrictions}} on the Fraser River fishing industries, including delayed starts to the fishing season as well as ending the season early. The severe strategies that preferred maximum protection were a success as the salmon population continued to increase into the early 1950s. Some argued that these {{restrictions on}} the salmon harvest were more beneficial to salmon <b>re-population</b> than {{the construction of the}} costly fishways, criticizing the decision to build them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Re-population</b> of the {{recently}} vacated Arab dwellings by Jews became official policy by December 1948, but the process began slowly. The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional urban center of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilized soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. In 1953 the nearby neighborhood of Afridar was incorporated and the current name Ashkelon was adopted. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers {{with a population of}} 24,000.|$|E
25|$|During the Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the country}} {{experienced}} {{a revolution in}} agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which made the Chinese economy the most advanced in the world from about 1100. Mastery of wet-field rice cultivation opened up the hitherto underdeveloped south of the country, while later northern China was devastated by Jur'chen and Mongol invasions, floods and epidemics. The result was a dramatic shift in the centre of population and industry from the home of Chinese civilization around the Yellow River {{to the south of}} the country, a trend only partially reversed by the <b>re-population</b> of the north from the 15th century. By 1300, China had fallen behind Italy in living standards.|$|E
500|$|The city {{remains in}} a {{destroyed}} condition. Syria has left the ruins in place and built a museum to memorialize its destruction. [...] It maintains billboards at the ruins of many buildings and effectively preserves it in the condition that the Israeli army left it in. The former residents of the town have not returned and Syria discourages the <b>re-population</b> of the area. However, in the 2004 census by the Central Bureau of Statistics, a small population of 153 people living in 28 households was recorded, all living {{in the neighborhood of}} Rasm al-Rawabi. The Rough Guide to Syria describes the current appearance of the city: [...] "The first sight of the flattened houses on Quneitra's outskirts is the most dramatic; many of the unscathed roofs simply lie on top of a mass of rubble, leaving the impression of a building that has imploded." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species were {{strongly associated with}} the radical materialism of the enlightenment and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for {{one part of the}} anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by <b>re-population,</b> rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades.|$|E
2500|$|The 9th century {{saw this}} state expand southward, with Castilian and Asturian noblemen {{acquiring}} {{most of the}} northern Meseta, while in Galicia, a similar impulse led to the conquest and <b>re-population</b> of the regions of Astorga, southern Galicia, and northern Portugal down to Coimbra, by noblemen mostly proceeding from northern Galicia. Also significant was the pretended discovery of the tomb of Saint James the Great at what would become Santiago de Compostela; the shrine constructed there became the religious center of the nation, {{as well as being}} the destination of a major international pilgrimage route, the Way of St. James. This increased the political and military relevance of Galicia, and its noble families aspired to positions of power within the kingdom through either military force or by matrimonial alliance with the royal family. To the east, this southern expansion led the capital of the Christian kingdom to be moved to the city of León, from which time the state is usually called the Kingdom of León. This same kingdom was frequently known as either Gallaecia or Galicia (Yillīqiya and Galīsiya) in Al-Andalus Muslim sources up to the 14th century, as well as by many European Christian contemporaries.«Considerandum etiam quod, cum sint quinque regna in Ispaniorum, videlicet Arragonensium, Navarrorum et eorum qui specificato vocabulo Ispani dicuntur, quorum metropolis est Tolletum, item incholarum Galicie et Portugalensium»: Narratio de Itinere Navali Peregrinorum Hierosolymam Tendentium et Silviam Capientium A.D. 1189" [...] Cf.

2500|$|Like plants, animals {{display a}} range of {{abilities}} to cope with fire, but they differ from plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although birds are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit {{from being able to}} take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some birds are potentially responsible for intentional fire propagation to flush out prey. [...] Mammals are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. Amphibians and reptiles may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud. Some arthropods also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril. Microbial organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but {{are more likely to be}} able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire. The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover. Certain species of fungi, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit <b>re-population</b> of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.|$|E

5000|$|Siberian Tiger <b>Re-population</b> Project was {{proposed}} in 2009 to reintroduce Amur tigers {{back to their}} former lands and including the former ranges in Central Asia once inhabited by their closest relatives, the Caspian tigers. In 2010, two pairs of Siberian tigers, exchanged for Persian leopards to southwestern Russia, were set to be reintroduced in Iran's Miankaleh peninsula. Currently, the big cats (one of them had died) are being held in captivity in Eram zoo. Siberian tigers were also proposed to be reintroduced to a suitable habitat near the international river of Amu Darya in Central Asia and near the Ili River delta in Kazakhstan.
