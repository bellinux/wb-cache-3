A July 1994 GAO document revealed that Air Force and DoD studies from 1986 and 1991 stated the C-17 could use 6,400 more runways outside the U.S. than the C-5; {{it was discovered that}} these studies only considered runway dimensions, but not <b>runway</b> <b>strength</b> or Load Classification Numbers (LCN).

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{requirement of}} military transport aircraft {{is the ability}} to manoeuvre on soft soil runways whereby the flotation depends on the aircraft / <b>runway</b> <b>strength</b> relationship. One must take into consideration that when operating on substandard airfields take-off distance is increasing and extra propulsive force must be available. Hence predictions for the manoeuvrability, the higher rolling resistance compared to rigid surfaces, not to mention the runway damage should be available. These effects depend essentially on the deformation of soil in contrast to rigid pavements where the rolling resistance is caused mainly by internal hysteresis losses in the tyre. In the design process of concurrent engineering MBS (Multibody System) simulation tools take an important place. In contrast to the CBR (California Bearing Ratio) method, which is until now state-of-the-art in the landing gear design process for soft soil runways, multibody simulation allows to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle, tyre and soil system. The simulation of tyre-soil interaction by means of multibody tools makes use of analytical modelling and specific measurable parameters are used to describe the physical soil behaviour. With analytical approaches for the tyre-soil contact area it is possible to reach quite a good approximation for the real contact conditions. The main problems i...|$|E

We implemented a novel stochastic airport channel model describing the main wireless propagation phenomena related to the airport environment. Multi-path and Doppler effects with the potentially resulting inter-symbol interference and inter-carrier interference have been taken into account, respectively. System performance is evaluated for the forward link case in the apron, parking, taxi and <b>runway</b> scenarios, showing <b>strengths</b> and lacks of the system characteristics. For the most critical scenario (i. e., the parking one), an investigation of the reduction of the pilot sub-carriers spacing and on the introduction of antenna diversity is proposed, showing large performance gains...|$|R
40|$|All runways used {{by civil}} {{aircraft}} are classified {{according to their}} strength and they are given a load classification number (LCN) or single wheel loading (SWL) of its weakest point. Currently, the load bearing <b>strength</b> of a <b>runway</b> is reported using empirical approaches recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The ICAO has adopted a pavement classification system for reporting airfield strength known as aircraft classification number (ACN) and pavement classification number (PCN). This system reports a unique PCN, which indicates that an aircraft with an ACN equal to or less than the PCN can operate on the runway. ACN/PCN method enables evaluation of interaction between the aircraft landing gear and the runway pavement without {{a reference to the}} pavement thickness and it does not take potential runway deflection into account for this reporting. This paper presents an argument to include analytically calculated potential deflection for <b>runway</b> bearing <b>strength</b> reporting. It may be considered as a step towards rationalising the ACN-PCN system. The study reviews and analyses the suitability of the international practice of LCN reporting system. In conclusion, it is suggested that the bearing <b>strength</b> of a <b>runway</b> pavement should be reported using analytically calculated potential deflection. aircraft landing gear; airport runways; runway deflection; engineering; runway strength; load classification number; LCN reporting; single wheel loading; SWL; load bearing strength; pavement classification number; PCN; aircraft classification number; ACN; pavement thickness; critical infrastructures...|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} part of 1965 about one dozen {{personnel}} of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute extraction system (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, a drogue parachute would be released, pulling palletized cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity extraction system (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the <b>runway.</b> At full <b>strength</b> the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, high velocity or low-velocity drop techniques.|$|R
40|$|Airport runway {{pavement}} always {{subjected to}} huge impact loading {{due to the}} hard landing of aircraft on the pavement surface. Therefore runway pavements should have sufficient impact resistance capability to avoid damage causing by hard impact like surface deflection in downward or penetration since the repair works is cumbersome within the operating condition of airport and also increases the service life cost of the pavement structure. Several research works {{have been carried out}} on airport runway pavement to measure the present condition of pavement and also to predict future performance of it. However, most of the works are confined by pavement response under moving aircraft loading. Nevertheless, no comprehensive research work is yet conducted to identify the controlling factors which might have significant effect in changing the common pavements damage like surface penetration depth under impact of aircraft. Therefore, a 3 D FE study is conducted to determine some effective factors in controlling the top surface penetration depth of runway pavement. Among the exterior factors, mass of the impactor, velocity of the impactor, impact angle and boundary conditions are selected and as interior factors, thickness of the <b>runway</b> pavement, compressive <b>strength</b> and density of materials used in the runway pavement are selected...|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{required}} {{in order to}} identify the optimum snow processing technique that will produce a compact and bonded snow suitable for the construction of high strength snow roads and <b>runways.</b> Improving the <b>strength</b> of the snow runway at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica would be required if the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) considers wheeled aircraft as a possible delivery system. The types of conventional snow processing equipment that produces the highest snow strength were quantitatively verified using image analysis techniques and other on-site testing methods. Tests were performed in West Yellowstone MT where the snow properties and winter ambient temperatures are as analogous as possible to those at South Pole during the austral summer and in other Arctic and Antarctic regions. Four separate sites were established using Logan Manufacturing Company (LMC) equipment and the test plots were observed for 12 weeks. The processed snow was tested for hardness (strength) using a soil penetrometer, and strength values were correlated to bond density. The temperature distributions in the processed snow were monitored using a thermocouple stack and CR 10 datalogger and are correlated to strength increases or decreases. Plane sections of the different plots were taken on a weekly basis and image analyses were performed {{in order to determine the}} critical microstructural properties of the snow that contribute to compressive strength increases or decreases as image analysis provides information on volumetric density, surface density per unit volume, etc., and the ability to estimate bonding in snow. Manual volumetric density measurements were also made and are compared to the stereological results. Test results indicate that a powered tiller with a relatively dense tooth population provided the highest strength snow...|$|R
