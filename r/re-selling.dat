5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court found that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is in violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from <b>re-selling</b> or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E

25|$|The central {{government}} funds were deemed insufficient by the Hainan authorities {{for the construction}} of the island's other infrastructures (water works, power stations, telecommunications, etc.) and had taken a very liberal interpretation of the economic and trade regulations for Hainan and thirteen coastal cities; the regulations did not mention on prohibiting the <b>re-selling</b> of second-hand goods. Some of the proceeds, from unsold units, were later retrieved by the {{central government}} to re-finance the special district.|$|E
25|$|Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a New York City {{rare book}} dealer, makes his living conning people into selling him {{valuable}} antique books for a low price, and then <b>re-selling</b> them to private collectors. Corso meets with wealthy book collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), who has recently acquired {{a copy of}} the (fictional) book The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows by 17th-century author Aristide Torchia, one of only three extant copies. The book is an adaptation of one written by the Devil himself and purportedly contains the means to summon the Devil and acquire invincibility and immortality. Balkan believes two of the copies are forgeries. He hires Corso to check all three and acquire the legitimate one by any means necessary.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Vassar College and marrying classmate Elkin Kwesi Pianim (the son of Ghanaian {{financial}} and political mogul Kwame Pianim) in 1993, Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, {{along with her}} husband, purchased a pair of NBC-affiliate television stations in California, KSBW and KSBY, with a $35million loan provided by her father. By quickly re-organising and <b>re-selling</b> them at a $12million profit in 1995, Elisabeth emerged as an unexpected rival to her brothers for the eventual leadership of the publishing dynasty's empire. But after divorcing her first husband in 1998 and quarrelling publicly with her assigned mentor Sam Chisholm at BSkyB, she struck {{out on her own}} as a television and film producer in London. She has since enjoyed independent success, in conjunction with her second husband, Matthew Freud, the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud (the founder of psychoanalysis) whom she met in 1997 and married in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{chairmanship}} of Matt Ridley, Northern Rock had a business plan which involved borrowing heavily in the UK and international money markets, extending mortgages to customers based on this funding, and then <b>re-selling</b> these mortgages on international capital markets, {{a process known as}} securitisation. In August 2007, when the global demand from investors for securitised mortgages was falling away, the lack of money raised by this meant that Northern Rock became unable to repay loans from the money market. This problem had been anticipated by the financial markets, which drew greater attention to it. On 14 September 2007, the bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, to replace funds it was unable to raise from the money market. This led to panic among individual depositors, who feared that their savings might not be available should Northern Rock go into receivership. The result was a bank run – the UK's first in 150 years – where depositors lined up outside the bank to withdraw all of their savings as quickly as possible, particularly since everyone else was doing the same.|$|E

2500|$|Motor vehicle theft is {{a common}} form of {{property}} crime, often perpetrated by youths for joyriding. [...] The FBI includes attempted motor vehicle thefts in its Uniform Crime Report (UCR) definition. [...] About 15-20% of motor vehicle thefts are committed for their auto parts or with an intent of <b>re-selling</b> them on the black market. [...] Crime prevention and target-hardening measures, such as car alarms and ignition locks, have been effective deterrents against motor vehicle theft, as have been practices such as etching VINs on car parts.|$|E
2500|$|This major {{slump in}} flue-cured tobacco {{production}} {{did not affect}} fire-cured tobacco, and Blantyre and East Africa Ltd stepped up production on their estates. [...] However, there was increasing competition from African growers outside the estates on Crown land. To counter this competition, in the 1920s Tait Bowie, the company's General Manager, advocated that African smallholders were registered {{and that they should}} grow no more than half as acre of tobacco to reduce their output. Bowie wanted to ensure that the development of smallholder agriculture did not reduce the availability of labour on estates, and that estate owners would benefit fully from <b>re-selling</b> the tobacco that their tenants grew on parts of their estates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{real estate}} {{business}} practice of [...] "blockbusting" [...] was a for-profit catalyst for white flight and a means to control non-white migration. By subterfuge, real estate agents would facilitate black people buying {{a house in a}} white neighborhood, either by buying the house themselves, or via a white proxy buyer, and then <b>re-selling</b> it to the black family. The remaining white inhabitants (alarmed by real estate agents and the local newsmedia), fearing devalued residential property, would quickly sell, usually at a loss. Losses happened when they sold en masse, and would sell the properties to the incoming black families, profiting from price arbitrage and the sales commissions from both the blacks and the whites. By such tactics, the racial composition of a neighborhood population often changed completely in a few years.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect on}} foreign trade of price-regulation and profiteer-hunting as cures for {{inflation}} is even worse. Whatever {{may be the}} case at home, the currency must soon reach its real level abroad, with the result that prices inside and outside the country lose their normal adjustment. The price of imported commodities, when converted at the current rate o exchange, is far in excess of the local price, so that many essential goods will not be imported at all by private agency, and must be provided by the government, which, in <b>re-selling</b> the goods below cost price, plunges thereby a little further into insolvency. The bread subsidies, now almost universal throughout Europe, are the leading example of this phenomenon.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, {{very well}} said," [...] replied Mr. Campbell heartily. [...] "And now {{to come to}} the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here a little packet which {{contains}} four things." [...] He tugged it, as he spoke, and with some great difficulty, from the skirt-pocket of his coat. [...] "Of these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money for your father's books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have explained from the first) in the design of <b>re-selling</b> at a profit to the incoming dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and myself would be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round, will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie laddie, it's but a drop of water in the sea; it'll help you but a step, and vanish like the morning. The second, which is flat and square and written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness. And as for the last, which is cubical, that'll see you, it's my prayerful wish, into a better land." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{tickets for}} the first four {{readings}} here (the only readings announced) were all sold immediately, and many are now <b>re-selling</b> at a large premium. The {{tickets for the}} first four readings in New York (the only readings announced there also) were on sale yesterday, and were all sold in a few hours. The receipts are very large indeed; but engagements of any kind and every kind I steadily refuse, being resolved to take what is to be taken myself. Dolby is nearly worked off his legs, is now at New York, and goes backwards and forwards between this place and that (about the distance from London to Liverpool, though they take nine hours to do it) incessantly. Nothing can exceed his energy and good humour, and he is extremely popular everywhere. My great desire is to avoid much travelling, and {{to try to get the}} people to come to me, instead of my going to them. If I can effect this to any moderate extent, I shall be saved a great deal of knocking about. My original purpose was not to go to Canada at all; but Canada is so up in arms on the subject that I think I shall be obliged to take it at last. In that case I should work round to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and then take the packet for home.|$|E
6000|$|Correspondents {{from several}} {{places on the}} Sound, both on the British and American territories, men of various nationalities, have since written that {{the country on the}} Fraser River is rich in gold, and [...] "equal to any discoveries ever made in California." [...] The Times' correspondent, writing from Vancouver's Island on 10th June, says, [...] "The gold exists from the mouth of Fraser River for at least 200 miles up, and most likely much further, but it has not been explored; {{hitherto}} any one working on its banks has been able to obtain gold in abundance and without extraordinary labour; the gold at present obtained has been within a foot of the surface, and is supposed to have averaged about ten dollars per diem to each man engaged in mining. Of course, some obtain more, some less, but all get gold. Thompson River is quite as rich in gold as Fraser River. The land about Thompson River consists of extensive sandy prairies, which are loaded with gold also; in fact, the whole country about Fraser and Thompson Rivers are mere beds of gold, so abundant as to make it quite disgusting. I have already seen pounds and pounds of it, and hope before long to feast my eyes upon tons of the precious metal." [...] And the same high authority writes on 17th June,--"There is no longer room to doubt that all the country bordering on Fraser River is one continuous gold bed. Miners abandoning the partially exhausted placers of California, are thronging to this new Dorado, and the heretofore tranquil precincts of Victoria are now the scene of an excitement such as was witnessed at San Francisco in 1849, or since in Melbourne. Land has run up to prices fabulously high; and patches that six months ago were, perhaps, grudgingly purchased at the colonial price of 20 shillings the acre, are <b>re-selling</b> daily at a hundred times that amount. The small number of steam ships hitherto found sufficient for the commerce between San Francisco and these vicinities no longer suffices to convey a tithe of the eager applicants for passage. An opening for the enterprise of British capitalists such as was not anticipated has thus suddenly arisen, and the opportunity will, of course, be seized with alacrity.|$|E
