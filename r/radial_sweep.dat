These echoes are typically presented {{on a computer screen}} with a color-coding scheme depicting the reflection strength.Two problems have to be solved during such a visualization process. The first problem arises from the fact that typically the radar antenna turns around its position and measures the reflection echo distances from its position in one direction. This effectively means that the radar video data are present in polar coordinates. In older systems the polar oriented picture has been displayed in so called plan position indicators (PPI). The PPI-scope uses a <b>radial</b> <b>sweep</b> pivoting about the center of the presentation. This results in a map-like picture of the area covered by the radar beam. A long-persistence screen is used so that the display remains visible until the sweep passes again.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} set {{of experiments}} {{has been carried}} out on the DIII-D tokamak to measure the 2 -D (R,Z) structure of the divertor plasma in a systematic way using new diagnostics. Measurements cover the divertor radially from inside the X-point to the outer target plate and vertically from the target plate to above the X-point. Identical, repeatable shots were made, each having <b>radial</b> <b>sweeps</b> of the X-point and divertor strike points, to allow complete plasma and radiation profile measurements. Data have been obtained in ohmic, L-mode, ELMing H-mode, and reversed B{sub T} operation ({gradient}B drift away from the X-point). In addition, complete measurements were made of radiative divertor plasmas with a Partially Detached Divertor (PDD) induced by D{sub 2 } injection and with a Radiating Mantle induced by Impurity injection (RMI) using neon and nitrogen. The data set includes first observations of the radial and poloidal profiles of the X-point, inner and outer leg plasmas in PDD and RMI radiative divertor operation. Preliminary data analysis shows that intrinsic impurities {{play a critical role in}} determining the SOL and divertor conditions...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need to characterize the plasma plume of the NASA HiVHAc thruster {{in order to better}} understand the plasma physics and to obtain data for spacecraft interaction studies. To address this need, the HiVHAc research team {{is in the process of}} developing a number of plume diagnostic systems. This paper presents the initial results of the farfield current density probe diagnostic system. Farfield current density measurements were carried out before and after a vibration test of the HiVHAc engineering development unit 2 that simulate typical launch conditions. The main purposes of the current density measurements were to evaluate the thruster plume divergence and to investigate any changes in the plasma plume that may occur as a result of the vibration test. <b>Radial</b> <b>sweeps,</b> as opposed to the traditional polar sweeps, were performed during these tests. The charged-weighted divergence angles were found to vary from 16 to 28 degrees. Charge density profiles measured pre- and post-vibration-test were found to be in excellent agreement. This result, alongside thrust measurements reported in a companion paper, confirm that the operation of the HiVHAc engineering development unit 2 were not altered by full-level/random vibration testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{elements}} of transport into {{and across the}} scrape-off layer in the poloidal divertor tokamak ASDEX Upgrade are analysed for different operational regimes with emphasis on enhanced confinement regimes with an edge barrier. Utilizing the existing set of edge diagnostics, especially the high- resolution multi-pulse edge Thomson scattering system, in combination with long discharge plateaus, <b>radial</b> <b>sweeps</b> and advanced averaging techniques, detailed radial mid-plane profiles of diverted plasmas are obtained. Profiles are smooth across the separatrix, indicating strong radial correlation, {{and there is no}} remarkable variation across the second separatrix either. Together with measured input, recycling, pumping and bypass fluxes, a corrected separatrix position is determined and transport characteristics are derived in the different radial zones generally identified in the profile structure. Transport in the steep gradient region inside and across the separatrix shows typical ballooning-type critical electron pressure gradient scaling and, in parallel, even a clear correlation between radial electron density and temperature decay lengths (e. g. eta(e) = d(ln T) /d(ln n) similar to 2 for type-I ELMy H-modes). These findings indicate the importance of stiff profiles in this region, while diffusion coefficients are secondary parameters, determined essentially by the source distribution. The outer scrape-off layer wing exhibits a more filamentary structure with preferential outward drift especially in high-performance discharges, with formal diffusion coefficients far above the Bohm value in agreement with results on the old ASDEX experiment. A basic mechanism involved there seems to be partial loss of equilibrium and fast curvature-driven outward acceleration, in principle well known from theory, investigated decades ago in pinch experiments and utilized recently in high- field-side pellet fuelling...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{comparing}} the performance of classifiers. In this paper we study techniques for generating and evaluating bands on ROC curves. Historically this has been done using one-dimensional confidence intervals by freezing one variable - false-positive rate, or threshold on the classification scoring function. We adapt two prior methods and introduce a new <b>radial</b> <b>sweep</b> method to generate confidence bands. We show, through empirical studies, that the bands are too tight and introduce a general optimization methodology for creating bands that better fit the data, as well as methods for evaluating confidence bands. We show empirically that the optimized confidence bands fit much better and that, using our new evaluation method, it is possible to gauge the relative fit of different confidence bands. ...|$|E

40|$|The Integrative Freight Market Simulation (IFMS) {{is a new}} {{modeling}} {{framework for}} urban goods movements that attempts {{the development of a}} comprehensive freight transportation demand model that depicts both commodity flows and vehicle trips (Holguín-Veras, 2000). This model has a two-level solution approach. One level deals with the economic problem of estimating the provision of freight service consistent with market equilibrium and profit maximization, while the other level deals with the network problem of constructing tours which are consistent with the economic solution and other system constraints. The network problem is not strictly a traditional routing problem in that competition is incorporated into the process. To capture the effect of imperfect information and to create an environment of economic competition, a specified number of randomly selected nodes are available to two or more freight companies while the rest are available only to one company. This paper describes a method for solving the IFMS which consists of a “cluster first, route second ” approach. The clustering stage consists of a geometric clustering combined with a generalized assignment problem (GAP) to create clusters from which feasible tours can be constructed (Nygard et al. 1988). An initial clustering is performed using a version of the <b>radial</b> <b>sweep</b> method of Gillett and Miller (1974) which provides an estimate of the cost coefficients for the GAP. The GAP is solved to determine a minimum cost clustering with constraints that insure that the resulting node clusters can be turned int...|$|E
