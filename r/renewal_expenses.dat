In contrast with much optimization work pertaining to spatially contiguous maintenance works, its principal economic emphasis and objective focus are centered on the optimal allocation of current maintenance and periodic <b>renewal</b> <b>expenses,</b> on their yearly distribution among large network partitions, and on infrastructure pricing. The model equations are based on very simple assumptions of infrastructure degradation laws and on a manager's objective function optimized through optimal control procedures. Equations are tested on national French rail track segment databases using Box–Cox transformations and match rail regeneration and maintenance practices prevailing in France. More generally, the paper makes a broad contribution to capital theory, on the optimal maintenance and renewal of equipment, and defines a method applicable not only to other transport infrastructure but {{to a wide range}} of capital goods, including housing, cars and industrial machines...|$|E
40|$|In Japan, {{the aging}} of public {{facilities}} constructed {{during the period of}} high economic growth is progressing. While huge renewal investment is anticipated in the future, in addition to the reduction in tax revenues, the increase in assistance expenses etc. is expected to rise rapidly and there is concern that <b>renewal</b> and repair <b>expenses</b> will be secured. Furthermore, it is necessary to deal with the falling birthrate and the aging population and corresponding changes in the facility functions required. In response to these challenges, it was urgent to introduce "public facility management", which is a mechanism for comprehensively grasping the public facilities they possess and managing and borrowing them in conjunction with fiscal management. In this paper, in developing comprehensive management plan of Isahaya City, we first examined the current situation analysis and its characteristics in order to grasp the situation of public facilities etc. in Isahaya city...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} redress {{anthropogenic}} {{interference with the}} landscape {{is one of the}} discussed topics today not only in professional groups but also among the public, because mineral mining takes place in many places in the Czech Republic. More and more are beginning to promote nearnatural methods of <b>renewal</b> at the <b>expense</b> of recently prevalent technical reclamation. Except for question, how the exhausted places reuse or renew also researches, how the whole process has an impact on the local fauna and flora. The aim of this thesis was a qualitative comparison of water beetles among the forefield Bílina Mine and reclamation dumps Radovesice and Pokrok in North Bohemia province. It was evaluated 16 reservoirs in forefield and 15 reservois of dumps. A total of 36 taxa were found from which 19 were determined only at the species level. The most of taxa were located at post R 9 in the forefield, at 4 locations there were none of them. The most abundant was genus Haliplus. The collection took place using standard hydrobiological sampling by sieve. The material was preserved in alcohol, then separated, prepared and finally determined. The obtained data were evaluated and compared using the Jaccards index of similarity. It was tested hypothesis: Due to the good dispersion ability of water beetle is representation of species in the forefield the same as constitution of species in the newly ponds at reclamations. Calculation Jaccard index between locations of forefield and dump reached the highest value of similarity 66, 7 %, but over of the value 50 % moved only in 7 cases out of 465 possible combinations, thereby hypothesis was disproved. Found species were also evaluated from point of view conservation status according to the Red list of threatened species in the Czech Republic. This way was detected only one species, Laccophilus poecilus, falling into the category VU vulnerable. The determination must be examined...|$|R
