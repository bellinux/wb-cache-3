40|$|A new {{simultaneous}} derivatization and extraction {{method for}} the preconcentration of ammonia using new one-step headspace dynamic in-syringe liquid-phase microextraction with in situ derivatization {{was developed for}} the trace determination of ammonium in aqueous samples by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC–FLD). The acceptor phase (as derivatization reagent) containing ophthaldehyde and sodium sulfite was held within a syringe barrel and immersed in the headspace of sample container. The gaseous ammonia from the alkalized aqueous sample formed a stable isoindole derivative with the acceptor phase inside the syringe barrel through the <b>reciprocated</b> <b>movements</b> of plunger. After derivatization-cum-extraction, the acceptor phase was directly injected into LC–FLD for analysis. Parameters affecting the ammonia evolution and the extraction/derivatization efficiency such as sample matrix, pH, temperature, sampling time, and the composition of derivatization reagent, reaction temperature, and frequency of reciprocated plunger, were studied thoroughly. Results indicated that the maximum extraction efficiency was obtained by using 100 L derivatization reagent in a 1 -mL gastight syringe under 8 <b>reciprocated</b> <b>movements</b> of plunger per min to extract ammonia evolved from a 20 mL alkalized aqueous solution at 70 ◦C (preheated 4 min) with 380 rpm stirring for 8 min. The detection was linear in the concentration range of 0. 625 – 10 M with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9967 and detection limit of 0. 33 M (5. 6 ng mL− 1) based on S N− 1 = 3.

Methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA) were selected as model compounds of SCAAs. In this method, a micro-syringe pre-filled with derivatizing reagent solution (9 -fluorenylmethyl chloroformate) in the barrel was applied to achieve the simultaneous derivatization and extraction of two methylamines evolved from alkalized aqueous samples through the automated <b>reciprocated</b> <b>movements</b> of syringe plunger. After the derivatization–extraction process, the derivatized phase was directly injected into HPLC-FLD for analysis. Parameters influencing the evolution of methylamines and the HS-DIS-LPDE efficiency, including sample pH and temperature, sampling time, {{as well as the}} composition of derivatization reagent, reaction temperature, and frequency of <b>reciprocated</b> plunger <b>movements,</b> were thoroughly examined and optimized. Under optimal conditions, detections were linear in the range of 25 – 500  μg L− 1  for MA and DMA with correlation coefficients all above 0. 995.

Two castrated male pigs could successfully be shaped to press a lever with successive approximation by 3. 4 g food pellets and 2 s buzzers without additional food deprivation. Frequency of responses was increased from 5 /min to 10 /min during training with CRF. Rapid extinction was observed. In later sessions of acquisition, pigs hoarded food pellets by pressing the lever {{several times before}} going to the feeder. This hoarding behavior was eliminated when only the first response of the hoarding response was reinforced.

40|$|Effectiveness of rotatory and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>movements</b> in {{root canal}} filling {{material}} removal Abstract: The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the efficacy of reciprocating and rotary techniques for removing gutta-percha and sealer from root canals. Forty straight and oval single-rooted premolars were prepared up to size 30, filled with gutta-percha and sealer, and then randomly allocated to two experimental retreatment groups: ProTaper Retreatment System (PTRS) and WaveOne System (WS). Procedural errors, time of retreatment and apically extruded material were recorded for all the roots. The roots were radiographed after retreatment. The percentage of residual material was calculated using image analysis software. The data were analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and t tests, with a significance level set at 5 %. No system completely removed the root filling material from the root canal. No significant differences were observed between the systems, in terms of residual filling material in any tested third (p> 0. 05). WS was faster in removing filling material than PTRS (p < 0. 05). Extrusion was observed in 4 cases in PTRS and in 5 cases in WS. No procedural errors were observed in either group. It can be concluded that although no differences were observed in the efficacy of PTRS and WS for removing root filling material, WS was faster than PTRS...|$|R

In 1970 he became Head of Department, and from 1973 to 1976 he was also Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and Technology. At Belfast his major contribution was the invention of a novel turbine for generating electricity from wave-power. The Wells turbine rotates in one direction irrespective of the direction of axial fluid flow driving it and is best suited to devices containing an oscillating water column in which waves force the piston-like motion of a column of water in a chamber with the air above blown and sucked through the Wells turbine. Thus low-speed <b>reciprocating</b> <b>movement</b> is efficiently transformed into high-speed rotational motion of the turbine shaft, {{which is used to}} drive an electrical generator.

There {{was no need to}} lose energy converting <b>reciprocating</b> <b>movement</b> into rotational movement. The result was a remarkably compact free-revving engine which, in the 1960s, was hailed by some as the next major step forward in automobile design. It was later found that the characteristics of critical materials selected and applied by NSU to build production rotary engines were inappropriate to the stresses they would bear, and rotary-engined cars earned a reputation for unreliability. Engines required frequent rebuilding to replace worn apex seals, and warranty costs associated with installation of the engine in NSU’s second Wankel-engined model destroyed the financial viability of NSU, forcing a merger with Audi in 1969. The only large scale automaker to persist with the rotary engine—and then only for niche models—was Mazda: piston engines continued to dominate the world’s automobile engine bays. These events were not foreseen during the Spider’s production period.|$|E
50|$|The diagram {{shows the}} sound {{generation}} processes in an organ pipe {{and in the}} resonator of the Kienle Resonator System. To activate the organ pipe, the required air flow (black arrow) must be generated first in a sufficient quantity and supplied from below through the pipe foot. The air flow is directed through the windway against the upper labium where air vortexes replace each other, alternatingly between the inside and the outside. This process stimulates the air column in the tube and it starts to oscillate. An example {{of the distribution of}} the sound wave's fundamental tone created in the tube is shown in the diagram by red curves.

50|$|The {{machine gun}} feeds from the {{left-hand}} side {{through a variety}} of disintegrating ammunition belt types: the American M13 linked belt, the German DM6 counterpart to the M13 or the segmented German DM1 belt. The ratcheting wheel feed unit was designed as an easily removable module that is inserted into the bottom portion of the feed block (installed in place of the standard magazine well), below the barrel axis. As a result of this configuration (the bolt passes over the belt), the ammunition belt is aligned upside down compared to most other belt-fed weapons (that is, the links face downward). The feed mechanism is actuated by the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>movement</b> of the bolt; a curved cam slot {{on the bottom of the}} bolt engages an actuator in the feed mechanism, rotating the double sprockets and positioning a new round in the feed path. Simple conversion from belt to magazine feed is possible by installing an adapter in the feed block which enables the use of H&K’s proprietary 20-round box magazine (from the G3 rifle) or a 50-round drum magazine. The HK21 uses a modified G3 receiver that has been extended to the front sight base and is equipped with a detachable bipod (mounted either in front of the feed mechanism or at the muzzle) and tripod and vehicle mounting points. The HK21 has close to a 48% parts interchangeability with the G3.|$|E
50|$|The Barrett 240LWS {{features}} a removable and telescoping buttstock, that can has 6 adjustable positions. It {{differs from the}} buttstock of the 240LW by being half of its size in length, and doesn't have a polymer cheek piece. There are two telescoping rods that allows the buttstock to be extended to the desired position, when depressed from the top portion. The rods have indentations on them, which lock into positional latches within {{the rear of the}} buttstock. The hydraulic buffer is permanently encased within the stock and is necessary for recoil reduction from the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>movement</b> of the bolt group. Early prototypes had steel QD sling sockets {{on both sides of the}} stock, however current production versions will have solid steel sling loops on either side of it. This is to alleviate any damage that may occur to a sling mounted on the QD socket, and the amount of stress that it could take while carrying the machine gun. It also {{features a}} Picatinny rail that is longer compared to the Picatinny rail of the M240 machine guns, and where the Barrett M107A1 rear sight can be mounted and other various optics. The design of the feed tray cover hinge has been altered to be in the shape of a hexagon, thus allowing for the feed tray cover to be able to stay open while at a 45 degree angle to the receiver, while the machine gunner is loading a belt of ammunition. The feed tray has also been altered, with two protruding spring-loaded teeth which can bend in the direction of the ammunition belt. These teeth allows the operator to securely place a belt of ammunition on the feed tray, while at an upright angle, and not have the belt slip out while closing the cover. In addition they allow the operator to be able to squeeze the front of the belt into a closed cover because the teeth only bends in the direction of the belt, and the belt will pass over them, then the teeth will click upwards, thus locking the belt in place. Another click forward, and the belt of ammunition will be in place to fire. This allows the operator to feed a belt of ammunition into his 240LWS without ever having to possibly expose his position or line of sight, by opening the feed tray cover.|$|E

40|$|Most recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} of snakes have recognized two major clades within Serpentes: Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia. Alethinophidians feed predominantly on relatively large vertebrate prey, which they transport into {{and through the}} mouth via <b>reciprocating</b> ratcheting <b>movements</b> of the toothed palatopterygoid jaw arches. In contrast, scolecophidians are small-prey specialists, feeding almost exclusively on small arthropods. In addition, these diminutive, fossorial snakes lack many of the key morphological features which underlie the feeding mechanisms of alethinophidians, such as toothed palatopterygoid jaw arches and a distensible lower jaw. However, the functional significance of these morphological differences has remained poorly understood {{because there have been}} no detailed descriptions of feeding behavior in Scolecophidia. ^ I used magnified high-speed videography, videofluoroscopy, and standard histological and gross morphological preparations to study the functional morphology of the feeding apparatus in representatives of two families of Scolecophidia, Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae. In Leptotyphlops (Leptotyphlopidae), a mandibular raking mechanism is used to capture, ingest and transport prey. In this mechanism, the toothed anterior portions of the mandibular rami are rotated medially about the intramandibular joints in a bilaterally synchronous fashion. In contrast, Typhlops and Rhinotyphlops (Typhlopidae) feed via a maxillary raking mechanism, in which asynchronous rotations of the toothed maxillae are used to drag prey into and through the mouth. Both mandibular raking and maxillary raking involve exceptionally rapid (3 – 5 Hz) movements of the tooth-bearing elements of the jaws, thereby facilitating the ingestion of large numbers of small prey within relatively brief periods of time. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides a}} propulsion {{system based on}} "thuniform" movement of a foil member to achieve desired directional movement of a vehicle such as an unmanned submarine type of vessel. A pair of foil members are mounted to the vehicle body for <b>reciprocating</b> oscillating <b>movement</b> {{towards and away from}} each other, creating forward movement due to the compression of a fluid medium between the foil members and the expulsion of the compressed fluid rearwardly of the foil members. Each foil member is mounted to a pivot shaft for limited rotational movement with respect to the vehicle body. Damping means are connected between each pivot shaft and its associated foil member so that during operation of the propulsion system damping torque will offset hydrodynamic loads imposed on the foil members by the fluid medium. The damping means will in turn control the pitch angle of the foil members during operation, meaning that a thrust is generated for rigid foil members when moving at zero forward speed. The propulsion system of the invention exhibits increased efficiency and thrust in comparison to other such propulsion systems. The foil members are mounted to the vehicle body in such a manner that the thrust vector thereof can be directed through a full 360 degrees relative to the vehicle, thereby achieving superb maneuverability when the vehicle is provided with sets of the thrusters suitable located thereon.

40|$|Ten {{subjects}} balanced {{their own}} body or a mechanically equivalent unstable inverted pendulum by hand, through a compliant spring linkage. Their balancing process was always characterized by repeated small <b>reciprocating</b> hand <b>movements.</b> These bias adjustments were an observable sign of intermittent alterations in neural output. On average, the adjustments occurred at intervals of ∼ 400 ms. To generate appropriate stabilizing bias adjustments, sensory information about body or load movement is needed. Subjects used visual, vestibular or proprioceptive sensation alone and in combination {{to perform the}} tasks. We first ask, is the time between adjustments (bias duration) sensory specific? Vision is associated with slow responses. Other senses involved with balance {{are known to be}} faster. Our second question is; does bias duration depend on sensory abundance? An appropriate bias adjustment cannot occur until unplanned motion is unambiguously perceived (a sensory threshold). The addition of more sensory data should therefore expedite action, decreasing the mean bias adjustment duration. Statistical analysis showed that (1) the mean bias adjustment duration was remarkably independent of the sensory modality and (2) the addition of one or two sensory modalities made a small, but significant, decrease in the mean bias adjustment duration. Thus, a threshold effect can alter only a very minor part of the bias duration. The bias adjustment duration in manual balancing must reflect something more than visual sensation and perceptual thresholds; our suggestion {{is that it is a}} common central motor planning process.

Methods. The cyclic fracture resistance of rotary Ni-Ti endodontic instruments was tested with a special device aiming at recreating the same conditions for all instruments. The instruments were rotated at constant speed and torque up to fracture, recording the time to fracture in seconds. 10 Flex Master 25 / 06, 10 Protaper F 2, 10 Reciproc used in rotating motion and 10 Reciproc using in reciprocating mode were tested. A statistical analysis was applied to check differences between the groups. Results.
