For some <b>recordings,</b> only one soprano soloist is listed. <b>Recordings</b> with orchestras on period instruments in historically informed performances are highlighted. The first <b>recordings</b> in the 1960s combined the version in D major (BWV 243) with transposed Christmas interpolations. The type of orchestra is shown for an ensemble with period instruments in historically informed performance by green background.|$|E

5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed <b>recordings,</b> which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released <b>recordings,</b> often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit <b>recordings</b> are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
