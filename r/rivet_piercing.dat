40|$|To {{increase}} {{fuel efficiency}} and reduce emission, aluminium alloys have been increasingly used in automotive body-in-white structures for lightweighting. Due to its advantages {{over some of}} the more traditional joining technologies, self-piercing riveting (SPR) has been widely used for these lightweight structures. Research has showed that friction is a very important factor that influences both the riveting process and joint strength for SPR, but these influences have not been fully understood. In this paper, an innovative method was used to modify the local surface of the top sheet around the <b>rivet</b> <b>piercing</b> location with different impression tools (the central pin, the small ring, the medium ring and the large ring) and garnet particles to study the influence of local frictions on rivet inserting process, joint features and static lap shear strength. The results showed that the local surface textures on the aluminium sheet did not have significant influence on the rivet inserting process based on displacement-force curve analysis. The local surface textures could slightly change the joint features, especially the rivet head height, but overall this influence was not significant. The lap shear tests showed that ring impressions with garnet particles and central pin impressions on the bottom surface of the top sheet increased the static lap shear strength of the SPR joints. The results confirmed that the critical location for local friction influence on the lap shear strength was around the rivet leg piercing location...|$|E
40|$|Self-piercing {{riveting}} (SPR) {{is a cold}} mechanical joining process used to join two or more {{sheets of}} materials by driving a <b>rivet</b> <b>piercing</b> through the top sheet or the top and middle sheets and subsequently lock into the bottom sheet {{under the guidance of}} a suitable die. SPR is currently the main joining method for aluminium and mixed-material lightweight automotive structures. SPR was originated half century ago, but it only had significant progress in the last 25 years due to the requirement of joining lightweight materials, such as aluminium alloy structures, aluminium-steel structures and other mixed-material structures, from the automotive industry. Compared with other conventional joining methods, SPR has many advantages including no pre-drilled holes required, no fume, no spark and low noise, no surface treatment required, ability to join multi-layer materials and mixed materials and ability to produce joints with high static and fatigue strengths. In this paper, research investigations that have been conducted on self-piercing riveting will be extensively reviewed. The current state and development of SPR process is reviewed and the influence of the key process parameters on joint quality is discussed. The mechanical properties of SPR joints, the corrosion behaviour of SPR joints, the distortion of SPR joints and the simulation of SPR process and joint performance are reviewed. Developing reliable simulation methods for SPR process and joint performance to reduce the need of physical testing has been identified as one of the main challenges...|$|E

40|$|The idea of “hybrid joints” {{arises from}} the need of joining {{together}} materials, producing a tough, stiff and lightweight joint. The core concept is: use two different joining techniques, with the aim to increase the strength and gather the advantages of each technique, reducing the drawbacks. In this work hybrid joints consist in joints produced with two different kinds of joining techniques: one of them being adhesive bonding and the other being one among Resistance Spot Welding, Pop <b>Riveting,</b> Clinching, Self <b>Piercing</b> <b>Riveting.</b> The performance of hybrid joints are {{compared with those of}} traditional joints for the single lap joint geometry, for different geometric (plates thickness, pitch of the mechanical fastening) and environmental condition (temperature and ageing). The experimental tests are planned and therefore their results analyzed by means of Design of Experiment techniques.

In particular the stiffness, the strength and the energy absorption are compared for the different kinds of joints, giving emphasis to the differences between simple and hybrid joints.

40|$|The {{yield load}} {{equivalent}} for mechanical joints is a characteristic joint value, which appraises the joint specific deformation behavior. The value considers the maximum load {{of a joint}} {{as well as the}} ductility of the joint. Therefore the value is a combined strength / deformation value with high information content. The value guaranties an adequate joint deformation reserve. The shown examples and the application variety prove the adaptability of the yield load equivalent. Those examples as been verified for different fastener types and joint geometries. Based on the appraisal of shear loaded lock bolt and blind rivet joints the yield load equivalent has been used and proven for the appraisal of: 1. punch <b>rivets</b> / self <b>piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> 2. clinching 3. spot welding 4. tension loaded joints 5. peel loaded joints The appraisal of multiple joint specimens was difficult and is now possible with the yield load equivalent. For this kind of joints the yield load equivalent de liver the possibility to describe the complex joint characteristic with one comparable value. The easy appraisal of the transition area between force and form closure is an additional and important issue for the characterization of load bearing characteristic of mechanical joints. Due to this value a comparability of test result is possible without knowledge of the exact test assembly. Current research projects at the Fraunhofer AGP - Rostock have the goal of implementing the yield load equivalent in national guidelines and standards for dimensioning of blind rivet and lock bolt joints...|$|R

A mixture of different light weight materials like aluminium and higher strength steels, called multi-material mix, is used increasingly to fulfill these requirements and reduce the weight of the vehicles. Hence the challenges for the joining technique are increasing. Mechanical joining techniques like self <b>piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> have great potential to fulfill this challenge. In particular the joints are the highest loaded parts during crash loading and overloading situations and have to be modeled in crash simulations.

40|$|Regarding {{the use of}} material, modern {{lightweight}} car {{bodies are}} becoming more and more complex than previous constructions. The materials nowadays are used for a more specific field of application and more high strength steels are used and also other materials like aluminium, stainless steel, reinforced polymers are used more frequent. The joining of these materials often requires new or modified joining processes. The aim with this thesis is concerned with the development of simulation models of the joining process as well as mechanical properties of self <b>piercing</b> <b>riveted</b> (SPR) joints and pierce nut joints. In both of these joining methods problems occur when introducing more high strength steel sheets. For SPR, fractures occur in the <b>rivet,</b> and for <b>pierce</b> nut the thread will be damaged. Since both the SPR process and the pierce nut process expose the material for plastic deformation up to 150 %, correct material properties for very large strain and a simulation program that could handle this was required. With the commercial finite element program Deform 2 D an axi-symmetric model has been built for the SPR process and the pierce nut process. Because of the computational time, 3 D simulations were only used where it was necessary. The developed 3 D models use the commercial finite element program ABAQUS-Explicit. All simulation models have been verified with satisfactory agreement to experimental results. For SPR, an axi-symmetric simulation model was used for evaluating and optimising the setting process in the stainless steel sheets EN 1. 4301, HyTens 800 and HyTens 1200. Subsequently, 3 D models were used for predicting the mechanical properties of new SPR joints that have showed reduced risk for <b>rivet</b> cracking. In <b>pierce</b> nut simulations, nuts with hardness 8 and 10 have been set in the high strength steel sheet DP 600. An axi-symmetric simulation model was used for centred nut setting and two different simulation models in 3 D were used to evaluate eccentric nut setting and torque resistance. This work resulted in more knowledge about the fracture risk in the rivet and how to reduce it. The strain and stress, which was used as fracture indicators, were reduced to the half with modifications of the rivet and the die geometry. Mechanical property simulations in shear and peel load resulted in satisfactory results for new SPR joints that have showed reduced fracture risk during rivet setting. New die and rivet designs can be developed effectively by combining the process and mechanical property simulations. For a pierce nut joint in high strength steel sheets (1. 5 mm DP 600), the simulations show that the cutting of the sheet in combination with eccentric setting over the die causes the thread damage. The thread damage can be avoided by changing the dimension of the nut or by increasing the strength of the nut material. The simulation models can also be used to develop new nut and die geometries for future applications. QC 2010111...|$|R

In this paper, the mechanisms of crack initiation and growth during fatigue and the influence of fatigue on the stiffness and remaining static strengths of SPR joints in both lap shear and T peel configurations were studied. The results showed that cracks could initiate and develop from different locations on the substrate materials depending on load levels and test types. Fatigue increased the remaining static lap shear strength and stiffness of specimens due to the increased friction force at the top/bottom sheet interfaces around the tip of punched hole through fretting; however, fatigue reduced the remaining static T peel strength of specimens due to crack initiation and development; T peel fatigue at high load levels also increased the stiffness of specimens due to geometry change through large plastic deformation...|$|R

One reason found is the variation of rivet specifications between different batches. In this paper, the influence of rivet tip geometry on the joint quality and mechanical strengths was studied. The results showed that rivets with sharper tips flared more during riveting process, and joints with sharper rivets had higher lap shear strength; however, the influence of rivet geometry on T peel strength could be different for different rivets, and rivet tip geometry did not have an obvious influence on joint fatigue strengths...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce weight of a vehicle, {{application}} of light metals has increased. Magnesium alloy is very light and has high specific strength compared to other structural metals. SPR (Self <b>Piercing</b> <b>Rivet)</b> joining has been applied mainly for an aluminum alloy in motor industries. However, application of SPR joining to a magnesium alloy is very limited. In this study, SPR joining was carried out with AM 50 magnesium alloy sheets. According to the result of joining experiment, cracking easily occurred at the lower sheet due to poor formability of the alloy. Static and fatigue strength of the joint were evaluated under shear tensile loading condition. The crack introduced in SPR process affects on strength of the joint. As a practical way to solve the problem, adhesive aided SPR joining was proposed. Adhesive was spread {{on the surface and}} then SPR joining was conducted before its hardening. The maximum shear tensile load of the joint increased by using an adhesive and was strongly influenced by kind of adhesive used. Fatigue strength also improved by using an adhesive.

40|$|In this article, the {{possibilities}} for improving the joining process of self <b>piercing</b> solid <b>rivets</b> and self <b>piercing</b> nuts by increasing tool velocity are demonstrated. Thereby, the focus is put on the joining process of high strength steel sheets. Proper and reliable joining of these steels presents a major challenge for mechanical joining techniques. In the conventional joining process, where tool velocities well below 1 m/s are common, different problems during the joining process caused by the high strength of the steel sheets can occur. At the punch riveting process undesirable material flow or unwanted burr development can occur, and at the setting process of self piercing nuts a deformation of the nuts is possible. These problems can be reduced significantly by using elevated tool velocity. In the present paper, characteristics of the joining process at conventional and elevated tool velocity are investigated. The influence caused by different tool velocities within the joining process is shown by cross section- and process force analysis. In the cross section analysis of the mechanical joints it is demonstrated {{that the quality of}} connections can be improved significantly due to the usage of elevated tool velocity.

40|$|Abstract. The {{aspect of}} {{lightweight}} constructions {{becomes more and}} more important. This particularly applies to the automotive industry which wants to lower the fuel consumption by a smaller vehicle weight. Under this point of view in recent years steel has often been replaced by aluminum alloys. In comparison with this the application of lightweight magnesium alloys, whose specific density is appropriate within the range of plastics, opens further prospects for weight reduction. The pre-condition for this purpose is the supply of suitable joining processes for magnesium alloys, which are universally applicable and offer the maximum utilization of the materials of the joined parts under operating loads. Mechanical joining techniques provide the opportunity of connecting magnesium components homogeneously as well as in material mix. However, the anisotropic deformation characteristics of the hexagonal crystal structure of magnesium at room temperature contain the application for mechanical joining techniques. Only starting from temperatures of approx. 225 °C a sufficient plastic deformation and thus a crack-free shaping of the magnesium material is given. Therefore preheating of magnesium substrates leads to a broad extension of deformability and offers the chance to realize a high quality mechanical joint. This article describes a process-safe realization of the mechanical joining operations clinching, self <b>piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> and clinch riveting of magnesium sheets by means of an inductive heating of the substrates in laboratory scale. In this context, feasibilities and limits of the considered joining techniques are shown...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive Bonding is an {{attractive}} alternative to conventional joining methods, such as welding and mechanical fastening. In applications such as primary aircraft structures or automobiles elements adhesive bonding competes with traditional bolting, riveting or welding. The advantages of adhesive bonding includes high strength/weight ratio, possibility to join any combination of materials, high corrosion resistance and improved fatigue performance. Although, adhesives can be used alone, most of the volume manufacturers can't afford the level of quality control required and have opted to employ hybrid joining methods containing adhesives with spot welds or self <b>piercing</b> <b>rivets</b> {{because they do not}} have a reliable software method to analyze and predict the lifetime of bonded or riveted joints. In analysing adhesively bonded joints for design purposes, important properties to consider are strength, stiffness, weight and nature of stress distributions. In this research, a new mathematical method based on stiffness drop of adhesively bonded joints has been investigated and presented to determine the fatigue crack propagation rates and obtain the crack growth curves for these joints. This method makes use of the raw laboratory fatigue test data and finite element based stiffness data of bonded joints. This concept has been tested and validated for T-peel and single lap shear bonded joint configurations. The bonded joint configurations were prepared using aluminium alloy AA 5754 and the adhesive used was Betamate Epoxy adhesive 4601, which is high performance, heat curing, epoxy adhesive. The entire tests were conducted under constant amplitude loading using an R ratio of 0. 1 and frequency of 10 Hz. The damage models for this work were developed using computational fracture mechanics tools in abaqus. Various curve fitting models were reviewed and employed in this method to combine the stiffness data obtained from FE damage models and fatigue test data of T peel and single lap shear bonded joints to calculate the fatigue crack propagation rates. The methodology investigated in this work provides a way to obtain the fatigue crack growth curves for adhesively bonded joints by combining the finite element modeling data with fatigue test data of bonded joints...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is the study of}} a mixed method used for the joining of {{aluminum}} alloys with glass reinforced polymer’s substrates (in the next GFRP). In particular, the technique of self-piercing riveting (in the next SPR) was applied on a co-cured joint in order to evaluate the influence of the time of inserting the rivet on the mechanical behavior of the mixed joints. Three different joints were realized: adhesive by co-curing technique, mechanical by self <b>piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> (in the next SPR) and a mixed one in which the joining techniques (i. e. adhesive and mechanical) were combined. In particular, to determine the optimum time to insert the rivet, three different times {{from the beginning of the}} curing reaction of the resin (i. e. after 2 h, 5 h and 24 h from the moment of mixing resin with its hardener, respectively) were chosen to insert the rivets in the co-cured adhesive joints. Moreover, for each condition, the oil pressure of the riveting system needed to optimize the performances of the joints was investigated. To determinate the times of riveting to be investigated, the curing process of the epoxy resin was previously analyzed by means of a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a stress controlled rheometer. All the realized samples (i. e. five for each configuration) were characterized by single lap joint tests. The experimental results, supported by the ANOVA test, prove that the time at which the rivet is inserted is a critical parameter as it greatly influences the performances of the joints. In particular the mixed joints show higher resistance than the adhesive ones only if the rivet is inserted when the resin is in its fluid state (i. e. after 2 h) with the oil pressure equal to 180 bar or if the rivet is inserted when the resin is in its solid state (i. e. after 24 h), with the oil pressure equal to 280 bar. Vice versa if the rivet is inserted when the resin is in its rubber state (after 5 h), the resistance of the mixed joints is lower than the adhesive ones regardless of the value of the oil pressure...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} technologies that are required for magnesium to be taken up in structural applications. CAST research has focused on a number of these in the value chain. One of the key developments required is new wrought alloys that are more easily processed and have superior properties to the current suite of wrought Mg alloys. A new alloy has been developed that can be extruded more than twice as fast as AZ 31 with similar strength and better ductility. Furthermore, the processability rivals 6000 series Al alloys and better specific strength and ductility. The alloy has been developed primarily for extrusion but could also be used in sheet applications. A key enabling technology required for the uptake of magnesium alloys is joining. Self-pierce riveting (SPR) is a promising solid state joining technique for magnesium, especially for spot joining to dissimilar metals because the formation of brittle inter-metallic phases encountered in fusion joining such as resistance spot welding is avoided. However, while SPR joining of aluminium intensive car, truck and recreational vehicle bodies is well established with over 10 years of commercial application in the automotive industry, SPR joining of magnesium needs further development to prevent cracking of magnesium, especially when placed on the bottom {{in the design of the}} joint. This is because magnesium alloys are generally not ductile enough at room temperature to be joined mechanically by processes such as SPR and clinching which involve forming and plastic deformation. CAST has proven that laser assisted self <b>piercing</b> <b>riveting</b> is able to produce crack free joints of high integrity, even when Mg alloys are on the bottom ply. Another important area of consideration is the deformation of magnesium alloys in crash situations. It has been shown that many magnesium alloys tend to have large plastic hinges upon deformation due to their high work hardening rates. This shows great advantages in some situations where deformation occurs in a larger volume and hence more energy is absorbed. However, this same phenomenon can also cause fracture when the plastic hinge is forced to be a lower radius of curvature than the alloy would naturally bend. Hence, magnesium alloys will provide the greatest benefit when used in applications where deformation is not constrained or global buckling is the most likely deformation mechanism...|$|R
