50|$|In {{addition}} to host-water dependence, dwarf mistletoes must acquire carbohydrate and mineral nutrition from their hosts. Dwarf mistletoes have both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and the necessary mechanisms for photosynthesis, but chlorophyll concentrations in dwarf mistletoes are approximately 1/5 to 1/10 of {{those found in}} their host’s foliage, and dwarf mistletoes have low photosynthetic rates {{as measured by the}} rate of carbon fixation. The principal carbohydrate transported from the host to dwarf mistletoe is sucrose. Dwarf mistletoes are phloem deficient; therefore, dwarf mistletoes draw carbohydrates from their hosts by connections to the host phloem and <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> The rate of carbohydrate transport between dwarf mistletoes varies according to season, but dwarf mistletoes continuously draw carbohydrates from their hosts throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|Wind carries teliospores to pines shoots {{that then}} {{germinate}} under cool humid conditions, producing germ tubes {{with up to}} three side branches that act as basidia. The basidiam directly penetrate the cuticle and epidermis. Other pines rusts like cronartium ribicola and C. comandrae infect through the stomata. After penetration and establishment of a intracellular infection structure, primary hyphae are produced, infecting the epidermis and cortex intercellularly. Haustoria extend through neighboring cells and the cortex to reach the vascular cambium before the host becomes dormant follow the first infection season. The cambium is invade inwardly through the phloem and cortex, {{as opposed to a}} vertical or peripheral hyphael growth. Initiation of gall formation is through exogenous stimulation of the cambium and pith rays, causing an increased production of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> The host reacts by hyperplasia(increased division) providing the resources needed for further hyphae proliferation in the cortex, phloem, and cambium until the galls death. The gall will enlarge for 2 years and sporulate on the third. Spermogonia ooze from infected bark in early spring, but they are non-functional since they do not form aecia (vestigial). Dikaryotization of the haploid mycelium that produce the teliospores takes place in the outer cortex, just beneath the first periderm. They are surrounded by a membrane called a peridium that bursts, releasing the spores. Stimulation of dikaryotization is not understood, though it is likely a combination of host sap flow and environmental cues.|$|E

The results of the author’s investigation are compared with the data in the literature. The features of vessels, <b>rays,</b> and <b>parenchyma</b> agree well with those reported by other investigators. When the fibres are divided into libriform fibres and fibre tracheids in the sense of Janssonius, the correlation between the distribution of these organs and recent taxonomic subdivisions of the family is better than when all fibres with bordered pits are regarded as fibre tracheids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{leaf and}} stem {{microstructure}} of commercialised Cyclopia species (Cyclopia intermedia, Cyclopia subternata, Cyclopia maculata, Cyclopia genistoides) is described and illustrated {{for the first}} time. Leaflet characters of diagnostic value include the shape, margin (flat or revolute), bundle sheath extensions, crystals (aggregates, solitary crystals and crystal sand), relative size of {{the upper and lower}} epidermal cells and thickness of the cuticle. The study revealed an abundance of phenolic compounds, not only in the leaf epidermal cells and leaf bundle sheaths, but also in the secondary phloem, xylem <b>rays,</b> xylem <b>parenchyma</b> and pith, showing that the inclusion of older stems may be acceptable and does not necessarily lower the quality of the product...|$|R
30|$|Wood {{consists}} of {{several kinds of}} secondary xylem cell that {{have a variety of}} functions. Cell death plays a critical role in the determination of the function of secondary xylem cells. Long-lived xylem <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells (<b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells) retain their organelles for several years or decades, and they play important roles in the storage and radial transport of materials [1, 2]. In addition, <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells are involved in the heartwood formation and they synthesize heartwood substances, such as polyphenols, that contribute to resistance to decay and the color and odor of wood, prior to their death [3 – 6]. In previous studies, we investigated the death of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells as a model of the death of long-lived xylem cells in situ. The death of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells does not occur successively even within the same radial cell lines of a ray, suggesting that the death of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells might not be controlled in a time-dependent manner [7 – 9]. Thus, the mechanism of the death of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells might differ from that of the time-dependent programmed cell death of short-lived tracheary elements [10, 11].|$|E
30|$|Changes in the {{morphology}} {{and functions}} of vacuoles provide useful information about the mechanism of cell death. In the present study, we monitored the morphology and contents of vacuoles during the death of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in the conifer Cryptomeria japonica. In differentiating xylem, <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells had large central vacuoles. In sapwood, vacuoles in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells contained proteins, an indication {{that one of the}} main functions of these vacuoles might be protein storage. A dramatic decrease in the protein content of some vacuoles was detected in the intermediate wood before the initiation of vacuole rupture. Although vacuole rupture was detected from the intermediate wood to the outermost heartwood, some vacuoles were obviously enlarged in the inner intermediate wood. Condensed nuclei were first observed after the rupture of these large vacuoles in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells. It seems plausible that the autolysis of the contents of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells might be caused by the rupture of the enlarged vacuoles in the inner intermediate wood.|$|E
30|$|No nucleus was {{observed}} in the heartwood <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells (Fig.  7 e, f). Only {{a small amount of}} amyloplasts remained in the <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells of 44 -H (Fig.  7 f), thereby corresponding to the copy numbers of 185  bp rbcL fragments obtained for 44 -H as shown in Fig.  4.|$|E
40|$|Examination of a {{large number}} of apple trees {{infected}} with Trametes versicolor, indicated that the fungus was a facultative parasite which caused a white rot of the sapwood. Papery bark was a distinctive but non-specific external symptom of the disease. The development of papery bark was influenced by seasonal and nutritional conditions and was not a reliable indicator of susceptibility of trees to T, versicolor. Discoloration of the sapwood always occurred in advance of fungal colonisation and decay. The formation of discolored wood involved the loss of starch and nuclei from <b>ray</b> and xylem <b>parenchyma</b> and the eventual necrosis of these cells. Necrotic cells were filled with a brown amorphous material which appeared to be oxidised phenolics. In young wood, <b>ray</b> and xylem <b>parenchyma</b> formed polysaccharide wound gum which was deposited in the vessels of the sapwood-discolored wood transition zone. The levels of K, Ca, Mg, moisture, pH, neutral solvent extractable materials and phenolics in discolored wood, differed from those in the adjacent sapwood. Bacteria were present in discolored wood in advance of the fungus. Discoloration was a non-specific response of the sapwood to mechanical or pethological stimuli. In vitro decay tests indicated that discolored wood was more resistant to decay than normal sapwood. Discoloration of the wood and gum formation therefore appeared to be an active host resistance mechanism to fungal penetration and decay. The host reaction to wounding was related to the physiological cycle of the tree and with age cells lost the ability to synthesise wound gum and reduced amounts of extraneous material were formed in the <b>ray</b> and xylem <b>parenchyma.</b> Evidence indicated that the resistance of young apple sapwood to colonisation and decay by T. versicolor was due to its vital nature and ability to elaborate an effective fungal inhibitory barrier. The susceptibility of living wood to fungal decay increased with age, due to a natural decline in host resistance...|$|R

Three clones (NE- 5323, NE- 5326, and NE- 5377) from a Populus x euramericana cross, each growing at 5, 000, 10, 000, and 15, 000 stems/ha were studied. This material was then used for the manufacture of 40 lb/ft(2 ̆ 73) homogeneous flakeboards {{in an attempt to}} evaluate the effects of the raw material quality on properties of flakeboard;Height, diameters at one foot and 4. 5 feet, the proportions of stem and branch material, and the number of sprouts per stump were significantly different among all clones and planting densities. Clone NE- 5323 had the best overall height and diameter growth. Height and diameter growth for all clones was greater than that reported for first rotation 3 -year-old hybrid poplar. The proportions of stem material and the number of sprouts per stump decreased with increasing planting density;Wood and bark specific gravity, wood fiber length, vessel segment length, bark fiber length, the proportions of cell types (i. e., fibers, vessels, <b>rays,</b> <b>parenchyma),</b> the proportion of bark, and bark thickness were also determined from the single, dominant coppice sprout of each tree. Planting density did not {{have a significant effect on}} any of these characteristics. The wood and bark quality of clone NE- 5323 was superior to the other two clones. Partial correlation coefficients among all characteristics were calculated;Moduli of elasticity and rupture in bending, internal bond, thickness swell, linear expansion, water absorption, and strength properties after accelerated aging were determined for homogeneous flakeboards made from material from each clone and planting density;No significant differences in any strength or dimensional stability properties could be attributed to clone or planting density effects. Compared to the properties of flakeboards made from material from the main stem only, strength and dimensional stability properties were significantly less for flakeboards that contained main stem and branch material...|$|R

30|$|In the {{previous}} year’s xylem, <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells contained both PSVs and non-PSVs (Fig.  4). By contrast, {{in the sixth}} and ninth annual rings from the cambium, namely, in the middle part of the sapwood and the outer part of the intermediate wood, all the vacuoles in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells were PSVs (Figs.  5 b, 6 b). These observations suggest that the main function of vacuoles in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells might be storage of proteins from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the intermediate wood. It was reported that PSVs contain hydrolytic enzymes and function in autophagy, even when proteins are accumulated [29, 31]. Therefore, PSVs in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the intermediate wood might also function in autophagy for maintenance of cellular homeostasis.|$|E
30|$|From {{the middle}} {{part to the}} inner part of the {{intermediate}} wood, we observed deformed vacuoles in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells (Figs.  5 c–f, 6 c–e). The profiles of these deformed vacuoles were irregular, suggesting that deformed vacuoles might have been ruptured. Some <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells contained ruptured vacuoles, as well as PSVs and/or non-PSVs (Figs.  5 c–e, 6 c, d). Both the number of ruptured vacuoles in each cell {{and the number of}} <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells that contained ruptured vacuoles increased from the middle part toward the inner part of the intermediate wood (Figs.  5 c–f, 6 c–e). Furthermore, there were no morphological changes in nuclei in <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells from the middle part to the inner part of the intermediate wood (Figs.  2 b, e, 5 c–e, 6 c–d). During the programmed cell death of tracheary elements in the Zinnia system in vitro, the vacuole rupture is followed by the rapid degradation of nuclei and other organelles [14 – 16]. By contrast, <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells might retain their organelles for some time after the initiation of vacuole rupture (Figs.  5 c–f, 6 c–e).|$|E
30|$|In LH- 1 samples, no dark-colored {{heartwood}} {{was visible}} to the naked eye. However, variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.  5 b). Yellow–green fluorescence of cell walls was observed only in some of the xylem <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells that were located near the pith and perimedullary cells. This observation indicates that these additional substances were synthesized not only in xylem <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells but also in perimedullary cells in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis. We also observed the disappearance of starch grains from xylem <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells and perimedullary cells around the pith in LH- 2 and 3 samples during cell death (Fig.  4 f-h). It has been suggested that stored starch is used for the synthesis of heartwood substances [5]. Therefore, the disappearance of starch from xylem <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells and perimedullary cells might be involved in the synthesis of heartwood substances.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty vasicentric axial <b>parenchyma,</b> <b>rays</b> both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in <b>rays</b> and axial <b>parenchyma</b> and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features. Thunbergia thus should not be segregated from Acanthaceae...|$|R
40|$|The {{shedding}} {{of branches}} along a preformed layer {{is a complex}} phenomenon in which several types of xylem elements are involved. The abscission layers in Perebea mollis and Naucleopsis guianensis are distinguished from the normally developed xylem {{by the presence of}} shorter unlignified fibres with small simple pits. Most of these fibres show large nuclei. In this zone containing abnormal fibres, the vessels, <b>rays</b> and <b>parenchyma</b> are conspicuously {{different from those of the}} normal tissue. The transition in anatomy from the main branch to the abscission layer is much more abrupt than that from the abscission layer to the secondary branch. Contrary to what is generally seen in other Moraceous tribes, natural pruning seems to occur in all genera of Olmedieae with the sole exception of the genus Olmedia. The correlation with other morphological and anatomical characters and the complexity of the phenomenon of branch abscission seem to justify Berg’s decision to use this character in defining the new tribe Castilleae, containing all the genera formerly placed in Olmedieae except Olmedia...|$|R

In the middle part of the earlywood of the eleventh annual ring from the cambium (inner part of the intermediate wood), <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells had elliptical nuclei (a white arrow in Fig.  5 d). The number of deformed vacuoles in each of the <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells tended to be greater than in the tenth annual ring from the cambium (white arrowheads in Fig.  5 e).

50|$|Isotopic {{analyses}} of South American gomphotheres suggest a wide diet for Notiomastodon platensis, {{except for the}} fossils unearthed at the localities in Santiago del Estero and La Carolina in Ecuador. Isotope analyses suggested an exclusive C4 diet, whereas every other South American locality indicates an exclusive C3 or mixed C3 and C4 diet. The results also support the latitudinal gradient of C3 and C4 grasses. The stereomicrowear analyses for N. platensis exhibited average scratch and pit values, which place it within the extant mixed-feeder morphospace and the higher frequency of fine scratches indicated the ingestion of C3 grasses. Alternatively, the presence of coarse and hypercoarse scratches along with gouges and large pits suggests the ingestion of foliage and lignified portions. The plant microfossil analysis recovered fragments of conifer tracheid and vessel elements with a <b>ray</b> of <b>parenchyma</b> cells, which corroborates the consumption of wood plants, pollen grains, spores, and fibers. The Aguas de Araxa gomphotheres were feeding generalists and consumed wood elements, leaves, and C3 grasses. Cuvieronius specimens from Chile were exclusively C3 plant eaters, whereas specimens from Bolivia and Ecuador are classified as having a mixed C3 and C4 diet. Notiomastodon showed {{a wider range of}} dietary adaptations. Specimens from Quequen Salado in Buenos Aires Province were entirely C3 feeders, whereas the diet of specimens from La Carolina Peninsula in Ecuador was exclusively C4.|$|R

40|$|Summary &mdash; The {{breeding}} of sunflower varieties whose seeds (achenes) {{can be easily}} hulled would help to optimise industrial hulling before oil extraction, and thus improve the protein content of sunflower seedmeal. Laboratory hulling tests require samples of about 10 g of seed, and so a search was made for characteristics that would permit indirect selection for improved hullability using smaller numbers of seed. Anatomical characteristics of the pericarps of 12 inbred sunflower lines and 18 hybrids were observed using light microscopy. Significant differences between geno-types {{in the frequency of}} <b>parenchyma</b> <b>rays</b> separating sclerenchyma zones, and in the proportion of wide and wedge-shaped sclerenchyma zones were observed. However, the phenotypic correlations between these characteristics and hullability measurements with a laboratory huller were too weak to be usable alone in hullability breeding programmes.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we found that}} deeply furrowed xylem in P. betle was {{produced}} from parenchyma proliferation (Fig.  1 c). This deeply furrowed xylem cambial variant has not been reported previously. Twenty-two families develop xylem in plates (also called radiating plate xylem), including Piperaceae. Carlquist (2001) stated that in Piperaceae, combinations of cambial variants were common, such as secondary growth of external primary vascular bundles combined with xylem in plates, so two cylinders of vascular bundles combined with deeply furrow xylem and xylem in plates in P. betle is another special cambial variant type. In the stems we examined, the xylem was beginning to furrow in P. kadsura, P. sintenense, and P. taiwanense, indicated that these three species will develop deeply furrowed xylem in older stems. In summary, the seven Piper species in Taiwan produce cambial activity that results in large, radially extended regions of secondary vascular tissues, which are separated from each other by wide, medullary <b>rays</b> of primary <b>parenchyma.</b>|$|R

30|$|By {{contrast}} to the above observations, there were no clear variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls of axial parenchyma cells in LH- 1 samples (Fig.  5 b). However, we did observe the disappearance of starch grains from axial parenchyma cells during cell death (Fig.  4 e). It has been suggested that, in Cryptomeria japonica, axial and <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in xylem might synthesize and accumulate different kinds of heartwood substances [13, 25]. Nobuchi and Harada [26] reported differences {{in terms of the}} ultrastructural changes during heartwood formation between axial and <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in xylem.

30|$|After {{treatment}} for 72  h, the cell wall {{area of the}} <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells of all species increased by approximately 1.3 – 1.5. The cell wall area of the wood fibers increased significantly {{with the exception of}} the earlywood of Trochodendron aralioides as in Figs.  3 and 4. Therefore, in general, the degree of swelling for the <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells is lower than the wood fibers. The differential shrinkage and swelling by moisture are attributed mainly to the cell wall structure [19]. Swelling of the cell walls is mainly caused by swelling of the amorphous region between microfibrils, and bundles of the microfibrils swell extensively in the perpendicular direction. The lower the microfibril angle for the longitudinal cell axis, the higher the swelling perpendicular to the longitudinal cell axis. In wood fibers, the middle layer of the secondary wall (S 2) that is usually oriented 5 – 20 ° to the fiber axis occupies a large area [20]. In <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, the inner (S 1) and outer (S 3) layers of the secondary wall that are oriented 30 – 60 ° to the longitudinal cell axis are thicker than the other layers [21]. Therefore, the occupancy rate and microfibril angle of their thickest layers affect their swelling behavior significantly and the wood fibers may swell more than the <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells during [C 2 mim][Cl] treatment. Other causes for the difference in swelling ratio may be the difference in chemical composition. The lignin concentration of <b>ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells is reported to be 1.5 times higher than that of wood fibers [22]. <b>Ray</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells react with difficulty with [C 2 mim][Cl]. The cell wall thickness of Quercus glauca and Trochodendron aralioides increased in the fiber and tangential direction in almost the same ratio while that of Quercus mongolica and Fagus crenata increased significantly in the fiber direction in comparison with the tangential direction after [C 2 mim][Cl] treatment.|$|E

The experimental device, conceived and developed in our laboratory, allows the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio to be determined on very small samples. In this work, four components of the anatomical pattern have been differentiated. The corresponding micro samples have been prepared by careful polishing, which is difficult at best. Finally, {{we are able to}} propose values for <b>ray</b> cells, longitudinal <b>parenchyma</b> cells, initial ring porous zone and fibres. The ray cells depict the highest rigidity in the transverse plane. On the contrary, the ring porous zone is the weakest, with a value almost ten times less important. Fibres and longitudinal parenchyma cells exhibit average values. The later only seem to present a high anisotropy ratio (E-R/E-T approximate to 2). ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.) ...|$|R
40|$|In grape, {{there are}} very few xylem {{differences}} between susceptible and tolerant varieties, except for smaller vessel diameters and more <b>parenchyma</b> <b>rays</b> in the tolerant variety examined. These findings in the tolerant grape suggest a restriction to bacterial movement imposed {{at the level of the}} vessels. The systemic and non-systemic alternate hosts studied here showed relatively similar xylem characteristics with large variations. Overall, the comparison of the basic xylem characteristics (vessel length, diameter, stem-petiole-leaf connectivity) is not conclusive and more studies are needed. First, more species needs to be studied as Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is found in numerous species. Second, Xf movement and patterns of colonization needs to be determined in more details (time, distance, location). Third, differences in the vessel network, vessel overlapping, spatial organization of the pit fields, structure (thickness, porosity) of the pit membrane, need to be considered to fully understand the role of the xylem network in bacterial movement...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePremise of the study: During the Devonian, the {{evolution}} of secondary phloem produced by a bifacial vascular cambium was a key innovation that increased the ability of plants within the lignophyte clade to redistribute photosynthates and other organic compounds throughout their body. Unraveling the secondary phloem anatomy of the first arborescent lignophytes is crucial to understand {{the evolution}} of this tissue and the physiology of early trees. * Methods: A 10 cm wide stem of Callixylon with preserved secondary phloem from the Famennian of Morocco is described using thin-sections. * Key results: The secondary phloem of this Callixylon zalesskyi-type of stem is composed of fibers, sclereids, <b>rays,</b> axial <b>parenchyma,</b> and putative sieve cells. Fibers differentiate early and are relatively abundant in the inner phloem. In the older phloem, fibers are arranged in tangential bands alternating with extensive layers of axial parenchyma. Changes between the young and old phloem involve the periclinal division and radial elongation of the axial parenchyma cells. The presence of fibers in the inner, presumably functional phloem, combined with evidence for rhythmicity {{in the production of}} different phloem cell types are documented {{for the first time in}} detail in an archaeopteridalean progymnosperm. No periderm was observed within the preserved seven millimeters of bark tissues. * Conclusions: The secondary phloem anatomy supports a close affinity of archaeopteridalean progymnosperms with both aneurophytalean progymnosperms and seed plants. The production of secondary phloem might have provided an advantage to these first arborescent lignophytes over other types of Devonian early trees, especially in dry conditions...|$|R
