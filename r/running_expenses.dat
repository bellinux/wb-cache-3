25|$|The Umikaze-class destroyers {{proved to}} be largely {{experimental}} ships. The use of Parsons steam turbines pushed the design {{to the limits of}} capability of contemporary engineering and production technology, and the engines were plagued with maintenance issues, as well as tremendous fuel consumption. In an effort to reduce <b>running</b> <b>expenses</b> and to increase range, the boilers were modified from all heavy oil to two heavy oil and four coal-fired boilers. Even with the modification, the Umikaze vessels were largely retained for coastal patrol duties.|$|E
25|$|In {{its first}} three years, {{the only source}} of income of the Association was that which was derived from {{membership}} and initiation fees and from contributions. In time, the association hoped to erect a building in San Francisco, the rentals of which would suffice to pay the <b>running</b> <b>expenses</b> of the Association, as well as sick benefits, when it is required. The library of the Association was a source of gratification to the members. More than 500 volumes were contributed, besides files of many of the leading dailies, weeklies, monthlies. The Association wanted first to accumulate complete sets of the published works of members, then works by Pacific Coast writers, then reference books, and finally, rare and standard books.

25|$|The 2004 season {{went well}} in that Stord/Moster won the league again, despite that 2003's top goalscorer Kjetil Løvvik played less. In the playoff to the Second Division it beat Nest-Sotra 3–2 on aggregate, and won promotion. This was a revenge after Nest-Sotra {{eliminated}} Stord/Moster {{in the first}} preliminary round of the 2004 Norwegian Football Cup. The new goal of the club, according to majority owner Simonsen, was to reach the upper echelon of the Second Division within 2007. The club's reserves team also won promotion, to the Third Division. However, the club still had financial issues. The <b>running</b> <b>expenses</b> showed a deficit of NOK 477,000 in 2003 and NOK 819,000 in 2004. In 2005, the new chairman Geir Ove Sele pondered that the club's goals for 2005, among others an average attendance of 1000 on home matches, {{as well as the}} perceived willingness of sponsors to support the team, might be unrealistic.|$|E

30|$|A serious {{limitation}} when monitoring in aggressive environments, is {{the breakdown}} of sensors, usually due to the accumulation of dust and salts on them, with ensuing corrosion and {{a break in the}} monitoring.

Consequently, a long run (ca 1  year) of uninterrupted data collection was not often verified. This necessarily made data evaluation more complicated than envisaged (see also [8, 14]).|$|R
25|$|European {{settlers}} had {{two main}} criticisms of British South Africa Company railway policy. Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited {{the company and}} its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill-founded, they caused tensions between the settlers and the BSAC. On the shorter east coast route from Beira, <b>running</b> <b>expenses</b> were high because of construction debts and because the Mozambique Company, which was granted the original concession to build the railway in 1891, imposed a transit duty of up to 3% on goods destined for Rhodesia in return for the sub-concession to the Beira Railway Company. From 1914, the European settlers had a majority in the Advisory Council, and called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of public control under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Rhodesian Government acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.|$|E

As for the profits to be made, take our own case. Our profits have long since repaid us the cost of our trawler. We have Just floated ourselves into a company, with a capital of £20,000. We are looking round now in Scotland for a second trawler. We have only begun to show the possibilities of the industry. There are further big developments to come." ...|$|E

He seems to have given independent consideration to introducing a turbine steamer, and agreed to take this on. Towards the end of 1900 a syndicate was formed in which he agreed to personally operate the proposed ship for its first season without pay, William Denny and Brothers would build the hull and boilers, and the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company was to provide the machinery.

40|$|A {{half of the}} Japanese {{land has}} been legislated as the heavy {{snowfall}} area {{by the government and}} more than twenty million people live there. Snow precipitation in a day sometimes reaches over 600 mm high and people expend a considerable amount of work and time remove accumulated snow and to maintain the daily activities. The top of citizen’s demands to solve municipal issues is always related snow in this area. In order to enhance urban appeal as well as the safety and comfort daily life, the snow melting system of the pavement has been getting more recognition in the central are of the city. Popular snow melting systems use electrically heating wire buried in the pavement. On the other hand, hot water piping systems heated by kerosene or gas boilers are also commonly used for not only residential front yards but also for big parking spaces and precipitous roads. However, snow melting systems consume much bigger amount of thermal energy than most people think due to a large amount of heat loss to the ambient in addition to needed heat for melting snow. For example, 400 litters of oil are burned in winter season for 20 m 2 wide residential snow melting system in average in Hokkaido area. This amount of oil consumption is almost equivalent to the annual oil consumption for domestic hot water supply of a single family house. From energy conversation and CO 2 reduction as well as saving <b>running</b> <b>expense</b> point of view, heat pump technologies have been applied into the snow melting system in the northern districts of Japan.

50|$|For this reason, many jurisdictions {{restrict}} {{the ability of}} secured creditors to enforce their rights in a bankruptcy. In the U.S., the Chapter 11 creditor protection, which completely prevents enforcement of security interests, aims at keeping enterprises <b>running</b> at the <b>expense</b> of creditors' rights, and is often heavily criticised for that reason. In the United Kingdom, an administration order has a similar effect, but is less expansive in scope and restriction in terms of creditors rights. European systems are often touted as being pro-creditor, but many European jurisdictions also impose restrictions upon time limits that must be observed before secured creditors can enforce their rights. The most draconian jurisdictions in favour of creditor's rights tend to be in offshore financial centres, who hope that, by having a legal system heavily biased towards secured creditors, they will encourage banks to lend at cheaper rates to offshore structures, and thus in turn encourage business {{to use them to}} obtain cheaper funds.|$|R
