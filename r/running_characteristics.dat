25|$|In 1989 Land Rover had {{launched}} the Discovery its Range Rover-based family 4×4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4×4. One {{of the key}} reasons for its success was its ground-breaking turbodiesel engine. The 200Tdi {{was one of the}} first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels, with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines. However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an inertial separator in the breather system to remove oil before crankcase gases were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the turbodiesel version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990. For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the timing belt system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being tucked under the manifolds in the original Discovery version. In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures. It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed 300,000 miles of use. The engine's commonality with the older models makes it a popular choice for installation in older Land Rovers. This is done both in original form or with the turbo removed (when the engine becomes known to enthusiasts as a 200Di) in order to keep the power/torque output within the limits of a Series Land Rover's gearbox and for greater ease of conversion. The turbocharged version may also be installed with or without the intercooler.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, {{the result}} of a rapidly {{functioning}} neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms. Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained <b>running,</b> <b>characteristic</b> of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.|$|R

The name [...] "scuttle fly" [...] derives from the jerky, short bursts of <b>running,</b> <b>characteristic</b> to the adult fly. The name [...] "coffin fly" [...] is due to their being found in coffins, digging six feet deep in order to reach buried corpses.

In addition, this article puts forward simplified methods of DFIG model innovatively and establishes two different degrees of simplification models with equivalence of the converter model and the generator model respectively.

40|$|The gas {{engine-driven}} {{heat pump}} (GEHP), {{which has been}} considered as a preferable choice in the heating and air-conditioning scheme can make full use of the waste heat from the engine and achieve a higher primary energy ratio (PER) than other forms of heating/cooling systems. In this paper, {{the relationship between the}} capacity characteristic of the GEHP and the heating and cooling loads of buildings has been analyzed. Meanwhile the reasons of the imbalance of the urban electricity and natural gas consumptions between summer and winter have been studied. The <b>running</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a water-to-water GEHP has been investigated experimentally and the PER was measured. Based on the analysis and experimental results, it could be concluded that if both the gas-fired boilers and electric air conditioners are replaced by GEHPs in some percentage, we can narrow the gaps between the requirement and provision of electricity and natural gas and balance the seasonal consumption differences of electricity and natural gas between summer and winter simultaneously. In order to improve energy efficiency, environmental quality and energy consumption structure effectively, the governmental incentive policies for promoting use of GEHPs should be formulated in China and some other developing countries.

50|$|To {{reach the}} {{necessary}} tractive effort, a construction comprising six driven axles was necessary. In order to still get good <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> in curves, {{they were built}} into three two-axle bogies instead of two three-axle bogies as on the Ae 6/6. The middle bogie can move sideways, and the three bogies are connected by elastic cross couplings. Two of the four prototypes were built with a split locomotive body, whereby the joint may only move on an horizontal transverse axis, not on a vertical axis, to accommodate to gradient changes.|$|E
50|$|The {{turbocharger}} was the then-new EMD mechanically assisted turbo-compressor. During engine startup, and {{at lower}} power levels, during {{which there is}} not sufficient exhaust heat energy to drive the turbine fast enough for the compressor to supply the air necessary for combustion, the engine drives the compressor through a gear train and an overrunning clutch. At higher power levels, the overrunning clutch is disengaged, and the turbo-compressor operates as a true turbocharger. It is possible for the turbo-compressor to revert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power. Turbocharging provides higher horsepower and good <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> at all altitudes. Turbocharging also improves fuel consumption and reduces emissions.|$|E
50|$|As with {{everyday}} passenger vehicles, {{the smooth}} <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the straight-six engine are what make it desirable for industrial use. The straight-six {{is a simple}} engine that is in both primary and secondary balance. This means it can be scaled up to very large sizes without causing excessive vibration. Most of the engine components and accessories can be located along both sides, rather than on top of or underneath the cylinder banks, meaning that access and maintenance is easier than on a V engine in a truck or industrial configuration. In addition, a straight-six engine is mechanically simpler than a V6 or V8 since it has only one cylinder head and the overhead camshaft configuration has half as many camshafts.|$|E
30|$|Complex {{network theory}} is an {{effective}} tool to study topological and kinetic properties of network [8]. Power grid is a complex network [9, 10]. Most of available methods for evaluating node importance of power grid are based on complex network theory. In [4, 5], the change of the weighted network agglomeration after node contraction {{is defined as the}} index of node importance. Considering topology and power injection, an improved model is propose based on complex network theory for evaluating node importance of power grid in [11]. It is proposed an index of node importance combining structure of overlapping community in power grid, system <b>running</b> <b>characteristic</b> and reactance values of transmission lines in [12]. The extended betweenness and net-ability drop are defined as indexes of node importance with consideration of electric distance, power transfer distribution factor and line flow limit in [13]. In above methods, power grid is abstracted as a weighted and undirected graph. The weights of edges are given according to reactance parameters of transmission lines. The above methods evaluate node importance {{from the perspective of the}} topology of power grid to a greater extent, such as degree, betweenness and network agglomeration. In fact, power grid can be abstracted as a directed graph according to power flow direction. The node importance of power grid is related to not only the topology but also line flow, power source and load.|$|R

5000|$|The smooth <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the straight-eight made it {{popular in}} luxury and racing cars of the past. However, the engine's length demanded {{the use of}} a long engine compartment, making the basic design {{unacceptable}} in modern vehicles. Also, due to the length of the engine, torsional vibration in both crankshaft and camshaft can adversely affect reliability and performance at high speeds. In particular, a phenomenon referred to as [...] "crankshaft whip," [...] caused by the effects of centrifugal force on the crank throws at high engine rpm, can cause physical contact between the connecting rods and crankcase walls, leading to the engine's destruction. As a result, the design has been displaced almost completely by the shorter V8 engine configuration.|$|E

They concluded that even though his 40-yard time is not below 4.4 second {{and he does not}} possess the most power when running, he is a complete running back. He runs very low, below the pad level of defenders, making him very difficult to tackle. Abdullah has great balance, vision to find holes and the patience to wait for his blockers to those open holes.

To modernise the Benelux-service (Amsterdam-Brussels) and the finishing of the electrification between Roosendaal and Essen, 12 EMU were built that these EMU run in multiple unit with existing EMUs. The EMU can run under 1500 V DC and 3000 V DC. In cooperation with the NMBS the following was decided: mechanically of the same construction as the NS Mat '54 and the electrical installation would be a Belgian one.

40|$|In practice, the {{performance}} evaluation of supercomputers is still substantially driven by singlepoint estimates of metrics (e. g., MFLOPS) obtained by <b>running</b> <b>characteristic</b> benchmarks or workloads. With the {{rapid increase in}} the use of time-shared multiprogramming in these systems, such measurements are clearly inadequate. This is because multiprogramming and system overhead, as well as other degradations in performance due to time varying characteristics of workloads, are not taken into account. In multiprogrammed environments, multiple jobs and users can dramatically increase the amount of system overhead and degrade {{the performance}} of the machine. Performance techniques, such as benchmarking, which characterize performance on a dedicated machine ignore this major component of true computer performance. Due to the complexity of analysis, there has been little work done in analyzing, modeling, and predicting the performance of applications in multiprogrammed environments. This is especially true for parallel processors, where {{the costs and benefits of}} multi-user workloads are exacerbated. While some may claim that the issue of multiprogramming is not a viable one in the supercomputer market, experience shows otherwise. Even in recent massively parallel machines, multiprogramming is a key component. It has even been claimed that a partial cause of the demise of the CM 2 was the fact that it did not efficiently support time-sharing. In the same paper, Gordon Bell postulates that, multicomputers will evolve to multiprocessors in order to support efficient multiprogramming. Therefore, it is clear that parallel processors of the future will be required to offer the user a time-shared environment with reasonable response times for the applications. In this type of environment, the most important performance metric is the completion of response time of a given application. However, there are a few evaluation efforts addressing this issue...|$|R

50|$|Most {{vibration}} analysis instruments today utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) {{which is}} a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis (sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis) is {{only one aspect of}} interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on machines that employ rolling element bearings and whose main failure modes tend to be the degradation of those bearings, which typically exhibit an increase in characteristic frequencies associated with the bearing geometries and constructions. Depending on the type of machine, its typical malfunctions, the bearing types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, the CM specialist may use additional diagnostic tools, such as examination of the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a timing mark on the machine shaft (often known as a keyphasor), historical trends of vibration levels, the shape of vibration, and numerous other aspects of the signal along with other information from the process such as load, bearing temperatures, flow rates, valve positions and pressures to provide an accurate diagnosis. This is particularly true of machines that use fluid bearings rather than rolling-element bearings. To enable them to look at this data in a more simplified form vibration analysts or machinery diagnostic engineers have adopted a number of mathematical plots to show machine problems and <b>running</b> <b>characteristics,</b> these plots include the bode plot, the waterfall plot, the polar plot and the orbit time base plot amongst others.|$|E

The Physiological Strain Index (PSI), however, requires only rectal temperature (Tre) and heart rate (HR) data, and {{has been shown to}} be accurate in predicting composite heat stress in a variety of conditions. This case study - in which a 37 -year old male professional firefighter in the UK ran the 2015 Humber Bridge Half Marathon while wearing his full firefighting kit - allowed us to collect data needed to examine the relationship between PSI (as a measure of overall physiological stress) and changes in half-marathon <b>running</b> <b>characteristics.</b> PURPOSE: To describe the relationship between PSI and changes in half-marathon <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> in full firefighting kit. METHODS: A GPS-enabled heart rate monitor (HRM) and a rectal temperature probe were fitted to the subject, who wore his full kit of non-breathable turnout coat and pants, leather boots, helmet, and breathing apparatus (full-face mask, hoses, air tank). The subject planned to walk (not run) up hills and change air cylinders at 2. 4 km intervals, or as needed. Heart rate (HR), speed, and distance were recorded every two seconds. Tre was recorded when air cylinders were changed. Post hoc calculation of Tre progression and PSI were then descriptively compared to changes in running characteristics: Mean Speed (MSp), Run Time/Walk Time Ratio (RWR), and Run/Walk Oscillation Rate (OR). RESULTS: Despite the generally cool ambient conditions (17. 1 °C, 80 % humidity), the subject’s Mean PSI climbed steadily from 3. 6 to 9. 5 (on a scale of 0 - 10) over the course of the event. Peak MSp of 7. 4 kph was reached near the 9 km mark, at which time the calculated PSI was 8. 7, while RWR was 5. 9, and OR remained at 2 cycles per segment (cps, with a segment defined as a section of the course covered between cylinder changes or rest breaks). From this point on, MSp and RWR declined steadily while OR increased from 2 cps to 10. These waves of rising speed and PSI - followed by dropping speed and PSI - became more prominent, especially as PSI neared 10. 0, indicating that a physiological limit had been reached that required alteration of <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> in order to maintain forward progress.
