50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{launched}} as the Datsun Prairie in Europe and was rebranded to Nissan {{along with the}} rest of the range from 1984, at first featuring 'Datsun by Nissan' badging and then solely 'Nissan' badging from 1985. However, as Prairie was a slow but steady seller, some instrument clusters remained with the Datsun script featuring on the centre of the speedometer. Nissan tried, with partial success, to cover over the script a grey sticker over the plastic fascia of the instruments, rather than on the speedometer itself. The 1.5L engine was dropped from the UK market sometime after the 1986 facelift with the 1.8 being the sole engine offered. From the facelift (larger front lights, larger front <b>indicators</b> with additional <b>side</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>indicators,</b> trim improvements, redesigned rear tail light clusters) onwards the UK model was available either in 1.5 GL, 1.8 SGL or 1.8 SGL Anniversary II specification (featuring two-tone paint, electric front windows, electric steel sliding sunroof, Power Assisted Steering and a dealer applied 'Anniversary II' badge on the tailgate). The Prairie was sold with a 3-year 100,000 mile warranty and a 6-year anti-corrosion warranty.|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} about <b>side</b> health <b>indicator</b> in FPS, why {{they look like}} they do and what {{function}} they provide in FPS and their existence in modern FPS. The essay also contains information about traditional health indicators, psychology in colors, the crosshair focus area and research about FPS in modern times. The author research of 44 FPS games is find out the amount of <b>side</b> health <b>indicators</b> against the more traditional types and the reasons a developer would include a <b>side</b> health <b>indicator</b> instead of the others. In his research he found out that in the selected games, a fair amount of them did include only a <b>side</b> health <b>indicator</b> but a far larger amount of the combination type, using a traditional type as a primary health <b>indicator</b> and a <b>side</b> health <b>indicator</b> when an avatar takes too much damage or nearing death.

50|$|The Datsun DB-5 was {{introduced}} in 1953. The DB-5's body remained the same except for intakes added (with two chrome horizontal bars) between the headlights. The engine was the new 860 cc Datsun D10 side valve four-cylinder that produced 25 horsepower. The DB-5 was slightly redesigned in mid-1953; the rear window was widened and the <b>side</b> <b>indicators</b> were changed. The DB-5 was produced until 1954, when it {{was replaced by the}} Datsun DB-6.|$|R

50|$|Ford Australia {{built its}} own version, {{known as the}} TE, with the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Pinto unit and the Ford Falcon's 3.3-litre and 4.1-litre 6-cylinder unit. The six-cylinder {{versions}} were rather nose heavy and did not handle {{as well as the}} fours or the European V6 models. Interior door hardware and steering columns were shared with the Falcons and the Australian versions also had their own instrument clusters, optional air conditioning, and much larger bumpers. It also had <b>side</b> <b>indicators.</b> The Cortina wagon was assembled by Renault Australia at its plant in Heidelberg in Victoria.|$|R
50|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} that Puffin crossings {{may be less}} safe than Pelican crossings due the nearside indicator not being visible while crossing, and being at a different focal length, reducing traffic awareness. However, a 2008 study commissioned by the DfT found that Puffins were safer than Pelican crossings with fewer pedestrian accidents and fewer involving cars, despite confusing pedestrians. Transport for London decided to stop installing Puffins in 2014, as they prefer the far <b>side</b> <b>indicators.</b> Birmingham Council also dislike the low level indicators at busy city centre crossings.|$|R

This version, with blacked-out trim and 17-inch alloy wheels, was otherwise a Connoisseur SE spec and was brought out to celebrate Rover's centenary in Portugal.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to identify and}} evaluate the main determinants of venture capital (VC). We develop a theoretical model where macroeconomic conditions, technological opportunity, and the entrepreneurial environment affect the demand and supply of VC. The quantitative results, based on a panel dataset of 16 OECD countries from 1990 to 2000, show that VC intensity is pro-cyclical. Interest rates affect more the demand side of VC (entrepreneurs) than the supply <b>side.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of technological opportunity, such as the stock of knowledge {{and the number of}} triadic patents affect positively and significantly the relative level of VC. Labour market rigidities reduce the impact of the GDP growth rate and of the stock of knowledge, whereas a minimum level of entrepreneurship is required {{in order to have a}} positive effect of the available stock of knowledge on VC intensity.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the ongoing {{discussion}} on the regulation and marketisation of the higher education system. Its aim is to study the higher education market (des) equilibrium. Teixeira, Rosa and Amaral (2004) have analysed the presence/absence of market mechanisms in the Portuguese higher education sector. This paper describes supply and demand in the Portuguese system. On the supply side, it looks at indicators such as place distribution and diversity, whereas on the demand <b>side,</b> <b>indicators</b> based on the revealed preferences are computed. It goes a step further in quantifying the (mis) match {{between the two sides}} of the market, by suggesting and computing a set of strength and weakness indicators. These indicators are then used in predicting the potential impact of changes in higher education regulations on the market equilibrium and stability.
