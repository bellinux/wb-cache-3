50|$|The former {{dominant}} political clan in Milagros was the De Jesus Clan {{and followed}} by the Abapo Clan. In 2015, former Milagros town Mayor Bernardito Abapo was arrested in a raid by the Philippine National Police and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency on a suspected drug laboratory in Masbate province. The results of the 2007 Local Elections replaced the Abapo Clan by the Magbalon Clan. Dr. Natividad Isabel Magbalon finished her 3-consecutive terms or a total of 9 years as being {{the mayor of the}} municipality. When she was still the mayor of the town, the Office of the Ombudsman has ordered the filing of the case against Dr. Magbalon before the Sandiganbayan after finding probable cause to indict her. The Ombudsman accused Magbalon of graft charge for withholding the <b>representation</b> and transportation <b>allowance</b> (RATA) allotted for the Office of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (OMSWD) in 2013. Since Dr. Natividad Isabel Magbalon can no longer run for mayor, her husband Jose Magbalon Jr. run on her behalf and won the 2016 elections with 51.2% votes over his opponent Bobet Trias.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Successful cross-national {{research}} requires {{methods that}} are both standardized across sites and adaptable to local conditions. We report on {{the development and implementation}} of the methodology underlying the survey component of the WHO Drug Injection Study Phase II – a multi-site study of risk behavior and HIV seroprevalence among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs). Methods Standardized operational guidelines were developed by the Survey Coordinating Center in collaboration with the WHO Project Officer and participating site Investigators. Throughout the duration of the study, survey implementation at the local level was monitored by the Coordinating Center. Surveys were conducted in 12 different cities. Prior rapid assessment conducted in 10 cities provided insight into local context and guided survey implementation. Where possible, subjects were recruited both from drug abuse treatment centers and via street outreach. While emphasis was on IDUs, non-injectors were also recruited in cities with substantial non-injecting use of injectable drugs. A structured interview and HIV counseling/testing were administered. Results Over 5, 000 subjects were recruited. Subjects were recruited from both drug treatment and street outreach in 10 cities. Non-injectors were recruited in nine cities. Prior rapid assessment identified suitable recruitment areas, reduced drug users' distrust of survey staff, and revealed site-specific risk behaviors. Centralized survey coordination facilitated local questionnaire modification within a core structure, standardized data collection protocols, uniform database structure, and cross-site analyses. Major site-specific problems included: questionnaire translation difficulties; locating affordable HIV-testing facilities; recruitment from drug treatment due to limited/selective treatment infrastructure; access to specific sub-groups of drug users in the community, particularly females or higher income groups; security problems for users and interviewers, hostility from local drug dealers; and interference by local service providers. Conclusion Rapid assessment proved invaluable in paving the way for the survey. Central coordination of data collection is crucial. While fully standardized methods may be a research ideal, local circumstances may require substantial adaptation of the methods to achieve meaningful local <b>representation.</b> <b>Allowance</b> for understanding of local context may increase rather than decrease the generalizability of the data. </p...|$|E
