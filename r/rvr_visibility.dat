40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigates the}} capability of Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) to provide significant situation awareness in terminal area operations, specifically in low visibility conditions. The use of a Head-Up Display (HUD) and Head-Down Displays (HDD) with SVS is contrasted to baseline standard head down displays in terms of induced workload and pilot behavior in 1400 <b>RVR</b> <b>visibility</b> levels. Variances across performance and pilot behavior were reviewed for acceptability when using HUD or HDD with SVS under reduced minimums to acquire the necessary visual components to continue to land. The data suggest superior performance for HUD implementations. Improved attentional behavior is also suggested for HDD implementations of SVS for low-visibility approach and landing operations...|$|E
40|$|Drishti {{transmissometer}} â€“ A visibility measuring system, an Indigenous {{development from}} CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories (CSIR-NAL), has been installed at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport, New Delhi for precise measurements of visibility and {{runway visual range}} (<b>RVR).</b> <b>Visibility</b> information is critical under poor visibility conditions for all categories of airports viz., CAT I, CAT II, CAT III A & B. In CAT IIIB Airports the pilots have to land with as low a visibility as 50 meters during dense fog. Drishti system with 30 meters baseline is {{first of its kind}} installed at any airport in the country. In this paper we report visibility measurements of Drishti during different weather conditions viz., dust storm, rainfall and dense fog at IGI Airport, New Delhi. Drishti data has been compared with other imported transmissometers which have been situated in the Airport either parallel to Drishti or installed few kms away. It has been observed that Drishti measures visibility very accurately. Remote health monitoring of the system through Web-enabling, fast and easy field maintenance through modular electronics are some of the salient features of the system. IGI Airport is the first airport in the country to have Indigenous systems in all its three runways...|$|E
50|$|Weather was 2,400 feet <b>visibility,</b> <b>RVR</b> runway 05L of 3,900 feet, 300 feet broken ceiling, 3,000 feet overcast. According to the CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), {{the last}} words were from the captain and were 'OH! My God!'. This was {{surrounded}} by the Terrain alarm and stall warnings.|$|R
40|$|Dual {{base line}} AVRA (AVRA MK II) {{system is a}} tramsmissometer system for {{measuring}} the runway visual range (<b>RVR)</b> and Meteorological <b>visibility</b> (MV) satisfying the visibility range requirements for all categories of aircraft landing operations (Cat II, Cat IIIa and Cat IIIb). This document describes the software for this system. Flowcharts designed for this system are also included...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a part-task {{simulation}} evaluating the separate and combined effects of an electronic moving map display and newly developed HUD symbology on ground taxi performance, under moderate- and low-visibility conditions. Twenty-four commercial airline pilots carried out a series of 28 gate-to-runway taxi trials at Chicago O'Hare. Half of the trials were conducted under moderate <b>visibility</b> (<b>RVR</b> 1400 ft), and half under low <b>visibility</b> (<b>RVR</b> 700 ft). In the baseline condition, where navigation support was limited to surface features and a Jeppesen paper map, navigation errors were committed on almost half of the trials. These errors were virtually abolished when the electronic moving map or the HUD symbology was available; in addition, compared to the baseline condition, both forms of navigation aid yielded an increase in forward taxi speed. The speed increase was greater for the HUD than the electronic moving map, and greater under low visibility than under moderate visibility. These results suggest that the combination of electronic moving map and HUD symbology has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of ground taxi operations, particularly under low-visibility conditions...|$|R
