5|$|On 20 December 1961, No.410 Squadron became Canada's first {{operational}} CF-101 Voodoo squadron.

5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the <b>Rockets</b> <b>and</b> the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof. After sessions with his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The <b>Rockets</b> <b>and</b> White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white). White missed the first week of training camp before this agreement was put in place.|$|E

5|$|Artillery in the Middle Ages {{primarily}} {{consisted of}} {{the introduction of the}} cannon, large tubular firearms designed to fire a heavy projectile over a long distance.

5|$|In {{their final}} conference {{game of the}} season, Toledo {{defeated}} the Western Michigan Broncos 37–9 to secure the conference co-championship with Central Michigan.

5|$|The attacking force {{included}} JNA soldiers conscripted {{from across}} Yugoslavia, {{members of the}} TO, Chetniks (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force.

50|$|At one point, Judson Jakes {{tried to}} steal the Halfworld Bible, but was thwarted by <b>Rocket</b> <b>and</b> various animal associates. Later, Lord Dyvyne {{abducted}} <b>Rocket's</b> friend Lylla, <b>and</b> Jakes began the Toy War. As the Toy War continued, Blackjack O'Hare teamed up with <b>Rocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rocket</b> was reunited with Lylla. The Rack 'n' Ruin was soon destroyed, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne teamed up to kill Rocket Raccoon. <b>Rocket</b> Raccoon <b>and</b> his friends cured the Loonies of their mental illnesses, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne were apparently killed. <b>Rocket</b> <b>and</b> the animals {{as well as the}} robots left Halfworld and took off into space for their own adventures. Some time later, Rocket was revealed to have been a laboratory subject on the Stranger's planet, and escaped his captivity there.|$|R
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive <b>rockets</b> <b>and</b> arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|Although immobilizing {{a victim}} {{in front of}} a gun before firing the cannon {{is by far the most}} {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges that the victim was actually put into the gun and executed in that manner. Reports exist that attest that on occasion, people were fastened to <b>rockets</b> <b>and</b> blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761–1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E

On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing <b>rockets</b> <b>and</b> strafing the presidential compound with machine-gun fire. The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E

5|$|Coggins {{served as}} an artist for British YANK in London until August 2, 1945 and was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army on November 3, 1945. While in Britain, Coggins spent time on a Royal Navy convoy in the North Sea, witnessed the bombing of Saint-Lô, and flew over Berlin in a Lancaster bomber. He also spent time on a U.S. PT boat patrolling the beaches and made a trip into Brittany with an armored column. Events from all of these sorties were illustrated in YANK magazine in double page spreads. During his time in Britain, Coggins wrote articles on war <b>rockets</b> <b>and</b> the German Navy which were also published in YANK.|$|E
5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, <b>rockets,</b> <b>and</b> depth charges.|$|E

Moses Malone, who played 6 of 19 seasons for the Rockets, had the most points, rebounds, and free throws made in a season for the <b>Rockets,</b> <b>and</b> he also holds the NBA records for most offensive rebounds in a regular season and playoff game.|$|E

In Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, he hit a go-ahead shot with a second left to lift the Clippers over the Spurs despite a hamstring injury. The injury forced him to miss the first two games of the next series versus the Houston <b>Rockets,</b> <b>and</b> Los Angeles eventually lost in seven games despite holding a 3–1 series lead. The defeat marked ten consecutive seasons and seven consecutive playoff appearances without a Conference Finals appearance for Paul.|$|E
5|$|In Aden in May 1964, Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF {{were used}} {{extensively}} during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting {{to overthrow the}} Federation of South Arabia. SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision, and, predominantly using 3-inch high explosive <b>rockets</b> <b>and</b> 30mm ADEN cannon, the Hunter proved an able ground-attack platform. Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1950s, {{fishermen}} in Iceland requested {{assistance from the}} government to remove Killer Whales from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance. As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, <b>rockets</b> <b>and</b> depth charges.|$|E
