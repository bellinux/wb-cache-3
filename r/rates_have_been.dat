5|$|The {{population}} segment {{most likely}} to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who {{have a history of}} smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rising over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize. In the USA, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.|$|E
5|$|High {{mortality}} <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{recorded in}} the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E

People are living longer with projections of average life expectancy reaching 84.6 years for men and 89.1 for women by 2060, an increase of 7.9 years of life for men and 6.6 years of life for women compared to 2010.|$|E

Excessive and problematic Internet use has been reported across all age, social, economical, and educational ranges.
