2500|$|A British {{reconnaissance}} aircraft sighted Bismarck {{in the early}} morning hours of 26 May by following its oil slick. At dusk on 26 May, Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft from HMS Ark Royal attacked. Though much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed Bismarcks rudders and steering gear. Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but Lütjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage Lütjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer Bismarck somewhat by adjusting the <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to [...] and effectively left it circling in the water.|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} on {{the importance}} that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically [...] "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know." [...] Drummond's penchant for living by numbers has also been observed in his choosing to align the ages at which he undertook creative projects The Man and 45 with the standard <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds</b> of a turntable (33.3 and 45 rpm).|$|R

5000|$|The Baltic {{is driven}} by two main engines of the General Electric 16V250MDB3 type which are {{connected}} to two Schottel controllable pitch propellers via transmissions and drive shafts. The engines are 16-cylinder Diesel units which can provide [...] each at a nominal 1,050 revolutions per minute. The propellers are encased in Kort nozzles and have a maximum <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> of 170 rpm. Two thrusters are installed in the bow and the stern section respectively to improve the ship's manoeuvrability.|$|E
5000|$|The load can be {{a maximum}} power, temperature, <b>revolution</b> <b>speed,</b> torque, {{acceleration}} or whatever can influence the mechanical or chemical properties of the device for its correct function: for instance an electrical motor can be driven at a higher <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> than for normal (constant) operation (nominal <b>revolution</b> <b>speed),</b> but after a short time it should be driven down or switched out {{in order to prevent}} from damage; another example can be the operating temperature of a simple oven which can be raised to the maximum allowed but only for a short time to avoid that the oven begins to burn. Generally at all performances a part of the input energy will be dissipated as heat. The higher the operation power the higher the heat to dissipate. If the performance is too high, the device {{will not be able to}} dissipate the heat to its environment and its temperature will raise proportionally to the energy surplus. If the temperature raises too much the mechanical and chemical properties of the device will begin to change causing permanent deformations for plastical material or fractures for brittle materials. Being the energy the product of power and time, either the power (or any to it related physical value) as by normal operation/duty or the time as by short-time duty have to be limited. A common application is the high current measure (typically up to 10 or 20 A) with multimeters. The maximum time length of short time duty (typically 10 to 30 seconds) is indicated near the corresponding socket (usually the left one) as well as the time to be waited for, before each of such measures might be repeated (typically [...] "each 15 minutes"). Another common application is inflation with air compressors: those become very hot, if used for a too long time and have to be shut down after a certain time (for small compressors such that of the picture a typical time is 10 minutes).|$|E
50|$|The motors are {{designed}} with a sealed oil sump from which oil is pumped continuously to lubricate the bearings. A fan draws air from the engine room through the motor to cool it and returns the exhaust air to the engine room through a water-cooled heat exchanger. This arrangement reduces the possibility of water being drawn into the motor {{should there be a}} leak in the cooler. The engine is also fitted with a heater to keep it warm when not running so as to prevent condensation internally. Temperature and <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> are monitored and displayed on the control panel.|$|E

One-point electromagnetic synchronized pulse excitation served as a force excitation for analysis of resonant vibration under different <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds.</b> The force level was evaluated from supply current calibrated by dynamic scale measurement. The responses of the blades were measurement by strain-gauges placed on the blades with a slip-ring signal transmission. After sufficient level of first flexural (axial) blade vibration the electromagnetic force was turned off and vibration attenuations were analyzed. The dynamic behaviour of the blades and results of damping are in a good accordance with the numerical modelling...|$|R

40|$|Some {{preliminary}} results concerning performance improvement of a two-cylinder automotive engine, are here reported. This has been obtained through a {{revised version of}} a variable valve-timing system, whose early prototype had already been implemented on a single-cylinder engine. The updated device, which operates {{on the basis of}} a hydraulic working principle and is electronically controlled by means of a high-speed solenoid-valve, has been placed in the kinematic chain of the original valve-timing system of the engine, in order to modify only the closing features of the intake-valve. The major aim of this practice is to obtain some torque gain, especially at low <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds,</b> by selecting the most suitable intake-valve timing in all operating condition...|$|R

50|$|In all {{vehicles}} using {{a transmission}} (virtually all modern vehicles), {{a coupling device}} is used to separate the engine and transmission when necessary. This is because an internal-combustion engine must continue to run when in use, although a few modern cars shut off the engine when the vehicle is stationary. The clutch accomplishes this in manual transmissions. Without it, the engine and tires would at all times be inextricably linked, and any time the vehicle stopped, the engine would stall. Without the clutch, changing gears would be very difficult, even with the vehicle moving already: deselecting a gear while the transmission is under load requires considerable force (and risks significant damage). As well, selecting a gear requires the <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> of the engine {{to be held at}} a very precise value which depends on the vehicle speed and desired gear - the speeds inside the transmission have to match. In a car, the clutch is usually operated by a pedal; on a motorcycle, a lever on the left handlebar serves the purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} power {{produced by the}} main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds</b> between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|R
40|$|Five axis {{micromachining}} has, due to {{many different}} tools and materials, {{a demand for}} a very broad spectrum of <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds.</b> Due to this, several types of tool spindles with varying tool holding systems have to be mounted on the high precision machine tool. With this, severe positioning errors are incorporated. In this work the occurring geometrical positioning errors are analysed and their effects on microcutting are shown. To compensate the errors, different models have been investigated and two promising principles have been established. For a fast tool spindle change a fixed position loading system with very precise spindle holders, without the need to use fine adjustment elements, is proposed. The second alternative is a precision adjustment system using flexures that are frictionless and free from backlash. Here, the spindle is adjusted after every installation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High-precision {{machining}} {{and large-scale}} tool {{are the most}} primary development trend of current machine tool and hydrostatic products are key technologies of high-precision machining equipments. However, these equipments mostly process miniature components, thus the adopted tools are relatively small and the spindles mainly use are mainly built-in types of HSK 32 to HSK 25 with <b>revolutions</b> <b>speed</b> over 25, 000 rpm. Some processing equipments are even equipped with hydrostatic or gas-static spindles. The study extends the axial oil chamber to radial ones to expand the action area of axial oil pressure and form a closed oil seal edge by combining the radial clearance. Consequently, the axial bearing stiffness can be enhanced to enlarge the application scope of hydrostatic spindle. The design mode can enhance axial stiffness of spindle modules or strengthen the stiffness of hydrostatic spindle in a ball screw...|$|R

A study released by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center shows that the Riddell Revolution, and others like it, reduce the incidences of concussion by 31%. Subsequently, a Senate Commerce Committee meeting on October 19, 2011, heard testimony from Jeffrey Kutcher, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan and chair of the American Academy of Neurology's sports neurology section that [...] "there is no significant data" [...] in the UPMC study for Riddell to make the claim that the helmet reduced concussions by 31%.

40|$|It is {{said that}} the {{revolution}} speeds of band saw wheels change during sawing by the load acting on the band saw. However, there are few quantitative data on such change during sawing. In this study, the revolution speeds of the band saw wheels were measured precisely with rotary encoders, {{in order to examine}} the influence of sawing condition on the change in <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> and the power consumption during sawing. The revolution speeds of band saw wheels decreased along with the start of sawing, and then it resumed closely to the idling <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> level. It increased immediately after sawing and then it came down to the idling <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> level before sawing. The power consumption increased rapidly simultaneous with the start of sawing and then it decreased gently. After sawing, the power consumption decreased rapidly and then resumed the level for idling. The differences between the maximum and minimum revolution speeds of band saw wheels during sawing increased with an increase in feed speed and also with an increase in depth of workpiece.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{transient}} dynamic characteristics of water-lubricated bearing-rotor system in seawater desalination high pressure pump, the water-lubricated bearing test device {{was designed and}} built based on the prototype of high pressure pump with 4 -stage rotors. The test was conducted to study the journal orbit and circumferential pressure distribution of journal bearing. The result shows that, in startup stage, the journal whirled with little amplitude in low <b>revolution</b> <b>speed,</b> and as the <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> increased, the journal began to move irregularly. The hydrodynamic lubrication formed basically when close to the rated <b>revolution</b> <b>speed,</b> and there is stable whirling center and amplitude of the journal orbit. The circumferential pressure distribution of journal bearing changed severely and kept consistent with the change of journal orbit; when the <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> reached the rated speed, the pressure distribution is stable. We changed the radius clearance, the aspect ratio, and the rotating speed to analyze the influence on the bearing-rotor system at steady speed. In conclusion, the journal orbit and circumferential pressure of journal bearing are very stable when the clearance radius is 0. 05 [*]mm, the aspect ratio is 1, and the <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> is 3000 [*]r/min...|$|E

40|$|An experimental-theoretical {{study has}} been carried out on {{high-pressure}} volumetric radial-piston pumps for diesel fuel injection systems. The dependence of the pump inducted flow rate on speed and load was investigated and the characteristic curve of the pump cooling-lubrication circuit was derived. The head-capacity curves were determined for different types of pumps at different <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds</b> and compared with the injector flow requirements in order to evaluate the pressure-control strategy efficiency. An insight into the ageing effects on the pump performance was also provided. Furthermore, the dynamic pump behavior was investigated, with specific reference to the flow-rate ripple at the delivery port. A general analytical expression has been derived for the volumetric efficiency. Furthermore, a specific procedure has been developed and applied to the experimental evaluation of the fuel leakages in pressure control valve (PCV) integrated pumps. Finally, the mechanical-hydraulic efficiency of the pump has experimentally been assessed as a function of head and speed in order to obtain a reliable evaluation of the pump shaft power and torque at different working condition...|$|R

40|$|A new {{normalized}} coupling synchronization (NCS) {{method is}} proposed {{to solve the}} problem of synchronizing the speeds of all wheels in a multi‐axis independent driving system without mechanical transmission connection. The NCS method integrates normalizing and coupling techniques by emulating mechanical line shaft. All wheelsʹ speeds are normalized, and thus can be synchronized whether the wheelʹs <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds</b> are the same or different. Then, all of the normalized wheel speeds are coupled in order to eliminate speed synchronization errors between any pair of axes. Therefore, the new algorithm is able to achieve global speed synchronization. It is applicable to multi‐ axis driving vehicles either driving in straight line or making a turn. The conducted computational simulation shows that the proposed method gets better result in reducing speed synchronization errors in both cases of same and different wheel speeds compared to some classic speed sync methods in the literature. To further validate the effectiveness and applicability of the NCS method, it is also applied to a four‐wheel‐driving and four‐wheel‐steering vehicle for comparison tests. The onboard tests indicate that the proposed method achieves a fast convergence of speed error...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to better characterize the influence of process parameters (impeller <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds)</b> on the performance of a planetary flour-beater mixer (mixer bowl P 600 from Brabender) used in dough production. Firstly, we have theoretically described the path followed by the impeller tip into the vessel and the variation of the absolute velocity during its trajectory. This gives us indications during the transient mixing action of the material induced by this mixer. Secondly, we have theoretically and experimentally shown that for Newtonian fluids: (i) The power dissipated by this mixer is strongly dependent on the impeller speed ratios. (ii) It is possible to obtain for this planetary mixer a unique master power curve, gathering on the same characteristic the influence of the dual impeller speeds on power consumption. This requires the introduction of a characteristic velocity, known as the maximal impeller tip velocity, into power and Reynolds numbers. The constant K-p, of the mixer bowl P 600, determined as the product of the modified Reynolds and power numbers, was found to be equal to 48. 6. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
