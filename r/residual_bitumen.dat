At present leading positions on Russian bitumen market occupy the companies Gazprom Oil, Rosneft and Lukoyl. They cover nearly 80 % of total volume of bitumen production in the RF. In world road construction practice the <b>residual</b> road oil <b>bitumen</b> is basically used, from which more than 80 % of motor roads are built in the west.

Amongst block polymer of the styrene (SBC - styrene block copolymer), used in road construction, the main modifier for production of polymer-modified bitumen in the world is butadiene styrene thermoelastolayer SBS (SBS - styrene butadiene styrene). In 2014 at Moscow NPZ the installation on production PMB of new generation G-Way Styrelf is launched. The installation was built by the joint-venture Gazprom Oil" and French concern Total and is considered to produce 60 thousand tons of PMB and 7 thousand tons of bitumen emulsion per annum. The production is realized in accordance with technology Styrelf, designed by concern Total and adapted to Russian climatic conditions.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{continuous}} quality {{improvement of the}} road pavements, leads {{to the development of}} new binders, such as asphalt rubber (AR). AR is produced by the digestion of crumb rubber from used tires on bitumen. The resulting AR is a heterogeneous material with high viscosity. The study of this product during its production is essential due to the sudden and sharp increase in the volume of AR in this phase. Knowledge of the extent of this phenomenon has obvious implications {{in the design of the}} AR production equipment. In addition, to predict the performance of the AR in the pavement, its components (i. e. bitumen and rubber) should be analyzed separately. Thus, the objective of this paper is to present new experimental methods for the evaluation of the referred parameters, namely: i) a method to control the AR density during its production; ii) a modified “basket drainage method” to separate the swelled rubber from the <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> after the AR production and; iii) a “sphere AR production simulator” (SARPS) method developed to reproduce the bitumen aging during the AR production (without the contribution of the rubber interaction). The effectiveness of these procedures was assessed by applying conventional CEN tests in the different bituminous materials obtained with the previous methods (base bitumen, sphere bitumen, <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> and AR). SARPS method, combined with the “basket drainage method”, was found to be a simple and effective way to monitor rubber-bitumen interaction.

The fine grain sludge component of this waste is the most troublesome because of its stability and poor compactibility. Apparently, the sludge owes it's stability to a complex interaction between organic coated, amorphous particles, clays and bitumen. Recently, we have developed a novel technique for the recovery of organic material from the tailings streams of bitumen extraction plants. The separated fractions include the <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen,</b> naphtha and solids associated with the significant quantities of strongly adsorbed organic matter which is largely insoluable in common solvents.

Different research lines are discussed, concluding that the most influential variables are: tack coat type, dosage, mixture type, surface characteristics, temperature, and emulsion breaking time. In order to reach the highest bond strength values, the following factors should be considered: high values of surface macro-texture, low temperatures, the use of heat-adhesive emulsion, a dosage from 300 to 450 g/m 2 of <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> and the compaction after emulsion break.

40|$|The mining of {{bituminous}} sandstone {{rock for}} the purpose of extracting bitumen has created a need for reclamation. One such mine is located in northern Logan County. Their mining operation involves removing large sections of sandstone, which is impregnated with bitumen, and crushing it to sand-sized material. The sand-sized material is then mixed with organic solvents which extract the bitumen. Once separated, the bitumen is stored for future refinement and the spent sand is stockpiled for later disposal. The spent sands or waste material are referred to as tar sand tailings. These tailings have particular properties which make reclamation efforts difficult. One restrictive property is the 30 percent swell factor, which prevents replacement of the tailings into their respective mined area. Another property is the tailings’ hydrophobicity. This water repellence prevents merely spreading the tailings onto the surface. Experiments were conducted at Western Kentucky University during 1984 and 1985 to determine methods to lessen the hydrophobic tendencies and allow for reclamation. These experiments included mixing the tailings with the existing soil and adding surfactants to the tailings. Water holding capacities, infiltration rates, and the ability to sustain plant life were determined and evaluated. It appears that the <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> not removed by the extraction process causes the hydrophobic tendencies of the tailings. This conclusion was based on a comparison of pure tailings and tailings which were subjected to 500 °C temperatures for 24 hours which could destroy all organic material, specifically the <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen.</b> The pure tar sand tailing held 0. 44 percent moisture and the tailings with the organic material removed held 27. 48 percent moisture. Mixtures of tailings and Zanesville soil were also evaluated and compared to the tailings with and without organic material. The percent moisture of the soil was not significantly different from the tailings without organic material. All mixtures were significantly lower than the soil or the tailings without organic material and significantly higher than the pure tar and tailings. However, the mixtures apparently can hold sufficient moisture for plant growth. Water infiltration rates through various mixtures of tailings and soil with and without surfactants were also evaluated. It was concluded that a tailings/soil mixture of 75 / 25 percent with and without surfactant and 90 / 10 percent mixture with surfactant allowed the fastest water infiltration. The rate of infiltration is important since the Logan County topography is favorable for runoff erosion. Rye (secale cereale) was grown in various mixtures of tailings and soil with and without surfactants to determine phytotoxic effects. Visual observations of the growing plants indicated no phytotoxic effects due to the bitumen or surfactants. However, dry matter yields of the plants differed significantly. The lower yield of some plants could be attributed to a lack of moisture since the lowest yields were in the pure tailings with and without surfactant. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} revealed that tar sand tailings do have hydrophobic tendencies apparently due to <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen.</b> These tendencies can be buffered by mixing the waste material with an existing soil or by complete combustion of the residual organic material. Also it was concluded that vegetation could be established on the mixtures of tailings and soil and thus, the land reclaimed...|$|E

The large volume, and poor consolidation and water release ability of MFT have been causing significant economic and environmental concerns.

Knowledge of the geology and stratigraphy of the basin is very scarce, {{and there are no}} petrologic studies published on its sedimentary rocks. The petrologic study of coastal sabkha deposits from the Paleozoic Pimenta Bueno Formation revealed that the diagenetic processes are largely facies-controlled, with substantial differences among tidal flat, deltaic and hypersaline lagoon deposits. The sequence of diagenetic processes indicates that diagenetic fluids of two main compositions were responsible for the precipitation of the authigenic minerals. Diagenesis was initially controlled by saline-alkaline, oxidizing porewaters that precipitated Fe oxide coatings, quartz and feldspar overgrowths, anhydrite, dolomite, calcite, chalcedony and microquartz cements.

40|$|Oil sands {{tailings}} are a warm {{aqueous suspension}} of sand, silt, clay, <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> and naphtha. The tailings are hydraulically transported {{and stored in}} tailing ponds where they segregate, with the sand settling from suspension forming beaches and the remaining tailings flowing {{to the middle of}} the pond. After several years of tailings disposal, three layers have developed in the pond, which are, from top to bottom, water, thin fine tailing and mature fine tailing (MFT). MFT is the major reason that the tailing ponds cannot be reclaimed. Due to low the high water content and low hydraulic conductivity, MFT consolidate very slowly in the ponds. Therefore, many technologies have been proposed remove the water from the tailings and increase the consistency so that the tailing pond can be reclaimed. but most of these dewatering technologies are rejected due to the limited technical or economic feasibility.

The use of bitumen modified with crumb rubber contributes for a sustainable development of road infrastructures through: (i) the definition of an efficient final destination for the used tires of cars and trucks; (ii) the improvement of the performance of the resulting material used in the pavement. However, the materials which constitute these AR binders and the physicochemical changes in the binder during the production of the AR are not sufficiently characterized. Thus, the main objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the changes in the morphology of the rubber particles due to the interaction with three different bitumens during the production of the ARs. The studied bitumens were selected from the same origin and obtained in the same distillation column. Initially, the bitumens were left to interact with 17. 5 % of crumb rubber by mass of AR binder.

So far, a homogeneous reservoir model, a study of the regional geology and a study of the fluid flow and heat transfer have been made. For these studies, information is used from the Moerkapelle oil field located twelve kilometers to the east of Delft. Because of the oil production there, a wealth of subsurface data is available. This thesis used for the first time borehole cuttings data from the well DEL- 03. DEL- 03 is less then one kilometer away from the proposed drill site. The aim of this thesis is to discover vertical heterogeneity within the Delft Sandstone Member with a sediment-petrographical analysis. With the use of thin slides of the cuttings of DEL- 03 a sedimentary analysis has been made using a polarizing microscope. It goes more deeply into mineralogical content and cement types. Examination of the cuttings with fluorescent light and chloroform proved the absence of <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen,</b> which is a needed for the production of hot water. Also a grain size analysis has been made which was inconclusive. The content of sandstone in the borehole cuttings analysis does not correspond with the results of the spontaneous potential log of DEL- 03. Siderite present as cement in these sections is the cause of this contradiction. The siderite cement has a high influence on the porosity and permeability which is also concluded in the petrographical study of thin slides of plugs of MKP- 11. Porosity is detected {{with the use of the}} software Image Analysis while the permeability is calculated with the Karman-Kozeny equation. The porosities in the upper part of the Delft Sandstone Member beneath Moerkapelle showed relatively high values and therefore a relative high permeability. The results of this thesis can be used, together with the many images gathered, as a database for a heterogeneous reservoir model. Applied GeologyGeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The Aurora Soil Capping study, {{located in}} {{northern}} Alberta, was constructed to evaluate reclamation practices on lean oil sands dumps. The challenges relating to its success includes determining the appropriate soil cover design(s) for the coarse textured reclamation soil, while utilizing available salvaged natural soils, {{some of which}} contain <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> {{in the form of}} aggregate oil sand material (AOSM). Limited research on this material raises key questions as to the impact it will play on transport and retention processes, along with potential contamination from hydrocarbon leaching. The research conducted sought to answer these questions. This thesis describes laboratory studies conducted on four soils; the upper organic LFH layer, Bm, BC and subsoil material while varying the amount of AOSM and implementing layering schemes. Material characterization through organic carbon and particle size analysis as well as hydrophobicity studies on AOSM through contact angle analysis were performed. A tension table and pressure plates, along with columns equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry probes, were used for water retention studies. Hydraulic conductivity was measured through constant head methods. To address hydrocarbon leaching concerns, chloride tracer studies were performed and the column outflow was analyzed using Gas Chromatography to detect the hydrocarbon type and concentration. Results from water retention and hydraulic conductivity studies indicated that although the AOSM was hydrophobic, its placement at varying concentrations and forms did not create consistent significant differences in the amount of moisture retained or transported. Results from the column studies showed that under steady state and transient conditions AOSM could result in decreasing infiltration rates and increasing chloride retention. The integration of soil layers further slowed the infiltration rate and delayed chloride transport. Under saturated conditions the presence of higher concentrations of AOSM appeared to increase the rate of water movement. Although these differences were minimal, further studies are required to explore this behavior. Overall, it can be concluded that with appropriate material placement, the addition of layering schemes and hydrocarbon material, the potential exists to increase soil water content in the upper layers of the soil, thereby increasing soil water storage for plant use...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} two {{challenges facing}} the management of mature fine tailings (MFT) from oil sand processing. The first challenge is the high concentration of <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> in tailings ponds, which poses a hazard to aquatic biota and impact to the environment. A laboratory scale study is carried out to assess the suitability of electro-flotation (EF) for removal of bitumen from oil sand tailings slurry. The {{results of the study}} confirm that EF is effective to reduce bitumen contents of tailings slurry. At a current density 150 A/m 2, the bitumen concentration is reduced from 106. 8 mg/L to less than 10 mg/L within 90 minutes. The electrolysis voltage has direct impact to the operating cost of an EF system, hence an electrochemical model is developed to predict the total electrolysis voltage required for an EF cell. Good agreement is found between the simulation results and experimental data from both this study and the literature. Hence the model derived can be used to predict the total electrolysis voltage required for an EF cell and to optimize operating conditions of an EF cell to reduce the operating cost. The performance of EF is strongly influenced by the size of O 2 and H 2 bubbles. Therefore, in this study the bubble sizes are measured in a lab scale EF cell using a high-speed camera. The mean bubble size is found to vary in the range of 32. 7 – 68. 6 μm under different operating conditions. This study shows that the electrode material, current density, water pH, ionic strength, and frother (Tennafroth 250) concentration are important factors in controlling the bubble size. Furthermore, four mathematical distributions (normal, log-normal, Weibull and gamma distributions) are fitted to the experimental data, among which the log-normal distribution is found to be the best fit based on the lower Anderson-Darling (AD) value. The second major challenge is to thicken and consolidate the MFT for water recycling and land reclamation. The suitability of electrokinetic (EK) sedimentation to accelerate sedimentation of MFT is investigated in this study. Based on the experimental data, an electric field intensity of 150 V/m along with an initial tailings solid concentration of no more than 5 % are the optimum operating condition for EK sedimentation of MFT, in terms of reducing the overall sedimentation time and increasing the final solid concentration. The results show that the current density of EK sedimentation for MFT should not be more than 20 A/m 2 to control the bubble effect and reduce power consumption...|$|E
40|$|A {{multitude}} of chemical reactions rely on high temperatures and pressures to attain suitable kinetics and reach desirable conversions, which are commonly delivered in autoclave reactors. Traditional reactor designs (e. g. CSTRs) have large energy demands (due to pressurization and mixing demands, and heat losses) and costly construction specifications (to meet pressurized vessel codes and safety provisions), which make certain processing routes prohibitively expensive. An alternative reactor technology, which cleverly applies {{the principles of}} process integration and process intensification [1], is the Gravity Pressure Vessel (GPV). This is {{a special kind of}} autoclave with a built-in heat exchanger, plug flow configuration, and gravity driven pressurization/depressurization. Residence time is controlled by the reactor length that can reach up to 2400 m, resulting in hydrostatically built pressures that can exceed 120 bar. By continuously recycling exothermic reaction heat, up to 70 % of the energy can be conserved, and high end temperatures can be achieved (up to 500 °C). In the case of slurry flow, the generated turbulence promotes particle-particle interaction, removing passivating layers and autogenously milling the reacting material, permitting post-processing separation of the mineral phases into valuable product streams. The first patent of the GPV technique was granted in 1981 (US 4272383) for wet-air oxidation of sewage sludge. This process was in operation for 12 years in Apeldoorn (the Netherlands), reducing chemical oxygen demand (COD) by > 70 % and generating up to 10 MW in heat output. Recently, Innovation Concepts B. V. patented the ‘CO 2 Energy Reactor™’ (WO 2011 / 155830 A 1), an application of GPV to mineral carbonation. This is an economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sustainable process that permanently sequesters CO 2; an alternative to underground storage. It utilizes alkaline minerals (virgin or waste-derived), rich in calcium (e. g. wollastonite, steel slags and incineration ashes) or magnesium (e. g. olivine, serpentine, asbestos and mine tailings) as carbon sinks. Besides carbon capture, valuable product streams also emerge: precipitated carbonates, amorphous silica, and enriched metal residues. This solution results in the stabilization or detoxification of hazardous industrial wastes, and in the valorisation of abundant low-value minerals. The GPV technology is also being developed for the oil sands industry. Bituminous sands are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit consisting of a mixture of sand, clay, water, and a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum (the bitumen or “tar”). GPV technology is a sustainable solution to one main problem area: oil sand tailings treatment. Wet-air oxidation permits the conversion of MFT (Mature Fine Tailings) to TTT (Thermally Treaded Tailings), wherein <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> in MFT is used as energy source for the process. The outcome is reduced settling time, metals oxidation, reduced contaminants leaching, and freed water that can be re-used in the separation process. This work reports on the technical aspects of the GPV technology, and on the latest developments, challenges and outlook for its adaptation to the considered applications and adoption by the mainstream industry.

40|$|Asphalt rubber is a {{modified}} binder {{widely used in}} pavement construction. Composition design methods of asphalt rubber blends are exclusively empiric and rely on {{the selection of the}} optimal combination of parameters after a long experimental program. The understanding of the phenomena affecting the asphalt rubber behaviour starts with the proposal of a rational theory and its validation with experimental data. To do so, a set of experiments were carried out including three main factors considered as significant for the rheological behaviour of the final binder. These factors are the bitumen chemical composition, the rubber content and its maximum mesh size. The binder complex shear moduli were measured within the viscoelastic linear domain. The measurements allowed a full characterisation of the rheological behaviour of asphalt rubber for the service temperatures and rates of loading. Base bitumen composition leads to final binders with rheological behaviours that are radically different {{despite the fact that the}} base bitumen belong to the same commercial grade. The rubber content increase showed significant changes on the properties of the binder, especially an increase of its elasticity and a decrease of its temperature sensitivity. The rubber powder maximum mesh size has no significant effect on the rheological properties of the blends within the service conditions. An analysis of physical and chemical changes was carried out on the phases formed after the curing process. A method for the isolation of the phases without affecting their physical and chemical properties was proposed. A centrifuging process was applied to asphalt rubber thanks to the design of an appropriate equipment adapted to the binder features. An experimental protocol was established to obtain a good separation of the phases with a limited aging. The SARA bitumen group analyses were carried out before and after the curing process. They allowed the determination the bitumen fractions kinetics during the blending. Light fractions of bitumen are the main chemical groups that migrate toward the cross-linked rubber network causing its swelling. The rheological behaviour of the separated bitumen phase has proven that the <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> exhibits a lowered thermal sensitivity which is confirmed by the increase of the colloidal instability index. The rubbery phase has showed an extent of swelling varying between 200 and 400 % which modifies considerably the rheological behaviour of the rubber by transferring to it a part of the thermal sensitivity of the bitumen. The influence of the factors was evaluated and their relative importance determined through a statistical model. Micromechanical modelling of the asphalt rubber composite has allowed the validation of observed phenomena that are mainly physical ones. To do this, two main homogenisation procedures were implemented and carried out on the heterogeneous medium: The classical self-consistent approach widely referenced as the equivalent medium approach (EMA) and the generalised self-consistent approach frequently referenced as the equivalent field approach (EFA). A satisfactory modelling of the composite is achieved by taking into account two changes occurring in the phases: their volumetric fractions influenced by the swelling, and their rheological properties due to the diffusion of bitumen into the rubber. An acceptable estimation of the rheological behaviour of the rubbery phase is obtained from the base materials properties with a three-phase self-consistent modelling according to EFA approach. The consideration of an adsorbed fraction of the bitumen on the surface of the rubber particle has allowed a qualitative and a quantitative description of the properties of the rubbery phase. The difficulty of predicting the rheological behaviour of a bitumen from its chemical composition is discussed. Future investigation ways are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Two common {{methods of}} road pavement, {{granular}} material stabilisation used in road construction throughout South Africa today include Cold in Place Recycling (CIPR) and stabilisation with cement or bitumen and an active filler to create Bitumen Stabilised Materials (BSM). As {{part of the}} updating of the South African Pavement Design Method (SAPDM) an experimental section, investigating the structural capacity of cement and lime stabilised and BSM pavement layers, was constructed and will be monitored over a two year period. As part of this study Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements were taken on the various experimental stabilised pavement layers constructed. The FWD deflection data, measured at various time intervals over a 360 day period, forms {{the basis of the}} study presented here. The objective of this thesis was to identify typical back-calculated layer stiffnesses and their variability over time for the various in-situ recycled and stabilised base layers constructed within the experimental section. Stabiliser type, content and layer thicknesses were varied across experimental sub-sections. Trends in back-calculated stiffness of cement stabilised base layers consistently showed significant reductions in layer stiffness subsequent to construction traffic loading. Subsequent to the initial reduction in stiffness little change in stiffness was noted under normal traffic loads. Observations on the trends in back-calculated stabilised layer stiffness per material type over time indicated that seasonal moisture and temperature fluctuations {{have an effect on the}} stiffness of the pavement structure as a whole. BSM materials showed significant variability over time in-line with seasonal variability in the supporting subgrade stiffness in the southbound lane. BSM materials with 1 % cement added in the northbound lane show initial stiffness reductions due to direct rainfall application however a significant increase in layer stiffness occurs up to 360 days after construction. BSMs with 2 % cement in the northbound lane show significant increases in layer stiffness over the 360 day observation period. No significant difference in stiffness trend was observed between BSM emulsion a BSM foam materials. The BSM emulsion with 0. 9 % <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> and 1 % cement was observed to show rapid reduction in stiffness upon opening to traffic and reverting to stiffness values similar to an unbound material of approximately 350 MPa. Cement and lime stabilised materials showed typical post 28 –day average stiffnesses per sub-section ranging between 600 MPa and 1800 MPa. BSM foam with 1 % cement added were observed to have average stiffnesses per sub-section in the range of 400 MPa to 2200 MPa and BSM emulsion with 1 % cement with stiffnesses between 400 MPa to 1700 MPa over the 360 day period. BSMs with 2 % cement added showed stiffness ranges between 900 MPa to 4300 MPa for BSM foam and 900 MPa to 3900 MPa for BSM emulsions over the 360 day period. The spatial variability of back-calculated stiffness per sub-section of a particular stabilisation design was significant and was observed, through the Co-efficient of Variation (COV), to increase over time. The effect of the observed variability when incorporated into a pavement design scenario, requiring a design reliability of 90 %, showed 50 % of the pavement structure would be overdesigned by a factor of 4. With respect to the current philosophies on the development of stiffness over time of cement and lime stabilised and BSM pavement layers some useful observations were made. Cement stabilised materials correlate well with stiffness development theories predicted by previous studies. Theories relating to the stiffness development of BSMs however did not predict the levels of variability in base layer stiffness observed on the experimental section. The continued observation of the experimental section for another year will give greater insight to the stiffness trends of the stabilised materials discussed above...|$|E
40|$|Eco-friendliness, energy {{efficiency}} and cost effectiveness are major drivers responsible for cold recycled asphalt mixtures being considered as alternatives to hot mixtures. Although such mixtures are still regarded in some quarters as second class asphalt, results from field trials on such materials under temperate climates {{have been reported to}} be highly impressive and encouraging. Some developed countries with temperate climates have since developed guidelines for the production and use of cold mixtures in road building. However, evidence from the literature shows that little or nothing has been done to ascertain the performance and suitability of such sustainable materials in developing countries located in hot tropical climates. Ascertaining the performances of such will, among other things enable the formulation of guidelines required for producing and using these alternative sustainable materials and methods in developing countries with hot tropical climates, where available funds for road building are increasingly inadequate to meet demand. The work reported in this thesis attempts to simulate what should be expected in terms of the performance of flexible pavements containing cold mixes of bitumen emulsion stabilized RAP as road base in hot climates. Cold recycling in-plant was deemed appropriate for the obvious reason that it enables control of the quality of mixtures produced. The challenge of sourcing severely aged RAPs required for this study afforded the opportunity of developing a laboratory ageing protocol for producing RAPs with controlled properties, typical of those found in hot tropical belts (with residual binders of very low penetration). The result of the physico-chemical and rheological studies showed that ageing hot mix asphalt at 125 ⁰C does not degrade the binder when compared to that aged at 85 ⁰C, which is the conventional protocol (for temperate climates). A target mix design based on Overseas Road Notes (ORN) 19 and 31 for 20 mm DBM, which the literature suggests is suitable for road base layers of road pavements, yielded an aggregate gradation containing RAP (with <b>residual</b> <b>bitumen</b> of 20 dmm penetration), 5 mm granite dust and granite mineral filler in the proportion 65 : 30 : 5 respectively. Further investigations patterned after Marshall and Hveem mix design methods, indicated that a cationic bitumen emulsion content of 6. 5 % and pre-wetting water content of 1. 5 % were suitable. Unlike hot mixtures, cold mixtures due to their peculiarity i. e. intermediate nature (close to unbound granular materials in early life and close to fully bound materials when fully cured), require curing before being assessed for mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength etc. Performances of the five cold bituminous emulsions mixtures (CBEMs), one with 100 % virgin aggregate, the others including RAP with binder penetrations 5, 10, 15 and 20 dmm, manufactured at 20 ⁰C and 32 ⁰C (to reflect average minimum and maximum temperatures in hot tropical climates) showed that: • Properties of CBEM are dependent on the state of curing or maturation attained i. e. early life, intermediate life and fully cured or stable condition; • High air void content in CBEMs appears to be inevitable; • Mixing and compaction temperature is very important for achieving relatively low air void contents in CBEMs. For example, mixing and compacting CBEMs at 32 ⁰C gave better results than at 20 ⁰C; • Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus is useful for quickly ranking the CBEMs; • The RAP CBEMs performed better than the virgin aggregate CBEM in terms of water susceptibility; • An increase in stiffness modulus up the range from 10 dmmCBEM to 15 dmmCBEM and to 20 dmmCBEM, with higher values than the virgin aggregate CBEM as observed in this work gives the impression that the residual binder in the studied RAPs is active as a result of possible softening or rejuvenation. Alternatively, the stiffness enhancements could possibly have been caused by the alteration of the volumetrics of such RAP CBEMs which consequently enhanced their compactability; • Overall, RAP CBEMs are better than virgin aggregate CBEM in mechanical performance and durability; • Fatigue lives of the CBEMs are generally lower than those for hot mix asphalt (HMA); • The CBEMs are stress-dependent as they all fitted the k-Θ model. The results of the analytical pavement design showed the importance of using tools such as KENLAYER which account for the non linearity of CBEMs. Although the structural design was a hypothetical case, the results confirmed that the virgin aggregate CBEM was inferior in terms of axle loads to failure compared to the RAP CBEMs, and the RAP CBEMs were inferior to HMA. The findings of this limited investigation suggest that the studied RAP CBEMs are suitable for low volume traffic roads, an indication of the great potential of these sustainable materials when properly harnessed. In the light of this, a short and concise set of guidelines for mix design of RAP CBEMs and structural design of pavements containing such non linear materials was proposed in the thesis.
