5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up the dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe had burst. Other fire units used water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but <b>repairable.</b> As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The first F-111C, A8-126 {{selected}} for conversion to the RF-111C variant was modified at General Dynamics plant at Fort Worth, Texas between October 1978 and 18 April 1979. After {{four months of}} test flights, the aircraft returned to Australia in August 1979 where it conducted further tropical weather trials at Darwin. The other three aircraft were modified by the RAAF's No. 3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley in 1980, using kits purchased from General Dynamics. The RF-111C variant proved to be highly successful, and {{was considered to be}} among the best tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the world. Three of the four RF-111Cs remained in RAAF service until 2010. The other aircraft was retired in 2006 after suffering damage from landing on its belly after one of its main wheels separated during take off; although the aircraft was <b>repairable</b> it was judged not worthwhile doing so due to the impending retirement of the entire F-111 fleet. The RAAF does not have an aircraft with the RF-111C's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities since they were retired.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was <b>repairable,</b> but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E

40|$|We study static repair {{priorities}} {{in a system}} consisting of one repair shop and one stockpoint, where spare parts of multiple <b>repairables</b> are kept on stock to serve an installed base of technical systems. Demands for ready-for-use parts occur according to Poisson processes, and are accom-panied by returns of failed parts. The demands are met from stock if possible, and otherwise they are backordered and fulfilled as soon as possible. Returned failed parts are immediately sent into repair. The <b>repairables</b> are assigned to static priority classes. The repair shop is modelled as a single-server queue, where the failed parts are served according to these priority classes. We show that under a given assignment of <b>repairables</b> to priority classes, optimal circulation stock levels follow from Newsboy-type equations. Next, we develop fast and effective heuristics for the assignment of <b>repairables</b> to priority classes. Subsequently, we compare {{the performance of the}} system under these static priorities to the case with a First-Come First-Served (FCFS) service discipline. We show that in many cases static priorities reduce total inventory holding and back-ordering costs by more than 40 %. Finally, we analyse the effect of the number of priority classes. We show that 2 priority classes suffice to obtain 90 % of the maximal savings via static priorities...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. This thesis analyzes a new wholesale level <b>repairables</b> replenishment model proposed for implementation by the U. S. Navy. The new model uses the total investment level as its measure of effectiveness {{with a mean}} supply response time (MSRT) goal as a constraint. In addition, the new model requires that procurement and repair order quantities be specified as input parameters. The importance of the model is that it relates resources to readiness, an area of primary concern to Congress and the Department of Defense. Tests with actual data were conducted between the current Navy <b>repairables</b> model and the new model. The results of these tests indicate that the new model would consistently out-perform the current model for investment levels and system material availability (SMA).

Because of these characteristics, significant economies {{can be achieved by}} repairing these items rather than discarding them when they become unserviceable. Historically, these carcasses have been difficult to manage because, when they broke, maintenance personnel were primarily concerned with replacing them with ready-for-issue units; what happened to the carcass was of little concern. Defense Management Review Decision (DMRD) 901 's objective to reduce supply system costs includes an initiative to achieve savings by retaining retrograde carcasses returned from the fleet at the first turn-in point rather than shipping them immediately to the repair depot or designated storage site. This thesis analyzes the operation of the ATAC Program to determine a 'ship or hold' decision for returned carcasses. A thorough study of ATAC's background, current management controls and operating procedures, and results from previous studies were combined with on-site hub observations to show how and why the ATAC system works. Because of ATAC, the DMRD 901 initiative to retain carcasses at their first turn-in point is not cost effective except for those items experiencing rapid phase-out or numerous upgrades. Detailed indicators to measure and monitor ATAC cost and performance effectiveness need to be implemented. Lieutenant Commander, United States NavyLieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Service parts {{logistics}} {{is concerned}} with providing support through service parts availability to the after-sales service operations of equipment manufacturers. This dissertation studies strategies and methodologies for managing service parts logistics systems. The approach is to combine extensive field study with rigorous modeling analysis. The research was motivated directly by a project with a major US electronic equipment manufacturer to improve the operations of their world-wide service parts logistics system. ^ The {{first part of the}} dissertation presents our preliminary study of the company 2 ̆ 7 s service parts logistics system. We build two simple models (one for consumables and the other for <b>repairables)</b> to approximate the company 2 ̆ 7 s complex system and to show their effectiveness in providing improved policies. Through this phase of study, we draw important insights regarding applications of operational models to real-world systems and abstract research problems. These new problems are then rigorously analyzed in the next two parts of the dissertation. ^ The second part of the dissertation studies a two-echelon system (a single central repair depot and multiple local inventory stocking centers) for <b>repairables</b> with local-center-dependent depot replenishment lead times. We characterize the system by deriving the various exact performance metrics and then analyze system optimization problems. The following two features in the solution structure differentiate our model fundamentally from those in the literature: (1) the random delays at the depot of local center replenishment orders are different from center to center; (2) the lead time variances have a direct effect on system performance. ^ The third part of the dissertation considers a two-echelon system for <b>repairables</b> with two classes of customer service: an emergency class, where a customer demand needs to be satisfied immediately upon its arrival, and a non-emergency class, where a customer demand needs not to be satisfied until a due date. Using both transient and steady state analysis approaches, we derive exact system performance metrics and characterize various properties. We then carry out numerical studies, based on company data, to quantify and to compare system improvement potential over company practice. ...|$|R

A key component of the plan is that inventories be established at the lowest possible levels and be positioned to permit rapid delivery to the customer. In response, the Marine Corps has established a "virtual float" concept that seeks to reduce inventory levels for secondary <b>repairables</b> (SecReps). We show through a simulation model that the Marine Corps should not expect large savings from a virtual float operating with a lateral transfer inventory policy.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the Advanced Traceability and Control System (ATAC). Prior {{to the implementation of}} ATAC, end users of depot level <b>repairables</b> sent retrograde carcasses to various organic and commercial facilities for repair and overhaul. Due to many factors, the depot level carcass tracking system was unable to prevent the loss or delay of many retrograde carcass s through the transportation pipeline. These problems resulted in erroneous charges to the type commander's operating funds, unnecessary investment in inventory levels to meet demand, and a possible lessened fleet readiness due to shortages for critical repair items. The Navy's solution to this problem is ATAC. The ATAC program simplifies the retrograde turn-in process while providing improved traceability and accountability throughout the return pipeline.
