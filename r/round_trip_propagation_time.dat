50|$|It was the {{negative}} {{result of a}} famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson-Morley experiment (and later also the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer {{can be regarded as}} at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with {{the negative}} experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation.|$|E
40|$|In TWR (Through Wall Radar) signal {{processing}} procedure, time delay estimation {{is one of}} the key steps in target localization and high resolution imaging. In time domain imaging procedure such as back projection imaging algorithm, <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> delay at the path of “transmitter-target-receiver” needs to be calculated for each pixel in imaging region. In typical TWR scenario, transmitter and receiver are at one side and targets at the other side of a wall. Based on two-dimensional searching algorithm or solving two variables equation of four times, traditional time delay calculation algorithms are complex and time consuming, and cannot be used to real-time imaging procedure. In this paper, a new fast time-delay (FTD) algorithm is presented. Because of that incident angle at one side equals to refracting angle at the other side, an equation of lateral distance through the wall can be established. By solving this equation, the lateral distance can be obtained and total propagation time delay can be calculated subsequently. Through processing simulation data, the result shows that new algorithm can be applied effectively to real-time time-delay calculation in TWR {{signal processing}}...|$|E
40|$|The {{human heart}} {{contracts}} and relaxes approximately once each second. This {{is a complex}} process where {{different parts of the}} cardiac tissue contract and relax at different times and at different rates. The accurate evaluation of this deformation with ultrasound requires the use of a high frame rate. The frame rate of a conventional ultrasound image is limited by the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> of the sound pulse along each of the scan lines covering the imaged object. A common technique to increase the frame rate is multiple line acquisition, MLA. Using this technique, several scan lines are acquired in parallel for each transmitted pulse. This technique is therefore also called parallel beamforming. Although it increases the frame rate in proportion to the number of parallel beams, this technique also introduces block-like artifacts in the B-mode image. These artifacts severely degrade the image quality, and are especially visible in image sequences (movies). An aim of this thesis is to investigate methods to increase the frame rate using parallel beamforming without introducing such image artifacts. Investigations of the mechanisms of MLA image artifacts have shown that the misalignment of the transmit and receive beams causes distortions to the pulse-echo responses. These distortions result in a shift variant imaging system and image artifacts. This thesis is comprised of four papers that document several metrics that have been developed to evaluate the pulse-echo distortions, image artifacts and shift invariance property. Different methods for artifact reduction have been compared and evaluated. The two methods that have been most thoroughly investigated are steering compensation and the synthetic transmit beam method, STB. In the first method, the receive beams are additionally steered to partially avoid the pulse-echo distortion. Applying this method reduced image artifacts under ideal conditions. However, the performance was heavily reduced in realistic scenarios with aberrations. In the STB method, synthetic transmit beams are created in each receive direction through interpolation. This method performed well both with and without aberrations. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} from the same STB acquisition pattern it is also possible to estimate velocities with an accuracy comparable to that of conventional TDI. This enables higher TDI frame rates or a larger field of view compared to conventional TDI, which requires separate acquisitions for B-mode and tissue Doppler.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling bursts of data in an optical network with an ultra-fast tunable laser and a fixed receiver at each node. In [10] we considered the static scheduling problem of meeting demand in the minimal time. Here we substantially extend these results {{to the case of}} online, dynamic scheduling. Due to the high data rates employed on the optical links, the burst transmissions typically last for very short times compared to the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> between source-destination pairs. A good schedule ensures that (i) there are no transmit/receive conflicts, (ii) throughput is maximized, and (iii) propagation delays are observed. We formulate the scheduling problem as a generalization of the well-known crossbar switch scheduling problem. We show that the algorithms presented in [10] can be implemented in dynamic form to give 100 % throughput. Further, we show that one of the more intuitive solutions does not lead to maximal throughput. In particular, we show advantages of adaptive batch sizes rather than fixed batch sizes for both throughput and performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling bursts of data in an optical network with an ultrafast tunable laser and a fixed receiver at each node. Due to the high data rates employed on the optical links, the burst transmissions typically last for very short times compared with the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>times</b> between source-destination pairs. A good schedule should ensure that 1) there are no transmit/receive conflicts; 2) propagation delays are observed; and 3) throughput is maximized (schedule length is minimized). We formulate the scheduling problem with periodic demand as a generalization of the well-known crossbar switch scheduling. We prove {{that even in the}} presence of propagation delays, there exist a class of computationally viable scheduling algorithms which asymptotically achieve the maximum throughput obtainable without propagation delays. We also show that any schedule can be rearranged to achieve a factor-two approximation of the maximum throughput even without asymptotic limits. However, the delay/throughput performance of these schedules is limited in practice. We consequently propose a scheduling algorithm that exhibits near optimal (on average within U% of optimum) delay/throughput performance in realistic network examples.

40|$|We {{designed}} and constructed {{a pair of}} TEM-horn antennas specifically for the very fast time-domain boresight response. Two physical topologies were made. A printed-board configuration has much slower transient response, which we think is due to pulse-smearing of the antenna currents in the dielectric substrate of the printed wiring boards. The solid state version has a 20 ps transition duration response in the main beam endfire (boresight) direction, which is the fastest we have seen to date. And since the antenna has a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> antenna current <b>propagation</b> <b>time</b> of 6 ns, it offers clean radiated electromagnetic field measurement capability with a clear time of several nanoseconds.

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to study the fundamental limitations of dual bus networks, in terms of full utilization, fairness and bounded access delay.

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, many {{high-speed}} {{congestion control}} (HSCC) algorithms {{have been proposed}} for utilizing network pipes with huge bandwidth-delay product (BDP), {{and some of them}} have also been implemented in popular operating systems. Considering the extremely long <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> delay (RTPD) of satellite network, it is very likely that these algorithms are triggered when TCP flows pass through satellite network. But the existing algorithms are normally evaluated on network pipes with high bandwidth and moderate RTPD (≤ 400 ms). This paper is an attempt to study these algorithms on a simulated satellite network with moderate bandwidth and extremely long RTPD. Their effects on the existing applications, especially World Wide Web (WWW) and the emerging streaming applications, are emphasized. Different queue sizes are also used in simulation with the aim of investigating how to provision satellite link’s queue for well accommodating flows driven by HSCC algorithms. Through this study, we find that Compound-TCP, Cubic-TCP, and H-TCP can not work well on satellite network. Currently, satellite link should use moderate queue size for accommodating flows driven by HSCC algorithms. As for end hosts, when they find that <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> time (RTT) is very long, HS-TCP should be adopted for high throughput while avoiding to hurt the existing applications as little as possible.

40|$|Abstract [...] Two {{concepts}} {{for reducing}} the latency in the Internet are designed, implemented, and tested. First, a distributed-server mechanism, CBD (Component-Based Download) for downloading large files. Second, a new application protocol, FSTP (File Segment Transfer Protocol). These two concepts are then combined to create a distributed version of FSTP: CBD-FSTP. In CBD, the file to be downloaded is split into components and each is put on a different server. The components get downloaded through parallel connections between the user and the servers maintaining them. Upon the completion of download, the components get appended {{to each other and}} reconstitute the original file. The effectiveness of CBD is tested through running extensive experimental measurements. FSTP is a new file transfer protocol designed for moving large-size files over the Internet. FSTP uses UDP packets to send data compared to FTP, which uses TCP. The key advantage to this protocol is that <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>propagation</b> delay is no longer a limiting factor in data transferring. The operation of FSTP is explained, and its performance is tested using a prototype written in JAVA. CBD-FSTP incorporates the CBD approach into FSTP. It is a modified version of FSTP. In general either method by itself improves network latency as perceived by the user. As anticipated when combined even greater reduction in latency can be achieved. Typical improvements are routinely on the order of 300 % to 500 %. More importantly, these techniques can be easily implemented on a large scale. ...|$|R
