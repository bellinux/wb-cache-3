5|$|Historically, the Lenni Lenape people {{inhabited}} {{the area in}} the vicinity of Darby Creek. By the 17th century, the Dutch and Swedish had arrived in the area, followed some years later by the English. Numerous mills of various types were eventually build along the creek and several railroads traversed the watershed. In modern times, grants by various organizations have been awarded to improve the creek and its watershed. The Darby Creek Valley Association operates within the watershed. Part of the creek's length is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, part is a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Various species of fish, including <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish,</b> eels, and trout, inhabit it. Several areas {{in the vicinity of the}} creek are listed on the Delaware County Natural Areas Inventory. These include the Darby Creek Mouth Mudflat, the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, and the Ithan-Darby Creek Wetlands. A reach of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
50|$|Several {{sections}} of the river have been designated by South Carolina as wild and scenic rivers, and thus have some protection from development. The river is a favorite for canoeing, but Hurricane Hugo in 1989 felled many trees, blocking the flow at places, making navigation difficult at low water and dangerous at high water. River enthusiasts have been gradually cleaning up the storm debris. The river is also a popular fishing spot, with <b>sunfish,</b> <b>redbreast,</b> catfish and bass.|$|R
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E

50|$|The species prefers vegetated {{and rocky}} pools and lake margins for its habitat. Its diet can include insects, snails, {{and other small}} invertebrates. A panfish popular with anglers, the <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> is also kept as an {{aquarium}} fish by hobbyists. <b>Redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> are usually caught with live bait such as nightcrawlers, crickets, grasshoppers, waxworms, or mealworms. They can also be caught using small lures or flies. Most anglers use light spinning tackle to catch <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish.</b> It is popular with fly anglers in the winter because it will more readily strike a moving fly than will bluegills in cooler water.|$|E
50|$|The <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> (Lepomis auritus) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the sunfish family (family Centrarchidae) of order Perciformes.

50|$|<b>Redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> mainly consume {{immature}} aquatic insects. Mayflies, small fish, and dragonfly larvae {{consist of}} the majority of the sunfish’s diet based on stomach content. Being an opportunistic feeder, the fish competes with other sunfish and larger predatory fish that prey on the same food they do. Larger piscivorous fish are the main predators of smaller <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish.</b> Micropterus species are a major threat to sunfish because of the shared habitat and the large availability of the sunfish. The sunfish prefers structure around banks and overhanging branches that provide shade to provide food and protection. Lepomis auritus survives best in water with current and a pH between 7.0 and 7.5. Lack of current or too acidic or basic water can dramatically affect the sunfish’s survival rate. Human influence on abiotic and biotic factors such as sunlight and predator numbers can have a major influence on sunfish. Factors such as clearing debris bank cover can increase amount of sunlight into the water and increase water temperature and decrease defense habitats, also decreasing the number of predators by eating larger predatory fish will increase the survival rate of the <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fish species {{present in}} the lake are walleye, smallmouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish,</b> bluegill, {{northern}} pike, tiger muskie, largemouth bass, carp, pumpkinseed sunfish, and brown bullhead.

50|$|Since 2005, the Shenandoah River has {{experienced}} several springtime fish kills that have affected {{several of its}} native fish species. In 2005, <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> and smallmouth bass along a 100 mi stretch of the South Fork Shenandoah River began dying of lesions caused by bacteria and fungi. Although the fish kill eventually wiped out 80% of the adult <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> and smallmouth bass, juvenile populations appeared to be unaffected. The following year more-localized fish kills in Clarke County spread {{to two of the}} Shenandoah's three species of sucker: the shorthead redhorse and the northern hogsucker - the former suffering from similar lesions witnessed in the previous year's fish kill. Virginia's Department of Environmental Quality received reports of fish kills near Elkton and between Bentonville and Front Royal in late April 2007 and observed fish exhibiting lesions and strange behavior.|$|E
50|$|The Lumber River has 24 boat {{launches}} {{that serve}} as access points to Lumber River State Park. The {{entire length of the}} river is open to fishing.

50|$|Wildlife {{found on}} the {{property}} include a number of game animals, such as deer, bear, turkey, and squirrels; waterfowl are also abundant within the area's wetlands. Other game bird species, such as bobwhite quail and woodcock, are also found at the property and benefit from management that periodically clears portions of the landscape of mature vegetation. Fish found within the river include bluegill, <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish,</b> and largemouth bass; ponds on the property contain crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, chain pickerel, and {{a limited number of}} bowfin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} easily {{accessible}} lakes: Eagle Lake, Jackson Lake and Whitford-Lawler Lake. The Kalamazoo River also {{runs along the}} western of the park. Several types of panfish found within the area including bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> (Lepomis auritus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). There are a few species that are sought after as sport fish such as the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). There are also abundant common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Eagle Lake and the Kalamazoo River. During the winter ice fishers can often be seen on all three lakes.|$|E
5000|$|The dark, tannin stained {{waters of}} the Blackwater River host runs of striped bass, river herring (alewives and blueback), American and hickory shad in the spring. Angling for <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> ("red throats" [...] or [...] "red robins") is also quite good in the spring. The river also hosts largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, flier, and chain {{pickerel}} populations. Bowfin and gar are common in the lower main stem. Angling for bowfin provides {{a great opportunity to}} catch many hard-fighting fish in a short amount of time. The possibility also exists to land a trophy bowfin over ten pounds.|$|E
50|$|The spotted sunfish {{has been}} shown to have {{potential}} as an indicator species. Spotted sunfish select habitats with high complexity and depth. They are frequently found in areas with woody debris that offer shelter from velocity and provides cover. Small decreases (0.30m) in river stage below base flow conditions resulted in 20-70% declines in a study by Dutterer and Allen. Though the spotted sunfish itself is not threatened, managing for this fish benefits the entire aquatic community. Similar centrarchids are preferred by anglers; the spotted sunfish must be closely watched to ensure that habitat is not modified for bluegill or <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{at the expense of the}} spotted sunfish.|$|E
5000|$|The Ocmulgee River {{is popular}} with anglers for its {{excellent}} fishing, particularly for <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish,</b> bluegill, redear sunfish, largemouth bass, black crappie, channel catfish, and flathead catfish. The world record for largest recorded catch of a largemouth bass was achieved in 1932 in Montgomery Lake, an oxbow lake off the Ocmulgee River in Telfair County. The record-setting fish, caught by farmer George Washington Perry, weighted 22 pounds, six ounces. [...] The International Game Fish Association officially declared {{the world record}} for largemouth bass tied in 2010, following Manabu Kurita's catch (in July 2009) of a 22-pound, four-ounce largemouth bass in Lake Biwa in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Nequasset Lake {{is home to}} {{the fish}} of a typical warm-water lake. These include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, white perch, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish,</b> hornpout, eel, and a variety of baitfish. Anglers report largemouth bass in the range of 2-4 pounds range with the {{occasional}} 5-pound or bigger fish. Bass fishing is most productive in Nequasset Lake from late spring to early fall, with peak fishing in midsummer. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife annually stocks the lake with brown trout to provide winter anglers with cold-water gamefish during the ice-fishing season. Because of low oxygen levels at the lake's deepest points and high temperatures in shallow water, it is unlikely that any trout hold over into the summer months. Trout can however be caught in the first weeks after iceout.|$|E
50|$|There are 24 boat {{launches}} {{along the}} Lumber River {{that serve as}} access points to Lumber River State Park. The {{entire length of the}} river is open to fishing.

50|$|The species native {{range is}} {{condensed}} to eastern North America, in Canada and {{south to the}} rivers emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. The species has been introduced as far west as Texas. This fish primarily feeds on small insect larva, small crayfish, and sometimes small fish. Lepomis auritus thrives in streams and rivers with shelter and structure, usually around banks with the water pH around 7.0-7.5. The <b>redbreast</b> <b>sunfish</b> is a spring spawner in sand-gravel substrate depending on location, or when water temperatures reach 16-26 °C. Average clutch size for the sunfish is around 2000 depending on {{the age of the}} female. The average length of the sunfish is around 11 cm with a record 30.5 cm. The record weight for the fish is 1.75 pounds. Rarely are limits set on the number of fish that can be harvested due to their large numbers and high reproductive capabilities. If a particular area is subject to overfishing or habitat destruction, managements plans should be put into effect to preserve the population.|$|E
