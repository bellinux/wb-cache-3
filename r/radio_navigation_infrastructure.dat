40|$|This diploma thesis {{concerns}} with creating of study {{which deals with}} the optimization of the ground network infrastructure of radio navigation aids for RNAV in FIR Praha. The thesis contains an analysis of concept of development of Czech navigation environment and introduces DEMETER software, in which the optimization analyses are realized. The thesis describes DME/DME navigation system {{from the perspective of}} individual components and parameters. The actual study deals with an optimization of the ground network infrastructure of the radio navigation aids and includes the definition of network performance requirements, creation of general methodology of optimization of navigation performance analysis and a procedure of choosing a suitable placement of radio navigation aid. The integral parts of the study are analyses of current state of navigation performance and analyses of possible improvement of <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|E
