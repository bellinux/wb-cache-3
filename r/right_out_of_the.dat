International routes out of Scandinavia had since the 1940s been the domain of Scandinavian Airlines System, but in 1990 the Danish authorities granted domestic carrier Maersk Air the right to start a Gatwick service out of Copenhagen. Transwede used this as leverage to secure itself a similar <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedish capital. Transwede started the service eight times per week, using a single-class MD-83, offering prices 32 percent below SAS and British Airways.|$|E

The boy (a highly troubled youth himself) disaffected by his parents' divorce, lives {{with his mother and}} grandparents while the father lives nearby. The escaped convict commits murder to save the boy from harm but gets involved with the mother. By the time the boy is to have his first communion, the mother—trapped in a humdrum existence—has fallen in love with the convict and wants to run away with him.|$|E

25|$|The Drillers {{came out}} of the gate smoking, {{rattling}} off five straight wins <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate. As a team that had always prided itself on playing defense first, now had also developed a potent offense rolling three full lines. Particularly of notice in this newfound offensive stroke was the play of Nikola Vignjevic. A phenomenally gifted player, his performance in the first season (with the Drillers) was often hit and miss, but come his second season his play was inspired and gave the Drillers the playmaker they long needed up front. Another player that drastically stepped up his game for the 99/00 season was Vignjevic's line mate Rick Titus, always a tenacious defender, he too became a force in the offensive end to the surprise of many.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the game}} at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium {{with the passing of}} North Carolina's legendary coach Dean Smith a couple of days before, both Duke and UNC coaches, players and staff all {{gathered}} at center court and held a moment of silence for Smith. Once the game started Duke jumped <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate with an 18-6 lead early in the game thanks to hot shooting. UNC would respond by outscoring Duke 30-22 over the next several minutes of the 1st half to cut Duke's lead down to 40-36 with around 4 minutes left in the 1st half. Duke then went on a 9-0 run over the next 2 minutes to get their largest lead of {{the game at}} 49-36 with 2 minutes left in the half. UNC would score the last 6 points of the half to cut Duke's lead down to 49-42 at halftime. In the 2nd half almost everything went UNC's way as UNC started dominating the post and eventually built their largest lead of the game 77-67 over Duke with 4 minutes left in regulation to complete a 41-18 run over Duke in an 18-minute span. With Duke still trailing UNC 79-72 with around 2 1/2 minutes left in regulation Duke's Tyus Jones would help Duke finish regulation on a 9-2 run over UNC to tie the game at 81 points apiece to send it to overtime. In overtime, the game was filled with missed free throws, missed shots, fouls, turnovers, lead changes and ties with Duke eventually winning the game 92-90.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

More than 15,000 people attended Fitzgeralds christening and launch ceremony on June 7, 1958. But the event was plagued by misfortunes: When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the ship by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks.

Grossman threw one touchdown and interception, and also scored a one-yard rushing touchdown, en route to a 21–14 loss. [...] Grossman received his final snaps of the season in the following week, when he was called to relieve Orton in a 37–3 loss to the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
