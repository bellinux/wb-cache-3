5|$|Haulālai is a known {{source for}} xenoliths, <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Earth's mantle {{that have been}} brought up in lava flows. Many prehistoric deposits, {{as well as those}} from the 1801 event, contain xenoliths of large size and {{abundant}} quantity.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks was {{the first}} release of its kind, {{followed}} {{by a number of}} similar compilations like Cambodian Cassette Archives and other unrelated titles by the same or similar names, inspired by the original or exploiting its weak standing with regard to intellectual property. It also gave rise, in part, to a broader trend of Western interest in obscure psychedelic and progressive <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of the world.|$|E

5|$|Drainage of the Widnes area is {{into the}} Mersey via Ditton, Steward's and Bower's Brooks. The bedrock {{of the area}} is <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sherwood {{sandstone}} group. There are a few outcrops of sandstone but elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. Most of this consists of till except near {{the bank of the}} Mersey where it is recent alluvium.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has shown}} igneous <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) intrudes into the {{surrounding}} metamorphic schists; the intrusions {{take the form of}} a series of concentric ring dikes. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of andesite and basaltic lavas.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Grainger was the {{engineer}} for {{the line and}} James Bray the contractor. Two sighting towers were erected and 20 shafts sunk along the tunnel's line. Men excavated <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shaft faces until the shafts were connected and the tunnel was completed in 1848. Thousands of navvies lived locally in temporary bothies with their families, and worked in dangerous and wet conditions to facilitate the grand opening in 1849.|$|E

5|$|At SuperBrawl VII on February 23, 1997, the Faces of Fear {{competed in}} a Three Way match. They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco <b>Rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Public Enemy pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had the Faces of Fear compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory. The Faces of Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E
5|$|Diffie {{released}} seven studio albums, a Christmas {{album and}} a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through Monument Records, Broken Bow Records, and Rounder Records. Among his albums, 1993's Honky Tonk Attitude and 1994's Third <b>Rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun are certified certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America; while 1992's Regular Joe and 1995's Life's So Funny are both certified gold. His most recent album, , {{was released in}} late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a neotraditionalist country influence {{with a mix of}} novelty songs and ballads.|$|E
5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|The Runcorn area drains {{into the}} River Mersey {{to the north}} and the River Weaver to the south. The bedrock of the western and northeastern parts of the town is made up of <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sherwood {{sandstone}} group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia mudstone group. In places there are prominent outcrops of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill. Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. At the northwestern periphery of the town the drift consists of recently blown sand. Farther to the east and bordering the River Mersey is recent alluvium. Elsewhere the drift consists of till.|$|E
5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay {{is similar to}} GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of <b>rock,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and {{was considered one of}} the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.|$|E
5|$|When the Jesuits left Maribojoc in 1768, the Augustinian Recollects {{administered}} to the spiritual needs of the town until 1898. Father Julian de Santa Ana, from the Recollects, served as the second parish priest. In 1794 and 1880, the towns of Cortes and Antequera established their own parish, separate from Maribojoc. The first church was constructed in a muddy area of the town proper from 1798 and was finished after 18 years under forced labor (polos y servicios) in 1816. To build the church, parishioners were instructed to bring not less than 4 pounds of <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea every time they attended.|$|E
5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using <b>rock</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
