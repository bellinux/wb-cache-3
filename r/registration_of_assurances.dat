40|$|In {{this article}} we explore how {{multinational}} corporations (MNCs) adopt assurance practices to develop and sustain organizational accountability for sustainability. Using a panel of Fortune Global 250 firms {{over a period of}} 10 years, we document the diffusion patterns <b>of</b> third-party <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> sustainability reports. We specifically investigate how evolving auditing practices, namely diversity <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> standards and type <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> providers, shape the quality <b>of</b> sustainability <b>assurance</b> statements. The results illustrate great variability in the adoption <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> practices in the formative stages of this novel market. Our descriptive analysis indicates the relevance of external institutional pressures as well as internal resources and capabilities as underlying factors driving the adoption <b>of</b> <b>assurance.</b> Our evidence also suggests that several MNCs project a decoupled or symbolic image <b>of</b> accountability through <b>assurance,</b> thereby undermining the credibility of these verification practices. The paper contributes to the emerging literature on international accountability standards and emphasizes the need to enhance theory-based, cross-disciplinary knowledge related to auditing and accountability processes for sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Number of {{companies}} adopting sustainability report assurance is increasing rapidly. Prior researches have explored factors that might drive companies to voluntary adopt assurance on their sustainability reports. But, few researches {{focus on the}} quality <b>of</b> sustainability report <b>assurance</b> statements provided. The first objective {{of this research is}} to investigate how the quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> statement differs among different assurance providers. The second objective of the research is to explore whether quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> statement is jointly affected by national legal environment where company is located and the company’s choice <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> provider. Population <b>of</b> this Research is Fortune Global 500 Companies 2014 list. Final sample of this research is 135 companies.

Multivariate regression analysis is used to test whether quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> statement is jointly affected by national legal environment and assurance provider.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) assurance and firm value. This study contributes {{to the understanding of}} the economic benefits inherent in CSR assurance by investigating the incremental value added to firms by assurance. This study also explores CSR assurance quality in both Australia and New Zealand, two countries that are rarely examined. The research adopts a signalling theory view <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance,</b> where assurance acts as a signal of disclosure quality. The quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> statements has been examined using a content analysis approach. Content analysis generates quality scores that enable quantitative analysis of the effects <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance</b> quality on firm value. The results show that CSR assurance is value-relevant, but assurance quality is not. Results remained true even after controlling for CSR performance, country and industry effects. The current study also finds that CSR assurance quality is lower when produced by an accountant, and that better governance mechanisms increase assurance statement quality. In addition to the CSR assurance quality score, scholars associate several other attributes with assurance quality. These attributes include the level <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> and the type <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> provider. The level <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> and the type <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> provider constitute signals about CSR assurance quality. These attributes are also examined to determine their effect on firm value. The results do not show any significant effect <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance</b> quality on firm value, either from the overall assurance quality score or from the attributes of quality. This research has implications for companies, standard setters and assurance providers. Companies may benefit from adopting CSR assurance. Since the quality <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> does not communicate any effective signal, it may be important for companies, standard setters and assurance providers to collaborate to improve assurance standards to achieve higher quality, in order to minimise the possibility of falsified signalling through substandard reporting and poor assurance quality. There are many opportunities for future research on the economic benefits <b>of</b> CSR <b>assurance.</b> Future research should look into conducting a longitudinal study on CSR assurance quality. Future research should also examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>assurance</b> and its quality on firm value at different points of time and with various types of CSR disclosure...|$|R
