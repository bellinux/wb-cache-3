5|$|The Simpsons try to {{hold the}} poachers but {{eventually}} they break into the sanctuary. The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists, who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a chimp slave master, exploiting their labor at a nearby diamond mine. Worried that the Simpsons will report her to the authorities, Dr. Bushwell offers everyone diamonds as a bribe - which all the Simpsons except Lisa happily accept. On the plane <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to Springfield, it is revealed that their former tour guide, Kitenge, is {{now president of the}} country, with the former president now the Simpsons' flight attendant.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to the Emerald City.|$|E

5|$|In 1452, Turkish cavalry {{forces had}} begun raiding Albanian territories in the East, a common Ottoman tactic to weaken an enemy before {{beginning}} a full-scale invasion. On 23 April, Raimon d'Ortafà, Alfonso's governor in Albania, {{feared that the}} Turkish invasion would force many of the Albanians to turn to Islam and sent letters to Alfonso for aid. Mehmed, believing that the misunderstandings between the Albanian leaders was at its most critical point, ordered a force of 25,000-27,000 inexperienced men. His reasoning was that these could weaken Albanian forces enough {{so that he could}} then launch a concerted invasion. The force was under the main command of Tahip Pasha. Tahip would split his forces into two parts, one under his command, and the other under his subordinate, Hamza Pasha. Mehmed had been tied up in war in the East so he let Hamza <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to the West.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

25|$|In late September 2003, the SkyPier {{high-speed}} ferry terminal opened. Passengers {{arriving at}} the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to the PRD. Passengers travelling both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports – Shekou, Shenzhen, Macau and Humen (Dongguan) – were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen's Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan's Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Passengers travelling from Shekou and Macau can complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and {{go straight to the}} boarding gate for the flight at HKIA.|$|E

Chipman's Panthers enjoyed similar success the following season, defeating archrival West Virginia for their last Eastern Eight Tournament Championship, energized by remarks by WVU Coach Gale Catlett. Pitt lost to Pepperdine {{in the first round of}} the 1982 NCAA Tournament to end Chipman's second season and Pitt's last as a member of the Eastern Eight Conference.|$|E

25|$|To {{cut off the}} Sikhs {{from the}} main source of their inspiration, the Harimandir at Amritsar was taken {{possession}} of and guarded by Mughal troops to prevent them visiting it. Sikhs were then living in exile in the Shiwalik hills, the Lakhi Jungle and in the sandy desert of Rajputana. To assert their right to ablution in the holy tank in Amritsar, they would occasionally send riders, who, in disguise or openly cutting their way through armed guards, would reach the temple, take a dip in the tank and <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> with lightning speed. Zakarya Khan, sent a strong force under Samad Khab to seek out the Sikhs. The force was defeated and their leader, Samad Khan who had been the target of the Sikhs' wrath since he had on June 24, 1734 executed Bhai Mani Singh was killed.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1928, Disney {{lost control}} of the Oswald {{character}}, and much of his staff was hired away; Disney left Universal soon afterwards. He promised never to work with a character he did not own ever again. Disney asked Iwerks, who stayed on, to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of frogs, dogs, and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were created at this time by Iwerks, but were also rejected. They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. Ub Iwerks eventually got inspiration from an old drawing. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. Then, on a train <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> from a failed business meeting, Walt Disney came up with the original sketch for the character that would eventually be called Mickey Mouse. Afterwards, Disney took the sketch to Iwerks. In turn, he drew a more clean cut and refined version of Mickey, but one that still followed the original sketch.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, {{the wreck}} of a ship was found in Red Bay. She is {{believed}} to be the Spanish Basque galleon San Juan, a three-masted, 27.1m (90ft) long, 250–300-ton vessel that was lost in 1565. San Juan, carrying a cargo of nearly 1,000 barrels of whale oil, was wrecked by an autumn storm. She grounded stern first on the northern side of Saddle Island, struck the bottom several times and split her keel open before sinking 30 yards from shore. Her captain, Joanes de Portu, and crew were able to save the sails, rigging, some provisions, and about half the whale oil. The crew took to the boats and hailed another ship for a <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to Spain. The following year de Portu salvaged more of the wreck before she finally sank out of sight. Three more wrecks have been found in Red Bay, the last in 2004. The charred hull fragments of the second ship, found in 1983, strongly suggest the ship sank because of a fire.|$|E
500|$|Cost {{estimates}} {{indicated that}} the script, as originally written, would be $300,000 over budget (about two-and-a-half times what the studio would have permitted) {{and a number of}} scenes were cut. [...] An extensive opening segment which would have depicted the destruction of Earth was changed to the filmed segment in which Tyrol sees a flash of light and his shadow is left on a wall. However, Nankin restored the scene in which Helo, Dualla, Adama and Roslin <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to Galactica in the Raptor.|$|E
500|$|Astana {{moved to}} the head of the main peloton after the second climb of the day. Although Dumoulin was still in the group, he had lost most of his teammates. Astana then {{attacked}} with [...] remaining on the third climb: Mikel Landa attacked first; Aru followed him and was joined by Quintana and Rafał Majka. Dumoulin was dropped but was then able to <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to the group. By this point the group contained just eight riders: Landa, Aru, Quintana, Majka, Dumoulin, Rodríguez, Chaves and Mikel Nieve (Sky). Towards the summit, Dumoulin and Nieve were dropped. Dumoulin attempted to <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to the group on the descent and flat; Aru, however, had three teammates in the group (Luis León Sánchez and Andrey Zeits had dropped back from the early breakaway) and they were able to defend their lead. On the final climb, Quintana and Majka attacked and gained over a minute's lead ahead of the rest of the group; they were assisted by Andrey Amador, Quintana's teammate, who had also been in the breakaway. Rodríguez rode hard at the front of the group to defend his overall position. Quintana and Majka finished around 50" [...] ahead of Rodríguez, Aru and Chaves. Dumoulin finished nearly four minutes further back. Aru therefore moved into the race lead, with Rodríguez in second and Majka third. Dumoulin dropped to sixth place.|$|E

In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar <b>ride</b> <b>back</b> to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E
