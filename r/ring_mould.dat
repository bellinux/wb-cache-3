40|$|Hydration and {{restrained}} {{shrinkage crack}} behaviours of different concrete grades were independently monitored using a non-contact electrical resistivity apparatus and a novel plastic <b>ring</b> <b>mould</b> respectively. The electrical resistivity curve trend is similar {{for all the}} concrete samples, in which the lowest concrete grade has the highest resistivity until reaching acceleration point which was then overtaken by the highest concrete grade. Four different hydration periods were identified upon which the hydration process can be based; these periods are classified into dissolution, induction, acceleration and deceleration periods. Also, initial and final setting times for the samples were examined, which confirmed that the decreasing rate of resistivity development for the lower concrete grade corresponds to its initial setting time range. Restrained shrinkage crack result shows that the highest concrete grade propagated cracks earlier than the lowest concrete grade and thereby the higher cracking potential of higher strength mixture was confirmed. Linear fitting was then developed to estimate concrete crack potential based on its electrical resistivity. Hence, both electrical resistivity measurement and novel plastic mould (which is very cheap, user-friendly and fast filled) are hereby proposed as a convenient alternative means of assessing concrete cracking potential...|$|E

The room temperature influences water temperature for mixing alginate impression materials. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the functional relationship of room temperature and initial setting time of alginate impression materials. Methods: The New Kromopan® alginate (normal and fast sets) were used. The initial setting time were tested at 23 (control), 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 degrees Celcius room temperatures (n = 5). The initial setting time was tested based on ANSI/ADA Specification no. 18 (ISO 1563). The alginate powder was mixed with distilled water (23 / 50 ratio), put in the metal <b>ring</b> <b>mould,</b> and the initial setting time was measured by test rod. Data were statistically analyzed by linear regression (α = 0. 05). result: The initial setting times were 149. 60 ± 0. 55 (control) and 96. 40 ± 0. 89 (31 ° C) seconds for normal set, and 122. 00 ± 1. 00 (control) and 69. 60 ± 0. 55 (31 ° C) seconds for fast set. The coefficient of determination of room temperature to initial setting time of alginate were R 2 = 0. 74 (normal set) and R 2 = 0. 88 (fast set). The regression equation for normal set was Y = 257. 6 – 5. 5 X (p < 0. 01) and fast set was Y = 237. 7 – 5. 6 X (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The room temperature gave high contribution and became a strength predictor for initial setting time of alginates.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective of this research project was {{to carry out the}} investigation of the relationship between processing conditions, micromorphology and mechanical properties of isotactic polypropylene homopolymer using conventional and shear controlled orientation injection moulding (SCORIM) techniques by systematically changing carefully controlled processing conditions, mould geometry and compound additives. Both SCORIM and conventional techniques were employed for iPP injection moulding using three moulds of different shapes by varying the processing conditions, including nozzle temperature, mould temperature, injection speed, hold pressure and oscillating patterns of pistons. The results obtained were compared so as to indicate the differences in microstructure and physical properties resulting from the two moulding techniques. A range of analytical methods were employed. Optical transmitted light microscopy was used to reveal the skin-core morphology and preferentially oriented fibrous textures. Transmitted Electron Microscopy represented the enlargement of the fibrous alignment. Micro hardness analysed the hardness and isotropy characteristics by measuring the diagonal lengths of the indentations. Mechanical testing determined Young's modulus, the strength and toughness of the mouldings. X-ray diffraction exhibited the distribution of the cc, 6 and 7 crystalline phases of the iPP mouldings. The WAXS Debye patterns confirmed the existence of the preferred orientation through the thickness of the moulding. Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysed the thermal behaviour from the endothermal and exothermal curves. In the initial stage of the study, the polypropylene was moulded {{in the form of a}} standard tensile bar on a conventional Sandretto injection machine in order to obtain the basic characteristics of the polypropylene study material, which could then be used to compare with those properties to be gained using the SCORIM technique. A <b>ring</b> <b>mould</b> was then used in a Negri Bossi twin injection machine to investigate improvements in uniformity of micromorphology and dimensional reproducibility of mouldings made possible by four live-feed injection moulding. Later, a study was carried out on injection moulding of polypropylene by varying processing conditions, including three hold pressures, two mould temperatures and two nozzle temperatures for both conventional and SCORIM injection processes by using a rectangular bar mould in a Demag injection moulding machine. In the finial stage, the study explores the influences of composition, in essence a limited range of nucleating agents, and processing methods, and aspects of the micromorphology, dimensional control and the mechanical properties of polypropylene. Polypropylene, as a sernicrystalline polymer, represents a class of materials in which mechanical properties are strongly influenced by processing conditions and micromorphology.

Key words: Polishing, surface roughness, microhybrid composite, nanocomposite, Sof-Lex XT, Spiral Wheels, Enhance, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Zircon-Brite, Dura-White stones, Mylar strips Methods: The composites {{used in this}} study were Filtek Supreme XTE (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) and Z 100 (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA). Thirty-five composite samples were made from each of the two composites. Uncured composite was placed into an aluminium <b>ring</b> <b>mould,</b> 10 mm X 2 mm. Both the upper and lower surfaces of the composite were covered with Mylar strips and glass plates, before the specimens were cured for 40 seconds from both sides. Samples were randomly divided into seven groups. The groups were: 1. Mylar polyester strip (control) 2. Sof-Lex XT finishing and polishing discs (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 3. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels (3 M ESPE, St Paul, USA) 4. Dura-White stones (Shofu Inc, Kyoto, Japan) 5. Intensiv UniglossCellbrush (Intensiv SA, Montagnola, Switzerland) 6. Enhance finishing and polishing system (Dentsply, Milford, USA) 7. Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels combined with Zircon-Brite (Dental Ventures of America, Corona, USA) The polishing of the specimens was performed by a single operator according to manufacturer s instructions. The mean surface roughness of each specimen was determined using a profilometer (Surftest SJ 210, Mitutoyo, Tokyo, Japan). Three readings were collected from each specimen. Data was statistically analysed using ANOVA. Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL JSM- 5800 LV, Tokyo, Japan) photos were taken of the representative samples. Results: Statistically significant differences in surface roughness were observed between the following groups: Z 100 and Filtek Supreme XTE with the polishing systems combined (p= 0. 005); Control group vs all the polishing systems; Sof-Lex XT finishing and polishing discs vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels vs Dura-White stones, Intensiv Unigloss Cellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system (p < 0. 0001); Dura-White stones vs Intensiv UniglossCellbrush, Enhance finishing and polishing system, Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001); Intensiv UniglossCellbrush vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p< 0. 0001); Enhance finishing and polishing system vs. Spiral Wheels/Zircon-Brite (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Filtek Supreme XTE displayed significantly better polishability and lower surface roughness values after polishing than Z 100. The composite samples cured against the Mylar polyester strip produced significantly smoother surface roughness values than all the polishing systems tested in this study. The following polishing systems led to the smoothest surfaces after polishing: Sof-lex Spiral Wheels in combination with Zircon-Brite, as well as the Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels and Sof-Lex finishing and polishing discs. These systems were significantly smoother than the Enhance system used in combination with Prisma Gloss polishing paste, and also the one-step polishing system Intensiv UniglossCellbrush. There was no statistically significant difference between Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels in combination with Zircon-Brite, the Sof-Lex Spiral Wheels and the Sof-Lex finishing and polishing discs.

500|$|As a {{gemstone}} used in jewelry, {{silicon carbide}} is called [...] "synthetic moissanite" [...] or just [...] "moissanite" [...] after the mineral name. Moissanite {{is similar to}} diamond in several important respects: it is transparent and hard (9–9.5 on the Mohs scale, compared to 10 for diamond), with a refractive index between 2.65 and 2.69 (compared to 2.42 for diamond). Moissanite is somewhat harder than common cubic zirconia. Unlike diamond, moissanite can be strongly birefringent. For this reason, moissanite jewels are cut along the optic axis of the crystal to minimize birefringent effects. It is lighter (density 3.21 g/cm3 vs. 3.53 g/cm3), and much more resistant to heat than diamond. This results in a stone of higher luster, sharper facets and good resilience. Loose moissanite stones may be placed directly into wax <b>ring</b> <b>moulds</b> for lost-wax casting, as can diamond, as moissanite remains undamaged by temperatures up to 1800°C. Moissanite has become popular as a diamond substitute, and may be misidentified as diamond, since its thermal conductivity is closer to diamond than any other substitute. Many thermal diamond-testing devices cannot distinguish moissanite from diamond, but the gem is distinct in its birefringence and a very slight green or yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some moissanite stones also have curved, string-like inclusions, which diamonds never have.|$|R

40|$|Piston’s {{rings are}} one of the most {{critical}} parts of heavy-duty engines for wear-work in conditions of prolonged exposure of alternating loads and high temperatures. Currently in the world production of billets for piston’s rings is dominated by the two methods of casting: production of individual and oiling billets of gray and ductile cast iron in green-sand mold and shell mold and centrifugal casting method (intended primarily for oiling billets of ductile iron); the technology for individual production billets for piston’s rings with a diameter up to 250 mm, from 250 to 450 mm with individual and oiling ways, over 450 mm - preference of oiling billet. The best parameters of physical-mechanical and operational characteristics piston’s rings are in the case of manufacture of billets to the maximum extent approaching the configuration to the finished product. The rings made of shaped billets are characterized by uniform distribution of properties from the perimeter, provide a given diagram of pressures and full fit to the cylinder. Because of deficiencies of traditional methods of casting, continuous quality requirements for billets, the need for economy of material, fuel and energy resources, are finding new progressive technological processes of production of high-quality billets for piston’s rings. One of the most promising for piston rings billet is a method of casting consists of immersing the sand molds into the melt. It is interesting idea, expressed by A. Sutherland and subsequently patented in several countries in the way of casting method, called "immersion pouring technology" (ICT-Immersion Casting Technique) [1]. Experiments, conducted in the laboratory of the Belarusian National Technical University, have identified significant shortcomings of immersion method of casting. When forms are immersing, have an intensive gassing in molten metal, and freezing of the metal on the out surface of the form. But despite some shortcomings, the proposed process is characterized by a significant reduction of laboriousness, improved working conditions, a significant decreasing of molding materials, decreasing of production areas, complete except flasks and ladles. In the Belarusian National Technical University was developed an improved method of casting immersion [2], schematic diagram of the process was shown in Figure 1. Thin <b>ring</b> single <b>mould</b> (5 - 10 mm), core sand - made, collect by means of a special device to the blocks. Pouring and filling billets are being when preheated moulds immersing in melt metal through one or more gatings, leaving the outer surface of the mould. Filling billet is directly from the molten pool until its complete solidification, after finishing of billet’s crystallization, non - solidified metal from the gatings goes back into the oven. For a long time, based on experimental investigation are identified optimal technological parameters of the process of casting billets of low-alloyed gray and ductile iron. Through the minimum time between the modification and pouring moulds of melt, graphitized items, in ligatures, have the greatest effect. Crystallization of the alloy is mainly running with the formation of austenite-graphite eutectic, which also has a positive effect on reducing marriage to porosity. Due to the active influence on the rate of solidification and cooling at different periods of the formation of the casting, provides technological process provide to obtaining billets without structurally - free carbides with the requisite level of physical and mechanical properties without the using of energy-intensive heat treatment. Optimal thermal conditions for the formation provide uniformity of hardness on the perimeter of billet. Physical-mechanical properties and microstructure satisfy the technical requirements for piston’s rings. Possibility to obtain a single cast billets of ductile iron with hypoeutectic composition, free shrinkage defects. Significantly reduces the deadweight loss of the metal, because there is no need to use big quantity of waste of production, accounting more than 50 % with the traditional casting technology. Replacing the traditional casting technology of individual billets of piston’s rings in the green-sand moulds with casting by immersion, allows high-performance process, increase the yield of up to 85 - 95 %, make technological process simplified and cheaper...|$|R

Thirty plastic models of (1 × 3 × 42) mm were prepared with conical shoulder shape as following ISO 6871 - 1 dental base metal casting alloys. Models were divided equally into two experimental groups (15 cobalt-chromium and 15 titanium) and one control group of 26 specimens of cobalt-chromium. Each model was invested and <b>moulded</b> into <b>mould</b> <b>rings</b> with a special investment material. The specimens were placed in oven at room temperature. Temperature of the oven was then increased gradually for each alloy following manufacturer’s recommendations. Following casting, the specimens were allowed to cool down at room temperature. All cast specimens were then retrieved from the investment and finished. Each specimen was cleaned utilizing acetone solution. All specimens of titanium were then checked by using X-ray to ensure that all specimens were porosity free before cutting and laser welding. Specimens of each alloy were laser welded using Nd-YAG (Manfredi Jewellaser 50, Italy) laser welding machine under power voltage of 270 W, pulse duration of 10 ms, and welding spot diameter of 1. 0 mm. Tensile strength and three-point bending tests were carried out using Universal Testing Machine(Shimadzu Autograph AG-X, Japan). Two specimens were selected randomly for examination under Scanning Electron Microscope to investigate the topography of the specimen after laser welding. All data were then statistically analysed using t-test and/or Mann Whitney test. Tensile strength tests results showed that the value of stress was significantly lower in laser welded specimens 401. 87 MPa, (124. 64) when compared to the control specimens 813. 07 MPa, (50. 075), at p= 0. 000.
