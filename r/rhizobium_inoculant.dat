30|$|Utilizing Rhizobium {{inoculation}} for pulses {{production is}} a common practice in {{different part of the}} world including some countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the success of this inoculant technology in common bean is variable from location to location. Besides, it depends on common bean genotypes. Due to different rhizobia population size and its competitiveness in different locations and presence of specificity between Rhizobium strain-common bean genotypes (Aouani et al. 1997), we need to develop genotype and location specific <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant.</b> Hence, this study was initiated to evaluate the effect of genotypes, Rhizobium inoculation and environmental locations on nodulation and productivity of common bean in major common bean growing areas of eastern Ethiopia.|$|E

In agreement with the cowpea accesses origin, the Brazilian accesses presented the largest of nodule occupancy rates, followed by those of Nigeria and USA. The largest occupation percentage, in 6 of the 10 tested cowpea, was due to the innoculation with the BR 3273 strain, and the smallest one was due to BR 3269 strains, in 8 of the 10 cowpea accesses.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{influence}} of various soil factors on the legume–Rhizobium symbiotic relationship. Abiotic factors such as extremes in soil pH (highly acidic or alkaline soils), salinity, tillage, high soil temperature and chemical residues, {{all of which can}} occur in crop and pasture systems in southern Australia, generally reduce populations of Rhizobium in the soil. Naturally occurring Rhizobium populations, although often found in high numbers, are generally poor in their ability to fix nitrogen and can compete strongly with introduced <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant.</b> The introduction of new legume genera as a continuing and essential part of change in farming systems usually requires the need to identify new and specific inoculant Rhizobium strains not found in the soil, but necessary for optimum nitrogen fixation. It is therefore necessary to characterise the specific requirements or limitations in the soil for establishing Rhizobium populations to ensure optimal nitrogen fixation following inoculation of legumes. The ability of the introduced Rhizobium to form effective nodules is rarely linked to a single soil attribute; therefore the study of rhizobial ecology requires an understanding of many soil and environmental factors. This paper reviews current knowledge of {{the influence of}} soil factors on rhizobial survival, the nodulation process, and nitrogen fixation by legumes...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} {{approach was}} used to develop a <b>Rhizobium</b> (Bradyrhizobium) japonicum <b>inoculant</b> that increases soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield in fields with indigenous Rhizobium populations, which typically outcompete strains present in existing commercial inoculants and therefore decrease the value of inoculant use. Field tests managed by several universities in the Mississippi delta region averaged a 169 -kg/ha (P < 0. 01) grain yield increase. The inoculant contains a mixture of mutants selected for increased nitrogen fixation ability. These mutants were derived from indigenous wild-type strains {{that are capable of}} high-level occupancy of nodules in soybean fields in the Mississippi delta region. To ensure microbiological purity, the inoculant is fermented directly in the point-of-use container with a vermiculite carrier (L. Graham-Weiss, M. L. Bennett, and A. S. Paau, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53 : 2138 - 2140, 1987). It should be possible to use this approach to produce more effective <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculants</b> for any legume in any geographical area...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Nitrogen (N) {{deficiency}} {{is present}} in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) fields in most production regions in Central America and the Caribbean (CA/C), especially on small hillside farms where no or sub-optimum levels of fertilizer are used. Under these conditions, <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculants</b> could represent a cheap and effective input to increase bean yield. Despite the potential benefits from increased biological nitrogen fixation, Rhizobium inoculation is rarely used by farmers in CA/C. Nodulation and nitrogen fixation (N 2) of bean cultivars in response to Rhizobium inoculation is quite variable due to several biological and edaphic factors (Graham et al. 2003). On the other hand, the response of different bean cultivars and germplasm accessions to different Rhizobium species and strains that nodulate and fix N 2 {{is often difficult to}} measure on farms.

(1993) also found that N derived from the atmosphere (% Ndfa) varied from 35 to 70 % among different common bean genotypes. Usually, bushy growth habit of common bean has the lowest N fixation efficiency among all legume crops (Bliss 1993; Hardarson et al. 1993; Isoi and Yoshida 1991; Martinez-Romero 2003). Indeterminate genotypes generally can fix more nitrogen than determinate genotypes due to the greater “sink” in the indeterminate variety (Ofori and Stern 1987). Bliss (1993) identified common bean genotypes capable of fixing enough atmospheric N 2 to support the grain yield of 1000 – 2000  kg ha− 1. Therefore, improvement of bean BNF requires a multidisciplinary approach that will increase the host capacity to fix N (Giller 2001) and selection of effective Rhizobium strains that can compete for nodulation with native populations of bacteria present in most soils. So far, the effect of environmental condition on Rhizobium-common bean genotypes is not well known. Almost no attempt has also been made on effective bushy type common bean genotypes (with variable maturity time)-Rhizobium symbiosis, which can give higher responses in different environment conditions. Hence, {{the objective of this}} work was to evaluate the effect of bushy type common bean genotypes, Rhizobium strains and environment interaction on the nodulation, yield and yield traits of common bean in soils of eastern Ethiopia.|$|E

Although the cost to implement these strategies is 13% higher, which may not be possible to obtain for a poor subsistence farmer, the profits per hectare could be nearly doubled. Protein intake for a farmer’s family can increase by 40%, and increases in livestock ownership can increase by 30%. This can result in an increase of 45% extra income for the family. This extra income for a family can help send a child to school, or teach a daughter how to read and empower them in Nepalese society.

40|$|Southern Africa {{smallholder}} farmers {{continue to}} be the most affected by the challenges of climate change and variability. The variability of climate demands the use of a variety of agronomic strategies and crop choices. Traditional drought tolerant cereal crops such as sorghum and millets are often chosen when drought seasons are anticipated. However, there are certain crops, originating elsewhere, that could help the smallholder farmers increase diversity of crops that can be grown in changed climates. Trials were conducted to test a basket of known and introduced climate smart crops in the field. The cereal crops tested were maize, sorghum, pearl and finger millet, and legumes: tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolias), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), Bambara nut (Vigna subterranea), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan. A second experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} inorganic fertilizer and rhizobium inoculation on the growth and grain yield of field grown tepary bean. Both experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Due to drought conditions during the growing season, cereal crops could not produce grain yield, as there was no grain filling. Despite this, cereal biomass was 5 t ha- 1 for maize, followed by sorghum (1. 3 t ha- 1) and millet (1. 2 t ha- 1). Legume crops produced grain with cowpea yielding 568. 1 kg ha- 1 of grain, followed by tepary bean (245. 9 kg ha- 1) and common bean (227 kg ha- 1). This is important for food, nutrition and health security of smallholder communities.

Results: The response of the test crops to inoculation varied with growth stage. At the seedling stage, effective nodule number was not significantly affected in all but Mucuna bean {{in which there was}} a 42. 7 % reduction. At pre-anthesis, Bambara groundnut, Bebi bean, Groundnut, and Cowpea recorded a statistically similar number of nodules (p= 0. 05) under inoculated and non-inoculated conditions, but inoculation reduced nodule formation in Mucuna bean and African yam bean by 22. 4 and 20. 4 %, respectively. Nodule dry weight of Bebi bean, Bambara groundnut, Mucuna bean and Cowpea was unaffected by inoculation when assessed at the seedling and pre-anthesis growth stages, but that of Groundnut was reduced by 35, and African yam bean increased by 60 %, respectively. Inoculation increased the nodule dry weight of African yam bean and Mucuna bean by 56. 5 and 60. 6 % at seed initiation stage, and reduced that of Bambara groundnut and Groundnut by 25. 6 and 50. 0 %, respectively. The effect of genotype × inoculation interaction on plant biomass and fresh grain yield was significant; whereas inoculation significantly increased the yield of Cowpea from 2, 471 to 2, 794 kg/ha and 2, 995 to 3504 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively, it did not significantly affect that of Bebi bean, African yam bean and Bambara groundnut. On the contrary, the yield of groundnut was reduced from 884 to 560 kg/ha and 963 to 678 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Conclusion: Inoculation with NoduMax was beneficial to cowpea, but did not significantly improve the performance of Bebi bean, and Groundnut. It could be that Bebi bean is promiscuous and better adapted to the native strains of Rhizobium, while the Rhizobium in Groundnut is antagonistic and incompatible with the introduced inoculants...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of chickpea {{as an alternative}} rotation crop in Canterbury has already been established. Experiments were therefore planned to investigate the effects of inoculation, additional nitrogen fertilizer and supplemental watering on its nodulation and growth and the suitability of sowing in either winter or spring. Three experiments were carried out using kabuli chickpeas; two on a Templeton silt loam soil {{in the field and}} one in the glasshouse. The first field trial was sown on two dates (3 July and 30 September), provided with four rates of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 15, 45 and 90 kg N/ha) and three rates of <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant</b> (zero, recommended rate and twice the recommended rate). Experiment two was carried out in the glasshouse with three levels of supplemental watering (1 / 3 field capacity, 2 / 3 field capacity and field capacity), two rates of nitrogen fertilizer (0 and 90 kg N/ha) and either inoculated with the recommended rate of <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant</b> or not inoculated. In the last field trial, the chickpea was inoculated and sown on three dates (9 July, 9 August and 14 September) with (90 kg N/ha) or without additional nitrogen fertilizer. Under both field and glasshouse conditions, nodulation response to Rhizobium inoculation was poor with the number of nodules initiated per plant rarely exceeding 10. Added fertilizer nitrogen reduced the number of nodules per plant by 50 % {{in the early part of}} the 1992 / 93 season. In the glasshouse, the reduction in nodule number in the presence of additional nitrogen persisted throughout plant growth such that at 30, 45 and 60 DAS, nodule number per plant was reduced by 84, 59 and 53 % respectively. Seed reserve mobilization was enhanced by both additional nitrogen and supplemental watering. The cotyledons of the fully watered plants weighed 50 and 77 % less than those of the plants maintained at 1 / 3 field capacity at 30 and 45 DAS respectively. At 30 DAS the plants receiving additional nitrogen had cotyledons weighing 31 % less than those not provided with additional nitrogen. In the glasshouse added nitrogen reduced root dry weights from 0. 16 g/plant to 0. 13 g/plant at 30 DAS and from 0. 23 g/plant to 0. 19 g/plant at 45 DAS. However, it increased branch number and leaf number per plant by between 21 and 87 % and 17 and 48 % respectively between 30 and 60 DAS. Green area per plant was increased from 72. 3 cm² to 93. 3 cm² at 45 DAS and from 66. 8 cm² to 110. 7 cm² at 60 DAS and shoot dry weight from 0. 92 g/plant to 1. 30 g/plant at 60 DAS in the presence of additional nitrogen. For plants maintained at field capacity the increase in root dry weight was between 33 and 180 %, that of leaf number between 18 and 74 % and green area between 52 and 226 %. Shoot percent nitrogen increased by 30 % in the presence of additional nitrogen and by 32 % when the plants were inoculated with the recommended rate of Rhizobium inoculum. Seed yield averaged 2. 87 t/ha with a harvest index (HI) of 0. 29. Harvest index was significantly (p< 0. 05) increased by Rhizobium inoculation from 0. 26 to 0. 31 at zero and double the recommended rate respectively. It was also increased significantly (p< 0. 0001) as sowing date was delayed from winter (0. 25) to spring (0. 33). Maximum dry matter yield declined as the sowing date was delayed from 11. 2 t/ha when sown in July to 9. 5 t/ha when sown in September. Added fertilizer nitrogen increased leaf area index (LAI) from 2. 7 without additional nitrogen to 3. 7 when 90 kg N/ha was provided and total intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from 725 MJ PAR/m² to 760 MJ PAR/m² at 0 and 90 kg N/ha respectively. Total PAR intercepted declined as sowing date was delayed with the July sowing intercepting 20 % more PAR (810 MJ PAR/m²) than the September sowing (675 MJ PAR/m²). Total dry matter accumulation was closely related to PAR intercepted throughout the growing season and on average 1. 64 g of dry matter was produced for every MJ of PAR intercepted. This work suggests that farmers are unlikely to obtain a yield advantage with winter sowing of chickpeas but sowing about late September to early October will give maximum yields. Rhizobium inoculation is necessary to ensure nodulation, however more work is necessary to determine suitable methods of inoculation. Water stress will reduce chickpea growth and dry matter yield in the glasshouse, primarily due to a reduction in green area. Chickpea crops do not fix adequate nitrogen for their own use. However in the field there was little indication that added nitrogen benefited crop growth...|$|E
40|$|Soybean Glycine max. L is an {{important}} food crop in Rwanda and has recently been identified {{as one of the}} priority crops for the Crop Intensification Program CIP for the country. However its productivity is low standing at about 0. 8 tha against the potential of 3 - 5 tha depending on the varieties used. The use of organic and inorganic fertilizers to increase soybean productivity is constrained by their high cost to most small scale farmers. Use of farm yard manure is also limited by the unavailability of livestock to most soybean growers. In this regard the most viable alternative to fertilization would be deployment of Nitrogen-fixing microorganisms to soybean farming systems. These however need to first be tested on the available soybean varieties. A field experiment was carried out in Nyarubaka sector of Kamonyi District to evaluate the response of two soybean varieties Peka 6 and SB 24 to Rhizobium inoculation without limitation of phosphorus. The experiment was laid down in completely randomized block design with three replicates. The results obtained showed significant differences P 0. 05 in grain yields and nodules mean score between inoculated and no inoculated treatments. The variety Peka 6 responded to the <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculants</b> more than SB 24. Although further studies need to be conducted to obtain conclusive information on these Nitrogen fixers the study indicates that Peka 6 in combination with the right Rhizobia inoculants could be recommended to replace conventional fertilization for our poor farming household...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate forage productivity of arbila (Phaseolus lunatus) as the ruminant feed at various levels of <b>rhizobium</b> <b>inoculants</b> and harvesting times, was designed following completely randomized design of factorial pattern with two factors. The first factor was the level of inoculums (I) i. e. I 1 (without inoculum), I 2 (5 g/kg seed), I 3 (10 g/kg seed), and I 4 (15 g/kg seed). The second factor was harvesting time (U) i. e. U 1 (60 days), U 2 (80 days), U 3 (100 days) with 4 replications. The variables were N uptake, production of dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM), and percentage of OM, crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), nitrogen free extract (NFE), extract ether (EE) and ash of arbila forage (based on DM). The results showed that inoculant treatment at the rate of 15 g/kg seed produced the highest percentage of effective nodules (98. 72 %), and in combination with harvesting age at 100 days each polybag of plant was able to absorb the higest amount of N (688. 10 g) with production of DM 273. 81 g, OM production 263. 96 g and nutrients content based on DM of about 91. 14 % OM, 33. 52 % CF, 34. 76 %, 5. 75 % EE, 09. 37 % ash, and 16. 16 % CP. From the study, it can be concluded that arbila plants inoculated specific rhizobium Phaseolus vulgaris at the rate of 15 g/kg seed and harvested at 100 days yielded the best forage as feed...|$|R
40|$|Available online 16 November 2015 Soybean yields {{could benefit}} {{from the use of}} {{improved}} varieties, phosphate-fertilizer and <b>rhizobium</b> <b>inoculants.</b> In this study, we evaluated the results of widespread testing of promiscuous soybean varieties with four treatments: no inputs (control); SSP fertilizer (P); inoculants (I) and SSP plus inoculants (P + I) among smallholder farmers in northern Nigeria in 2011 and 2012. We observed a strong response to both P and I, which significantly increased grain yields by 452 and 447 kg ha− 1 respectively. The additive effect of P + I (777 kg ha− 1) resulted in the best average yields. Variability in yield among farms was large, which had implications for the benefits for individual farmers. Moreover, although the yield response to P and I was similar, I was more profitable due to its low cost. Only 16 % of the variability in control yields could be explained by plant establishment, days to first weeding, percentage sand and soil exchangeable magnesium. Between 42 % and 61 % of variability in response to P and/or I could be explained by variables including year, farm size, plant establishment, total rainfall and pH. The predictive value of these variables was limited, however, with cross-validation R 2 decreasing to about 15 % for the prediction between Local Government Areas and 10 % between years. Implications for future research include our conclusion that averages of performance of technologies tell little about the adoption potential for individual farmers. We also conclude that a strong agronomic and economic case exists for the use of inoculants with promiscuous soybean, requiring efforts to improve the availability of good quality inoculants in Africa.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{watering}} regime and rhizobial inoculation on the growth, nodulation and seed yields of some legume species was evaluated in the screenhouse of the Department of Crop, Soil & Pest Management, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria. The experimental layout was 5 x 3 x 2 factorial with 3 replications given {{a total of}} 90 treatments. Seeds of five staple and forage legume species: Pakala (Phaseolus lunatus), Soy bean (TGX 199057 f’ and TGX 198057), Stylozanthes (Stylozanthes macrocephala) and the Greenleaf Desmodium (Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb.) were sown into plastic pots which were watered at 4 -, 8 - and 12 - days intervals, with or without rhizobium inoculation using a rhizobium strain, Rhizobium phaseoli. The plastic pots (5 litre capacity were perforated at bottom to allow for drainage and were filled with pure river sand. The effect of watering regimes on legume species was significant on leaf development, soybean variety, TGX 199057 f had {{the highest number of}} leaves while Desmodium had the least number of leaves. Seedlings that were watered at 4 - and 8 -days interval had better vigour of growth compared to 12 - days watering interval. Compared with 12 -days watering interval, both inoculated and non-inoculated seedlings subjected to 4 - and 8 -days watering intervals had higher root and shoot biomass. TGX 199057 f non- inoculated at 8 -days watering intervals had the highest value for number of pods and TGX 198057 watered at 12 - day intervals had higher pod weight. Rhizobium inoculated legumes produced more vigorous plants in addition to higher root nodules, plant height and number of leaves compared with the non-inoculated species. The highest number of leaves and nodules were produced by Phaseolus lunatus when inoculated with the rhizobium strain. However, the highest number of pods was obtained for inoculated soybean (TGX 199057 f) compared with the non-inoculated plants. The highest seed yield was obtained from rhizobium inoculated soybean (TGX 198057). Desmodium produced few seeds compared to Phaseolus lunatus and Styolzanthes. The effects of watering regimes and rhizobium inoculation varied on leaf proximate and chemical composition of legume species. The nitrogen, crude protein, ash, chlorophyll, soluble carbohydrates content in leaf differed among the legume species. The legume species inoculated and grown at 4 - days watering intervals had the highest contents of moisture, nitrogen, chlorophyll, soluble carbohydrates and ash compared to non-inoculated legume species. Application of rhizobium strain significantly increased seed yield in soybean and Desmodium and caused substantial increase in nodulation. The study has shown that to increase legume productivity under soil moisture deficit stress of marginal/degraded soil, application of <b>rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant</b> is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{production}} by large scale commercial producers in Ethiopia is under intensive production and relies on {{high rates of}} nitrogen (N) fertilizer and irrigation during the dry season. Despite increasing interest to produce this crop, small scale farmers cannot afford {{the high cost of}} N fertilizer. Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to test snap bean production under a low input production system better suited to small scale resource limited farmers. Field experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 under rain fed conditions, and in 2012 under irrigation, at three locations (Debre Zeit, Hawassa, Ziway) representing different climate zones in Ethiopia. This experiment used three N treatments: 0 and 100 kg N ha- 1, and inoculation with Rhizobium etli [HB 429], and eight cultivars: Andante, Boston Contender Blue, Lomami, Melkassa 1, Melkassa 3, Paulista and Volta. The general objective of the field experiment was to determine the potential of snap bean production under a low input production system using rhizobium inoculation as the nitrogen source, and use rain fed conditions. Results obtained indicated that rhizobial inoculation and applied inorganic N increased on average the marketable pod yield of snap bean under rain fed conditions by 18 % and 43 %, respectively. Nodulation and subsequent N 2 fixation was not effective in improving yield or other traits of snap bean pod under irrigation, although applied N increased marketable yield by 33 %. Melkassa 1 was the most suitable cultivar for a reduced input production system due to its successful nodulation characteristics, greatest N 2 fixation levels and consistently good performance across locations under rain fed conditions. Commercial cultivars possessed the best pod quality characteristics and they yielded better under irrigation. Cultivars interacted with locations to affect pod traits including total soluble solids and concentrations of protein, calcium, and potassium under rain fed conditions. Snap bean cultivrs produced at Debre Zeit and Hawassa were similar in marketable yield and several other traits particularly under rain fed conditions. Zinc (Zn) concentration in pods was greatest at Hawassa both under rain fed and irrigated conditions. Conditions at Debre Zeit were the most conducive for supporting biological N 2 fixation for snap bean production. The eight cultivars were also used for a greenhouse study that was evaluated treatments of drought stress of 50 % field capacity (50 % FC) during the vegetative (V 4. 4), flowering (R 6) and pod formation (R 7) developmental stages. Our result showed that drought stresses during reproductive stages (R 6 and R 7) were the most sensitive stages in deteriorating the quality of snap bean pods. Drought stress increased protein, phosphorus and Zn concentrations but it reduced iron concentration in snap bean pods. All cultivars had a similar response to drought stress. A second greenhouse experiment was conducted to test foliar application of growth regulators: the control, 10 - 5 M and 10 - 4 M concentrations of each of abscisic acid (ABA), kinetin and salicylic acid (SA); and two concentrations of yeast extract (4 g l- 1 and 8 g l- 1), under drought (50 % FC) stressed and unstressed conditions. Foliar application of SA on snap bean under greenhouse conditions reduced the impact of drought stress, particularly the pod quality parameters: marketable yield, pod curving, texture and appearance of snap bean pods. However, application of ABA, kinetin and SA reduced pod quality of snap bean under unstressed conditions. In conclusion, pod yield improvement could be achieved by a N 2 fixation system under rain fed conditions, which is more sustainable than N fertilizer inputs. Pod quality was also adequate for commercial export production. <b>Rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant</b> can therefore be used as an alternative N source, particularly under low input production system for resource-limited small-scale snap bean producers...|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} soil {{nitrogen}} (N) {{can interfere with}} N 2 fixation of lentil (Lens culinaris) and have variable effects on growth, yield and maturity of this indeterminate crop in Saskatchewan. In a series of field and greenhouse experiments during 2006 to 2008, response of the above-ground biomass (DW), plant N, N 2 fixation, yield and days to maturity (DTM) of lentil to different N sources, time of N availability, and also to two no tillage (NT) durations were studied. First, eight cultivars of lentil were grown under three fertility treatments of granular <b>rhizobium</b> <b>inoculant,</b> 50 kg N fertilizer ha- 1 and a non-treated control in three environment-years at Saskatoon and Indian Head, SK. The fertility treatments, plant N status and N 2 fixation did not alter lentil DTM, but weather did. On average, lentil matured 101 and 84 days after seeding with sufficient rain and with drought, respectively. Growth and yield of the lentil were identical in the inoculant and the N fertilizer treatments. The N fertilizer treatment occasionally restricted N 2 fixation, but N shortage was compensated via more N uptake from soil. The greatest N accumulation of lentil occurred during podding to maturity and benefitted pod N content. By maturity, pod, stem and leaf had 60, 24 and 14 % of total dry matter and 78, 9 and 13 % of total plant N, respectively. Leaf N concentration, which closely resembled soil and plant N status, was reasonably predicted by SPAD chlorophyll meter observations after pod set. Yield of five lentil cultivars was tested {{for the effects of}} 25 -years (LN) versus 5 -years (SN) of no tillage in the Black Soil Zone at Indian Head, SK in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In the same location, CDC Sedley was grown with four N fertilizer rates at the both LN and SN. Under terminal drought in 2006, average DW, N content and yield of the lentil cultivars in SN were greater than in LN, likely because of inhibited N 2 fixation by the amplified soil N in the LN. In this year, 60 kg N fertilizer ha- 1 reduced the yield difference of CDC Sedley in SN and LN. Lentil yield was identical or tended to be greater in LN than in SN with more rain in 2007 and 2008 that prolonged N mineralization and N uptake. In the greenhouse study, applying N fertilizer from flowering until podding and until maturity increased DW, N content and yield, and delayed maturity of lentil compared to lentil relying on N 2 fixation. Later flowering of one cultivar or greater N 2 fixation in one soil medium diminished the variation of inoculated lentil with the post-flowering N treatments, suggesting N fixation could supply lentil N requirement. Large-seeded cultivars produced greater yield than the small-seeded cultivars across environments in the fertility treatment study. Cultivar CDC Milestone produced comparable yield to high-yielding cultivars CDC Plato and CDC Greenland, but matured earlier. This cultivar showed promising results under both cool-wet and drought conditions. In contrast, CDC Sedley had lower on N 2 fixation and HI values across the experiments. In the Black Soil Zone, CDC Milestone and CDC Robin performance was improved by improved HI and N 2 fixation. Overall, results of this thesis do not support the application of N fertilizer for inducing early maturity in lentil. Soil inoculation with commercial strains is suggested for Saskatchewan cropping systems. Applying N fertilizer is not required, unless soil test results suggest otherwise. In places like Indian Head, SK, cultivars with greater N 2 fixation and higher HI can better fit the short growing season, cool temperature and high soil N content...|$|E
