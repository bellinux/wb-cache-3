5000|$|With {{the sudden}} death of Warren G. Harding on August 2, 1923, the U.S. Post Office {{was quick to}} release a {{memorial}} stamp in his honor only one month later, a record. By and large, it incorporated the same design as the Regular Issues of this time, the only differences being 1) that the dates of Harding's birth and death were inscribed in the upper two corners of the stamp, 2) that no hatch-lines appear in the rectangular frame and 3) that the corner circles are a solid color. Clair Aubrey Houston designed this issue in one day using {{a modified version of the}} existing frame to surround an image taken from a copperplate etching of Harding. The issue was first released on September 1, in Harding’s hometown of Marion, Ohio, and in the District of Columbia. Four varieties were ultimately issued: a flat plate printed perforated 11 and a <b>rotary</b> <b>plate</b> perforated 10, an error imperforate that was then officially reproduced, and a very rare version, the rotary perforated 11 (discussed below in [...] "Oddities of the issue"). The black colored memorial stamp itself is not considered a Regular Issue by collectors, however its basic design and theme was used in the three separate printings of the 1½-cent stamp that was added to the regular Issue a year and a half after the memorial issue.|$|E

The plant is equipped with rotary and stoker furnaces and both fly ash samples coming from these two equipments have been individually employed. Ash from waste incineration plant is classified as hazardous and cannot be utilized or even landfilled without prior treatment. This paper reports {{the results of an}} extensive investigation on stabilization/solidification of the above ash samples by addition of hydraulic binders in a granulation equipment. A <b>rotary</b> <b>plate</b> granulator was used with binders based on cement, lime and coal fly ash. Granulation was carried out with several mixes in which the ash content was up to 70 %. In some cases, the granules obtained in this way are suited for matter recovery by reusing the waste for the manufacture of building materials. To achieve this in most cases, two-step granulation is required with pure binder being used in the second one. In this way the granules from the first step can be encapsulated within an outer shell able to improve the technological and leaching properties. The possibility to get matter recovery from incinerator ash is a crucial issue for making the granulation process environmentally and economically sound. In fact, the most direct application of granules is in the field of artificial aggregates for road construction and concrete manufacture. The granules obtained from the treatment of fly ash samples have been tested to assess their physico-mechanical and leaching properties. Specifically, measurements have been carried out regarding the following properties: density, water adsorption capacity, compressive (crushing) strength and leaching behavior. Moreover, concrete mixes have been prepared with some of the artificial aggregates made by granulation.

40|$|Introduction The {{efficiency}} and cost effectiveness of orchard pest management programs {{are influenced by}} the skills of managers and sprayer operators who evaluate orchard conditions and alter machine settings and operating techniques to optimize performance of sprayers. A combination of operational skill, equipment performance, timing and chemical selection is necessary for optimal results. Research and development of electrostatics, air-assisted, low-volume spraying and other technologies for agriculture and horticulture was studied by biological and agricultural engineering in order to decrease of pesticide consumption. The main objective of charged liquid or powder form of the pesticide spread is increasing the percentage of poison meeting on plant surfaces. The first sprayer with <b>rotary</b> <b>plate</b> became available in 1970. The amount of solution was less and had uniform spray droplets. Apple orchards in West Azerbaijan province, Iran, are sprayed mainly with tractor-mounted lance sprayers but there is large national, regional and farm to farm variation in spray volumes applied with such sprayers. Traditionally, high spray volumes (> 2000 l. ha- 1) were used in many places. Reduction in spray volume has been driven largely by the need to improve spraying equipment. West Azerbaijan province has 117000 hectare fruit orchards and 1. 2 million ton fruit production that the most of them are apple and grape. However, it is necessary for reduction of pesticide application in order to produce economic and safe fruits. Materials and Methods In the present study the tractor-mounted lance sprayer in control of apple pest (Carpocasa pomonella L) was evaluated and compared with electrostatic and Micronair sprayers. This research was implemented in an apple orchard (Golden Delicious variety) with row spacing of 6  6 meter.

Methods: Twenty healthy young adult males {{participated in this study}} and were exposed to two treatments. The first treatment (nonvibration) involved passive stretching of the plantarflexors at end range of motion (ROM) for five 1 -min bouts.

The poly(1 -butene) samples investigated varied in {{number average molecular weight}} from 35, 000 to 105, 000. Crystallization was carried out using a parallel <b>plate</b> <b>rotary</b> shearing apparatus mounted on the stage of an optical microscope. Photographic techniques were used to record nuclei formation and size during crystallization over a shear rate range of 0 sec(2 ̆ 7 - 1) to 12 sec(2 ̆ 7 - 1). The data was analyzed in light of classical nucleation theory and Avrami kinetics. The imposition of shear during crystallization generally accelerated the transformation process through increased nucleation rates. The process was also characterized by a reduction in induction times which generally showed a saturation effect with shear. The negative temperature coefficient of the nucleation rate becomes less negative for shear crystallization over the range studied. ^ Shear stresses of the crystallizing melt were measured on a separate instrument and were found to increase rapidly with the onset of crystallization. The rise in shear stress paralleled the rise in nuclei formation. The corresponding increase in viscosity could be accounted for by using an effective nuclei volume concept during the early stages of crystallization. ^ Morphological studies of sheared samples show deformed spherulites and row-nucleated structures. ^ The observations here lead {{to the conclusion that the}} shear stress in the system induce a certain amount of molecular orientation which greatly accelerates the overall crystalline transformation process. The large increase in the nucleation process which is believed to be directly related to the orientation in the system, is the main contributing factor to the rapid crystallization as well as the decrease in induction period. ...|$|R

No morphological changes were induced by prolactin (PRL). On floating gels, two cell types appeared {{in the absence of}} cell proliferation. The cells in direct contact with the medium became cuboidal and developed intracellular organelles typical of secretory cells. PRL-induced lipogenesis, resulting in large fat droplets filling the apical cytoplasm and accumulation of casein and α-lactalbumin in vesicles surrounding the fat droplets. We detected tranferrin in {{the presence or absence of}} PRL intracellularly in small vesicles but also in the collagen matrix in contact with the cell layer. The second cell type, rich in microfilaments and reminiscent of the myoepithelial cells, was situated between the secretory cell layer and the collagen matrix. In embedding gels, the cells formed hollow ductlike structures, which grew continuously in size. Secretory cells formed typical lumina distended by secretory products. We found few microfilament-rich cells in contact with the collagen gels. Storage and secretion of fat, caseins and alpha-lactalbumin required the presence of PRL, whereas the accumulation and vectorial discharge of transferrin was prolactin independent. There was no differentiation gradient between the tip and the cent of the outgrowth, since DNA synthesis and milk protein storage were random along the tubular structures. These results indicate that establishment of functional polarity and induction of cytodifferentiation are influenced by the nature of the interaction of the cells with the collagen structure. The morphological differentiation in turn plays an important role in the synthesis, storage, and secretion of fat and milk proteins...|$|R
