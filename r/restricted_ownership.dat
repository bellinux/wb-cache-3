5000|$|In 1928, after a near {{decade of}} {{hyperinflation}} destroyed the structural fabric of society, a rapidly expanding three-way political {{divide between the}} conservatives, National Socialists, and Communists prompted the rapidly declining conservative majority to enact the Law on Firearms and Ammunition. This law relaxed gun restrictions and put into effect a strict firearm licensing scheme. Under this scheme, Germans could possess firearms, but {{they were required to}} have separate permits to do the following: own or sell firearms, carry firearms (including handguns), manufacture firearms, and professionally deal in firearms and ammunition. Furthermore, the law <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership</b> of firearms to [...] "... persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and who can show a need for a (gun) permit." [...] This law revoked the 1919 Regulations on Weapons Ownership, which had banned all firearms possession.|$|E
50|$|The {{first wave}} of mergers began with Yorkshire Television {{acquiring}} Tyne Tees Television in 1992, forming a parent group called Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings. In 1994, Carlton Communications - which had owned a 20% stake in Central Independent Television - acquired {{the remainder of the}} company and, because of Central's shareholdings, inherited a 20% stake in Meridian Broadcasting. Later that year, Granada acquired London Weekend Television through a hostile takeover worth in the region of £750 million. MAI, which controlled Meridian Broadcasting, acquired Anglia Television; MAI became United News & Media after merging with United Newspapers - owners of The Daily Express in 1996. Ownership rules, that previously <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership</b> of ITV licences by one company to two outright, plus 20% in a third, were relaxed, and so Carlton went on to acquire Westcountry Television (later re-branding it Carlton, along with Central), Granada acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Holdings (with the parent group becoming Granada Media, later simply Granada) and United acquired HTV.|$|E

50|$|Today's breed {{standards}} are {{alleged to have}} developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. However, Chien-gris dogs, having very similar features to the Weimaraner, have been traced {{as far back as}} the 13th century in the court of Louis IX of France, during which most aristocrats owned one and used them for hunting. One theory is that the ancestor is the St. Hubert Hound (also known as the Bloodhound and Sleuth Hound). Though these dogs are black, they can produce a grey dog when bred. Like the Vizsla at the time, the breed was created exclusively for the nobility. The aim was to create a noble-looking, reliable gun dog. With its <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership</b> and natural instinct, the breed was highly prized and lived with the family. This was unusual since during this period hunting dogs were kept in kennels in packs. This has resulted in a dog that needs to be near humans and that quickly deteriorates when kenneled. The Weimaraner was an all-purpose family dog, capable of guarding the home, hunting with the family, and of course, being loving and loyal towards children.|$|E

The beneficiaries of the redistributive land reforms undertaken in many Latin American countries, however, did not receive the individual property right of the land. This paper suggests {{that this type of}} reform was a measure intended to favor not the peasantry, but the landed elite of those countries. It is shown that if land is the abundant factor land rent is decreasing with the total amount of privately owned land. Thus, the landed elite favored giving the peasants land under a <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership</b> regime. (Copyright: Elsevier) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explored}} the natural situation of trees, concept, potentials {{and importance of}} tree tenure, tree and land tenure, types of tree tenure, problems of forest reservation in south eastern Nigeria and the way forward. The tropical rainforest of Nigeria occupies 9. 7 % of the total land mass of 98. 3213 km 2, but is the most densely populated and source of Nigeria’s bulk timber. In the natural situation no nutrients is lost due to a balanced nutrient recycling and there are slight variations in temperature light, humidity, and characteristic meet groups. The concept and importance of tree tenure borders the fact that much of life on earth owes its ’ existence to trees. Land and tree ownership rights are largely governed by customary tenure rules and these rights are rarely revoked. Land tenure {{does not necessarily mean}} tree tenure. Trees may be owned privately, communally or by government. Each of these forms of ownership have their advantages and disadvantages. In private/individual tree tenure, trees are owned by planting, inheritance, gender, purchase/lease and culture. Communal tree tenure involves full ownership, <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership,</b> village squares and evil forests/sacred bush. Government tree tenure is through acquisition and maintenance of forest resources at the local, state or federal levels. Some of the challenges of maintenance forest reserves include diseases and pests, wild fires, poaching, village/community participation, poor budgetary allocation among others. A proper knowledge of tree tenure is a must if trees are to be managed scientifically {{in such a way that}} their productivity is sustained...|$|E
40|$|While much {{attention}} has been paid to ways to help low and moderate income homebuyers buy their first homes, relatively little has been written about how those homes can be kept affordable for the next purchasers when the original owners move on. Although programs have become very successful at finding ways to make homeownership possible for households not served by the private market, the ultimate challenge is to devise workable strategies to maintain the affordability of those homes over time. This analysis will provide an overview of both the policy choices being made and the mechanisms being employed to protect Massachusetts' stock of affordable ownership housing. Through an examination of the ways in which ownership-based affordability restrictions are currently being designed, implemented, monitored, and enforced, under different programs and in different communities, this report will demonstrate ways in which the current system may fail to protect units from being "lost to the market" and will recommend measures which could be taken to make the system more failsafe. Only a few decades ago, housing activists did not think that it was possible to find a workable balance between restricting resale prices and maintaining affordability. Today thousands of families who are unable to become owners through the private market are accepting this trade-off when they decide to purchase <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership</b> units. This analysis focuses exclusively on what has been occurring in Massachusetts. While the concepts outlined in this report should be applicable to other programs in other parts of the country, there are a number of features of the Massachusetts affordable housing experience which are uniquely local. by Cassandra A.

40|$|Cambodia {{differs from}} many other {{developing}} countries because of one specific asset which is tourism. The number of tourists in Cambodia is currently growing with a rapid pace due to the Angkor site {{near the city of}} Siem Reap. The growing number of tourists has definitely created challenges for the accommodation industry in the Siem Reap region. This has created the need for achieving a delicate balance between the exploration of the region and how much the region can cater for regarding the environment, social and long-term economical benefits. This growth has however brought along many downsides such as economical, environmental, social, cultural, political, and technological. There are no previous studies done about sustainable practice in the accommodation industry in developing countries. This study examines the barriers for the implementation of sustainable practice among accommodation providers in Siem Reap. The first step is this process was to determine the state of the environment. The second step was to determine the cause of the state followed by determining the process of change for sustainable development which can be regarded as the barriers. Previous studies have concluded that barriers of financial difficulties, the cost of change, lack of resources, the lack of information and support regarding sustainable tourism are common barriers for the implementation of sustainable practice. The barriers can be categorized into industry barriers related to industry specific characteristics and organizational barriers that refer to barriers due to characteristics within the firm. This report is based on a case study in which hermeneutic and qualitative method was used. The data was based on a content analysis of reports published by the International Development Centre of Japan in cooperation with the Cambodian Ministry of Tourism and 14 interviews with accommodation providers in Siem Reap. In many areas {{there was a lack of}} sustainable practices and many barriers could be uncovered. Barriers included among others lack of financial resources which <b>restricted</b> <b>ownership,</b> low awareness of the environmental state, lack of governmental support; an insufficient educational quality which limits management opportunities for Cambodians and insufficient quality in the environmental friendly products. This study has expanded the knowledge of barriers for the implementation not only to include environmental sustainable practices but also to include barriers when it economical, social, cultural, political and technological dimensions. These barriers should be considered representative for barriers for the implementation of sustainable practices in the accommodation industry in developing countries, especially in contexts with a similar development pattern as Siem Reap...|$|E
