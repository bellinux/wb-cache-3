5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is <b>replicated</b> by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are <b>replicated</b> by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>replicates</b> is {{essential}} in logistic measurement error models with random, additive error, as it gives a consistent estimate of the variance of the measurement error.

We find that, unlike the situation with independent <b>replicates,</b> the efficiency gain is an almost linear function of the number of <b>replicates.</b> Further, we study the allocation of <b>replicates</b> among study subjects, and find that the optimal way of doing this is to allocate few <b>replicates</b> to as many subjects as possible, rather than allocating many <b>replicates</b> to fewer subjects.

50|$|In the quasispecies model, {{mutations}} occur through errors made in {{the process}} of copying already existing sequences. Further, selection arises because different types of sequences tend to <b>replicate</b> at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that <b>replicate</b> more slowly in favor of sequences that <b>replicate</b> faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest <b>replicating</b> sequence. Although the sequences that <b>replicate</b> more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that <b>replicate</b> faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly <b>replicating</b> sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly <b>replicating</b> sequences can remain present in finite abundance.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Traditional gene {{expression}} analysis techniques capture an average {{gene expression}} state across sample <b>replicates.</b> However, the average signal across <b>replicates</b> will not capture activated gene networks in different states across <b>replicates.</b> For example, if a particular gene expression network is activated within a subset or all sample <b>replicates,</b> yet the activation state across the sample <b>replicates</b> differs by the specific genes activated in each <b>replicate,</b> the activation of this network will be washed out by averaging across <b>replicates.</b> This situation is {{likely to occur in}} single cell gene expression experiments or in noisy experimental settings where a small sub-population of cells contributes to the gene expression signature of interest...|$|R

40|$|ChIP-seq {{experiments}} identify genome-wide {{profiles of}} DNA-binding molecules including transcription factors, enzymes and epigenetic marks. Biological <b>replicates</b> {{are critical for}} reliable site discovery and are required for the deposition of data in the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. While early reports suggested two <b>replicates</b> were sufficient, the widespread application of the technique has led to emerging consensus that the technique is noisy and that increasing replication may be worthwhile. Additional biological <b>replicates</b> also allow for quantitative assessment of differences between conditions. To date it has remained controversial about how to confirm peak identification and to determine signal strength across biological <b>replicates,</b> particularly {{when the number of}} <b>replicates</b> is greater than two. Using objective metrics, we evaluate the consistency of biological <b>replicates</b> in ChIP-seq experiments with more than two <b>replicates.</b> We compare several approaches for binding site determination, including two popular but disparate peak callers, CisGenome and MACS 2. Here we propose read coverage as a quantitative measurement of signal strength for estimating sample concordance. Determining binding based on genomic features, such as promoters, is also examined. We find that increasing the number of biological <b>replicates</b> increases the reliability of peak identification. Critically, binding sites with strong biological evidence may be missed if researchers rely on only two biological <b>replicates.</b> When more than two <b>replicates</b> are performed, a simple majority rule (> 50 % of samples identify a peak) identifies peaks more reliably in all biological <b>replicates</b> than the absolute concordance of peak identification between any two <b>replicates,</b> further demonstrating the utility of increasing <b>replicate</b> numbers in ChIP-seq experiments...|$|R
