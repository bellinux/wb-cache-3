40|$|In recent years, {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} of fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) has been enhanced in various studies by helically coiling the fiber around a support structure. While solid polyvinyl chloride tubes are an appropriate support structure under water, they can produce considerable errors in aerial deployments {{due to the}} radiative heating or cooling. We used meshed <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> as a novel support structure to measure high-resolution vertical temperature profiles with a height of several meters above a meadow and within and above a small lake. This study aimed at quantifying the radiation error for the coiled DTS system and the contribution caused by the novel support structure via heat conduction. A quantitative and comprehensive energy balance model is proposed and tested, which includes the shortwave radiative, longwave radiative, convective, and conductive heat transfers and allows for modeling fiber temperatures as well as quantifying the radiation error. The sensitivity of the energy balance model to the conduction error caused by the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> is {{discussed in terms of}} its albedo, emissivity, and thermal conductivity. Modeled radiation errors amounted to − 1. 0 and 1. 3  K at 2  m height but ranged up to 2. 8  K for very high incoming shortwave radiation (1000  J s − 1  m − 2) and very weak winds (0. 1  m s − 1). After correcting for the radiation error by means of the presented energy balance, the root mean square error between DTS and reference air temperatures from an aspirated resistance thermometer or an ultrasonic anemometer was 0. 42 and 0. 26  K above the meadow and the lake, respectively. Conduction between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> and fiber cable had a small effect on fiber temperatures (<[*] 0. 18  K). Only for locations where the plastic rings that supported the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> touched the fiber-optic cable were significant temperature artifacts of up to 2. 5  K observed. Overall, the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fabric</b> offers several advantages over conventional support structures published to date in the literature as it minimizes both radiation and conduction errors...|$|R

The ES-U 3160 <b>reinforced</b> <b>fabrics</b> with {{toughening}} function {{were prepared}} by carrying the Ex-situ elasticizer polyethersulphone homogeneously on <b>reinforced</b> <b>fabrics</b> according to Ex-situ toughening technology.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{concept of}} placing high {{strength}} linear reinforcements in a soil backfill {{to produce a}} vertical retaining structure is a recent idea that has been applied with success {{at a number of}} locations. Rational procedures have been developed for the design of these structures when the reinforcements consist of long metal straps. In certain situations advantages in construction and economy could be gained by replacing the metal straps with a continuous high strength fabric as reinforcement. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the behavior of a number of <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforced</b> earth models and to determine if the design methods that have been applied to metal strap reinforced earth walls can be applied to <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforced</b> walls. The economic feasibility of <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforced</b> earth walls was also investigated. The results of the model tests indicated that the design of <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforced</b> earth walls using methods developed for metal strap reinforced walls produces conservative results. Further investigation is required to define the actual mechanism involved in <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforced</b> earth walls. The economic analysis indicated that <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforced</b> walls can be competitive with other types of retaining structures for low heights...|$|R

Promising results of simple specimen, has encouraged the research team to perform the next tests using mastered carbon fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>fabric.</b> Main tests were performed on natural scale RC beam.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{explains}} {{a method to}} proceed to the optimization of the milling of pockets {{in order to save}} time during the machining of RTM moulds. Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) is a process for the manufacturing of composite parts. The main idea is to inject a resin into a <b>reinforced</b> <b>fabric</b> made from fibers. Most of the RTM moulds are made up of a cavity, a lid and many inserts filling this cavity. Machining of the cavity is time consuming, especially if parts to be manufactured are big. In order to save time and so, to save money, we propose a method to find the best set of parameters for the machining of a pocket. To reach this goal, we apply an optimization method, called simulated annealing, that takes parameters from a large range of predefined values and computes the related machining time. At the end of the simulation, the algorithm gives us the best combination of tool geometry and machining parameters, according with respect of different predefined constraints (pocket geometry, characteristics of the milling machine and roughness admitted on the final part) ...|$|E
40|$|Natural fibers {{have gained}} {{attention}} in composite making {{since it is}} sustainable, renewable and environmental friendly. However, there are some drawbacks such as low tensile strength, modulus and flexural strength compared to industrial synthetic fibers. Various techniques {{have been used to}} increase the mechanical properties of the reinforced material in order to compete with synthetic fibers. This study is to produce <b>reinforced</b> <b>fabric</b> made from kenaf fibers woven into four different weave patterns. The reason for the use of different weave patterns is to reduce the crimp percentage as it may increase the tensile strength of the fabric. The weave patterns are Twill 4 / 4, Satin 8 / 3 and Basket 4 / 4, while Plain 1 / 1 is used as a benchmark for its tensile strength. The dry fabrics structure with different weave pattern was optimized using a simulation of WiseTex software. The dry fabrics were infused with unsaturated polyester to produce composite panel using vacuum infusion process. The dry fabric and the composites were tested on tensile strength and compared with the Plain 1 / 1 weave pattern. The result shows the breaking strength of dry fabric increased when different weave pattern with low crimp percentage were used compared with Plain 1 / 1. Yet, in composite form there is reduction in tensile strength for Basket 4 / 4 due to changes in the fabric structure making some parts of the composite became weaker. The other weave patterns still retain the trend of increment in tensile strength compared with Plain 1 / 1 weave...|$|E
