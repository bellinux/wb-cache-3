Three main types of <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> found: ...|$|R

5|$|The Hsinchu Station is an oval-shaped {{space with}} a curved {{parallelogram}} roof. It is designed {{to respond to the}} sunlight and winds in Hsinchu. The cladding of the <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> durable stainless steel. It keeps the maintenance easier and enhances the high-tech image. The roof opens up over the platform and rail to avoid a piston effect and the style responds to the local environment. The station has become the new landmark of Hsinchu.|$|E

500|$|The forward conning {{tower was}} {{protected}} with heavy armor: the sides were 300mm thick and the <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> [...] thick. The rear conning tower was less well armored; its sides were only [...] thick and the <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> covered with [...] of armor plate. The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored: the turret sides were [...] thick and the <b>roofs</b> <b>were</b> [...] thick. On Hindenburg, {{the thickness of}} the turret <b>roofs</b> <b>was</b> increased to [...] The 15cm guns had 150mm-worth of armor plating in the casemates; the guns themselves had [...] thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters.|$|R
5|$|The east bay of {{the barn}} {{contains}} an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. The second-floor hayloft {{is supported by the}} two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fully supported by the brick walls. The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as tie rods {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E

5000|$|Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec was {{slated to}} be the first outdoor {{retractable}} roof stadium at its debut for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. However, plagued by construction problems, the <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> not installed until 1987, and was not retractable until 1988. Even then, movement of the <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> impossible in high wind conditions, and technical problems plagued the facility. A permanent, fixed <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> installed in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Roof - The {{complete}} building (room 1, foyer, {{and room}} 2) {{was covered by}} a gable roof that ran east/west. The <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> covered with cedar shakes. The shake <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> later replaced by corrugated metal.|$|R
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses. The design of the <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that in}} the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
50|$|Church <b>roofs</b> have <b>been</b> {{stripped}} {{of the lead}} roof, forcing some into near bankruptcy. Replacing church <b>roofs</b> <b>is</b> prohibitively expensive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{protective}} fireproofing {{continues on}} the top of the kura by forming an inner roof covered in the same way as the walls. The timbers for the outer roof then sit on a fireproof box. The outer <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> used to protect the clay finish from rain. In rural areas this outer <b>roof</b> <b>was</b> often constructed of thatch which would burn off in the event of a fire. However, due to their relatively short lifespan and complexity in replacing, thatch <b>roofs</b> <b>are</b> becoming a rarity. [...] In towns the <b>roofs</b> <b>were</b> usually tiled. To prevent fire from destroying the roof timbers supporting the outer <b>roof,</b> the eaves <b>were</b> sometimes thickened up with the plaster coating and extended to the underside of the tiles.|$|R
