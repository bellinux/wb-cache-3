Then a net will be deployed in the middle part of the boat to temporarily put the live fish for separation. After {{a few minutes the}} crew will then start the segregation of the fish according to type and will be stored in a Styrofoam box with crushed ice.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The "other species" {{management}} {{group has been}} established to account for species which are currently of slight economic value and upon which there is little, if any, directed fishing. However, these species could have economic value in the future, and many are important components of the ecosystem as prey for commercial fish species, marine mammals and birds. Squid is considered separately from the "other species" {{management group}}, which includes sculpins, skates, sharks, and octopus. Smelts {{were removed from the}} "other species" group and moved to the forage fish group beginning in 1999 as a result of fishery management plan (FMP) amendments 36 and 39 to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska groundfish FMPs. Information on the distribution, abundance, and biology of squid stocks in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Aleutian Islands region is limited. The predominate species in commercial catches in the EBS is the <b>red</b> <b>squid,</b> Berryteuthis magister, while O...|$|E
40|$|Although {{boat seines}} have a {{significant}} share in the total fish landings in Greece, there is little information on boat seine fisheries. The present study aims to identify boat seine métiers {{on a national level}} and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} their operation in Greece. We used boat seine landings data collected from a large number of ports in the Aegean and east Ionian Sea between 2002 and 2006. The landings profiles were grouped with a two-step procedure: the first step involved a factorial analysis of the log-transformed landings profiles, and the second step was a classification of the factorial coordinates (hierarchical agglomerative clustering). Six métiers were identified in the Aegean Sea, and three in the Ionian Sea. The ‘picarel-bogue’ métier was the most important in both seas, accounting for 54 % and 88 % of the fishing trips of the sample in the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. Apart from picarel and bogue, other important target species were <b>red</b> mullet, European <b>squid,</b> common pandora, chub mackerel, and European pilchard. Varying spatial (within the Aegean and Ionian Seas) and seasonal patterns were evident for the identified métiers...|$|R
5000|$|The Crim are an extradimensional {{species of}} parasites that have overrun Doc Horror's native world and have arrived here on Earth. They {{resemble}} <b>red</b> octopuses and <b>squid,</b> {{and some have}} wings and various tendrils in all shapes in sizes. They are intelligent, {{and they have the}} ability to secrete a chemical through their bite that allows them to exert control over a person. The amount of control that a Crim can force over a host depends on the individual's constitution: Tony Zampa was influenced by a Crim hatchling, but it appears that Tony was unaware of its presence and its level of control over him may have been more subtle than a direct form of mind-control. Don Lupo, on the other hand, was reduced to a zombified puppet because of his frail health and advanced age. Separation from the Crim beast will immediately free the host of its influence.The Crim are, in Doc Horror's words, [...] "a nasty breed. Difficult to kill." [...] After discovering the Crim's presence on this world, Doc Horror worked on developing special pistol rounds that could affect the creatures: rather than simply inflict impact damage, they used his transdimensional technology to blow pieces of the target back to Horror's black planet. During the raid to rescue Holloween Girl and Komodo in the Black Planet finale, these rounds prove to be especially effective in dealing with the monsters.|$|R
40|$|Several commercially {{important}} {{demersal fish}} stocks for the North Sea fisheries {{are classified as}} “category 11 ” {{in the light of}} the EU policy paper on fisheries management (17 May 2010, COM(2010) 241). For stocks in this category, there is no STECF (Scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries) management advice, due to the unknown status of the stocks. The reason for this is that the data and information available to perform analytical stock assessments are highly uncertain or lacking. This document describes existing data and options for collecting new data for the evaluation of the state of category 11 stocks. We focus on turbot and brill in the North Sea. Existing data from logbooks and the market sampling program can be used to estimate LPUE series used in age-based stock assessment methods, similar to other commercially important flatfish species such as plaice and sole. Landings Per Unit of Effort (LPUE) data of the Dutch beam trawl fleet > 221 kW were standardised for engine power and corrected for targeting behaviour as described below and graphically shown in Figure 3. 2. 1. The methods are similar to those used to analyse commercial LPUE data for North Sea plaice, described in Quirijns and Poos (2010). Landing rates (LPUE) by market category were calculated for the period 2002 - 2010. The corrected LPUE series indicate an increase in commercial LPUE for both species during the period 2002 - 2006. For turbot, the LPUE stays stable in the first five years, increases between 2006 and 2008, and decreases afterwards. The increase in brill LPUE is larger, and occurs throughout the study period. Compared to other commercially important flatfish species relatively few brill and turbot market samples are taken. This reduces the ability to track the cohorts in the LPUE series of the older ages which is a prerequisite for reliable stock assessment estimates. Also, the time series currently spans only 9 years. Collection of additional data may therefore be desirable. Expanding the BTS survey will provide industry independent data and would therefore give easily interpretable results. The option of an industry survey is also a good option if the survey is already being executed for sole and plaice. However, both options are costly. Therefore, the option of increasing the samples of turbot and brill at the auction is relatively easy and relatively inexpensive and therefore at present the most promising. The methods used for this document will not per definition be applicable for all category 11 species. For dab, flounder, lemon sole and tub gurnard, samples at the auctions are taken to collect biological data. For these species it may be possible to raise the data in a similar way as was done in this report to estimate the age composition of the stock. For other species (witch flounder, horse mackerel, silver smelt, <b>red</b> mullet and <b>squid)</b> there is no market sampling. For these species, other methods will have to be developed...|$|R
