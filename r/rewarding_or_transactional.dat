The sample was identified as the student leaders at the University of Johannesburg's Auckland Park Kingsway campus. The sample ultimately included 123 respondents for all the committees in the institution, resulting in a very positive response rate for data analysis. The findings revealed that there was insufficient evidence to support the objective that specific trends exist between leadership effectiveness when considering emotional intelligence or whether emotional intelligences relates more strongly with a transformational <b>or</b> <b>transactional</b> leadership style.

40|$|M. Comm. The {{general purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} and identify whether a potential trend exists between emotional intelligence (EI) and effective leadership. This research will further more assist in determining whether possible trends exist between emotional intelligence and leadership and whether these leaders can be distinguished from others by means of leadership styles. Thus two specific leadership styles are investigated being transformational <b>or</b> <b>transactional.</b> Given the research literature an expectation exists that a statistically significant difference will be found between leadership effectiveness and EI. Leadership effectiveness refers to either transformational <b>or</b> <b>transactional</b> leadership. Insight will also be gained into whether male or female student leaders practice either transformation <b>or</b> <b>transactional</b> leadership styles. The existence of EI is identifiable with the effective leadership style of transformational leadership more than a transactional leadership style. The sample was identified as the student leaders from 14 house committees as approved by the Dean of Students at the University of Johannesburg’s Auckland Park Kingsway campus. Approval to sample the current SRC members for the university was also obtained. The sample ultimately entailed 123 respondents (98. 4 %) of a possible 125 respondents from all the committees in the institution. Two measuring instruments were utilised for the purpose of the study and were set up to test emotional intelligence and leadership. The statistical procedures utilised in the analysis of the data included demographic distributions, factor analyses and t-test. The findings revealed that there was insufficient evidence to support the objective that specific trends exist between emotional intelligence and leadership effectiveness or whether EI relates more strongly with a transformational <b>or</b> <b>transactional</b> leadership style. There were however relevant relationships between female respondents and the transformational leadership style within the specific sample thus supporting a secondary objective of the study...|$|R

40|$|Single-unit {{studies in}} monkeys have {{demonstrated}} that neurons in the prefrontal cortex predict the reward type, <b>reward</b> amount <b>or</b> <b>reward</b> availability associated with a stimulus. To examine contributions of pyramidal cells and interneurons in reward processing, single-unit activity was extracellularly recorded in prefrontal cortices of four monkeys performing a reward prediction task. Based on their shapes of spike waveforms, prefrontal neurons were classified into broad-spike and narrow-spike units that represented putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. We mainly observed that narrow-spike neurons showed higher firing rates but less bursty discharges than did broad-spike neurons. Both narrow-spike and broad-spike cells selectively responded to the stimulus, reward and their interaction, and the proportions of each type of selective neurons were similar between the two cell classes. Moreover, {{the two types of}} cells displayed equal reliability of <b>reward</b> <b>or</b> stimulus discrimination. Furthermore, we found that broad-spike and narrow-spike cells showed distinct mechanisms for encoding <b>reward</b> <b>or</b> stimulus information. Broad-spike neurons raised their firing rate relative to the baseline rate to represent the preferred <b>reward</b> <b>or</b> stimulus information, whereas narrow-spike neurons inhibited their firing rate lower than the baseline rate to encode the non-preferred <b>reward</b> <b>or</b> stimulus information. Our results suggest that narrow-spike and broad-spike cells were equally involved in reward and stimulus processing in the prefrontal cortex. They utilized a binary strategy to complementarily represent <b>reward</b> <b>or</b> stimulus information, which was consistent with the task structure in which the monkeys were required to remember two reward conditions and two visual stimuli...|$|R
