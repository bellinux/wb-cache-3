40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Although equine motorised dental instruments are widely used, {{there is limited}} information on their thermal effect on teeth. The recently described variation in subocclusal secondary dentine depth overlying individual pulp horns may affect heat transmission to the underlying pulps. Objectives: This study compared the effect of 3 different equine motorised dental instruments on the pulpar temperature of equine cheek teeth with and {{without the use of}} water cooling. It also evaluated the effect of subocclusal secondary dentine thickness on pulpar temperature changes. Methods: A thermocouple probe was inserted into the pulp horns of 188 transversely sectioned maxillary cheek teeth with its tip lying subocclusally. Pulpar temperature changes were recorded during and following the continuous use of 3 different equine motorised dental instruments (A, B and C) for sequential time periods, with and without the use of water cooling. Results: Using motorised dental instrument B compared with either A or C increased the likelihood that the critical temperature was reached in pulps by 8. 6 times. Compared with <b>rasping</b> <b>for</b> 30 [*]s, <b>rasping</b> <b>for</b> 45, 60 and 90 [*]s increased the likelihood that the critical temperature would be reached in pulps by 7. 3, 8. 9 and 24. 7 times, respectively. Thicker subocclusal secondary dentine (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 75 /mm) and water cooling (OR = 0. 14) were both protective against the likelihood of the pulp reaching the critical temperature. Conclusions: Prolonged rasping with motorised dental instruments increased the likelihood that a pulp would be heated above the critical temperature. Increased dentinal thickness and water cooling had protective roles in reducing pulpar heating. Potential relevance: Motorised dental instruments have the potential to seriously damage equine pulp if used inappropriately. Higher speed motorised dental instruments should be used for less time and teeth should be water cooled during or immediately after instrument use {{to reduce the risk of}} thermal pulpar damage. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{extension}} of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to support declarative reasoning on consumption and production of resources. We call the proposed extension <b>RASP,</b> standing <b>for</b> “Re-sourced ASP”. Resources are modeled by introducing special atoms, called amount-atoms, to which we associate quantities that represent the avail-able amount of a certain resource. The “firing ” of a RASP-rule involving amount-atoms can both consume and produce resources. A RASP-rule can be fired several times, according to its definition and to the avail-able quantities of required resources. We define the semantics <b>for</b> <b>RASP</b> programs by extending the usual answer set semantics. Different answer sets correspond to different possible allocations of available resources. We then propose an implementation based on standard ASP-solvers. The im-plementation consists of a standard translation of each RASP-rule into a set of plain ASP rules and of an inference engine that manages the firing of RASP-rules. Key words: Answer set programming, non-monotonic logic program...|$|R
30|$|This {{study showed}} that the sheep model is useful to analyze the outcome of {{paediatric}} ACL reconstruction with open growth plates. In terms of risk for growth changes, we identified major differences between femoral and tibial growth plate injuries caused by tunnel drilling. On the tibial side the central positioning of the drill hole in the proximal tibial growth plate appeared to be safe in terms of growth abnormalities. On the femoral side, however, the eccentrically placed femoral tunnel is at risk to injure {{the periphery of the}} growth plate. In the paediatric knee, this may either occur during the drilling procedure, for instance if the posterior wall of the tunnel gets injured (posterior blow-out) or if the surgeon chooses to perform an extraepiphyseal graft placement during which this zone might be <b>rasped</b> <b>for</b> better graft adherence to the bone (Kocher et al. 2002). Injuries of the perichondral structures have shown to be at risk to develop major growth abnormalities due to an asymmetric remaining growth (Koman & Sanders 1999; Robert & Casin 2010; Kocher et al. 2002; Chotel & Seil 2013). In the Ogden classification, they are classified as type VI injuries and correspond to a localized peripheral bone bridge (Ogden 1981).|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{microbial}} cell factory Bacillus subtilis {{is a popular}} industrial platform for high- level production of secreted technical enzymes. Nonetheless, the effective secretion of particular heterologous enzymes remains challenging. Over the past decades various studies have tackled this problem, and major improvements were achieved by optimizing signal peptides or removing proteases involved in product degradation. On the other hand, serious bottlenecks in the protein export process per se remained enigmatic, especially for protein secretion at commercially significant levels by cells grown to high density. The aim of our {{present study was to}} assess the relevance of the intramembrane protease <b>RasP</b> <b>for</b> high- level protein production in B. subtilis. Results: Deletion of the rasP gene resulted in reduced precursor processing and extracellular levels of the overproduced a- amylases AmyE from B. subtilis and AmyL from Bacillus licheniformis. Further, secretion of the overproduced serine protease BPN' from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was severely impaired in the absence of RasP. Importantly, overexpression of rasP resulted in threefold increased production of a serine protease from Bacillus clausii, and 2. 5 - to 10 -fold increased production of an AmyAc alpha-amylase from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus, depending on the culture conditions. Of note, growth defects due to overproduction of the two latter enzymes were suppressed by rasP- overexpression. Conclusion: Here we show that an intramembrane protease, RasP, sets a limit to high- level production of two secreted heterologous enzymes that are difficult to produce in the B. subtilis cell factory. This finding was unexpected and suggests that proteolytic membrane sanitation is key to effective enzyme production in Bacillus...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complement 3 (C 3), a key {{component}} of the innate immune system, is involved in early inflammatory responses. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP; aka C 3 adesArg), a C 3 cleavage product, is produced in adipose tissue and stimulates lipid storage. We hypothesized that, depending on the diet, chronic ASP administration in C 3 (-/-) mice would affect lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity via an adaptive adipose tissue inflammatory response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: C 3 (-/-) mice on normal low fat diet (ND) or high fat diet (HFD) were chronically administered recombinant ASP (<b>rASP)</b> <b>for</b> 25 days via an osmotic mini-pump. While there was no effect on food intake, there was a decrease in activity, with a relative increase in adipose tissue weight on ND, and a shift in adipocyte size distribution. While rASP administration to C 3 (-/-) mice on a ND increased insulin sensitivity, on a HFD, rASP administration had the opposite effect. Specifically, rASP administration in C 3 (-/-) HFD mice resulted in decreased gene expression of IRS 1, GLUT 4, SREBF 1 and NFκB in muscle, and decreased C 5 L 2 but increased JNK, CD 36, CD 11 c, CCR 2 and NFκB gene expression in adipose tissue as well as increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (Rantes, KC, MCP- 1, IL- 6 and G-CSF). In adipose tissue, although IRS 1 and GLUT 4 mRNA were unchanged, insulin response was reduced. CONCLUSION: The effects of chronic rASP administration are tissue and diet specific, rASP administration enhances the HFD induced inflammatory response leading to an insulin-resistant state. These results suggest that, in humans, the increased plasma ASP associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease could be an additional factor directly contributing to development of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} work {{an extension of}} ASP, called <b>RASP</b> (standing <b>for</b> ASP with Resources), has been proposed. RASP supports declarative reasoning on production and consumption of (amounts of) resources. The approach combines stable model semantics with quantitative reasoning and relies on an algebraic structure to support computations and comparisons of amounts. The resulting framework also offered some form of preference reasoning on resources usage. In this paper we go further in this direction by introducing more expressive constructs to support complex preferences specification. The complexity of establishing {{the existence of an}} answer set, in such an enriched framework, is then shown to be NP-complete. A prototypical implementation of RASP has been realized. The tool, named raspberry, consists in a compiler that, given a ground RASP program, produces a pure ASP encoding suitable to be processed by commonly available ASP-solvers...|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} semi-industrial {{system with}} in-line near-infrared reflectance (NIR) for {{the characterization of}} the chemical composition of potatoes was designed and constructed, and its performance was tested. The system consisted of the following subsystems: sample crate manipulator, weighing unit for the gross sample weight, potato washing machines with a washing water recycling system, belt for visual inspection of the potatoes, unit for measuring the underwater weight (UWW), industrial rotary saw blade <b>rasp</b> <b>for</b> pulping the potatoes equipped with a sulfite dosage system for inhibiting enzymatic browning of the pulped potatoes, and industrial NIR system for the measurement of the potato composition. The whole system was controlled and operated by a programmable logic controller and process personal computer system. The system was able to process 12 potato samples per hour. Measurements were done to establish the sample carry-over in the system. The carry-over was proven to be well below the maximum acceptable level of 2 %. The UWW values established with the automatic system corresponded very well with the UWW data obtained by manual weighting. The day-to-day reproducibility of the UWW system was tested with golf balls. These balls have about the same specific gravity and size as potatoes. The day-to-day reproducibility coefficient of variation of the UWW unit was 0. 4 %. As a principle of proof, two tentative partial least squares calibration models, one for the starch concentration {{and one for the}} coagulating protein concentration in the potato samples, were calculated, applying leaving one out cross-validation. Both models were very promising. The by NIR-predicted starch concentrations showed to be at least as good or even better than the by UWW-obtained starch concentrations. The average difference between the by NIR-predicted and the chemically measured starch concentration was 0. 0 ± 0. 3 % (w/w). For the coagulating protein concentration, the average difference between the by NIR-predicted and the chemically measured concentration was 0. 00 ± 0. 06 % (w/w).
