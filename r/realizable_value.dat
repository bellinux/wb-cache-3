For a given positive integer k, 1 ⩽ k ⩽ n − 1, G is k-extendable if for every matching M of size k in G, there exists a perfect matching in G containing all the edges of M. The problem that arises is that of characterizing k-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a necessary condition, in terms of minimum degree, for k-extendable graphs. Further, we determine the set of <b>realizable</b> <b>values</b> for minimum degree of k-extendable graphs.

40|$|We {{describe}} a design methodology for modifying the {{refractive index profile}} of graded-index optical instruments that incorporate singularities or zeros in their refractive index. The process maintains the device performance whilst resulting in graded profiles that are all-dielectric, do not require materials with unrealistic values, and that are impedance matched to the bounding medium. This is achieved by transmuting the singularities (or zeros) using the formalism of transformation optics, but with an additional boundary condition requiring the gradient of the co- ordinate transformation be continuous. This additional boundary condition ensures that the device is impedance matched to the bounding medium when the spatially varying permittivity and permeability profiles are scaled to <b>realizable</b> <b>values.</b> We demonstrate the method in some detail for an Eaton lens, before describing the profiles for an "invisible disc" and "multipole" lenses.

50|$|Net <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> (NRV) is {{a method}} of {{evaluating}} a fixed or current asset's worth when held in inventory, {{in the field of}} accounting. NRV is part of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that apply to valuing inventory, so as to not overstate or understate the value of inventory goods. Net <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> is generally equal to the selling price of the inventory goods less the selling costs (completion and disposal). Therefore, it is expected sales price less selling costs (e.g. repair and disposal costs). NRV prevents overstating or understating of an assets value. NRV is the price cap when using the Lower of Cost or Market Rule.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{possible}} values can represent the market value: the replacement {{cost of the}} inventory, the net <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> (also known as the [...] "ceiling"), and the [...] "floor" [...] (the difference between the net <b>realizable</b> <b>value</b> and the normal profit). In the lower of cost or market approach, companies must determine these three values and find the median of the values. The companies then compare the median value, which is called the designated market value, to the inventory cost that is recorded. The lower of these two values is subsequently reported on the balance sheet. Because the lower of cost or market approach requires companies to use three possible market values, the companies' financial statements {{can be difficult to}} compare.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the motion of a diatomic dipole molecule in crossed magnetic and electric fields shows that according to the old quantum theory there will be spatial quantization practically {{with respect to the}} direction of the magnetic field for experimentally <b>realizable</b> <b>values</b> of the field strengths. As a result of this the old quantum theory definitely requires that the application of a strong magnetic field to a gas such as hydrogen chloride produce a very large change in the dielectric constant of the gas. The theory of the dielectric constant of a diatomic dipole gas according to the new quantum mechanics, on the other hand, requires the dielectric constant not to depend upon the direction characterizing the spatial quantization, so that no effect of a magnetic field would be predicted. The effect is found experimentally not to exist; so that it provides an instance of an apparently unescapable and yet definitely incorrect prediction of the old quantum theory...|$|R

Considering a high Tau of 1 ms, efficiency of a silicon solar cell of the hypothetical case {{is estimated to be}} around 29 %. This is comparable with (detailed balance limit) maximum efficiency of a p-n junction solar cell of 30 %. Value of Tau is varied from 1 second to 20 micro. Heavy doping effects, and <b>realizable</b> <b>values</b> of surface recombination velocities and shadowing, are then considered in succession and their influence on cell efficiency is evaluated and quantified. These practical barriers cause the cell efficiency to reduce from the maximum value of 29 % to the experimentally achieved value of about 19 %. Improvement in open circuit voltage V sub oc is required to achieve cell efficiency greater than 20 %. Increased value of Tau reduces reverse saturation current and, hence, improves V sub oc. Control of surface recombination losses becomes critical at higher V sub oc. Substantial improvement in Tau and considerable reduction in surface recombination velocities is essential to achieve cell efficiencies greater than 20 %...|$|R

40|$|The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) has {{stringent}} {{component alignment}} tolerances {{in order to}} preserve the ultralow emittance of the utilized particle beams. Beam-based alignment techniques have been designed to relax these tolerances to <b>realizable</b> <b>values.</b> In this paper, a scheme is presented that is capable of mitigating besides the effects of static misalignments also dynamic misalignments caused by ground motion. It is based on the well-known dispersion-free steering (DFS) algorithm, with the peculiarity that it can perform its correction during the usual operation (on-line). This is enabled by performing the necessary dispersion measurements by introducing only negligibly small beam energy changes (per mille level). It has been found that this on-line correction becomes sensitive to the imperfections of transverse wakefields and structure tilts. These sensitivities have been studied via analytical models and in simulations and appropriate countermeasures to improve the robustness of the method have been proposed. The correction performance and robustness properties of the improved algorithm have been studied in detail with respect to all relevant static and dynamic imperfections in a realistic scenario. The presented scheme is not only a potentially important operational tool for CLIC, but the findings with respect to robustness properties for different imperfections are of general interest for the application of the dispersion-free steering algorithm...|$|R

The {{following}} (abbreviated) statements represent the main {{results of the}} work: 1. Each of SU(2) representation j yields the different quantum Lagrangian density. As a consequence, theoretical observables depend on representation j {{which can be treated}} as a new phenomenological parameter. 2. Quantum chiral solitons exist and possess asymptotic behaviour consistent with the massive Yukawa field fall. The asymptotic shape and PCAC relation leads to the correct asymptotic equation coinciding with contribution of explicitly broken term. 3. A nucleon and Δ_ 33 -resonance are the only stable states for irreducible representations j= 3 / 2 and j= 2. Unphysical tower of states l_spin =l_isospin is, therefore, terminated by choosing the appropriate SU(2) representations. 4. Higher spin l> 1 / 2 quantum states are not "spherically symmetric". The Hamiltonian density function depends on the polar angle theta. 5. Each of the spin-isospin state yields the different range of <b>realizable</b> <b>values</b> of the parameter e. 6. A very good agreement with experimental data is obtained for axial coupling constant g_A in higher representations of SU(2), the problem being previously unsolved by using various extensions of the model in the fundamental representation of SU(2). 7. The basic quantum Skyrme model provides considerable improvements in nucleon magnetic momenta and, especially, in neutron charge density distribution. Comment: 98 pages, 15 figures.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in string theory have reinforced {{the notion that}} the space of stable supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric string vacua fills out a ``landscape'' whose features are largely unknown. It is then hoped that progress in extracting phenomenological predictions from string theory [...] such as correlations between gauge groups, matter representations, potential values of the cosmological constant, and so forth [...] can be achieved through statistical studies of these vacua. To date, most of the efforts in these directions have focused on Type I vacua. In this note, we present the first results of a statistical study of the heterotic landscape, focusing on more than 10 ^ 5 explicit non-supersymmetric tachyon-free heterotic string vacua and their associated gauge groups and one-loop cosmological constants. Although this study has several important limitations, we find a number of intriguing features which may be relevant for the heterotic landscape as a whole. These features include different probabilities and correlations for different possible gauge groups as functions of the number of orbifold twists. We also find a vast degeneracy amongst non-supersymmetric string models, leading to a severe {{reduction in the number of}} <b>realizable</b> <b>values</b> of the cosmological constant as compared with naive expectations. Finally, we also find strong correlations between cosmological constants and gauge groups which suggest that heterotic string models with extremely small cosmological constants are overwhelmingly more likely to exhibit the Standard-Model gauge group at the string scale than any of its grand-unified extensions. In all cases, heterotic worldsheet symmetries such as modular invariance provide important constraints that do not appear in corresponding studies of Type I vacua.

An S-n-distance-dominating set in G is a set D s;:; V(G) such that each vertex in S is n-distance-dominated by a vertex in D. The size of a smallest S-n-dominating set in G is denoted by I'n(S, G). If S satisfies I'n(S, G) = I'n(G), then S is called an n-distance-domination-forcing set of G, and the cardinality of a smallest n-distance-domination-forcing set of G is denoted by On(G). We investigate the value of On(G) for various graphs G, and we characterize graphs G for which On(G) achieves its lowest value, namely, I'n(G), and, for n = 1, its highest value, namely, p(G). A corresponding parameter, 1](G), defined by replacing the concept of n-distance-domination of vertices (above) by the concept of the covering of edges is also investigated. For k E {a, 1, [...] .,rad(G) }, the set S {{is said to be a}} k-radius-forcing set if, for each v E V(G), there exists Vi E S with dG(v, Vi) ~ k. The cardinality of a smallest k-radius-forcing set of G is called the k-radius-forcing number of G and is denot-ed by Pk(G).

Such systems can have computational advantages as they require only the numerical evaluation of first derivatives. One hierarchy of moment closures which seem to have many desirable mathematical properties are those which assume the distribution function is always that which maximizes entropy for a given finite set of velocity moments.

Simulations may converge to a good solution if the true parameters are used as starting values for the nonlinear search of the minimum of the negative log likelihood. From <b>realizable</b> starting <b>values,</b> the convergence to a continuous-time model with an accurate spectrum is rare if more than three parameters have to be estimated. A discrete-time spectral esti-mator that applies a new algorithm for automatic equidistant missing-data analysis to irregularly spaced data is introduced. This requires equidistant resampling of the data. A slotted near-est neighbor (NN) resampling method replaces a true irregular observation time instant by the nearest equidistant resampling time point {{if and only if}} the distance to the true time is within half the slot width.
