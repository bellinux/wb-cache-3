Dry white {{wines are}} made {{throughout}} the region, using the <b>regional</b> <b>appellation</b> Bordeaux Blanc, often from 100% Sauvignon blanc or a blend dominated by Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. The Bordeaux Blanc AOC {{is used for}} wines made in appellations that only allow red wines. Dry whites from Graves are the most well-known {{and it is the}} only subregion with a classification for dry white wines. The better versions tend to have a significant oak influence. In 2007, 7.8% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.|$|E
25|$|Sweet white wines. In several {{locations}} and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine {{is made from}} Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by noble rot. The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and {{where some of the}} world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighboring Sauternes, {{on both sides of the}} Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The <b>regional</b> <b>appellation</b> for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Supérieur Blanc. In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.|$|E

50|$|In the Bordeaux wine region {{there are}} seven <b>regional</b> <b>Appellations</b> dorigine contrôlée (AOCs) {{that may be used}} {{throughout}} the Gironde department. These are Bordeaux Rouge AOC, Bordeaux Supérieur Rouge, Bordeaux Clairet, Bordeaux Rosé, Bordeaux Blanc, a dry white, Bordeaux Supérieur Blanc, a sweet white, and Crémant de Bordeaux, a sparkling méthode traditionnelle wine. The <b>regional</b> <b>appellations</b> together form the largest world-class wine vineyard, making up {{more than half of the}} production of the prestigious Bordeaux wine region. and representing more than 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.|$|R
50|$|In addition, two <b>regional</b> <b>appellations</b> {{have been}} created: Niagara Escarpment for the bench area west of St Catharines (Short Hills Bench, Twenty Mile Bench, Beamsville Bench) and Niagara-on-the-Lake {{for the four}} sub-appellations east of St Catharines.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are eight}} AOCs {{that cover the}} entire {{department}} of Gironde. [...] Any producer within the region is entitled to use these appellations, {{whether or not they}} are also entitled to use a more specific <b>regional</b> <b>appellation.</b> [...] These appellations are: Bordeaux, Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux Sec, Bordeaux Moelleux, Bordeaux Clairet, Crémant-de-Bordeaux, Bordeaux Rosé and Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique. Where these appellations are used for wines which would otherwise be entitled to use a more specific appellation, they are generally used for wines of lower quality made by a négociant or co-operative. Many of Bordeaux's supermarket brands like Mouton Cadet, Dourthe Numero 1 and Sichel Sirius utilise these generic Bordeaux AOCs. [...] More than half of Bordeaux's production uses these generic appellations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} Roman period, as the empire came under {{pressure}} from many such [...] "barbarian" [...] peoples, a powerful group of Burgundians and other Vandalic tribes moved westwards towards the Roman frontiers along the Rhine Valley, making them neighbors of the Franks who formed their kingdoms to the north, and the Suebic Alemanni who were settling to their south, also near the Rhine. They established themselves in Worms, but with Roman cooperation their descendants eventually established the Kingdom of the Burgundians much further south, and within the empire, in the western Alps region where modern Switzerland, France and Italy meet. This later became {{a component of the}} Frankish empire. The name of this Kingdom survives in the <b>regional</b> <b>appellation,</b> Burgundy, which is a region in modern France, representing only a part of that kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of the Douro wine company was {{to respond to the}} [...] "scandal" [...] and wine frauds that contributed to the overall {{depression}} in sales and pricing of Port wine. Uninhibited and reckless blending of inferior wine and foreign ingredients contributed to many substandard examples of Port flooding the London market. To reestablish the reputation of Port, the Douro Wine Company first delineated the exact boundaries of Douro and dictating what areas could and could not produce Port. Under the guidance of Pombal, they specified the areas the contained predominately schistous soil along the Douro river and its tributaries. This distinguished the areas from the outcrops of granite that flanked the region and produced Port wine grapes of lesser quality. Pombal also specified this delineation to ensure that grapes were not planted where corn itself needed to be produced, which was a sorely needed food crop. This delineation essentially made the Douro the world's first <b>regional</b> <b>appellation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Douro Wine Company (also {{known as}} the General Company of Agriculture of the Wines of the Upper Douro and in Portuguese Companhia Geral da Agricultura e Vinhos do Alto Douro) was a {{government}} oversight organization established by the Portuguese Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal to regulate the trade and production of Port wine. Established in 1756, {{one of the first}} official duties of the company was the delineation of the boundaries of the Douro wine region. This act essentially made the Douro the world's first <b>regional</b> <b>appellation.</b> While the boundaries of the Chianti and Tokaji wine regions were outlined in 1716 and 1737, respectively, neither of these regions were [...] "technically" [...] appellations in the sense of being subjected to continued government control and regulations. Under their charter, Pombal invested an immense amount of control in the Douro Wine Company to regulate all exports of Port, set production quantities limits, fix maximum and minimum prices for grapes and to serve as sole arbitrator in any disputes between vine growers and Port shippers. In 1761, the company was further granted a monopoly on the sale of brandy which was used in the fortification process of Port winemaking. The Douro Wine Company continued to operate to 1833 (and was briefly revived from 1843 and 1853). Today, many of it functions have been deregulated with the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto or (Port and Douro Wines Institute) being the official regulating body of Port wine and Douro table wine production.|$|E

2500|$|Burgundy has {{a higher}} number of [...] (AOCs) than any other French region, and is often seen as the most -conscious of the French wine regions.

25|$|Red Bordeaux and Red Bordeaux Supérieur. Bordeaux winemakers {{may use the}} two <b>regional</b> <b>appellations</b> {{throughout}} the entire wine region, however {{approximately half of the}} Bordeaux vineyard is specifically designated under Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOCs. With the majority of châteaux located on the Right Bank in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, wines are typically Merlot-dominant, often blended with the other classic Bordeaux varieties. There are many small, family-run châteaux, as well as wines blended and sold by wine merchants under commercial brand names. The Bordeaux AOC wines tend to be fruity, with minimal influence of oak, and are produced in a style meant to be drunk young. Bordeaux Superieur AOC wines are produced in the same area, but must follow stricter controls, such as lower yields, and are often aged in oak. For the past 10 years, there has been strong, ongoing investment by the winemakers in both the vineyards and in the cellar, resulting in ever increasing quality. New reforms for the <b>regional</b> <b>appellations</b> were instituted in 2008 by the Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur Winemakers' Association. In 2010, 55% of all Bordeaux wines sold in the world were from Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOCs, with 67% sold in France and 33% exported (+9%), representing 14 bottles consumed per second.|$|R

40|$|Very {{different}} commodity chains {{had been}} established over the centuries in France to produce and sell wines as diverse as champagne, fine old clarets, or ordinary table wines. The major shortages caused by the vine disease phylloxera after 1875 forced merchants to search for new sources of supply, often in foreign countries or through the production of artificial wines. When domestic production revived, however, the recovery was not accompanied by a noticeable reduction in these new supplies, {{with the result that}} prices, as well as growers' profitability, fell sharply {{after the turn of the}} twentieth century, strengthening the merchants' power in the various commodity chains. To overcome this situation, growers in three very different wine-producing areas, namely the Midi, Bordeaux, and Champagne, used their political influence to achieve government intervention in order to control fraud and establish <b>regional</b> <b>appellations</b> or producer cooperatives, which helped them win back some of their market power from merchants. ...|$|R

40|$|Research {{studies have}} proven that place-based/regional {{branding}} methods {{have a positive}} effect on brand equity and economic benefits for companies. However, very small or specific regions may be confusing to consumers, so conjunctive labeling â or the process of advertising both a larger region and the sub-region of origin for a product â is suggested as a remedy for this situation. This study analyzes the impact of conjunctive labeling by comparing two national samples of consumers, before and two years after, conjunctive wine labeling was introduced in Sonoma County. The results show a higher awareness for both Sonoma County and its sub appellations (AVAs) after conjunctive labeling was introduced than before.
