5000|$|A {{scion of}} the Italian Binda Group dynasty, {{best known for}} making Breil watches, Carlo Crocco left the company in 1976 to strike {{out on his own}} and create a new watch company. Moving to Switzerland he formed MDM Geneve and set about {{designing}} a watch that he named the Hublot after the French word for [...] "porthole". The watch that he created featured the first natural <b>rubber</b> <b>strap</b> in the history of watchmaking. It took 3 years of research to create the strap. Despite failing to attract a single potential customer {{on the first day of}} its debut at the 1980 Basel Watch Fair, the watch quickly proved to be a commercial success with sales in excess of $2m in its first year. In 1993 a watch made by Hublot in the Geneve collection called Vendome (582888) with the now iconic <b>rubber</b> <b>strap</b> which although it is extreamally rare to see a picture of this watch but a as well as the <b>rubber</b> <b>strap</b> it was one of very few watches to be imprinted with the 582888 on the back of the watch and not to have the print on the internal workings instead have plain workings with a plastic intern ,this watch was due to be the more affordable watch which at that time retailed for $5000. This was the first and last time the affordable Vendome 282888 was produced and only 700 where made [...] However due to the vendome being so difficult to track down the watch will now sell for anything from $10000 -$18000 if it ever came onto the open market making the [...] "affordable" [...] watch no longer so affordable.|$|E

40|$|This study first {{shows how}} spatial ability {{develops}} {{in children who}} are visually impaired and blind and then suggests the use of bungee training as an intervention technique that ap-plies the development theory to be used for these children. Some of the studies conducted on visually impaired children indicate that the range of space sensed by these children is smaller than that sensed by sighted children. This is due to the fact that visually impaired children, who cannot use the visual sense as a long-range sensor, are unable to educe in-variant structure of distant objects. These children understand their environment through other senses such as sense of touch, hearing and motion; however, it is not easy for these children to understand space by use of these senses alone since they cannot provide the chil-dren with spatial experience equivalent to that given by visual image. For this reason, it is desirable that visually impaired children are given opportunities to experience wider range of space at the earlier stages of their development through their early education. Yamamoto (2000 a) took an approach of bungee training. The experiment, which used a long <b>rubber</b> <b>strap</b> with its one end attached to a child's body and the other end to an object, demonstrated that the child, who moved around an object in this state, could experienc...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Non-invasive {{navigation}} {{techniques have}} recently been developed to determine mechanical femorotibial alignment (MFTA) in extension. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of an image-free navigation system with new software designed to provide multiple kinematic measurements of the knee. The secondary aim was to test two types of strap material used to attach optical trackers to the lower limb. Methods: Seventy-two registrations were carried out on 6 intact embalmed cadaveric specimens (mean age: 77. 8 [*]±[*] 12 years). A validated fabric strap, bone screws and novel <b>rubber</b> <b>strap</b> were used to secure the passive tracker baseplate for four full experiments with each knee. The MFTA angle was measured under the conditions of no applied stress, valgus stress, and varus stress. These measurements were carried out at full extension and at 30 °, 40 °, 50 ° and 60 ° of flexion. Intraclass correlation coefficients, repeatability coefficients, and limits of agreement (LOA) were used to convey precision and agreement in measuring MFTA with respect to each of the independent variables, i. e., degree of flexion, applied coronal stress, and method of tracker fixation. Based on the current literature, a repeatability coefficient and LOA of ≤ 3 ° were deemed acceptable. Results: The mean fixed flexion for the 6 specimens was 12. 8 ° (range: 6 – 20 °). The mean repeatability coefficient measuring MFTA in extension with screws or fabric strapping of the baseplate was &# 8804; 2 °, compared to 2. 3 ° using rubber strapping. When flexing the knee, MFTA measurements taken using screws or fabric straps remained precise (repeatability coefficient &# 8804; 3 °) throughout the tested range of flexion (12. 8 – 60 °); however, using rubber straps, the repeatability coefficient was &# 62; 3 ° beyond 50 ° flexion. In general, applying a varus/valgus stress while measuring MFTA decreased precision beyond 40 ° flexion. Using fabric strapping, excellent repeatability (coefficient &# 8804; 2 °) was observed until 40 ° flexion; however, beyond 50 ° flexion, the repeatability coefficient was &# 62; 3 °. As was the case with precision, agreement between the invasive and non-invasive systems was satisfactory in extension and worsened with flexion. Mean limits of agreement between the invasive and non-invasive system using fabric strapping to assess MFTA were 3 ° (range: 2. 3 – 3. 8 °) with no stress applied and 3. 9 ° (range: 2. 8 – 5. 2 °) with varus and valgus stress. Using rubber strapping, the corresponding values were 4. 4 ° (range: 2. 8 – 8. 5 °) with no stress applied, 5. 5 ° (range: 3. 3 – 9. 0 °) with varus stress, and 5. 6 ° (range: 3. 3 – 11. 9 °) with valgus stress. Discussion: Acceptable precision and accuracy may be possible when measuring knee kinematics in early flexion using a non-invasive system; however, we do not believe passive trackers should be mounted with rubber strapping such as was used in this study. Flexing the knee appears to decrease the precision and accuracy of the system. The functions of this new software using image-free navigation technology have many potential clinical applications, including assessment of bony and soft tissue deformity, pre-operative planning, and post-operative evaluation, as well as in further pure research comparing kinematics of the normal and pathological knee...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{reflection}} technique is a non-invasive method of measuring vocal tract anatomy. It {{is useful in}} studying a number of conditions including sleep apnea and speech disorders. Current studies at the Vocal Tract Lab of the University of Wisconsin seek to compare acoustic {{reflection technique}} data with information from medical imaging studies.

50|$|Open heel fins are {{secured to}} the foot by a strap which passes {{around the back of}} the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used <b>rubber</b> <b>straps</b> {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include stainless steel spring straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed. Some heel straps have a loop for better grip with wet hands or gloves.Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer's legs. They are much like full foot pocket fins without the back part of the sole, but do not trap as much sand when used in the surf.|$|R
50|$|A {{dust mask}} is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or <b>rubber</b> <b>straps</b> to protect against dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A dust mask can also be worn to protect against allergens. A dust mask is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each protect against specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust masks with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even masks that do not protect against dust at all, such as paint masks and surgical masks. Misfitting masks are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the mask entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to protect against splattering liquids or mists. Dust masks are manufactured to protect against only certain dangers, and do not protect against chemicals such as vapors and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust masks with paint masks.|$|R
