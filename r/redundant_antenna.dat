40|$|Recent {{advances}} in modern manufacturing industries {{have created a}} great need to track and identify objects and parts by obtaining real-time information. One of the main technologies which has been utilized for this need is the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system. As a result of adopting this technology to the manufacturing industry environment, RFID Network Planning (RNP) has become a challenge. Mainly RNP deals with calculating the number and position of antennas which should be deployed in the RFID network to achieve full coverage of the tags {{that need to be}} read. The ultimate goal {{of this paper is to}} present and evaluate a way of modelling and optimizing nonlinear RNP problems utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This effort has led the author to propose a novel AI algorithm, which has been named “hybrid AI optimization technique,” to perform optimization of RNP as a hard learning problem. The proposed algorithm is composed of two different optimization algorithms: <b>Redundant</b> <b>Antenna</b> Elimination (RAE) and Ring Probabilistic Logic Neural Networks (RPLNN). The proposed hybrid paradigm has been explored using a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), and results have been compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed architecture successfully...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Radio {{emission}} from density plasma can {{be detected}} at low radio frequencies. An image of such plasma clouds of the entire inner interplanetary space is always a wanted input for space weather forecast and ICME propagation studies. To take such an image within the ecliptic plane may not fully explore what is happening around the Sun {{not only because of}} the blockage of the Sun, also because most of the ICMEs are propagating in the low-latitude of the Sun, near the ecliptic plane. It is then proposed to launch a solar polar orbit radio telescope to acquire high density plasma cloud images from the entire inner interplanetary space. Low radio frequency images require a large antenna aperture in space. It is, therefore, proposed to use the existing passive synthetic aperture radiometer technology to reduce mass and complicity of the deployment system of the big antenna. In order to reduce the mass of the antenna by using minimum number of elements, a zero <b>redundant</b> <b>antenna</b> element design can be used with a rotating time-shared sampling system. A preliminary assessment study shows the mission is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} {{identification is}} a developing technology that {{has recently been}} adopted in industrial applications for identification and tracking operations. The radio frequency identification network planning problem deals with many criteria like number and positions of the deployed antennas in the networks, transmitted power of antennas, and coverage of network. All these criteria must satisfy a set of objectives, such as load balance, economic efficiency, and interference, {{in order to obtain}} accurate and reliable network planning. Achieving the best solution for radio frequency identification network planning has been an area of great interest for many scientists. This article introduces the Ring Probabilistic Logic Neuron as a time-efficient and accurate algorithm to deal with the radio frequency identification network planning problem. To achieve the best results, <b>redundant</b> <b>antenna</b> elimination algorithm is used in addition to the proposed optimization techniques. The aim of proposed algorithm is to solve the radio frequency identification network planning problem and to design a cost-effective radio frequency identification network by minimizing the number of embedded radio frequency identification antennas in the network, minimizing collision of antennas, and maximizing coverage area of the objects. The proposed solution is compared with the evolutionary algorithms, namely genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The simulation results show that the Ring Probabilistic Logic Neuron algorithm obtains a far more superior solution for radio frequency identification network planning problem when compared to genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization...|$|E
5000|$|The signals {{which are}} present in the rail are {{detected}} by antennas mounted underneath the front airdam of TGV trains, approximately 1 metre (3 ft) forward of the front axle. These antennas work by inductively coupling to the AC signal shunted between the rails by the first axle. There are four <b>redundant</b> <b>antennas</b> per train, two at each end. Only the two at the [...] "front" [...] of the train (in the direction of travel) are used. The signal from the track circuit is filtered, conditioned, and decoded on board the train by two redundant digital signal processors.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} digital services demand, performance and power-efficiency become vital requirements for digital circuits and systems. However, the enabling CMOS technology scaling has been facing significant challenges of device uncertainties, such as process, voltage, and temperature variations. To ensure system reliability, worst-case corner assumptions are usually made in each design level. However, the over-pessimistic worst-case margin leads to unnecessary power waste and performance loss {{as high as}} 2. 2 x. Since optimizations are traditionally confined to each specific level, those safe margins can hardly be properly exploited. To tackle the challenge, it is therefore advised in this Ph. D. thesis to perform a cross-layer optimization for digital signal processing circuits and systems, to achieve a global balance of power consumption and output quality. To conclude, the traditional over-pessimistic worst-case approach leads to huge power waste. In contrast, the adaptive voltage scaling approach saves power (25 % for the CORDIC application) by providing a just-needed supply voltage. The power saving is maximized (46 % for CORDIC) when a more aggressive voltage over-scaling scheme is applied. These sparsely occurred circuit errors produced by aggressive voltage over-scaling are mitigated by higher level error resilient designs. For functions like FFT and CORDIC, smart error mitigation schemes were proposed to enhance reliability (soft-errors and timing-errors, respectively). Applications like Massive MIMO systems are robust against lower level errors, thanks to the intrinsically <b>redundant</b> <b>antennas.</b> This property makes it applicable to embrace digital hardware that trades quality for power savings.

50|$|SDO down-links science data (K band) {{from its}} two onboard high-gain antennas, and {{telemetry}} (S-band) from its two onboard omnidirectional antennas. The ground station {{consists of two}} dedicated (<b>redundant)</b> 18-meter radio <b>antennas</b> in White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, constructed specifically for SDO. Mission controllers operate the spacecraft remotely from the Mission Operations Center at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The combined data rate is about 130 Mbit/s (150 Mbit/s with overhead, or 300 Msymbols/s with rate 1/2 convolutional encoding), and the craft generates approximately 1.5 terabytes of data per day (equivalent to downloading around 500,000 songs).|$|R
40|$|A fast, {{accurate}} and stable two-dimensional sampling interpolation algorithm is developed {{to reconstruct the}} electromagnetic field radiated on a sphere in the antenna near-field region. Its analytical foundation relies on the recent theoretical results concerning the nonredundant field representations on curves and surfaces. The use of an ellipsoid (prolate or oblate) as modelling of the source allows one {{to reduce the number}} of required samples with respect to the spherical source modelling that, although more general, becomes <b>redundant</b> when considering <b>antennas</b> having one or two predominant dimensions. The obtained results are properly used to get ready an effective near-field-far-field transformation technique with spherical scanning, which requires a minimum number of data, thus reducing significantly the memory storage requirements and measurement time. Numerical examples assess the efficiency and the stability of the reconstruction process...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{has played}} a leading role in radio {{astronomy}} in Africa with the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO). It continues to make strides with the current seven-dish MeerKAT precursor array (KAT- 7), leading to the 64 -dish MeerKAT and the giant Square Kilometer Array (SKA), which will be used for transformational radio astronomy research. Ghana, an African partner to the SKA, has been mentored by South Africa {{over the past six years}} and will soon emerge in the field of radio astronomy. The country will soon have a science-quality 32 m dish converted from a <b>redundant</b> satellite communication <b>antenna.</b> Initially, it will be fitted with 5 GHz and 6. 7 GHz receivers to be followed later by a 1. 4 - 1. 7 GHz receiver. The telescope is being designed for use as a single dish observatory and for participation in the developing African Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network (AVN) and the European VLBI Network. Ghana is earmarked to host a remote station during a possible SKA Phase 2. The location of the country on 5 degree north of the Equator gives it the distinct advantage of viewing the entire plane of the Milky Way galaxy and nearly the whole sky. In this article, we present the case of Ghana in the radio astronomy scene and the science/technology that will soon be carried out by engineers and astronomers.
