40|$|Handbook of <b>Reliability,</b> <b>Availability,</b> <b>Maintainability</b> <b>and</b> Safety in Engineering Design {{studies the}} {{combination}} of various methods of designing for <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability,</b> <b>maintainability</b> <b>and</b> safety, {{as well as the}} latest techniques in probability and possibility modelling, mathematical algorithmic modelling, evolutionary algorithmic modelling, symbolic logic modelling, artificial intelligence modelling and object-oriented computer modelling, in a logically structured approach to determining the integrity of engineering design. Handbook of <b>Reliability,</b> <b>Availability,</b> <b>Maintainability</b> <b>and</b> Safety in Engineering Design not only encompasses a depth of research into engineering design methods and techniques ranging from quantitative probability theory and expert judgement in Bayesian analysis to qualitative possibility theory, fuzzy logic and uncertainty in Markov analysis; from reliability block diagrams, fault trees, event trees and cause-consequence diagrams to Petri nets, genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks; but it also covers a breadth of research into the concept of integrity in engineering design. Such breadth of research is represented by the inclusion of the topics of <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> performance, <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability,</b> <b>and</b> safety and risk, in an overall concept of designing for integrity during the different phases of the engineering design process.

50|$|Though the {{performance}} of APGenCo thermal power stations in terms of <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability</b> (RAM analysis) {{is one of the}} best in India, its hydro power stations performance is not satisfactory as they break down frequently or not in working condition when required to perform at full capacity during the short period (four months) monsoon season. The thermal efficiency (heat rate) of thermal power stations is not satisfactory to attain close to the rated / design values which is deciding parameter in the competitive electricity market (buyers market) whereas the fuel (coal) is costly in sellers market. Operating the thermal power stations in the range of 75 to 100% capacity in 'frequency follow mode' with good part load efficiency is the needful strategy in surplus electricity grid except during peak demand hours. Also Hydro power stations should perform well meeting all the functions such as power factor correction, peaking power generation, pumping water in pump mode and secondary power generation during monsoon season utilising total available water. This can be achieved by maintaining hydro power stations at availability more than 95%.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{a lack of}} {{interpretation}} tools and methodologies hinders the ability to assess {{the performance of a}} single piece of equipment or a total system. Therefore, a <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability</b> analysis must be combined with a quantitative reliability impact analysis to interpret the actual performance and identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities. This article proposes a novel methodology that uses <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability</b> analysis to quantify the expected impact. The strengths of the failure expected impact methodology include its ability to systematically and quantitatively assess the expected impact in terms of <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability</b> indicators and the logical configuration of subsystems and individual equipment, which show the direct effects of each element on the total system. This proposed analysis complements plant modeling and analysis. Determining the operational effectiveness impact, as the final result of the computation process, enables the quantitative and unequivocal prioritization of the system elements by assessing the associated loss as a â€˜â€˜production lossâ€™â€™ regarding its unavailability and effect on the system process. The Chilean copper smelting process study provides useful results for developing a hierarchization that enables an analysis of improvement actions that are aligned with the best opportunities...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presented}} {{the challenges of}} building systems with certain non-functional performability requirements (performance, <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability).</b> Several case studies are presented to illustrate the performability paradigms, particularly the performance, reliability and availability, maintainability, and budgeting. The paper presents a framework, which shows that the art of software engineering for non-functional requirements can be engineered in a rather systematic manner. The author has used the presented framework to work out several cases, to achieve significant improvements in performance, <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintainability.</b> The performance of intermodulation interference system (Intermode 60) achieved {{an order of magnitude}} speed improvement. The availability of the data mining system achieved more than four NINES availability through the utilization of diverse languages and environment, and adaptive algorithms for dynamic maintenance of the massive database system. Finally, the paper shows that achieving the required performability parameters is human centric and depends on the integration of diverse skills of engineers, and the sense of art embodied by those engineers.|$|E

The functional safety approach provides a structured method for achieving these requirements. In particular, the new IEC 61508 standards give guidance for system design and an effective and safe system exploitation. When designing new systems, it also sets out a generic approach for all the safety lifecycle activities that are the base for a total quality approach: requirements, design, realization, installation, operation, maintenance and even the decommissioning. This paper gives the results of the first attempts made at the CERN Technical Service division (ST) to use these standards and gives some suggestions on how to improve functional safety in a particle accelerator environment. ...|$|R
