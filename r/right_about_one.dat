Two lifeboats and two rafts were lowered into the water and later, another lifeboat was in the water with the remainder of the crew.

By {{far and away the}} most intensively popular section is the set of long articles, twice as popular as its nearest rival. Almost 42 % of all respondents (542 in all) call it their favourite section. A further 124 (13 %) vote for it as their second or third favourite. The news in brief section is next, with 273 (21 %) of respondents calling it favourite, and 29 % their second or third favourite. The third most popular section is on publications, the favourite of 208 respondents, and the second or third favourite of a strong 58 % of all respondents. What do you want? Most respondents want to expand sections, in the order of long articles, news, publications and Viewpoint. Should anything be shortened? An emphatic two-thirds of the 842 respondents to this question says No!, although each section is offered up for some shortening by about 7 % of respondents. Size and frequency count too! This desire for expansion is not reflected in many respondents opinions about size and frequency. A strong 73 % of readers think that publishing Spore every two months is just right. Almost 70 % think that the size is right, but a significant minority of almost 30 % want it to be longer, usually 20 or 24 pages. This message of Keep It As It Is, but Pack More In! continues with readers judgement about Spore s content. A total of 82 % think that the balance is just <b>right.</b> <b>About</b> <b>one</b> in 20 readers thinks that the content is too technical, or too varied, or too superficial. Only one in 50 thinks that it is too political. Clearer perspective on topics More than one in four respondents wanted more coverage of livestock issues, and one in five on information and communication. One in six wanted more features on general agricultural techniques, and on crop cultivation and protection. Less than one in fifteen wanted more information on water and soil management, on macro-policies, and on organisation and finance. One in thirty wanted more coverage of gender issues. The full list of desired topics is in the full report of the survey. In addition to topics, there is a question of tone. Several readers wrote at length about Spore s moral authority too, suggesting that coverage of taboo subjects such as AIDS would be respected by younger members of the community. This would take Spore outside of its original mandate, but the fact that such comments have been made merely serves to underline the regard in which the magazine is held. Currently, Spore has six sections, across 16 pages: Long articles: (five pages) three articles on general policies and trends News in brief: (four pages) thirty short articles on plants, animals, research, networks, events, market information Links: (one page) in-depth looks at resource organisations Publications: (three pages) reviews of books and multi-media Between Us: (two pages) a readers Mailbox, plus CTA s institutional news Viewpoint: (one page) from a reader Esporo has an extra section for more news from Portuguese-speaking countries.

40|$|Last {{week in the}} Australian, Janet Albrechtsen {{argued that}} {{overseas}} experience demonstrated that adopting a Bill of Rights for Australia was unwise. Simon Evans responds to the errors in her analysis of the overseas experience. JANET ALBRECHTSEN is <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> thing. Just about the worst argument for an Australian Bill of Rights is that every other Western democracy has one. But she misunderstands some key points about how modern Bills of Rights, like the British Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights, actually work. As a result, her jeremiad against an Australian Bill of Rights is built on shaky foundations. An Australian Bill of Rights {{might not be a}} good idea, but not for the reasons that Albrechtsen gives. Old-fashioned Bills of Rights, like the United States Bill, give the final say about rights to the courts. If the Supreme Court says that a law or some government action violates the Bill of Rights then that’s the end of the story. The law or government action is invalid. There’s nothing Congress can do except try to amend the Constitution. Modern Bills of Rights are different. Their framers have learnt the lessons of the United States experience. As Albrechtsen points out, when interpreting the Bill of Rights, US judges make policy decisions that should properly be made in congress. Not only do they make policy decisions, they get the final word. In Canada and the UK, the courts don’t get the final word. The Canadian Charter of Rights has a specific mechanism that allows parliament to legislate ‘notwithstanding’ the rights contained in the Charter. The Canadian courts can strike down laws that in their view are inconsistent with the charter. But parliament can respond and take a different view what the rights contained in the Charter mean or what limits need to be placed on them in a democractic society. In the UK, the courts can’t even strike down laws that in their view are inconsistent with the Human Rights Act. They can declare that in their view that laws are inconsistent with the act. But that doesn’t affect the validity or operation of the law. In both countries, the courts will try to interpret laws so that they are consistent with human rights. Our own courts do that already. Sometimes that means that courts interpret laws more narrowly than governments may wish. But in Canada and the UK, just as in Australia, governments have the means to respond if they disagree. They can say to the courts that their interpretation of what human rights require is wrong. Or they can amend their laws to respond to some of the criticisms made by the courts. That’s what’s happening in the UK at the moment in relation to deportation of ‘preachers of hate’, although Tony Blair does seem to want to wind back the Human Rights Act rather than legislate within its framework. Equally, Canadian legislatures may respond to the private health insurance ruling by reinstating the existing system or (more likely and perhaps better policy) improving it in light of the problems brought out by the Supreme Court’s ruling. It might be convenient for politicians to describe this as a battle for supremacy with the courts. But it’s nothing of the sort. It’s the natural operation of a system, fundamentally different from the United States system, in which parliaments and courts have distinct and complementary contributions to make in relation to rights. Parliaments have democratic legitimacy and policy making expertise. But they can’t predict the future and every possible ramification of the laws they enact. Courts look backwards and see how laws have affected the human rights of particular individuals. This dynamic relationship between parliaments and courts in the UK and Canadian models - sometimes but controversially described as a dialogue - draws on the strengths of both institutions to protect human rights, enhancing and not undermining democracy. If any more Australian jurisdictions do adopt Bills of Rights, it is almost inevitable that they will follow the UK or perhaps the Canadian model. They will not give Australian courts the unbridled power or the direct political role of the United States courts. Parliaments will retain the final say. They will continue the existing practice of Australian courts in interpreting laws consistently with human rights. But they will give them an explicit and democratically established framework for doing so. And they will provide a framework for parliaments and courts together to develop an understanding of what human rights require in the Australian context. • Simon Evans is Director of the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at the University of Melbourne Photo: Mark Hurlburt/ iStockphoto. co...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Fungal {{infection}} of the paranasal sinuses is an increasingly recognized entity both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Treatment has been via use of either surgical or medical modalities, {{or a combination of}} the two. Here, we present a case of utilization of intra-antral application of an anti-fungal agent in the management of recurrent fungal sinusitis in an indigent Nigerian patient. Case presentation We present the case of a 30 -year-old West African Yoruba man, an indigent Nigerian clergyman, who presented to our facility with a history of recurrent nasal discharge (<b>about</b> <b>one</b> year), recurrent nasal blockage (about five months), and <b>right</b> facial swelling (<b>about</b> <b>one</b> week). After intra-nasal antrostomy for debulking with a systemic anti-fungal agent, our patient had a recurrence after four months. Our patient subsequently had an intra-antral application of flumetasone and clioquinol (Locacorten®-Vioform®) weekly for six weeks with improvement of symptoms and no recurrence after six months of follow-up. Conclusions We conclude that topical intra-antral application of anti-fungal agents is effective in patients with recurrent fungal maxillary sinusitis after surgical debulking. </p...|$|R
