50|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{receiver}} required several power supplies at different voltages, which in early radios were supplied by separate batteries. By 1930 adequate <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes</b> were developed, and the expensive batteries {{were replaced by}} a transformer power supply that worked off the house current.|$|R
5000|$|During November 1954, Fender {{introduced}} the newly designed 5D6 Bassman amplifier offering four ten inch speakers and was designed utilizing two <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes.</b> The 5D6 {{was a major}} departure from the earlier 5B6 Fender Bassman model. Designed by Freddie Tavares, longtime R&D man at Fender, the new circuit included two <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes</b> and {{became known as the}} Dual Rectifier Bassman. Instead of the single 15" [...] speaker, four 10" [...] Jensen Alnico P10R speakers were used. The circuit had two innovations: a fixed bias for the power tubes, which increased power in comparison to the earlier cathode bias design, and a cathodyne phase inverter, using half of the 12AX7 tube and allowing a third gain stage on the other half.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were even}} a few [...] "AA4" [...] designs, usually midget sets, only usable in strong-signal {{metropolitan}} areas, because most had no IF amplifier (although some replaced the <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube</b> with a selenium rectifier).|$|E
5000|$|Early tube {{amplifiers}} had {{power supplies}} based on <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes.</b> These supplies were unregulated, a practice {{which continues to}} this day in transistor amplifier designs. The typical anode supply was a rectifier, perhaps half-wave, a choke (inductor) and a filter capacitor. When the tube amplifier was operated at high volume, due to the high impedance of the <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes,</b> the power supply voltage would dip as the amplifier drew more current (assuming class AB), reducing power output and causing signal modulation. The dipping effect is known as [...] "sag." [...] Sag may be desirable effect for some electric guitarists when compared with hard clipping. As the amplifier load or output increases this voltage drop will increase distortion of the output signal. Sometimes this sag effect is desirable for guitar amplification.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are often}} {{auxiliary}} windings that produce lower voltages for driving {{other parts of}} the television circuitry. The voltage used to bias the varactor diodes in modern tuners is often derived from the flyback transformer ("Line OutPut Transformer" [...] LOPT). In tube sets, a one or two-turn filament winding is located {{on the opposite side of}} the core as the HV secondary, used to drive the HV <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube's</b> heater.|$|R
50|$|This version used a 7.5 V A {{battery and}} a 90 V B battery. Note that the A battery {{did not need}} to heat the <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube</b> because, when {{operating}} from the batteries, the rectifier was not needed.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, {{the book}} [...] "Cyclopedia of Telephony & Telegraphy Vol. 1" [...] {{described}} an amplifier for telephone signals that used {{a magnetic field}} to modulate an arc in a mercury <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube.</b> This was never commercially important.|$|E
50|$|An all-tube design, the Prosonic uses {{standard}} 12AX7A {{tubes in}} the preamp sections, {{and one for}} the reverb send on the combo model. Output tubes are 5881/6L6WGCs. The <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube</b> is a 5AR4 (GZ34). The spring reverb unit in the combo model also uses a 12AT7 tube.|$|E
50|$|In Summer 2008, Fender reissued the Princeton Reverb. While it {{is based}} on the Blackface version, and {{utilizes}} a <b>tube</b> <b>rectifier</b> and a <b>tube</b> reverb, it uses printed circuit boards instead of eyelet-style hand-wired circuit boards.|$|R
50|$|Point-to-point and {{terminal}} strip construction {{continued to be}} used for some vacuum tube equipment even after the introduction of printed circuit boards. The heat of the tubes can degrade the circuit boards and cause them to become brittle and break. Circuit board degradation is often seen on inexpensive tube radios produced in the 1960s, especially around the hot output and <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes.</b> American manufacturer Zenith continued to use point-to-point wiring in its tube-based television sets until the early 1970s.|$|R
25|$|The first {{electric}} instrument amplifiers {{were not}} intended for electric guitars, but were portable PA systems. These {{appeared in the}} early 1930s when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes</b> enabled economical built-in power supplies that could plug into wall sockets. Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs. People used these amplifiers to amplify acoustic guitar, but electronic amplification of guitar first became widely poplular in the 1930s and 1940s craze for Hawaiian music, which extensively used amplified lap steel guitars.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Fender Bronco uses an all-tube AB764 circuit {{featuring a}} 12AX7 dual-triode preamp tube utilizing both {{sections of the}} tube in the preamp section of the amp. A second 12AX7 tube is used for driving the vibrato function. The power tube in the original Bronco is the 6V6GTA power tube, often used by Fender in its tube amps of the era. This amp's circuitry design {{is commonly known as}} a 'single-ended, class A' amplifier. Rectification in the original Bronco is via a single 5Y3GT <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube,</b> used by Fender since the early 1950s. In fact, Fender used {{an earlier version of this}} <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube</b> in the 1940s (the 5Y3) before it was phased out by manufacturers in the early 1950s to be replaced by the more electrically robust 5Y3GT.|$|E
5000|$|During 1952, the Fender 5B6 Bassman {{amplifier}} {{was introduced}} as a combo amplifier cabinet {{that included the}} amplifier chassis combined with one 15" [...] speaker. The 1952-1954 5B6 Bassman amplifiers had two 6SC7 or 6SL7GT pre-amp tubes, two 5881 power tubes and a single 5U4G <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube.</b> It was designed to generate 26 watts at an 8 ohm impedance load, and offered a cathode-based bias.|$|E

With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>rectifiers</b> became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|R

Later tubes had 1.4 volt filaments to run from dry batteries. With the introduction of mains powered equipment, indirectly heated tubes became more common and usually (though not always) required 4 volts in Europe and 6.3 volts in America. The latter became the standard voltage after the Second world war. One notable exception was that <b>rectifier</b> <b>tubes</b> often had 5 volt filaments or heaters which usually {{had to have a}} separate supply anyway.|$|R
50|$|Machlett Laboratories {{was created}} from E. Machlett & Sons {{in order to}} exploit the then new {{technology}} of X-rays.

In addition to making X-ray tubes, they manufactured high-power vacuum tubes for use in radio and TV broadcasting (857B mercury-vapor half-wave <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube)</b> and for industrial induction heating. Those two sides of the business were about equivalent for most {{of the life of the}} company.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, Fender began reissuing the 5F6-A Bassman. The {{first series}} of the reissue were made at the Corona, California facility, and came {{equipped}} with four Eminence-made 10" [...] blue frame AlNiCo speakers, and a solid state rectifier unit. Later on, production was moved to Ensenada, Baja California, and the model name was altered to [...] "59 Bassman LTD". The LTD came equipped with the original 5AR4 <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube,</b> and four Jensen P10R reissue alnico speakers, which was period correct for the original amp.|$|E
50|$|The Deluxe Reverb is a 22-watt tube {{amplifier}} (at 8 ohms), {{powered by}} a pair ("duet") of 7408/6V6GT power tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 <b>rectifier</b> <b>tube,</b> four 7025/12AX7 tubes for preamplification and tremolo oscillation, and two 6201/12AT7 tubes driving the reverb and phase inverter circuits. Throughout its production, the amplifier has most often featured a Jensen C-12Q series 12-inch loudspeaker, although Oxford 12K5, Marlboro SE, Utah and Eminence speakers have also been used. The 22-watt output was obtained by operating the 6V6 power tubes well in excess of their maximum specified operating voltage.|$|E
