50|$|The flask is {{then put}} back together, and metal can be {{poured into the}} mold. The metal will flow down the sprue, into the mold cavity, and back up the riser (of which there may be several). Once the metal has cooled enough to solidify, the flask can then be {{separated}} again, and the sand removed to reveal the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> The <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> is separated from the sprue and riser(s) either by sawing them off, or just breaking the thin metal of the gates and runners.|$|R

6000|$|About 1826, Mrs. Yonge {{was looking}} at the bit of waste land that had once served as a roadway to the field at the back of Otterbourne House, when she said, [...] "How I wish I had money enough to build a school here." [...] "Well," [...] said Mrs. Bargus, [...] "You shall have what I can give." [...] The amount was small, but with it Mr. Yonge {{contrived}} to put up one room with two new small ones at the back, built of mud <b>rough</b> <b>cast,</b> and with a brick floor, except for the little bedroom being raised a step, and boarded.|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} was to {{consider}} {{what was to be}} done about the boys, who could not be made to mind Mrs. Creswick. A row of the biggest sat {{at the back of the}} school, with their heels to the wall, and by constant kicking had almost knocked a hole through the mud wall; so the Vicar, who was now the Archdeacon's son, the Rev. Gilbert Wall Heathcote, gave permission for the putting up another mud and <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> school house near the old Church, for the boys, in an empty part of the Churchyard to the north- east, where no one had ever been buried.|$|E
60|$|She was {{a gentle}} woman, with {{dark eyes and}} a lame leg, {{so that she could}} not walk to church with the children, who sat on low benches along the nave, under no {{discipline}} but the long stick Master Oxford, the clerk, brandished over them. Nor could she keep the boys in any order, and the big ones actually kicked a hole nearly through the cement wall behind them. At last, under the sanction of the Rev. Gilbert Wall Heathcote, who had succeeded his father as Vicar of Hursley, a <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> room was erected in the churchyard, where Master Oxford kept school, with more upright goodness than learning; and Mr. Shuckburgh, the curate, and Mr. Yonge had a Sunday school there.|$|E
50|$|Bronze {{items are}} {{typically}} cast, not forged. Secondary operations involve removing {{material from the}} <b>rough</b> <b>casting,</b> polishing, {{and the application of}} decorative elements. Some Chinese swords used high-tin bronze for the edges, since it is harder, and keeps a sharp edge longer, but is more brittle than the softer, lower-tin alloy used for the blade's core. Bronze alloys with lower tin content are tougher, or more resistant to fracturing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the forging}} process, the <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> {{is placed in}} a die set while it is still hot and semi-solid. A {{hydraulic}} press is used to place the rough slug under tremendous pressure. This removes any possible porosity, and also pushes the alloy grains together tighter than {{can be achieved by}} simple casting alone. The end result is a much stronger material. Hypereutectic pistons can be forged, but typically are only cast, because the extra expense of forging is not justified when cast pistons are considered strong enough for stock applications.|$|R
50|$|After casting, the cores {{are broken}} up by rods or shot and {{removed from the}} casting. The metal from the sprue and risers is cut from the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> Various heat {{treatments}} may be applied to relieve stresses from the initial cooling and to add hardness - {{in the case of}} steel or iron, by quenching in water or oil. The casting may be further strengthened by surface compression treatment - like shot peening - that adds resistance to tensile cracking and smooths the rough surface. And when high precision is required, various machining operations (such as milling or boring) are made to finish critical areas of the casting. Examples of this would include the boring of cylinders and milling of the deck on a cast engine block.|$|R
60|$|He {{explained}} {{that he had been}} thinking of a Queen Anne style of architecture (Ann directly she heard her name shook her head at Kipps in an aside) so far as the exterior went. For his own part, he said, he liked to have the exterior of a house in a style, not priggishly in a style, but mixed, with one style uppermost, and the gables and dormers and casements of the Queen Anne style, with a little <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> and sham timbering here and there and perhaps a bit of an overhang diversified a house and made it interesting. The advantages of what he called a Queen Anne style was that it had such a variety of features.... Still, if they were prepared to be unconventional it could be done. A number of houses were now built in the unconventional style and were often very pretty. In the unconventional style one frequently had what perhaps he might call Internal Features, for example, an Old English oak staircase and gallery. White rough-cast and green paint were a good deal favoured in houses of this type.|$|E
60|$|Raymond {{staggered}} {{forth from}} this scene, {{as a man}} might do, who had been just put to the torture, and looked forward to {{when it would be}} again inflicted. He had sinned against his own honour, by affirming, swearing to, a direct falsehood; true this he had palmed on a woman, and it might therefore be deemed less base--by others--not by him;--for whom had he deceived?--his own trusting, devoted, affectionate Perdita, whose generous belief galled him doubly, when he remembered the parade of innocence with which it had been exacted. The mind of Raymond was not so <b>rough</b> <b>cast,</b> nor had been so rudely handled, in the circumstance of life, as to make him proof to these considerations--on the contrary, he was all nerve; his spirit was as a pure fire, which fades and shrinks from every contagion of foul atmosphere: but now the contagion had become incorporated with its essence, and the change was the more painful. Truth and falsehood, love and hate lost their eternal boundaries, heaven rushed in to mingle with hell; while his sensitive mind, turned to a field for such battle, was stung to madness. He heartily despised himself, he was angry with Perdita, and the idea of Evadne was attended by all that was hideous and cruel. His passions, always his masters, acquired fresh strength, from the long sleep in which love had cradled them, the clinging weight of destiny bent him down; he was goaded, tortured, fiercely impatient of that worst of miseries, the sense of remorse. This troubled state yielded by degrees, to sullen animosity, and depression of spirits. His dependants, even his equals, if in his present post he had any, were startled to find anger, derision, and bitterness in one, before distinguished for suavity and benevolence of manner. He transacted public business with distaste, and hastened from it to the solitude which was at once his bane and relief. He mounted a fiery horse, that which had borne him forward to victory in Greece; he fatigued himself with deadening exercise, losing the pangs of a troubled mind in animal sensation.|$|E

50|$|Stewart {{followed}} his father William Spiers into the cabinet-making trade in Ayr, {{and when his}} father died in 1844 he apparently took over the workshop in River Street. He was later to claim 1840 as the year his plane-making firm began. How Stewart came to be a plane-maker was, according to the Ayrshire Post, purely by accident, however. He {{is said to have}} bought a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> in Edinburgh for 1/6, finished it at home and sold it to a local cabinet-maker for 18/-. This supposedly was the beginning of what soon became a successful operation in which he was selling his planes in Glasgow and Edinburgh and as far afield as North America, yet this was still little more than a sideline to his cabinet-making. Only much later did he become a full-time plane maker.|$|R
50|$|With a {{completed}} mold {{at the appropriate}} moisture content, the box containing the sand mold is then positioned for filling with molten metal - typically iron, steel, bronze, brass, aluminium, magnesium alloys, or various pot metal alloys, which often include lead, tin, and zinc. After being filled with liquid metal the box is set aside until the metal is sufficiently cool to be strong. The sand is then removed, revealing a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> that, {{in the case of}} iron or steel, may still be glowing red. In the case of metals that are significantly heavier than the casting sand, such as iron or lead, the casting flask is often covered with a heavy plate to prevent a problem known as floating the mold. Floating the mold occurs when the pressure of the metal pushes the sand above the mold cavity out of shape, causing the casting to fail.|$|R

50|$|Wood {{craftsmen}} {{begin by}} making {{a model of the}} desired metal object from hardwood, using lathes, saws, and planes, which were all powered by the Knight Wheels. The model, called a pattern, is then placed in a casting flask, in its simplest form a topless and bottomless box split in half around its perimeter. The flask is placed on a board and a sand mixture (containing seacoal, bentonite clay, and pitch) poured and rammed around the pattern. The additives harden and stabilize the sand so that the flask can be split apart and the pattern removed leaving an exact impression or mold in the sand. The pattern can be reused almost indefinitely to create more molds in additional casting flasks. A channel or gate is left in the sand so that when the flask is rejoined, the ironworkers can pour the molten iron into it through the opening. When the iron has solidified the flask is broken apart, destroying the sand mold in the process, to reveal the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study and theoretical analyses on the monotonic and fatigue performance in bending of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber-reinforced engineered cementitious composite (ECC) overlay system. The {{influence of the}} interfacial characteristics between overlay and old concrete substrate on the overall bending performance is investigated. The experimental results show that when ECC is used as overlay material, both load carrying capacity and deformability represented by deflection at peak load of the overlaid beams in flexure are significantly increased compared to those of plain concrete (PC) overlaid beams. The fatigue life of ECC overlaid beams in flexure is not influenced by the layer/base interfacial characteristics, such as smooth cutting surface or sand-blasted rough surface. However, the deformation ability of the overlaid beams, such as deflection at midpoint of beam, in both static and cyclic loading cases {{are influenced by the}} interfacial property. The smooth casting surface leads to larger deformation at peak load under monotonic loading and at failure under fatigue loading than the corresponding values for beams with a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> surface. The present study demonstrates that reflective cracking failure in pavement overlays can be eliminated by the use of a ductile material such as ECC. D 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This {{inspection}} cell {{consisted of}} an ultrasonic flaw detector, transducer, robot, immersion tank, computer, and software. Normal beam pulse-echo ultrasonic nondestructive testing, using the developed automated cell, {{was performed on}} 17 bosses on each <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> Ultrasonic transducer selection, initial inspection criteria, and ultrasonic flow detector (UFD) setup parameters were developed for the gray iron castings used in this study. The software were developed {{for control of the}} robot and UFD in real time. The software performed two main tasks: emulating the manual operation of the UFD, and evaluating the ultrasonic signatures for detecting subsurface discontinuities. A random lot of 105 castings were tested; the 100 castings that passed were returned to the manufacturer for machining into finished parts and then inspection. The other 5 castings had one boss each with ultrasonic signatures consistent with subsurface discontinuities. The cell was successful in quantifying the ultrasonic echo signatures for the existence of signature characteristics consistent with Go/NoGo criteria developed from simulated defects. Manual inspection showed that no defects in the areas inspected by the automated cell avoided detection in the 100 castings machined into finished parts. Of the 5 bosses found to have subsurface discontinuities, two were verified by manual inspection. The cell correctly classified 1782 of the 1785 bosses (99. 832 %) inspected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The cam-shaft for the {{internal-combustion engine}} {{needs to be}} chilled at the foundry stage to rise the cam hardness, but {{unexpected}} chilled structures could occur on the sensor plate surface. If chilled structures exist on the sensor plate, a grinding tool may break when grinding sensor plate, or the specified shape {{may be unable to}} be produced due to resistance arising from the hyper-hardness of the chilled structures. For this reason, developing an inspection technique and a device for detecting unnecessary chilled structures before grinding the cam-shaft and for determining the rejection and removal of cam-shafts with chilled structures detected was necessary. This article reports on a recently developed nondestructive method using an eddy current test and X-rays to accurately detect chilled structures on a cam-shaft sensor plate. 1. Summary In the manufacturing process of a cam-shaft for the internal-combustion engine that primarily includes casting and machining, the cam tip’s structures are chilled locally to increase durability and resistance to abrasion with other areas that are de-chilled in order to raise machinability. When hard chilled structures are in areas other than a cam, they could exert harmful influence on the manufacturing line due to bite damage, etc. However, since the surface of a cam-shaft immediately after casting is covered with oxide scales (black scales), it is difficult to confirm chilled structures from appearance. In our research, we conducted a basic examination to develop an optimum evaluation system for the actual cam-shaft manufacturing line. As a result, we succeeded in developing a system that can detect structures with a nondestructive method, even on a cam-shaft covered with a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> surface. Our report follows below. 2. Nondestructive test using eddy curren...|$|R
