5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequence</b> (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Sequence</b> (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of a transgene requires the assembly of a few main parts. The transgene must contain a promoter, which is a <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequence</b> that will determine where and when the transgene is active, an exon, a protein coding sequence (usually derived from the cDNA for the protein of interest), and a stop sequence. These are typically combined in a bacterial plasmid and the coding sequences are typically chosen from transgenes with previously known functions.|$|E

40|$|Regulation of {{splicing}} in eukaryotes occurs {{through the}} coordinated action of multiple splicing factors. Exons and introns contain numerous putative binding sites for splicing regulatory proteins. Regulation of splicing is presumably {{achieved by the}} combinatorial output of the binding of splicing factors to the corresponding binding sites. Although putative regulatory sites often overlap, no extensive study has examined whether overlapping <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> provide yet another dimension to splicing regulation. Here we analyzed experimentally-identified splicing <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> using a computational method based on the natural distribution of nucleotides and splicing <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences.</b> We uncovered positive and negative interplay between overlapping <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences.</b> Examination of these overlapping motifs revealed a unique spatial distribution, especially near splice donor sites of exons with weak splice donor sites. The positively selected overlapping splicing regulatory motifs were highly conserved among different species, implying functionality. Overall, {{these results suggest that}} overlap of two splicing regulatory binding sites is an evolutionary conserved widespread mechanism of splicing regulation. Finally, over-abundant motif overlaps were experimentally tested in a reporting minigene revealing that overlaps may facilitate a mode of splicing that did not occur in the presence of only one of the two <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> that comprise it...|$|R
500|$|Flanking {{the open}} reading frame, genes contain a <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequence</b> that is {{required}} for their expression. First, genes require a promoter sequence. The promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. The recognition typically occurs as a consensus sequence like the TATA box. [...] A gene can {{have more than one}} promoter, resulting in messenger RNAs (mRNA) that differ in how far they extend in the 5'end. Highly transcribed genes have [...] "strong" [...] promoter sequences that form strong associations with transcription factors, thereby initiating transcription at a high rate. Others genes have [...] "weak" [...] promoters that form weak associations with transcription factors and initiate transcription less frequently. Eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters.|$|E

2500|$|The {{human genome}} has many {{different}} regulatory sequences which {{are crucial to}} controlling gene expression.

25|$|Eukaryotic genes {{also contain}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> beyond the core promoter. These cis-acting control {{elements}} bind transcriptional activators or repressors to {{increase or decrease}} transcription from the core promoter.

The combined upstream and intron <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> showed a marked inhibition of COL 1 A 1 promoter activity in fibroblasts.

Solid statistical validations of our comparative analyses indicated that alternative exons have (1) weaker splice sites and (2) more potential <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> than constitutive exons. Based on our observations, we propose a combinatorial model of alternative splicing mechanisms, which suggests that alternative exons contain weak splice sites regulated alternatively by potential <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> on the exons...|$|R

40|$|Steroid hormone receptors induce genes {{by virtue}} of their {{interaction}} with DNA <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences.</b> The hormonal response of a particular gene in vivo correlates with binding of the hormone to the receptor and supposedly reflects the degree of occupancy of the corresponding DNA <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences.</b> However, in vitro the steroid-free glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors bind specifically to the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> of mouse mammary tumor virus, thus raising questions {{on the role of the}} hormone in DNA binding in vivo. By using monoclonal antibodies, gel retardation assays, and filter binding techniques we show here that binding of a functional steroid to either the glucocorticoid or the progesterone receptors influences the kinetics of the protein-DNA interaction in vitro. In the presence of hormone the on rate of receptor binding to DNA fragments with or without <b>regulatory</b> <b>sequences</b> is accelerated 2 - to 5 -fold, and the off rate is accelerated 10 - to 20 -fold. The receptors complexed to an antihormone bind to DNA with kinetics intermediate between those of the steroid-free and the hormone-bound protein. Thus, ligand binding accelerates the kinetics of receptor binding to DNA and this could partly account for the behavior of the hormone receptor observed in vivo...|$|R
