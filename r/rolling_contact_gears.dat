The <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> joints provide a passive one degree-of-freedom relative motion between {{the base and}} the prismatic links. It is shown, both theoretically and numerically, that when all the G-joints have equal circular contact profiles, there are at most 48 real forward kinematic solutions when the P joints are actuated.

40|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> noncircular <b>gear</b> {{system is}} applied to assist a desired {{controller}} in the slewing of a flexible space structure. The varying gear ratio {{in cooperation with the}} controller results in lower feedback gains at the controller, as well as considerably reducing flexural vibrations of the space structure. The noncircular gears consist of a pair of convex noncircular cylinders with specially designed profiles that are synthesized in conjunction with the optimal controller gains for minimizing the flexural vibrations of flexible structure during a slew maneuver. Convexity of the cylindrical profiles for this noncircular gear device must be ensured to maintain <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> between the two cylinders.

40|$|Diamondlike carbon (DLC) {{films have}} emerged as a class of very {{important}} tribological materials in recent years mainly because of their outstanding properties, such as high mechanical strength and hardness, excellent chemical inertness, and exceptional friction and wear performance under both dry and lubricated sliding conditions. Persistent and systematic research efforts {{during the last decade}} have resulted {{in the development of a}} new breed of DLC films providing superlubricity and near-wearless sliding even under very harsh contact and environmental conditions. In fact, the dry sliding friction and wear coefficients (i. e., as low as 0. 001 and 10 - 11 mm 3 /N. m, respectively) of these films are among the lowest reported to date, and such unusual tribological properties may have huge positive impacts on efficiency, durability, and performance characteristics of a wide range of mechanical systems, including magnetic hard disks, sliding and/or <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> bearings, <b>gears,</b> mechanical seals, scratch-resistant glasses, invasive and implantable medical devices, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and many more. In this chapter, we attempt to provide an up-to-date overview of these novel DLC films that can provide superlubricity and discuss in detail those factors that control their very unique lubrication mechanisms. Specifically, we concentrate on the current state-of-the-art in our understanding of their superlow friction and wear mechanisms, and how these mechanisms may relate to their structural chemistry, mechanical properties, and test and environmental conditions. In particular, various intrinsic (film specific) and extrinsic (or test condition-specific) factors that play major roles in friction and wear of DLC films are discussed in detail and correlated with their friction and wear mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Rolling {{contact is}} {{experienced}} {{by a large}} number of components in mechanical designs. Examples include roller bearings and ink distribution rollers in the printing industry. Rolling contact results in surface wear. It is however possible to reduce <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> wear rates and surface fatigue by performing a surface modification such as powdered metal coating [35]. Powder coating methods such as Laser cladding and Plasma coating are two application processes that are completely different in method and therefore create different coating microstructures and bonding mechanisms between the coating and substrate. The aim of the research was to investigate the comparative <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> performance of two coating processes and two separate metal powder compositions. The coatings were applied to British standard En 9 steel test specimens. En 9 was selected due to its popular use in the manufacture of shafts, cylinders and rollers. Under <b>rolling</b> <b>contact,</b> material is removed from the surface as a result of wear and surface fatigue. Through testing and evaluation, the performance of the coating application processes were evaluated relative to one another and relative to the uncoated steel under <b>rolling</b> <b>contact.</b> The performance of the coating compositions were also evaluated against one another for a given coating application process. Results used to determine the performance of the coatings and coating processes were, the number of cycles to failure and the wear rates of the coated surface. Microstructure pictures of the coated surface were taken prior to testing and following testing. The pictures were used to qualitatively determine the effects of the <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> on the surfaces.

In the present study, a low cost sintered and reaction-bonded Silicon Nitride is used to study the surface machining effects on its <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue performance. Studies have been carried out to link the surface strengths of Silicon Nitride derived from half-rod and C-Sphere flexure strength specimens to the <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> lives of Silicon Nitride rod and ball specimens. The <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue tests were carried out on ball-on-rod and modified four-ball machines. Three types of surface with coarse, fine and RCF-conventional finishing conditions were examined. Flexure strength tests on half-rod and C-Sphere showed an increasing surface strength from specimens with coarse, fine to RCF-conventionally machined conditions. During <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue tests of as-machined specimens, no failures were observed on either ball-on-rod or four-ball tests after 100 million stress cycles. However, a trend of decreasing wear volumes was measured on the contact path of rods and balls with coarse, fine and RCF-conventional conditions. In four-ball tests, spall failures were observed on pre-cracked specimens. There was a trend of increasing <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue lifetime from pre-cracked specimens with coarse, fine to RCF-conventional machining conditions.

Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal loading from braking and mechanical loading, with traversing wheel-rail <b>rolling</b> <b>contact,</b> are studied.

The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue of the wheel treads and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the wheel treads...|$|R

Further Johnson collected in his book a tremendous amount of {{information on}} contact mechanics and related subjects. With respect to <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> mechanics an overview of various theories is presented by Kalker as well. Finally the proceedings of a CISM course are of interest, which provide an introduction to more advanced aspects of <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> theory.|$|R
