5|$|Gareloi is {{the northernmost}} volcano of the Delarof Group, a {{subgroup}} of the Aleutian Islands. It {{is composed of}} two craters, the older of which is covered by lava flows <b>running</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest and southern coasts. The northern crater is small, with a feature suggesting dome collapse in its northwest flank. The southern flank, higher up and considerably larger, contains fumarolic activity. A fissure created by Gareloi's 1929 eruption runs along the southern summit of the volcano. Steep sea cliffs on the southwest {{side of the island}} cut into the older caldera. Three masses offshore of the island were produced by debris flows from the volcano.|$|E

5|$|In 1608–09, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton built a {{house on}} {{the eastern side of the}} former Chapel and Hospital of St. Mary Rounceval, at Charing Cross, {{including}} gardens <b>running</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Thames and adjoining Scotland Yard to the west. The estate became the property of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland when he married Howard's great-great niece, Lady Elizabeth, in 1642, whereupon it was known as Northumberland House. In turn, the street was named Northumberland Street. The house was damaged in the Wilkes' election riots of 1768, but was saved after its owner, Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland opened the nearby Ship Ale House, driving off rioters.|$|E

Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|SH-132 turns {{east and}} {{overlaps}} the U.S. routes for one mile (1.6km), before splitting back {{off to the}} north. In Carrier, it briefly overlaps State Highway 45.

At the Garfield–Grant County line, the highway curves to the northwest before turning back to a due north heading in order to line up with Grant County's road grid.|$|E
5|$|The altered {{bill was}} passed as an Act of Parliament in 1834. It was this act which founded the City of London School, which {{initially}} had around 400pupils. The act gave the Corporation of London {{a duty to}} maintain a school on the Honey Lane Market site and so gave control over {{almost every aspect of}} the school's <b>running</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Corporation. A committee was also set up to manage the school, with Hale as chairman. Although the committee's powers were initially limited, they gained more control over time as they made important decisions for the school.|$|E

There is a rash of stones on the summit although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, the view is extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view from the summit of High Crag.|$|E
5|$|From here, MD 97 turns {{northwest}} through residential {{neighborhoods and}} passes the Glenmont station terminus of Washington Metro's Red Line, before reaching some businesses near the intersection {{with the northern}} terminus of MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue) in Aspen Hill. It turns north again past this intersection and crosses Bel Pre Road. After crossing Bel Pre Road, the route heads into wooded neighborhoods before it passes through a mix of businesses and houses, with MD 655 <b>running</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of the road. MD 97 crosses MD 28 (Norbeck Road) in Norbeck, and continues past some residences where it intersects MD 655A, a short connector that provides access to westbound MD 28. MD 97 enters more wooded areas and narrows to four lanes, interchanging with MD 200 (Intercounty Connector). A park and ride lot {{is located at the}} southwest corner of this interchange.|$|E

5|$|Route 108 {{begins at}} the Arkansas state line in Arkmo, Dunklin County, where the road {{continues}} south into that state as Highway 77. From the Arkansas-Missouri state line, the route heads north as a two-lane undivided road, passing a few homes and businesses in Arkmo before running through farmland. The road continues through rural areas to {{the southern edge of}} Arbyrd, where it reaches an intersection with Route 164. At this point, Route 108 turns east to form a concurrency with Route 164, with the two routes passing through more fields before <b>running</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of industry. Route 108 splits from Route 164 by heading north on East Frisco Street, passing homes and a few businesses. Route 108 leaves Arbyrd and heads through more agricultural areas before reaching its eastern terminus at US 412. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated 1,057 vehicles traveling north of the state line. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.|$|E
5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley <b>running</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio {{situated in the}} southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|The Beaumont {{section of}} MS 198 begins at an {{intersection}} with US 98 within the DeSoto National Forest northwest of Beaumont in Perry County, heading east on a two-lane undivided road.
