25|$|Samuel ben Meir, {{brother of}} Jacob ben Meir, argued that infused tastes could endure in a cooking vessel or utensil {{for up to}} 24 hours; his {{suggestion}} led to the principle, known as ben yomo (Hebrew: son of the day, בן יומו), that vessels and utensils {{should not be used}} to cook milk within 24 hours of being used to cook meat (and vice versa). Although, after 24 hours, some <b>residual</b> <b>flavour</b> may still reside in porous cooking vessels and utensils, some rabbis hold the opinion that such residue would become stale and fetid, hence only infusing taste for the worse (Hebrew: nosen taam lifgam, נותן טעם לפגם), which they do not regard as violating the ban against mixing the tastes of milk and meat.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{modulating}} the gelatinisation extent by hydration (50 / 50 and 80 / 20 water to starch ratio) and temperature (65 or 85 degrees C) on various properties of wheat starch in presence of flavours has been studied. The hydrothermal treatments resulted in samples with different properties. The lowest <b>residual</b> <b>flavour</b> content {{was found in}} samples treated at the highest hydration and temperature (85 degrees C) while the other treatment conditions led to samples with similar <b>residual</b> <b>flavour</b> content. Ethyl hexanoate significantly increased the characteristic pasting viscosities compared to starch +/- 2 -hexanone; suggesting a greater structuration with ethyl hexanoate. Heating starch in excess water caused amylopectin melting, but promoted an incomplete granular swelling as revealed by RVA. This study suggested that lowering the hydration upon treatment could limit both crystal melting (with a residual crystalline content up to 38 % in the most extreme conditions) and granular swelling but increased granule organisation like following annealing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} two seemingly disjoint topics that are interesting on their own, but {{that come to}} their full bloom when combined. These two topics are the violation of CP and the so-called flavour problem. CP violation is simply necessary for all our existence, however currently no strong enough source of it is known to ensure successful baryogenesis. The flavour problem {{on the other hand}} is a loose collection of questions concerning fermions in the standard model, especially why several flavours exist at all, and why their properties appear to be so chaotic. The overlap between the two topics happens, as in the SM CP is violated in the flavour sector. After an introduction, so-called <b>residual</b> <b>flavour</b> and CP symmetries are explored as possible explanations of the parameter structure of the lepton Yukawa sector. Such residual symmetries are embedded into larger groups at high energy and from the breaking patterns constraints on observables are derived. There it was found that an important class of subgroups of U(3), namely (6 n 2) groups, can indeed explain the observed lepton mixing. Several variations of this approach, combining <b>residual</b> <b>flavour</b> and CP symmetries, are explored. This {{was the first time that}} such an infinite series of finite groups was analysed in this way. After this, motivated by the need for breaking of flavour and CP symmetries and the search for additional sources of CP violation, a large number of candidate scalar potentials are explored, especially for their CP properties. A necessary tool for this are CP-odd Higgs basis invariants, the theory of which was further developed to enable such analyses. Using this approach, many very complicated potentials were tested for their CP properties for the first time and new sources of CP violation were found in new and known potentials...|$|E
50|$|Vin de Paille is the French for 'straw wine', {{made only}} in the ripest vintages. Perhaps the best known example {{is made in the}} Cotes du Jura (Arbois and {{sometimes}} L'Etoile) from a blend of Chardonnay, Savagnin and the red grape Poulsard. Vins de paille are also made from Marsanne in Hermitage, and from Riesling in Alsace. In Corrèze, it is called Vin Paillé. Traditionally the grapes are placed indoors on straw mats for up to three months, and the final wine has 10-20% <b>residual</b> sugar, with <b>flavours</b> of peaches and apricots. It is an excellent accompaniment to foie gras.|$|R
40|$|Expansion of the Irish {{dairy herd}} {{has led to}} more dairy breed male calves being {{available}} for beef production. This study investigated the physico-chemical and sensory characteristics of beef from Holstein-Friesian (HF) and Jersey × HF (JEX) young bulls fed pasture grass only or pasture grass plus 2 kg concentrate during their first grazing season and slaughtered at 15, 19 or 22 mo of age. Longissimus thoracis (LT) muscles were collected from 67 carcasses. Postmortem pH, ultimate pH (pHu), meat colour, chemical composition, collagen content and solubility were evaluated. After ageing for 21 d, Warner-Bratzler shear force and cooking loss were determined, and assessments by a trained sensory panel were conducted. Meat from older animals was darker. The pHu, moisture and ash contents decreased, while <b>residual</b> roast beef <b>flavour</b> length increased with age. However, increasing age to slaughter did not negatively influence tenderness. JEX beef had lower cooking loss, was darker and redder, {{in addition to having}} higher sensory scores for initial tenderness and fattiness than HF beef. Warner-Bratzler variables were positively correlated with cooking loss and chewiness and were negatively correlated with intramuscular fat (IMF) content, soluble collagen and initial tenderness. In summary, most young dairy bull beef samples were acceptably tender after 21 d of ageing and half of them had acceptable IMF content. Slaughter age affected beef colour, pHu, chemical composition and flavour length. The eating quality of meat from the JEX breed type was considered to be superior to that of the HF breed type. Diet during the first season had no effect on meat quality traits...|$|R
40|$|The eating {{quality of}} M. longissimus dorsi (LD) from RN- homozygotes, RN- heterozygotes and RN- non-carriers was {{investigated}} in a Swedish Hampshire x Finnish Landrace pig population. The recently identified new allele (V 1991, here denoted rn*) at the RN locus was also detected among the pigs selected and included in the sensory evaluation. The number of animals varied from 10 to 15 in the five genotype groups; RN-/RN-, RN-/rn+, RN-/rn*, rn+/rn+ and rn+/rn* (in total 59 pigs). In addition, one pig {{was determined to be}} rn*/rn* but was excluded from the analysis. The three genotypes in which the RN allele was represented (RN-/RN-, RN-/rn+ and RN-/rn*) had higher glycogen and lower protein contents as well as lower ultimate pH (measured 48 h post-mortem) in LD than the non-carriers (rn+/rn+ and rn + rn*). Of the sensory parameters evaluated (tenderness, chewing time, chewing <b>residual,</b> juiciness, meat <b>flavour</b> and acidity), the five RN genotypes only affected acidity significantly; the RN- allele contributing to a more acid taste in LD. The influence of the rn* allele resembled that of rn + on the sensory parameters. When the material was divided into three groups (homo-Zygous, heterozygous and non-carriers of the RN- allele) the juiciness was found to be significantly influenced by RN genotype, and LD from animals that were homozygous and heterozygous with respect to the RN- allele exhibited a higher juiciness than LD from non-carriers. The RN- allele also tended to contribute to greater tenderness, which was significantly higher in LD from heterozygous carriers than from non-carriers of the RN- allele. A more rapid decline in pH (measured as pH at 45 min and 3 It postmortem) contributed to a greater tenderness in LD (according to a trained panel and Warner-Bratzler shear force). In addition to the RN genotype, the decline in pH was influenced by carcass weight, which varied between 71 and 97 kg, and by stunning procedure, which changed {{during the course of the}} study from individual to group stunning with CO, The individual stunning procedure contributed to a lower pH in the initial post-mortem phase (pH(45)), whereas a higher carcass weight and the RN- allele lowered the pH in the mid-post-mortem region (pH(3 h) and pH(24 h)), significantly (P less than or equal to 0. 05). The pH continued to decline after 24 h post-mortem and the ultimate pH was not reached until 48 h post-mortem. The cooking loss, juiciness and acidity were related to the specific characteristics of the RN- carriers, such as higher glycogen content, lower protein content and lower ultimate pH (pH(48 h)) (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractGeneralised CP transformations are {{the only}} known {{framework}} which allows to predict Majorana phases in a flavour model purely from symmetry. For the first time generalised CP transformations are investigated for an infinite series of finite groups, Δ(6 n 2) =(Zn×Zn) ⋊S 3. In direct models the mixing angles and Dirac CP phase are solely predicted from symmetry. The Δ(6 n 2) flavour symmetry provides many examples of viable predictions for mixing angles. For all groups the mixing matrix has a trimaximal middle column and the Dirac CP phase is 0 or π. The Majorana phases are predicted from <b>residual</b> <b>flavour</b> and CP symmetries where α 21 can take several discrete values for each n and the Majorana phase α 31 is a multiple of π. We discuss constraints on the groups and CP transformations from measurements of the neutrino mixing angles and from neutrinoless double-beta decay and find that predictions for mixing angles and all phases are accessible to experiments in the near future...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExcessive {{intake of}} sodium has been {{associated}} with harmful effects on human health. Therefore, salt reduction in manufactured products is been targeted as a way to reduce dietary sodium intake. Sodium chloride (NaCl) {{plays an important role in}} cheese, and reducing the NaCl level in cheese may adversely affect its characteristics. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of different levels of salt reduction on the physicochemical, biochemical, rheological, and sensory characteristics of Mozzarella cheese. Samples were brine-salted for different periods to obtain cheeses with different levels of salt reduction (C: control cheese; S 1 : cheese with 60 % salt reduction, S 2 : cheese with 35 % salt reduction). Samples were analysed during 43  days of ripening. As expected, salt flavour intensity decreased with a decrease in NaCl levels. Small differences between control and experimental cheeses due to salting condition were observed in moisture content, water activity, maturation index, αs 1 -casein, αs 1 -I-casein, crossover temperature (when the elastic component equals the viscous component) and in some sensory attributes (aroma, colour, global flavour and creaminess). No significant differences due to salting condition were observed in pH, γ-casein, β-casein degradation, activation energy (parameter that quantifies the matrix degradation with heating), <b>residual</b> <b>flavour,</b> acidity and bitter taste. Taking into account the minor differences observed after the significant salt reduction analysed, it is considered that decreasing NaCl may not jeopardise the standard Mozzarella cheese quality...|$|E
