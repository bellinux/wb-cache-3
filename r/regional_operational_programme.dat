This {{was followed by a}} period where EU member states tried to maximize control, with little systematic project appraisal and a focus on a small number of large projects. Since 1994 more systematic, co-ordinated and complex methods of allocating resources start to be introduced. For example, most funds within the 2004-06 Integrated <b>Regional</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Programme</b> (IROP), and its 2007-13 successor (ROP), are allocated through largely need-based project-selection mechanisms.

40|$|The thesis {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the problem of theoretical perspectives on regional development in regional development programmes, studying the case of <b>Regional</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Programmes</b> of five Eastern Poland regions. Formulation of regional development policy for the macroregion is a controversial issue in regional policy discussions in Poland.

The content analysis showed the domination of the innovation perspective in all of the documents.
