5|$|Dawson Creek is a <b>regional</b> <b>node</b> for air, rail, and bus {{services}}. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built}} in 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became {{more important in the}} resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} clinicopathologic {{features}} of the lesion and host which influence the natural course of melanoma. Currently, the most important prognostic factor {{appears to be the}} depth of invasion of the primary lesion. Using either the Clark's level of microinvasion or the tumor thickness as measured by Breslow, there is good correlation of decreasing survival rates, and increasing incidence of occult metastasis in <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> with deeper invasion of the tumor. Thus, proper diagnosis and treatment of primary melanoma depends on the information of depth of microinvasion. And patients with high-risk of developing occult metastasis in <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> can be identified. Although two recent studies question the value of performing prophylactic regional lymphadenectomy, none of these studies utilized depth of microinvasion to select patients who have a high chance of having extension or relapse only in <b>regional</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. -Thirty-five {{cases of}} primary reticulum-cell sarcoma seen during 28 years are presented. These tumours {{occurred}} {{five times more}} frequently in males than in females, and were seen most commonly in adults. The femur was the commonest location. None of the tumours was located in the small bones of the hand, foot or skull bones (excluding maxilla). Radiation therapy has been the treatment of choice. Though the initial response was good, local recurrence and metastasis to <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> and generalised dissemination was not uncommon. Radiation therapy to <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> and concomitant chemotherapy are suggested to prevent metastasis in <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> and generalised dissemination. These tumours {{were found to have}} a spectrum of activity varying from a rapid fatal outcome within a few months to survival for many years.

40|$|Objective: It {{remains unclear}} whether lymphadenectomy alters <b>regional</b> <b>node</b> {{recurrence}} after nephroureterectomy {{in patients with}} urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. The predictive factors for <b>regional</b> <b>node</b> recurrence are still unclear. In this study, we retrospectively examined how the extent of lymphadenectomy influences <b>regional</b> <b>node</b> recurrence in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Methods: From January 1988 through July 2013, we performed nephroureterectomy in 180 patients with non-metastatic (cN 0 M 0) urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis at two Japanese institutes. Regional nodes were determined according to our previous mapping study: complete lymphadenectomy designates that all regional sites were dissected; incomplete lymphadenect-omy that all sites were not dissected. A third group included those without lymphadenectomy. Results: The 5 -year cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in the complete lymphadenectomy group than in the incomplete lymphadenectomy or without lym-phadenectomy groups (P 0. 03). The incidence of <b>regional</b> <b>node</b> recurrence was significantly lower in the complete lymphadenectomy group at 2. 9 % (2 / 67) than in the incomplete lymphade-nectomy at 18. 1 % (4 / 22) or without lymphadenectomy at 10. 9 % (10 / 91) groups (P 0. 03).

Patients with Clark's Level III melanoma had a 29 % incidence of <b>regional</b> lymph <b>node</b> metastases, Clark's Level IV had a 42 % incidence of <b>regional</b> lymph <b>node</b> metastases and Clark's Level V a 58 % incidence of <b>regional</b> lymph <b>node</b> metastases.

A new technique is described which is helpful in localizing the direction of ambiguous lymphatic drainage in patients with truncal melanoma. The use of radioactive colloidal gold scanning has been useful in predicting lymphatic shed in these ambiguous truncal melanomas. Certain technical aspects of inguinal lymph node dissection are emphasized in an attempt to reduce the morbidity of these dissections. It is emphasized that iliac-obturator lymph node dissections are not performed unless the inguinal lymph nodes are found to be involved by frozen section examination at the time of surgery...|$|R
