5|$|The club {{played only}} {{friendly}} games until the 1887–88 season, when it {{took part in}} the Gloucestershire Cup for the first time. In 1892 the club became a founder member of the Bristol and District League, which three years later was renamed the Western League. In 1897 Eastville <b>Rovers</b> joined the Birmingham and District League, and for two seasons played in both this league and the Western League. At the beginning of the 1897–98 season, the club turned professional and changed its name to Bristol Eastville <b>Rovers,</b> and on 17 February 1899 the name was officially changed to Bristol <b>Rovers.</b> In 1899 Bristol <b>Rovers</b> joined the newly formed Southern League, where they remained until 1920, winning the league title along the way in 1905.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} <b>Rovers</b> {{encountered}} Yeovil was a Football League Trophy match which was played on 31 October 2001, which <b>Rovers</b> won via a penalty shoot out.

25|$|The Range <b>Rover</b> was {{launched}} in 1970 by British Leyland. This flagship model {{is now in its}} fourth generation.

50|$|The company traded as <b>Rover,</b> {{manufacturing}} cars between 1904 and 1967, when it {{was sold}} to Leyland Motor Corporation, becoming the <b>Rover</b> marque. The <b>Rover</b> marque was used on cars produced by British Leyland (BL), who separated {{the assets of the}} original <b>Rover</b> Company as Land <b>Rover</b> in 1978 whilst the <b>Rover</b> trademark continued to be used on vehicles produced by its successor companies - the Austin <b>Rover</b> Group (1982-1986), the <b>Rover</b> Group (1986-2000), and then finally MG <b>Rover</b> (2000-2005). Following MG <b>Rover's</b> collapse in 2005, the <b>Rover</b> marque became dormant, and was subsequently sold by BMW to Ford, who had bought Land <b>Rover</b> from BMW in 2000. The rights to the <b>Rover</b> brand were transferred along with the Jaguar Cars and Land <b>Rover</b> businesses, to Tata Motors in 2008.|$|R

5|$|Bremner was {{appointed}} manager of struggling Fourth Division side Doncaster <b>Rovers</b> in November 1978. He oversaw a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Belle Vue {{in his first}} match in charge. Results fluctuated during the 1978–79 season, demonstrated by a 7–1 defeat by struggling Bournemouth punctuating a run of five wins in six games. <b>Rovers</b> ended the season in 22nd place, though 11 points ahead of Halifax Town and Crewe Alexandra, and successfully applied to the Football League for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Bristol <b>Rovers</b> Football Club is an English {{professional}} association football club based in Bristol, who play in Football League One, the Third tier of the English football league system, {{as of the}} 2016–17 season. The club was formed in 1883 under the name Black Arabs F.C. playing their home games at Purdown in Bristol, but they used the name for only a single season, becoming Eastville <b>Rovers</b> and moving to a site known as Three Acres in 1884. Eastville <b>Rovers</b> were somewhat nomadic, moving home in 1891 to the Schoolmaster's Cricket Ground, in 1892 to Durdham Down, and in 1894 to Ridgeway, before finally settling at Eastville Stadium and changing their name to Bristol Eastville <b>Rovers</b> in 1897. Two years later they adopted their current name of Bristol <b>Rovers</b> when they became founder members of the Southern League. They remained at Eastville Stadium for 99 years, before leaving in 1986 when financial pressures meant that {{they could no longer}} afford to pay the rent, whereupon they moved to Bath City's Twerton Park, a move that saved the club £30,000 a year. After playing for ten years in Bath, the club returned to Bristol in 1997 when they agreed to share Bristol Rugby's Memorial Stadium. Since joining The Football League in 1920, when the top division of the Southern League effectively became the Football League Third Division, <b>Rovers</b> have spent most of their time {{in the second and third}} tiers of the English football league system; the team has never played in the top flight and spent six years, 2001 to 2007, in the fourth tier.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Land <b>Rover</b> {{launched}} another model {{under the}} Range <b>Rover</b> brand – the Range <b>Rover</b> Sport, {{which was based}} on the Land <b>Rover</b> Discovery platform, but the new Range <b>Rover</b> Sport has the latest Range <b>Rover</b> platform.|$|R

5|$|In 1987, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} sell the stadium to {{property}} developers, having recently purchased it from the Jesuits. The last game at Glenmalure Park was an FAI Cup semi-final between Shamrock <b>Rovers</b> and Sligo <b>Rovers</b> on 12 April 1987. The game saw a pitch invasion by supporters protesting against {{the sale of the}} stadium. The next season, the supporters formed an association called Keep <b>Rovers</b> at Milltown and placed a picket on home games at Tolka Park, effectively bankrupting the club's owners. They accumulated funds, through supporter contributions, in an effort to purchase the stadium but failed to match the offer of a property developer to whom the Kilcoynes eventually sold the site. After a lengthy appeals process, Glenmalure Park was demolished in 1990 to be replaced by an apartment complex.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, BMW {{sold the}} <b>Rover</b> and related MG car {{activities}} of the <b>Rover</b> Group to the Phoenix Consortium, who established the MG <b>Rover</b> Group at Longbridge.
