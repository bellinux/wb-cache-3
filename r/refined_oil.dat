The blend of <b>refined</b> olive <b>oil</b> and <b>refined</b> palm <b>oil</b> exhibited a higher chemical stability during the frying process than that of <b>refined</b> soya bean <b>oil</b> and <b>refined</b> palm <b>oil.</b> Indeed, the total polar compounds and volatile compounds formed, especially 2, 4 -decadienal, were found to be relatively increased in the refined soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend reaching 36. 50 % and 46. 70 %, respectively, after fifty deep-frying sessions.

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, {{a period of}} {{prolonged}} high oil prices set in that characterised {{the rest of the}} 1970s. Romania as a major oil-producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> would be more than enough to pay off the loans. A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{examples}} cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.|$|E

25|$|Realizing {{that the}} New York Central now {{depended}} heavily on connecting lines to reach Midwestern cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis, Vanderbilt decided to add Amasa Stone to the Central's board of directors.

In April 1868, Stone {{played a major role}} in bringing together Cornelius Vanderbilt and the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Vanderbilt very much wanted the New York Central to carry both raw and <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> being shipped by Rockefeller. On April 18, 1868, Vanderbilt asked Rockefeller (then visiting New York City) to meet with him. Rockefeller refused, sending only his business card. He believed Vanderbilt would try to charge him high freightage rates, and Rockefeller knew he could get his oil to refineries and consumers without Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt persisted, however, and later that afternoon sent Amasa Stone to visit Rockefeller at Rockefeller's hotel. The two Clevelanders spoke for several hours, and Stone convinced Rockefeller to see Vanderbilt. The two men met that evening, and began a long and fruitful business relationship.|$|E

Moreover, with respect to the other kinds of oil, the use of extra virgin olive oil led to significantly lower values (P < 0. 05) of specific absorption at 232 and 270 nm (K(232) and K(270), respectively) and of triacylglycerol oligopolymers. It also proved to present a much lower content in oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than olive-pomace <b>oil</b> and <b>refined</b> palm <b>oil,</b> respectively.

In late 1898 the Manchester City, at 7,698gross tons, became the largest vessel {{to reach the}} terminal docks. Carrying cattle and general cargo, it was met by the Lord Mayor of Manchester and a large welcoming crowd. [...] In 1968 Manchester Liners converted its fleet to container vessels only. To service them it built two dedicated container terminals next to No. 9 Dock. The four container vessels commissioned that year, each of 11,898 gross tons, were the largest ever to make regular use of the terminal docks at Salford. [...] In 1974 the canal handled 2.9million long tons (3.25million short tons) of dry cargo, 27 per cent of which was carried by Manchester Liners. The dry tonnage was, and is still, greatly supplemented by crude and <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> products transported in large tanker ships {{to and from the}} Queen Elizabeth II Dock at Eastham and the Stanlow Refinery just east of Ellesmere Port, and also in smaller tankers to Runcorn.

40|$|<b>Refined</b> {{vegetable}} <b>oils</b> including <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil</b> {{are widely}} used in foods. Due to shared production processes, <b>refined</b> non-peanut vegetable <b>oils</b> can contain residual peanut proteins. We estimated the predicted number of allergic reactions to residual peanut proteins using probabilistic risk assessment applied to several scenarios involving food products made with vegetable oils. Variables considered were: a) the estimated production scale of <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil,</b> b) estimated cross-contact between <b>refined</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> during production, c) the proportion of fat in representative food products and d) the peanut protein concentration in <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil.</b> For all products examined the predicted risk of objective allergic reactions in peanut-allergic users of the food products was extremely low. The number of predicted reactions ranged depending on the model {{from a high of}} 3 per 1000 eating occasions (Weibull) to no reactions (LogNormal). Significantly, all reactions were predicted for allergen intakes well below the amounts reported for the most sensitive individual described in the clinical literature.

2500|$|The {{first time}} came in 1868. On March 4, 1867, John D. Rockefeller, his brother William Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and {{businessman}} Henry Flagler formed the oil refining firm of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler. (Flagler's step-brother, the liquor magnate Stephen V. Harkness, was a silent partner.) Transportation costs were {{the key to}} making oil cheaply available to consumers, and cheap oil meant more market share (and more profit). For Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, the question was how to get its <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> to East Coast cities. At the time, the railroads were engaged in cutthroat competition for <b>refined</b> <b>oil.</b> Rate-cutting was common (with railways often losing money on shipments). Each road also attempted to win more oil freight business by rapidly building up its supply of tank cars, but this left the railroads with an oversupply of cars, which lost them even more money. In 1868, Rockefeller formed a consortium of Cleveland-area refining companies. The consortium agreed to pool their shipments to the East Coast if lower freight rates could be procured. On behalf of the consortium, Henry Flagler reached an agreement with Stone's Lake Shore & Michigan Southern: The consortium would guarantee at least 60 tank cars of <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> every day, in return for which the LS would cut shipping rates by 30 percent (e.g., offer a [...] "rebate"). The consortium agreed not to ship oil with any other railway unless the LS could not take the oil, and the LS agreed not to offer a rebate to any other refiners unless they could provide at least 60 tank cars of oil a day (which none of them could). Stone quickly agreed to the plan, which greatly enhanced Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler's market share.|$|E

40|$|Highly <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil</b> is {{considered}} to pose a risk to people with peanut allergy. [1] Although that risk has not been characterised, but controlled clinical challenges sug-gest it is negligible. A consequence is that the risk from cross contact between other <b>refined</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> and <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil</b> during production must be assessed in order to assure consumer safety.
