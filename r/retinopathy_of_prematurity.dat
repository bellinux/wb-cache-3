5|$|<b>Retinopathy</b> <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> was not {{observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in <b>retinopathy</b> <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications.

5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or <b>retinopathy</b> <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. <b>Retinopathy</b> <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of <b>retinopathy</b> <b>of</b> <b>prematurity,</b> and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

40|$|Excess {{perinatal}} {{morbidity and}} mortality continue to be major problems in developed and developing nations. Most perinatal deaths occur in infants born weighing < 2500 g. Large expenditures of time, equipment, and personnel have led to striking reductions in neonatal mortality. However, rates <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> have not declined. Exploration of proven causes <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> and low birth weight suggests a role for infection that has hitherto not received sufficient attention. Women with symptomatic pyelonephritis, even when treated promptly, experience an excess <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> and perinatal death, and their children have lowered intelligence scores and neurologic scores. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria experience higher rates of low birth weight and perinatal mortality, as well as symptomatic pyelonephritis, and these are preventable by screening and treatment during pregnancy.

40|$|Background and purpose: Prematurity birth {{occurs when}} a newborn is born before the thirty seventh week of pregnancy. Preterm birth is the most {{expensive}} and the most common health problem. So, the aim {{of this study was to}} do epidemiological survey <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> in Gonbad-e Kavous in 2010. Materials and Methods: This sectional- descriptive study was carried out on 172 premature babies with census method. A questionnaire was made with α= 0. 873 to collect the data. The data were analyzed with SPSS software, descriptive statistics and Poisson regression. Results: The incidence <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> was 41. 04 at live births per 1, 000 and the mortality rate <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> based on all births at live births per 1, 000 was 7. 78 in 2009. In 2007 and 2008, the mortality rate <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> based on all births at live births per 1000 was 10. 74 and 7. 08, respectively. The villages of Baghlimara, Gadomabad, Aghabad, Gharemohammadtapeh, Chaighoshan, Agribaghaz, Soltanali, Taghiabad, Gonbad 1, Gonbad 6, Bibishirvan had the highest maturity rate in 2009 - 2010, respectively.

Objective: The study was design to evaluate whether identifying certain complications <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> may be useful in predicting neurodevelopment outcome. Observational longitudinal study, over six years, of a cohort of premature infants. The risk factors quantified were: gestational age, birth weight, birth asphyxia, necessity of mechanical ventilation, specific pathology (respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia),results of Amiel –Tison, neurologic exam at discharge, total numbers of evaluations, final results of evaluations, acording to Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2 nd Edition at two years corrected age. The data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 18. 0. From January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2011 the incidence <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> in our maternity was 13. 65 %. 33. 03 % (n= 2182) were prematures and from these, 1845 were enrolled in this study. Complications <b>of</b> <b>prematurity,</b> developped by included patients were : respiratory distress syndrome (70. 51 %), apneea <b>of</b> <b>prematurity</b> (40. 76 %), perinatal asphyxia (22. 82 %), intraventricular hemorrhage (17. 01 %), periventricular leukomalacia (5. 42 %). Birth weight less than 1500 g, type of mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, results of Amiel-Tison evaluations and adherence of patients to program are predictive factors for results of final evaluation. Gestational age remains the leading factor in including premature infants in a specific group of risk (F= 69. 65, p<< 0. 01, 95 %CI).
