40|$|The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) {{has over}} 3 1, 000 miles of track {{covering}} a 24 state region. Planning and scheduling the production, packaging, delivery, and pickup of rail, {{involved in the}} maintenance of this network, {{is a very complex}} task. Manually scheduling only a subset of the resources required has historically taken several days to accomplish. Moreover, the inability to fully schedule all resources can lead to inefficient resource utilization. This paper describes the Rail Train Scheduler (RTS), designed and developed to capture the expertise of the UPRR scheduler, generate production schedules of all the resources involved, and provide a decision support tool for determining the best mix of resources required. RTS is an expert system that uses constraint satisfaction and domain specific heuristics to produce good, low cost schedules. It has been deployed since January, 1996. UPRR anticipates a savings of about $ 500, 000 per year from the use of RTS. ntroduction This paper describes a scheduling application, the Rail Train Scheduler (RTS), designed and developed for Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR). The primary motivation for developing the application was to solve a major operational problem relating to the allocation of resources required to provide rail to Union Pacific track construction and repair projects. The current manual process schedules some of the resources (weld plant capacity and rail material) but just assumes adequate availability of the necessary rail handling equipment. It also focuses on the delivery of rail while generally ignoring the pickup of used <b>rail</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-use...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Re-use of unused {{medicines}} {{returned from}} patients is currently considered unethical in the UK {{and these are}} usually destroyed by incineration. Previous studies suggest {{that many of these}} medicines may be in a condition suitable <b>for</b> <b>re-use.</b> Methods All medicines returned over two months to participating community pharmacies and GP surgeries in Eastern Birmingham PCTwere assessed for type, quantity and value. A registered pharmacist assessed packs against set criteria to determine the suitability <b>for</b> possible <b>re-use.</b> Results Nine hundred and thirty-four return events were made from 910 patients, comprising 3765 items worth £ 33 608. Cardiovascular drugs (1003, 27 %) and those acting on the CNS (884, 24 %) were most prevalent. Returned packs had a median of 17 months remaining before expiry and one-quarter of packs (1248 out of 4291) were suitable <b>for</b> possible <b>re-use.</b> One-third of those suitable <b>for</b> <b>re-use</b> (476 out of 1248) contained drugs in the latest WHO Essential Drugs List. Conclusion Unused medicines are returned in substantial quantities and have considerable financial value, with many in a condition suitable <b>for</b> <b>re-use.</b> We consider it appropriate to reopen the debate on the potential <b>for</b> <b>re-using</b> these medicines in developing countries where medicines are not widely available and also within the UK...|$|R
