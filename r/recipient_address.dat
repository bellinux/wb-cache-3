25|$|Hastings, {{while being}} no great detective himself, serves Poirot in many ways. A former British Army officer in World War I, he is brave. He has courage {{and is often}} used by Poirot for {{physical}} duties such as catching and subduing a criminal. Poirot likes to tease Hastings about being dim-witted at times, but he clearly enjoys the Captain's company. In The Mysterious Affair at Styles and The ABC Murders, Hastings plays {{a prominent role in}} the resolution of the mystery, with a casual observation that leads Poirot to the guilty party: In case of the former, by mentioning that Poirot had to straighten some spill holders and ornaments in Styles, he prompts Poirot to realise that someone had moved them, causing Poirot to discover a crucial piece of evidence. In case of the latter, he suggests that the error in <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> of a letter by the murderer was deliberate, thus causing Poirot to realise the murderer had attached greater importance to that particular murder.|$|E

5000|$|Mail Server Monitoring : Email servers use {{a variety}} of methods to combat {{directory}} harvesting attacks, including to refuse to communicate with remote senders that have specified more than one invalid <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> within a short time, but most such measures carry the risk of legitimate email being disrupted.|$|E
50|$|A free electronic-delivery {{option is}} also available, which sends the postcards as e-mail to the <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|A windowed {{envelope}} is {{a conventional}} envelope {{with a plastic}} (typically film or BOPS Bi-oriented polystyrene films) window to allow the <b>recipient's</b> <b>address</b> to be printed on the paper contained within.|$|R
50|$|The use of VERP {{requires}} each {{message to}} be sent once for every recipient, instead of once to each receiving SMTP server. This is because of a limitation of SMTP, which allows multiple <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses</b> to be specified in a single transaction, but only one sender address. When there are many subscribers in the same domain, a mailing list that is not using VERP can combine multiple deliveries into a single transaction. It connects to the appropriate server for the domain, gives the single sender <b>address,</b> the <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses,</b> and then sends the message contents only once.|$|R
50|$|This example {{shows the}} {{simplest}} possible method of matching a VERP {{to a list}} subscriber: the entire <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> is included within the return path, with the at sign replaced by an equals sign because a return path with two at signs would be invalid. Other encoding schemes are possible.|$|E
5000|$|The ADMD's MSA authenticates the user, either {{based on}} its IP address or some other SMTP Authentication means. Depending on the <b>recipient</b> <b>address,</b> the message can follow the normal path or pass through a mailing list or a {{forwarding}} service. [...] B can be an outbound SMTP proxy or a smarthost.|$|E
5000|$|Because lists have varying {{methods for}} adding IP {{addresses}} and/or URIs, {{it can be}} difficult for senders to configure their systems appropriately to avoid becoming listed on a DNSBL. For example, the UCEProtect DNSBL seems to list IP addresses merely once they have validated a <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> or established a TCP connection, even if no spam message is ever delivered.|$|E
5000|$|Yahoo! Mail {{is often}} used by spammers to provide a [...] "remove me" [...] email address. Often, these {{addresses}} are used to verify the <b>recipient's</b> <b>address,</b> thus opening the door for more spam.|$|R
50|$|IBM Notes can {{function}} as an IMAP and POP email client with non-Domino mail servers. The system can retrieve <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses</b> from any LDAP server, including Active Directory, and includes a web browser, although it can be configured by a Domino Developer to launch a different web browser instead.|$|R
50|$|An iMail message {{consists}} of three components, the message envelope, the message header, and the message body. The message header contains control information, including, minimally one or more <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses.</b> Usually descriptive information is also added, such as a subject header field and a message submission date/time stamp.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK and NZ, freepost {{envelopes}} can be hand {{addressed by}} the sender; this simply requires including the word ‘FREEPOST’ and the recipient’s permit number {{as part of the}} address. (This technique {{can not be used to}} send mail to merely anyone, who would then have to pay for it; the permit number and the <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> must match for the recipient to be billed.) ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} reasons why an email may bounce. One reason is if the <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> is misspelled, or simply does not exist on the {{receiving}} system. This is a user unknown condition. Other reasons include resource exhaustion — such as a full disk — or {{the rejection of the}} message due to spam filters. In addition, there are MUAs that allow users to bounce a message on demand.|$|E
50|$|A Cypherpunk remailer {{sends the}} message to the {{recipient}} stripping away the sender address on it. One can not answer a message sent via a Cypherpunk remailer. The message sent to the remailer can usually be encrypted, and the remailer will decrypt it and send it to the <b>recipient</b> <b>address</b> hidden inside the encrypted message. In addition, it is possible to chain two or three remailers, so that each remailer can't know who is sending a message to whom. Cypherpunk remailers do not keep logs of transactions.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on configuration, submit {{may then}} call deliver, or deliver may run later {{as part of}} {{periodic}} processing. Deliver does no direct processing of messages; instead it invokes outbound (delivery) channels, tells them which messages to process, and gives them a list of <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses</b> for each message.|$|R
5000|$|The actual {{e-mail message}} {{generated}} to the <b>recipient</b> <b>addresses</b> will usually {{be a short}} random phrase such as [...] "hello", {{so as not to}} trigger a spam filter. The actual content that is to be advertised will be sent in a later campaign to just the valid email addresses.|$|R
50|$|In the 90s, {{the company}} enabled its {{customers}} to make purchases online. The customers can search for products according to various categories, seasons and prices. The flowers and bouquets {{ordered by the}} customers are not physically sent from company’s office. Instead, a network of florists is used to deliver fresh flower greetings to <b>recipient’s</b> <b>address.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The ARF {{format is}} {{designed}} to be extensible, providing for generic spam reporting, e.g. from users to some anti-spam center or help desk, or for opt-out operations. The format defines a new MIME type to be included in a [...] attachment, and includes at least the headers of the offending message. Although the draft description acknowledges that some operators may choose to modify or redact that portion for privacy or legal reasons, it recommends that the entire original email message be attached, including the unmodified <b>recipient</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiving}} {{mail server}} verifies the sender address, by verifying both {{parts of the}} sender address - the domain name (part after the @ character), and the local part (part before the @ character). The {{first step is to}} establish a successful SMTP connection to the mail exchanger for the sender address. The mail exchanger is found by looking up the MX records in the domain's DNS zone. The second step is to query the exchanger, and make sure that it accepts the address as a valid one. This is done {{in the same way as}} sending an email to the address, however the process is stopped after the mail exchanger accepts or rejects the <b>recipient</b> <b>address.</b> These are the same steps the receiving mail server would take to bounce mail back to the sender, however in this case no mail is sent. The SMTP commands sent out are: ...|$|E

50|$|Sending an E-card {{to a given}} {{recipient}} invariably involves {{giving that}} <b>recipient's</b> email <b>address</b> to the E-card service - a third party. As with other third-party email services (such as mailing-list companies), the operator has the chance to misuse this address. One example of misuse is if the E-card service sends advertisements to the <b>recipient's</b> <b>address.</b> Under anti-spam rules used by major ISPs, such advertisements would be spam, since the recipient never asked ("opted in") to receive them. The E-card sender {{as well as the}} service could be held responsible for the act of spamming, since while the service sent the spam, the E-card sender provided the address.|$|R
50|$|The header {{contains}} the <b>recipient's</b> email <b>address,</b> {{the date of}} the message, and information proving that the required computation has been performed. The presence of the <b>recipient's</b> email <b>address</b> requires that a different header be computed for each recipient. The date allows the recipient to record headers received recently and to ensure that the header is unique to the email message.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{displayed}} {{number is}} in the <b>recipient's</b> <b>address</b> book, some handsets will display the name from the local address book {{in place of the}} transmitted name. Some VoIP providers use Asterisk (PBX) to provide similar functionality at the server; this may lead to multiple substitutions with priority going to the destination user's own handset as the last link in the CNAM chain.|$|R
