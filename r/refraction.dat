5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a <b>refraction</b> matrix describing the <b>refraction</b> at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another <b>refraction</b> matrix applies.|$|E

5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of <b>refraction</b> to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of <b>refraction</b> and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

40|$|High order <b>refractions</b> {{have been}} found to have a great impact on optical {{particle}} sizing using phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) especially when the relative refractive index of the media is less than one. The high order <b>refractions</b> cannot be neglected because of the differences in spatial frequencies and motion directions of each order. A model of phase-size correlation is proposed that considers these high order <b>refractions.</b> By using the conversion factors of the high order <b>refractions,</b> the particle diameter can be determined. The capability of the newly developed method was evaluated by using generalized Lorenz Mie theory (GLMT), which was validated by experiments. The results of the simulation and experiments are compared with those based on the conventional method. An optimization method for accurately sizing air bubbles in water has been suggested...|$|R

5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading {{experts in the}} field, including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis to be on shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of <b>refraction</b> depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Reflections, <b>refractions,</b> and {{caustics}} {{are very}} important for rendering global illumination images. Although many methods {{can be applied to}} generate these effects, the rendering performance is not satisfactory for interactive applications. In this paper, complex ray-object intersections are simplified so that the intersections can be computed on a GPU, and an iterative computing scheme based on the depth buffers is used for correcting the approximate results caused by the simplification. As a result, reflections and <b>refractions</b> of environment maps and nearby geometry can be rendered on a GPU interactively without preprocessing. We can even achieve interactive recursive reflections and <b>refractions</b> by using an object-impostor technique. Moreover, caustic effects caused by reflections and <b>refractions</b> can be rendered by placing the eye at the light. Rendered results prove that our method is sufficiently efficient to render plausible images interactively for many interactive applications...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{peripheral}} <b>refractions</b> {{obtained with}} a Hartmann-Shack sensor instrument and two commercial autorefractors. METHODS: Measurements were {{taken with a}} laboratory Hartmann-Shack instrument, the Canon Autoref R- 1, and the Shin-Nippon SRW- 5000 to 40 degrees in both directions along the horizontal meridian. RESULTS: The agreement between the Hartmann-Shack instrument and the Shin-Nippon autorefractor was good, with mean power differences varying from 0. 3 D {{at the center of}} the visual field to 0. 7 D at the edge of the visual field. The agreement between the Hartmann-Shack and Canon Autoref R- 1 was not as good, but neither was the agreement between the Shin-Nippon and Canon instruments. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between the instruments was similar to other comparisons made between different techniques. Combined with the high magnitude of peripheral <b>refractions,</b> this indicates that the Hartmann-Shack sensor technique can validly be extended from measuring central <b>refractions</b> to measuring peripheral <b>refractions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser <b>refraction</b> specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric <b>refraction</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of <b>refraction</b> of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe seek {{unbiased}} {{methods for}} estimating the target vergence required to maximize visual acuity based on wavefront aberration measurements. Experiments {{were designed to}} minimize the impact of confounding factors that have hampered previous research. Objective wavefront <b>refractions</b> and subjective acuity <b>refractions</b> were obtained for the same monochromatic wavelength. Accommodation and pupil fluctuations were eliminated by cycloplegia. Unbiased subjective <b>refractions</b> that maximize visual acuity for high contrast letters were performed with a computer controlled forced choice staircase procedure, using 0. 125 diopter steps of defocus. All experiments were performed for two pupil diameters (3 mm and 6 mm). As reported in the literature, subjective refractive error does not change appreciably when the pupil dilates. For 3 mm pupils most metrics yielded objective <b>refractions</b> that were about 0. 1 D more hyperopic than subjective acuity <b>refractions.</b> When pupil diameter increased to 6 mm, this bias changed in the myopic direction and the variability between metrics also increased. These inaccuracies were small compared to the precision of the measurements, which implies that most metrics provided unbiased estimates of refractive state for medium and large pupils. Thus a variety of image quality metrics {{may be used to}} determine ocular refractive state for monochromatic (635 nm) light, thereby achieving accurate results without the need for empirical correction factors...|$|R

5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of <b>refraction</b> is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{was first}} observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young a century later. Young described iridescence {{as the result}} of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with <b>refraction</b> as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.|$|E
5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of <b>refraction.</b> Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E
