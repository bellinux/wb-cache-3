5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> expansion.|$|E
5|$|An {{interior}} rearrangement {{was completed}} around 1942.

5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: there was no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans, an {{estimated}} 80% of the land was covered in forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees. Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.|$|E

5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, <b>room</b> <b>for</b> disagreement remained. The synthesis attributed problems with market clearing to sticky prices that failed to adjust to changes in supply and demand. Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E

There were entrances, a vestibule, luggage space, waiting <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> public, booking-offices, a telegraph, a pharmacy, and a bar at the front. There was a large operation hall in the center which separated <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> {{the first and second}} class passengers from the <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> the third class passengers.|$|R
