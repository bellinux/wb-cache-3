50|$|The <b>riding</b> <b>habit</b> worn {{by women}} riding sidesaddle {{originally}} {{was similar to}} clothing worn in everyday life. It wasn’t until {{the second half of}} the 16th century that a <b>riding</b> <b>habit</b> specifically designed <b>for</b> sidesaddle riding was introduced, though sidesaddle habit design still tended to follow fashion of the day. In 1875, the first safety skirt was introduced and later evolved into the open-sided apron.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} five {{metropolitan areas}} where {{light rail transit}} (LRT) lines serve as regional transit backbones. The paper defines a successful LRT-based regional transit system as one with high <b>riding</b> <b>habit</b> and productivity <b>for</b> all combined modes in each metropolitan area, and as also having high LRT ridership and productivity. Based on these criteria, Portland emerges as a successful LRT-based regional transit system. Our analysis reveals three characteristics that explain the Portland transit system’s strong performance: the network’s dispersed nature, the overlay of a higherspeed, high-frequency regional LRT network atop the local bus system, {{and the use of}} transfers to provide passengers easy access to a diverse array of destinations. We examine the performance of all five metropolitan areas with respect to these characteristics using a combination of agency data and insights from interviews with key informants...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} women's suits were <b>riding</b> <b>habits,</b> {{which consisted}} of a tailored coat or jacket and matching skirt from the 1660s. Practical and sturdy, <b>riding</b> <b>habits</b> were worn not only on horseback, but also for travel and other daytime pursuits. Jacket-and-skirt ensembles not intended for riding appeared in the later 19th century. Both <b>riding</b> <b>habits</b> and walking suits reflected the skirt and sleeve styles of the day. Until the 1910s, coat and skirt ensembles were usually described as [...] "costumes" [...] rather than suits, and the term [...] "suit", as applied to such sets, was not usual until after the First World War.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of a recreational cycle route suitable for bike touring for the Toowoomba Region. The route in particular would be from Toowoomba to Crows Nest, tailored to one type of cycling and designed to attract tourists to the region. Mountain Biking was the type of cycling chosen as it caters {{to a wide range of}} people and is an established tourism generator in many other areas of the world. A survey was conducted to establish the <b>riding</b> <b>habits</b> and demand <b>for</b> cycle routes from residents of the Toowoomba Region. The results from this survey were analysed and used to form criteria for the analysis of the preliminary routes that were chosen. In total six preliminary routes were chosen and the two best in terms of analysis were combined to form one route that is to be recommended to the Toowoomba Regional Council. The chosen route starts in at Queens Park, Toowoomba, passes to the western side of Mt Kynoch, through Highfields, to Cooby Dam, over Pepper Mountain and through to Crows Nest. The trail provides for all rider difficulty levels and incorporates other recreational opportunities in the Cooby Dam area. The trail is recommended to the Toowoomba Regional Council with the view to expand Cooby Dam into a Mountain Biking Park and to link the trail into the Lockyer Forest Trails. This strategy will attract cycling tourists to the Toowoomba Region and boost the local economy...|$|R
