40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for providing high availability {{to the demands}} of cloud's clients. To attain this objective, failover stratagems for cloud computing using integrated checkpointing algorithms are purposed in this paper. Purposed strategy integrate checkpointing feature with load balancing algorithms and also make multilevel checkpoint to decrease checkpointing overheads. For implementation of purposed failover strategies, a cloud simulation environment is developed, which has the ability to provide high availability to clients in case of failure/recovery of service nodes. primary objective of this research work is to improve the checkpoint efficiency and prevent checkpointing from becoming the bottleneck of cloud data centers. In order to find an efficient checkpoint interval, checkpointing overheads has also considered in this paper. By varying <b>rerun</b> <b>time</b> of checkpoints comparison tables are made which can be used to find optimal checkpoint interval. The purposed failover strategy will work on application layer and provide highly availability for Platform as a Service (PaaS) feature of cloud computing...|$|E

5000|$|The Adventures of Timothy Pilgrim was a children's {{television}} serial {{consisting of}} ten 15-minute installments which originally aired in 1975 on Canada's TVOntario and was <b>rerun</b> countless <b>times</b> afterward {{over the next}} decade on TVO as well as on other Canadian educational channels and PBS.|$|R
50|$|This episode aired {{after an}} {{extended}} break (June-October), {{which was not}} originally planned. TNT had begun replaying the entire series on a daily schedule {{at the same time}} that Season 5 had begun airing, and wanted anyone who had started watching the show then to be able to watch the conclusion live. Movements of Fire and Shadow thus became an impromptu cliffhanger as the network chose to leave off after it aired to give the <b>reruns</b> <b>time</b> to catch up. Ironically, although he did not consider Movements of Fire and Shadow to be a cliffhanger, JMS had already put a recap in the teaser of The Fall of Centauri Prime, coming as it did at the end of a five episode sequence.|$|R

50|$|After {{the show}} ended its run in 1992, Mega Channel reran it a {{multitude}} of times {{over the next few}} years, together with other much-loved series like Oi Treis Harites. The show ended up being <b>reran</b> more <b>times</b> than any other on Greek television (more than 12 reruns within 5 years). Eventually, a tired television audience and sarcastic TV magazine reviews forced the show off the air after the summer of 1997.|$|R

50|$|Many live {{television}} specials were telecast during the pre-videotape era. Among {{the most successful}} were the 1955 and 1956 telecasts of Peter Pan, a 1954 musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie's 1904 play, starring Mary Martin, and Cyril Ritchard. This was such a hit that the show was restaged and rebroadcast (this time on videotape) with the same two stars {{and most of the}} rest of the cast in 1960, and <b>rerun</b> several <b>times</b> after that. The Peter Pan telecasts marked the first-ever telecasts of a complete Broadway musical with most of its original cast.|$|R
50|$|The Attacker You! anime, despite mediocre {{ratings in}} Japan, {{achieved}} a strong level of popularity in several European countries, including Italy (Mila e Shiro, due cuori nella pallavolo), France (Jeanne et Serge), Spain (called both Dos fuera de serie and Juana y Sergio), Portugal (Joana e Sérgio, O Desafio dos Anjos) and Poland (Pojedynek Aniolow).

The German marque claimed a 1-2 finish and had two other cars in the top eight, with Andrew Cowan in a 280E repeating his success of nine years previous, followed home by teammate Tony Fowkes in a similar car. Paddy Hopkirk, this time driving a Citroën CX, took the final podium spot.|$|R
50|$|Criticized as a {{derivative}} and pale imitation of Switch and handicapped by {{its lack of}} a consistent broadcast day and time, The Feather and Father Gang garnered disappointing ratings and was cancelled after 14 episodes. Its last original episode aired on July 30, 1977, and the last <b>rerun</b> in prime <b>time</b> was on August 6, 1977.|$|R
50|$|Since {{there were}} no <b>reruns</b> at that <b>time,</b> the series often used plot devices and plot twists to allow Collyer to have {{vacation}} time.

At other times, Batman (Stacy Harris) and Robin (Ronald Liss) appeared on the program in Superman's absence.|$|R
50|$|The serial was {{controversially}} {{pulled off}} air by Doordarshan in 1996 and the producers had {{to file a}} suit in court for reinstatement.

It later enjoyed hugely successful prime <b>time</b> <b>reruns</b> on Star Plus and Sony Entertainment Television.|$|R
