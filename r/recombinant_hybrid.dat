40|$|Most notable {{among the}} acute phase {{proteins}} is serum amyloid A (SAA), levels {{of which can}} increase 1000 -fold during infections, aseptic inflammation, and/or trauma. Chronically elevated SAA levels {{are associated with a}} wide variety of pathological conditions, including obesity and rheumatic diseases. Using a <b>recombinant</b> <b>hybrid</b> of the two human SAA isoforms (SAA 1 and 2) that does not exist in vivo, numerous in vitro studies have given rise to the notion that acute phase SAA is a pro-inflammatory molecule with cytokine-like properties. It is however unclear whether endogenous acute phase SAA per se mediates pro-inflammatory effects. We tested this in samples from patients with inflammatory arthritis and in a transgenic mouse model that expresses human SAA 1. Endogenous human SAA did not drive production of pro-inflammatory IL- 8 /KC in either of these settings. Human neutrophils derived from arthritis patients displayed no signs of activation, despite being exposed to severely elevated SAA levels in circulation, and SAA-rich sera also failed to activate cells in vitro. In contrast, two recombinant SAA variants (the hybrid SAA and SAA 1) both activated human neutrophils, inducing L-selectin shedding, production of reactive oxygen species, and production of IL- 8. The hybrid SAA was approximately 100 -fold more potent than recombinant SAA 1. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>hybrid</b> SAA and SAA 1 activated neutrophils through different receptors, with recombinant SAA 1 being a ligand for formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR 2).

The resulting PCR-generated sequences can then be difficult, if not impossible, to authenticate. In contrast, single primer extension (SPEX) -based approaches can genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms from ancient fragments of DNA as accurately as modern DNA.

Ideal vaccines should include only immunoprotective antigens with no toxin activity. As an initial step towards obtaining a well-defined and simplified DTP vaccine, a pertussis toxin-tetanus toxin chimeric protein was constructed.

When administered to mice, the hybrid protein was found to be nontoxic but immunogenic. In addition, it was capable of inducing strong protection against tetanus and some protection against pertussis, as well as eliciting a pertussis toxin-neutralizing antibody response.

Substitution of the N-terminal contact region of stefin B by the corresponding KD 2 sequence resulted in a calpain inhibitor of K-i = 188 nM. Deletion of L 110, which forms a beta -bulge in family 1 and 2 cystatins but is lacking in KD 2, improved inhibition of mu -calpain 4 - to 8 -fold. All engineered cystatins were temporary inhibitors of calpain due to slow substrate-like cleavage of a single peptide bond corresponding to Gly 9 -Ala 10 in chicken cystatin. Biomolecular interaction analysis revealed that, unlike calpastatin, the cystatin-type inhibitors do not bind to the calmodulin-like domain of the small subunit of calpain, and their interaction with the mu -calpain heterodimer is completely prevented by a synthetic peptide comprising subdomain B of calpastatin domain 1. Based on these results we propose that (i) cystatin-type calpain inhibitors interact with the active site of the catalytic domain of calpain in a similar cystatin-like mode as with papain and (ii) the potential for calpain inhibition is due to specific subsites within the papain-binding regions of the general cystatin fold. ...|$|R

In haploid–diploid species, the genetic structure of the two phases {{of the life cycle}} can be analysed separately in natural populations. Such life cycles provide a unique opportunity to estimate the frequency of hybrid genotypes in diploid sporophytes and meiotic recombinant genotypes in haploid gametophytes allowing the effects of reproductive barriers preventing fertilization or preventing meiosis to be untangle. The level of hybridization between E. siliculosus and E. crouaniorum was quantified along the European coast. Clonal cultures (568 diploid, 336 haploid) isolated from field samples were genotyped using cytoplasmic and nuclear markers to estimate the frequency of hybrid genotypes in diploids and recombinant haploids. We identified admixed individuals using microsatellite loci, classical assignment methods and a newly developed Bayesian method (XPloidAssignment), which allows the analysis of populations that exhibit variations in ploidy level. Over all populations, the level of hybridization was estimated at 8. 7 %. Hybrids were exclusively observed in sympatric populations. More than 98 % of hybrids were diploids (40 % of which showed signs of aneuploidy) with a high frequency of rare alleles. The near absence of haploid <b>recombinant</b> <b>hybrids</b> demonstrates that the reproductive barriers are mostly postzygotic and suggests that abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis following hybridization of species with different genome sizes could be a major cause of interspecific incompatibility in this system...|$|R

40|$|A {{major focus}} in {{speciation}} genetics {{is to identify}} the chromosomal regions and genes that reduce hybridization and gene flow. We investigated the genetic architecture of mating behavior in the parasitoid wasp species pair Nasonia giraulti and Nasonia oneida that exhibit strong prezygotic isolation. Behavioral analysis showed that N. oneida females had consistently higher latency times and broke off the mating sequence more often in the mounting stage when confronted with N. giraulti males compared with males of their own species. N. oneida males produce a lower quantity of the long-range male sex pheromone, (4 R, 5 S) - 5 -hydroxy- 4 -decanolide (RS-HDL). Crosses between the two species yielded hybrid males with various pheromone quantities and these males were used in mating trials with females of either species to measure female mate discrimination rates. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis involving 475 <b>recombinant</b> <b>hybrid</b> males (F 2), 2148 reciprocally backcrossed females (F 3), and a linkage map of 52 equally spaced neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers plus SNPs in 40 candidate mating behavior genes revealed four QTL for male pheromone amount depending on partner species. Our results demonstrate that the RS-HDL pheromone {{plays a role in}} the mating system of N. giraulti and N. oneida, but also that additional communication cues are involved in mate choice. No QTL were found for female mate discrimination which points at a polygenic architecture of female choice with strong environmental influences...|$|E
40|$|Nonribosomal peptide synthetases are modular {{enzymes that}} {{assemble}} peptides of diverse structures and important biological activities. Their modular organization provides a {{great potential for}} the rational design of novel compounds by recombination of the biosynthetic genes. Here we describe the extension of a dimodular system to trimodular ones based on whole-module fusion. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>hybrid</b> enzymes were purified to monitor product assembly in vitro. We started from the first two modules of tyrocidine synthetase, which catalyze {{the formation of the}} dipeptide dPhe-Pro, to construct such hybrid systems. Fusion of the second, proline-specific module with the ninth and tenth modules of the tyrocidine synthetases, specific for ornithine and leucine, respectively, resulted in dimodular hybrid enzymes exhibiting the combined substrate specificities. The thioesterase domain was fused to the terminal module. Upon incubation of these dimodular enzymes with the first tyrocidine module, TycA, incorporating dPhe, the predicted tripeptides dPhe-Pro-Orn and dPhe-Pro-Leu were obtained at rates of 0. 15 min- 1 and 2. 1 min- 1. The internal thioesterase domain was necessary and sufficient to release the products from the hybrid enzymes and thereby facilitate a catalytic turnover. Our approach of whole-module fusion is based on an improved definition of the fusion sites and overcomes the recently discovered editing function of the intrinsic condensation domains. The stepwise construction of hybrid peptide synthetases from catalytic subunits reinforces the inherent potential for the synthesis of novel, designed peptides...|$|E
40|$|Hybridization between {{differentiated}} lineages {{can have}} many different consequences depending on fitness variation among hybrid offspring. When introduced organisms hybridize with natives, the ensuing evolutionary dynamics may substantially complicate conservation decisions. Understanding the fitness consequences of hybridization {{is an important}} first step in predicting its evolutionary outcome and conservation impact. Here, we measured natural selection caused by differential viability of hybrid larvae in wild populations where native California Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma californiense) and introduced Barred Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium) have been hybridizing for 50 – 60 years. We found strong evidence of hybrid vigor; mixed-ancestry genotypes had higher survival rates than genotypes containing mostly native or mostly introduced alleles. Hybrid vigor may be caused by heterozygote advantage (overdominance) or <b>recombinant</b> <b>hybrid</b> vigor (due to epistasis or complementation). These genetic mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and we find statistical support for both overdominant and recombinant contributions to hybrid vigor in larval tiger salamanders. Because recombinant homozygous genotypes can breed true, a single highly fit genotype with a mosaic of native and introduced alleles may eventually replace the historically pure California Tiger Salamander (listed as Threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act). The management implications of this outcome are complex: Genetically pure populations may not persist into the future, but average fitness and population viability of admixed California Tiger Salamanders may be enhanced. The ecological consequences for other native species are unknown...|$|E
50|$|Ex vivo and {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} the <b>recombinant</b> human SAA1 <b>hybrid</b> protein has strong {{chemotactic}} activity for neutrophils and macrophages. This effect is believed to be mediated through FPR2, a G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor. The same receptor also mediates the cytokine-like activity of the recombinant SAA1, resulting in an elevated expression of IL-8 in neutrophils. The recombinant SAA1 has been reported to induce the expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p40, as well as immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-23, IL-33 and growth-stimulatory cytokines such as G-CSF.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{challenging}} {{new approach to}} understanding ecological systems especially in urban and urbanised areas. Synthesising current ideas and approaches the book develops an historic context to ecological fusion and <b>recombinant</b> or <b>hybrid</b> ecosystems. With massive climate change and other environmental fluxes, this volume provides insight into consequences for future ecologies. Invasive and non-native or alien species are spreading, often aggressively around the globe. However, much current thinking in ecology and nature conservation fails to accommodate the consequences of changing environmental conditions and fusion of both species and ecological communities. Whether or not conservationists accept ecological change, factors such as urbanisation and globalisation combine with climate and other changes to trigger new hybrid communities and ecologies. Embedding this approach into current ecological thinking this book presents an overview of ideas set in the exemplar case study area of the British Isles. However, the approaches, ideas and conclusions presented here will find application in ecosystem studies and in nature conservation around the world...|$|R
40|$|Rapid recent {{developments}} in DNA sequencing and genetic marker technologies call {{for the establishment of}} cost-effective, automated phenotyping assays for evolutionary biology and systematics, so that the effects of DNA polymorphisms and epigenetic changes on the phenotype can be evaluated. We discuss the use of digital image-based morphometrics in evolutionary biology and systematics with special emphasis on studies of taxa with porous genomes, i. e., taxa that do not conform to the traditional view of whole-genome isolation between species. We outline the phenomenon of the 'phenotypic mosaic' in taxa with porous genomes using well-documented examples from the literature and describe three important challenges arising for taxonomists: (1) character conflict in phylogenetic studies, (2) biased sampling of traits in morphological studies, and (3) cryptic ecological speciation. We demonstrate the use of geometric morphometrics using a combined molecular and morphometric dataset from an interspecific hybrid zone between two divergent Eurasian species of Populus, P. alba (white poplar) and P. tremula (European aspen). Elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) -based morphometric data were collected for 527 leaf specimens from 84 trees with known genomic composition as determined by a set of 30 nuclear DNA microsatellites. In addition, to demonstrate the ease of scoring functionally relevant phenotypes via digital image analysis, quantitative differences in leaf reflectance were examined and their structural basis determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The EFA results indicate a heritable inter-individual component for symmetric aspects and an important intra-individual component for asymmetric aspects of variation in leaf outlines. Symmetric traits displayed a striking variety of phenotypes in hybrids compared to their parental species, consistent with the notion of the phenotypic mosaic. Linear discriminant analysis of these morphometric traits revealed (1) clear differentiation between parental species and (2) divergence between <b>recombinant</b> <b>hybrids</b> and their sympatric backcross parent P. alba, mediated primarily by two P. tremula-like and two transgressive traits. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of geometric morphometrics to interrogate multiple independent phenotypic characters and detect individual traits affected by introgression and divergence in taxa with porous genomes. Digital image-based morphometrics holds great promise for large-scale studies of relationships between DNA polymorphism and phenotypes in evolutionary biology...|$|R
