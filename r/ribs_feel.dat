[...] "I make my vow, my <b>ribs</b> <b>feel</b> as though {{every one of}} them were broken in twain. I tell thee, good fellow, I did think there was never a man in all Nottinghamshire could do to me what thou hast done this day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Lister (Craig Charles) and Cat (Danny John-Jules) {{have been}} flying around in Starbug 2 {{for the past}} three weeks searching for them. They come across the same [...] "time hole" [...] that Starbug 1 did and, despite Cat's reservations, go through it. They close in on Starbug 1 using a homing device and land near the lake where it crash-landed. Upon exiting Starbug 2 Lister {{complains}} of feeling some pain—he suddenly has a black eye and his <b>ribs</b> <b>feel</b> like they've been cracked. Lister also discovers to his confusion that he is dry after leaving the lake Starbug 1 crashed in. They have a series of bizarre reverse incidences such as [...] "un stealing" [...] a tandem and [...] "un hitching" [...] a lift.|$|E
6000|$|If a man {{frequently}} passes unjust judgments, {{takes up}} false attitudes, intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and {{falls into the}} consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the less ugly because they are ascribed to [...] "temper." [...] Especially I object to the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a breakage in my <b>rib,</b> I <b>feel</b> it no compensation that to-day he vows he will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day {{as long as he}} lives. Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in his lifelong gentleness. The utmost form of placability I am capable of is to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful of my own offences, to bear him no malice. But I cannot accept his amends.|$|R
5000|$|Augusta was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} a scandalous duel. From 1778 until 1788, she had a permanent relationship with baron Hans Henric von Essen. In 1788, her lover, von Essen, proposed to the heiress Charlotta Eleonora De Geer (1771-1798) and was accepted. His proposal was met with great dislike within the royal court because of sympathy with the popular Augusta von Fersen, and he was challenged to a duel by his rival count Adolph Ribbing. Ribbing had also proposed to De Geer but had been declined by her father, which he refused to accept, as he believed he had reasons to think that De Geer preferred him and that Essen had proposed because of economic reasons, and because von Essen's proposal and marriage plans was commonly disliked within the court. The duel {{took place in the}} royal riding house in the presence of several officers and led to the defeat of von Essen, who was slightly injured. The duel was regarded as a scandal and a crime against the King [...] The duel affair also caused great <b>Ribbing</b> to <b>feel</b> great animosity against the king, and he was later involved in the regicide against Gustav III.|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that the Book of Job can be {{understood}} as the record of a rib between Job and Yahweh, which involves ultimately the issue of the relationship of man and God. A definition of the term rib is first established by reviewing its occurrences in the other books of the Old Testament. Although it includes a wide range of contention, the term signifies essentially a legal complaint initiated by an aggrieved party, convinced of the rectitude of his position, against the party whom he holds responsible for the grievance. Ribs occur in both non-secular and secular contexts, the distinction being whether or not Yahweh is involved as a direct participant. In non-secular ribs, He may be the instituter, or an advocate, or the object of the faultfinding. An exegetical study follows of the nine periscopes in the Book of Job containing the term rib. This supports the conception of the rib as a legal complaint, and reveals a wealth of juridical vocabulary. Next, an examination of the speeches of Job and Yahweh brings the whole book into the category of <b>rib.</b> <b>Feeling</b> himself the victim of unceasing harassment by Yahweh, and hopeless of finding any means of arbitration, Job turns to the language and processes of the law court and institutes a rib. He does not accept the advice of the three friends who argue the traditional doctrine that his suffering is retribution for his sins. He is confident that a judicial hearing will establish his innocence and solve the problems of his unmerited tribulations and the seeming injustice of Yahweh. This, then, {{is an example of the}} Old Testament non-secular rib in which Yahweh is the object of faultfinding. In conclusion, the forensic terminology pertaining to the rib between Job and Yahweh is tabulated, and the significance of the outcome of this lawsuit is examined. God’s appearance out of the whirlwind is not the legal encounter which Job has anticipated. On the contrary, it drives home to Job the total inappropriateness of his demand that God face him as an adversary-at-law. His rib has been based on the faulty premise that man can limit God, can question God’s ways. But these are beyond human comprehension, above the rules of human justice and retribution. The divine truth revealed to Job is not a reasonable answer to the questions raised in his rib; it is an answer on the religious or experiential level, and, though it, he is reconciled to the transcendent God. Job’s rib has not been futile...|$|R
6000|$|As he spoke, Damian de Lacy, {{the best}} {{youthful}} wrestler in Cheshire, received no soft {{fall on the}} floor of the dungeon. He arose slowly and astounded; but the Palmer had now thrown back both hood and dalmatique, and the features, though bearing marks of age and climate, were those of his uncle the Constable, who calmly observed, [...] "I think, Damian, thou art become stronger, or I weaker, since my breast was last pressed against yours in our country's celebrated sport. Thou hadst nigh had me down in that last turn, but that I knew the old De Lacy's back-trip as well as thou.--But wherefore kneel, man?" [...] He raised him with much kindness, kissed his cheek, and proceeded; [...] "Think not, my dearest nephew, that I meant in my late disguise to try your faith, which I myself never doubted. But evil tongues had been busy, and it was this which made me resolve on an experiment, the result of which has been, as I expected, most honourable for you. And know, (for these walls have sometimes ears, even according to the letter,) there are ears and eyes not far distant which have heard and seen the whole. Marry, I wish though, thy last hug had not been so severe a one. My <b>ribs</b> still <b>feel</b> the impression of thy knuckles." ...|$|R
