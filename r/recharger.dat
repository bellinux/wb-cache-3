40|$|<b>Recharge</b> {{can take}} two main forms, direct <b>recharge</b> from {{rainfall}} infiltrating {{the ground or}} indirect <b>recharge</b> from leakage from wadi beds. The <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the West Bank can be summarised as rainfall <b>recharge,</b> wadi <b>recharge,</b> urban <b>recharge</b> processes and irrigation losses. Rainfall <b>recharge</b> is the predominant form of <b>recharge,</b> whilst wadi <b>recharge,</b> urban and irrigation losses are only minor components. However, these minor components can be locally important. The <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the Wadi Natuf catchment are varied and complex. The four main geological strata through which <b>recharge</b> takes place are: • Jerusalam • Upper Lower Beit Kahil • Lower Beit Kahil • Hebron The main aquifer units are karstic which receive <b>recharge</b> once a wetting threshold is exceeded. This assumption is supported by field observations (Messerschmid, 2003) and a field experiment close to the study area (Lange et al., 2003). Other minor aquifers receive <b>recharge</b> and distribute water laterally to springs. Flow from springs, if not used for water supply or irrigation, can then be routed to other aquifer units or as loss from wadis. High intensity rainfall can produce overland runoff and wadi flow. Flowing wadis loose water to all but the Yatta formation. <b>Recharge</b> can, therefore, occur by two methods, direct infiltration from rainfall and from losses from wadi beds. There are four main <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the aquifers of the West Bank; 1. Direct <b>recharge</b> from rainfall 2. Indirect <b>recharge</b> from wadi losses 3. <b>Recharge</b> from urban water supply and waste water proceses 4. <b>Recharge</b> from irrigation losses The difference between rainfall and potential evaporation, known as effective rainfall, is the main control on direct <b>recharge</b> from rainfall. Rainfall is greatest {{in the north and}} west whereas potential evaporation is the highest in the south and east.

Point <b>recharge</b> is highly transient and may occur in relatively short-time periods, yet is capable of <b>recharging</b> a large volume of water, even from a single extreme rainfall event. Preferential groundwater flows are observed in karst aquifers with local fresher water pockets of low salinity that develop around point <b>recharge</b> sources. Measurable fresh water plumes develop only when a large quantity of surface water enters the aquifer as a point <b>recharge.</b> In fresh water plumes, the difference in chloride concentrations in diffuse and point <b>recharge</b> zones decreases as the plumes become enriched through mixing. The relative contributions to total <b>recharge</b> from point sources using the measured gap between groundwater and rainwater chloride in the chloride vs. δ 18 O plot is not necessarily indicative of sinkholes not directly <b>recharging</b> the aquifer. In karst aquifers, <b>recharge</b> estimation methods based on groundwater age distribution; average annual rainfall and basin average chloride in the conventional chloride mass balance (CMB) method are questionable due to theoretical limitations and key assumptions of these methods not being met. In point <b>recharge</b> dominant groundwater basins, application of: watertable fluctuation, numerical groundwater modelling, Darcy flow calculation or water budget methods {{are more suitable for}} <b>recharge</b> estimation as they are independent of the particular mode of <b>recharge.</b> The duality of the <b>recharge</b> mechanism in karst aquifers suggests that modification to the CMB method may be required to include both point and diffuse <b>recharge</b> components...|$|R

Land surface Models (LSMs) could be a valuable tool for estimating current <b>recharge</b> and projecting changes due to future climate change. In this study, simulations of three LSMs (Noah, Mosaic and VIC) obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS- 2) are used to estimate potential <b>recharge</b> in the western US. Modeled <b>recharge</b> was compared with published <b>recharge</b> estimates for several aquifers in the region. Annual <b>recharge</b> to precipitation ratios across the study basins varied from 0. 01 % to 15 % for Mosaic, 3. 2 % to 42 % for Noah, and 6. 7 % to 31. 8 % for VIC simulations.

40|$|Existing {{studies on}} the impacts of climate change on {{groundwater}} <b>recharge</b> are either global or basin/ location-specific. The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important {{in the development of}} water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater <b>recharge</b> across the western United States (west of 100 degrees longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of <b>recharge</b> processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published <b>recharge</b> budget components were converted into four standard <b>recharge</b> mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems <b>recharge.</b> Future changes in individual <b>recharge</b> mechanisms and total <b>recharge</b> were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on <b>recharge</b> were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each <b>recharge</b> mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in <b>recharge</b> only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10 - 20 % in total <b>recharge</b> across the southern aquifers, but {{with a wide range of}} uncertainty that includes no change. Second, the northern set of aquifers will likely incur little change to slight increases in total <b>recharge.</b> Third, mountain system <b>recharge</b> is expected to decline across much of the region due to decreased snowpack, with that impact lessening with higher elevation and latitude. Factors contributing the greatest uncertainty in the estimates include: (1) limited studies quantitatively coupling climate projections to <b>recharge</b> estimation methods using detailed, process-based numerical models; (2) a generally poor understanding of hydrologic flowpaths and processes in mountain systems; (3) difficulty predicting the response of focused <b>recharge</b> to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; and (4) unconstrained feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and <b>recharge</b> in highly developed aquifer systems...|$|R

This study uses the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method to estimate the direct <b>recharge</b> and a groundwater balance to estimate the deep <b>recharge</b> on unconfined aquifers. The WTF method employs data of the aquifer water levels and its specific yield to estimate the direct <b>recharge.</b> The groundwater balance considers the direct <b>recharge</b> estimated by the WTF method, as the water input in the system and outputs as the base flow and deep <b>recharge.</b> The <b>recharge</b> was estimated at four areas at the watershed of Alto Rio Grande city, Minas Gerais (MG) state, in Brazil.
