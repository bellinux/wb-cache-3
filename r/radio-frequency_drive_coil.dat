40|$|Objective: Gradiometers {{have the}} {{advantage}} of increasing measuring sensitivity, which is particularly useful in magnetic induction spectroscopy (MIS) for bio-impedance measurements. Traditional gradiometers use a pair of field sensing coils equally distant and on opposite sides of a <b>drive</b> <b>coil,</b> which provides high immunity to interference. In this paper, a ferrite-cored coaxial gradiometer probe of 29 [*]mm diameter has been developed for measuring the impedance spectra of cervical tissues in vivo. Approach: It consists of a ferrite rod with outer ferrite confinement screening in order to eliminate the signals from surrounding tissue. The magnetic screening efficiency was compared with an air-cored gradiometer probe. For both gradiometer probes, a <b>drive</b> <b>coil</b> and two sensing coils were wound on a borosilicate glass former aligned coaxially with two sensing coils equidistant from the <b>drive</b> <b>coil.</b> The signal sensitivity of those two MIS gradiometers has been measured using saline samples with a conductivity range between 0. 1 and 1. 1 S m− 1. Finite element methods using COMSOL Multiphysics have been used to simulate the distribution of sensitivity to conductivity over the face of each probe and with depth. Main Results: The ferrite-cored probe has a sensitivity confined to the volume defined by the gap between the ferrite core and outer tube of ferrite while the air-cored probe without any magnetic shielding had a wide sensitivity over the face and the side of the probe. Four saline samples and one of distilled water with conductivities from 0. 1 to 1. 1 S m− 1 have been used to make conductivity measurements at frequencies of 50 [*]kHz, 100 [*]kHz, and 300 [*]kHz.
