25|$|The rudder is a spade type made of {{fiberglass}} with a brass <b>rudder</b> <b>stock.</b> The {{rudder port}} is a bronze tube with bushings top and bottom. Steering is by tiller. The tiller head is cast bronze and is held {{on with a}} pin. This pin passes horizontally through the head and stock. An allen screw locks into a key in the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock.</b> The tiller is straight grained ash. The rudder can be rotated a full 360 degrees if needed.|$|E

Both the propellers and the {{propeller shafts}} were retained in the refit. The original steering arrangement, a single center rudder mounted at the sternpost, was also retained although newer icebreakers have twin rudders for improved manoeuvrability.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1903, when {{entering}} Tillamook Bay, Elmore struck {{ground on}} the bar several times, splintering the keel towards {{the stern of the}} vessel, losing the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock,</b> and causing the ship to leak around the stern. [...] When Elmore returned to Astoria, the ship was beached for a partial inspection by the Lloyd's agent. This was not sufficient to determine {{the full extent of the}} damage, so the ship was ordered to proceed to Portland. [...] The ship was fully insured. [...] The underwriters were M.C. Harrison & Co. It was initially thought that the damage would cost about $3,000 to repair. The ship was taken to the Supple yard in Portland for extensive repairs. [...] The work was scheduled to be completed by Monday, November 2, 1903, and consisted of a new keel, a new propeller, new planking, and a thorough painting.|$|E
50|$|On 29 June 2008 she was {{involved}} in a grounding incident at Warrenpoint after an electrical failure put the controllable pitch propellers into full astern, which was a default setting. Moondance suffered damage to her <b>rudders</b> and <b>rudder</b> <b>stocks.</b> An underlying cause of the accident was insufficient manning of the bridge and engine room and lax operating procedures on board Moondance.Moondance returned to service on 16 October 2008 running between Heysham and Warrenpoint. With the arrival of , Moondance was redeployed to the newly opened Fredericia, Denmark to Moss Norway route. This route began operation on 2 February 2009.|$|R
40|$|The ships {{have long}} been an easy play-ground for {{hydraulic}} technologies. When high torques and low speeds are demanded on board ship, both technical and traditional reasons usually lead to hydraulic solutions. In fact, the conventional electrical machines are better suited for low-torque, high-speed applications, and coupling gears must be used to reduce the speed. However, oil-free direct-drive alternatives can be conceived, by new concepts of low-speed permanent-magnet actuators fed by low-frequency inverters. This paper shows the experimental results obtained with a linear permanent-magnet motor designed for direct coupling to <b>rudder</b> <b>stocks</b> or stabilizing fins. The prototype weights 700 kg and features a thrust-to-weight ratio of 5. Even better results {{can be obtained by}} using composite materials for the machine frame. The machine features a full structural redundancy and inherent fault tolerance, thanks to the modular construction. The present research has been carried out in the framework of the Italian Defence's Research National Program...|$|R
50|$|Because the Olson 30 is {{so light}} for its length {{and has a}} {{relatively}} overpowered (for its design's age) sail profile, the Olson 30 excels at light-air sailing. In moderate conditions the sailing performance is unremarkable. In heavy conditions upwind the Olson 30 suffers {{from the lack of}} weight to drive the bow and the boat through waves, however downwind in a breeze the Olson 30 surfs and planes readily, and it was for these conditions the boat was ultimately designed. The <b>stock</b> <b>rudder</b> tends to be underpowered in heavy air, leading to difficult driving downwind especially in short waves and big wind.|$|R
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock.</b> The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E

5000|$|In the ABS Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels, it {{is defined}} as the {{distance}} on the summer load line from the fore side of the stem to the centerline of the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock.</b> Scantling length need not be less than 96%, nor more than 97% of the length of the summer load line.|$|E
50|$|During {{survey work}} in Antarctica in January 2006, the ship's {{engineering}} staff discovered that her rudder was apparently {{loose on the}} stock. Her work period was cut short and she returned to Mare Harbour in the Falkland Islands for further inspections. Det Norske Veritas, the ship's assurance certification company, instructed that the ship should dock at the nearest available port - the nearest large enough being Puerto Belgrano, Argentina's largest naval base, where Endurance docked in mid-March 2006. Without hotel services on board, the ship's company moved to shore-side accommodation {{in the city of}} Bah√≠a Blanca, some twenty kilometres west of Puerto Belgrano. The rudder was removed for repairs, and once it was {{on the floor of the}} drydock, a dockers' strike followed. The ship remained there for nearly three weeks. Picket lines formed at the gates of the naval base, preventing Endurances crew from relieving the stranded duty watch on board. When the strike broke, the rudder was replaced and welded into position and the ship left Puerto Belgrano in early April 2006. She returned to Portsmouth via Lisbon and to drydock again for further engineering work on the <b>rudder</b> and <b>stock.</b>|$|R
50|$|A US {{district}} {{court found that}} the Smith Voyager was not seaworthy. The Smith Voyager was overloaded with grain when she departed Freeport, Texas. The court found evidence that the steam evaporators and boilers were not working correctly. Also there was a leak in the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> gland, thus sea water was leaking into the steering room and was draining into the bilge.|$|E
50|$|A tiller or till is a lever {{attached}} to a rudder post (American terminology) or <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> (English terminology) of a boat that provides leverage {{in the form of}} torque for the helmsman to turn the rudder. The tiller can be used by the helmsman directly pulling or pushing it, but it may also be moved remotely using tiller lines or a ship's wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Length between perpendiculars (often {{abbreviated}} as p/p, p.p., pp, LPP, LBP or Length BPP) is {{the length}} of a ship along the waterline from the forward surface of the stem, or main bow perpendicular member, to the after surface of the sternpost, or main stern perpendicular member. When there is no sternpost, the centerline axis of the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> is used as the aft end of the length between perpendiculars.|$|E
50|$|Measuring to {{the stern}} post or <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> was {{believed}} to give a reasonable idea of the ship's carrying capacity, as it excluded the small, often unusable volume contained in her overhanging ends. On some types of vessels this is, for all practical purposes, a waterline measurement. In a ship with raked stems, naturally that length changes as the draught of the ship changes, therefore it is measured from a defined loaded condition.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 11 November 1966, Isle of Gigha was en route from Gigha to Port Ellen, loaded with {{commercial}} vehicles. Rolling in a moderate sea, a <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> cracked making steering difficult. Unsecured loads shifted, causing the ferry to list and capsize. , , and the Islay lifeboat {{took part in the}} rescue, but three men were lost. That afternoon, Admiralty salvage vessel Succour secured a tow. The righted casualty was taken to Greenock.|$|E
50|$|Before the 16th century most sailing vessels were {{sufficiently}} {{small that}} they could be steered by a single individual working the handle of the tiller which was directly connected to the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> and therefore the rudder. However, as ships became taller and broader there came a need for a steering device which could stretch from the top deck of the stern down to the tiller which was sometimes located more than a deck below. The whipstaff became the temporary solution.|$|E
50|$|The Wayfarer World was {{introduced}} in 1997 and {{was designed as a}} collaboration between Ian Proctor and his son Keith. Made in GRP with no woodwork it has a removable aft storage tank, a self draining cockpit, and a spinnaker chute. The <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> is of aluminium alloy. Until the MkIV this was the only version with an asymmetric spinnaker, although it can not be used in class races in the UK. It has proved successful in both racing and cruising, including a North Sea crossing 1998.|$|E
50|$|The {{propeller}} shafts that connect the propulsion motors to the four-bladed steel propellers and the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> {{all have a}} diameter of 400 mm. The 3.5 m bow propellers weigh 8360 kg while the bigger stern propellers have a diameter of 4.2 m and weigh 9800 kg each. Both the propellers and the {{propeller shafts}} were retained in the refit. The original steering arrangement, a single center rudder mounted at the sternpost, was also retained although newer icebreakers have twin rudders for improved manoeuvrability.|$|E
50|$|Auk {{accordingly}} altered {{course at}} 0905 and plunged through the rough seas and a veritable curtain of fog, while her foghorn blared its warning. She anchored that afternoon, but waves breaking over the after deck foiled attempts to rig the heavy-duty wrecking pumps into the after hold (into which {{the water was}} coming, through the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock)</b> since {{it was impossible to}} remove the hatch without allowing more water to get below in the process. Then just as the fog began to lift to the northward and the ship prepared to weigh anchor and get underway, the anchor engine jammed. Quick repairs enabled Auk's men {{to begin the process of}} hoisting up the hook, and the minesweeper got underway and eventually reached safe haven in the lee of Montauk Point.|$|E

5000|$|Mechanical or [...] "wind vane" [...] {{self-steering}} {{started out}} as a way to keep model sail boats on course.Before the advent of Radio Control, model yacht racing (started before WW1) was typically contested on long narrow ponds, and the number of stops along the banks was counted as a penalty in the final result. Initially a system of counterweight on the tillers was devised to compensate for the weather helm when the model boat heeled in a gust. These crude systems evoved in a more sophisticated system called Braine Gear after its inventor, George Braine. The Braine steering gear was a fine-tuned system of quadrant on the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> driven by the tension of the mainsail sheet and damped by a rubber band. A more sophisticated system called the vane gear was later devised, it relied on a small vane or airfoil driving the main rudder via an adjustable system of clockwork gears vane gear rudder. It was very similar to the later vane driven autopilots seen on transatlantic yachts such as Blondie Hasler's self steering rudder.Some transatlantic singlehanded sailors used a crude form of self steering devices to cross the Atlantic Ocean in the 1920s and 1930s, the most notable being Frenchman Marin Marie (Pierre Durand Coupel de Saint Front) who crossed the Atlantic twice in the 1930s, first on a sailing yacht called Winnibelle II and secondly on a motor pinnace called Arielle.|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} method is presented that models fluid structural interaction problems for three-dimensional marine structures. Flow can be modelled with either potential or viscous incompressible flow. The structure deformation is modelled by a shell finite element formulation. The two fields are coupled by a domain decomposition approach that uses virtual surfaces to transfer information. A typical spade rudder has been modelled for steady-state three-dimensional {{problems in a}} free stream and in way of a propeller race. These computational models have been tested for mesh dependancy in both the fluid and structural domains {{as well as the}} virtual surface definition. The results show increased correlation to experimental data from uncoupled hydrodynamic modelling as well as detailed structural deformation. Of note is the variation in <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> bending moment from that utilised by classification society scantling rules...|$|E
40|$|This {{propeller}} {{was built}} in 1943 by Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Sparrows Point, Maryland. She was owned by the U. S. Maritime Commission until 1943, when she was sold to the U. S. Navy. She was then sold to Gulf Oil Company in 1947, Maryland Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in 1958, Pioneer Steamship Company in 1960, Columbia Transportation Company in 1962, and American Steamship Company in 2006. In 1947, she became "GulfOil," in 1961, she became "Pioneer Challenger," in 1962, she became "Middleton," and in 2006, she became "American Victory. " She was converted to dry bulk carrier in 1961, then to a self-unloader in 1982. She was laid down as "Marquette. " She was built under U. S. Maritime Commission contract as T 3 -S-A 1 tanker. As "GolfOil," she collided with tanker "S. E. Graham", August 7, 1958, at Newport, Rhode Island. The "Graham," who was carrying one million gallons of gasoline, exploded, killing fifteen crewmen from "GulfOil. " As "Pioneer Challenger," she struck a submerged object off Buffalo, New York, July 30, 1961, suffering severe bottom damage. As "Middletown," she underwent an inspection on December 6, 1978, that discovered broken <b>rudder</b> <b>stock...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out into the geometrical and flow parameters which control the interaction between a ship rudder and propeller. The tests used the 3. 5 m x 2. 5 m low speed wind tunnel at the University of Southampton. This report presents further results for a series of rectangular all-movable rudders of varying span and chord but with a constant NACA 0020 profile. A four-bladed, 800 mm diameter, adjustable pitch propeller was used. This porpeller is {{a modified version of the}} Wageningen B 4. 40 series. Open-water results for the modified design were validated against published data. The test consisted of a series of studies into the effect of propeller pitch ratio, rudder aspect ratio, position of the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock,</b> coverage of the rudder by the propeller race, lateral and vertical separation of rudder and propeller. A five-component strain-gauge dynamometer was used to measure lift, drag and three moments on the rudder and a rotating strain gauge dynamometer the developed thrust and torque of the propeller. In addition, both spanwise and chordwise pressure distributions were measured on the rudder surface. Propeller revolutions were varied between 0 and 3, 000 rpm and tunnel wind speeds up to 20 m/s were used. Results are presented in the form of non-dimensional coefficients of lift (C subscript L), drag (C subscript D), spanwise (CP subscript s) and chordwise (CP subscript c) position of the centre of pressure variation with incidence for the rudder. The influence of rudder on propeller performance is given in terms of non-dimensional thrust (K subscript T) and torque (K subscript Q) coeffient variation with advance ratio (J). The surface pressure measurements on the rudder are presented as both a spanwise distribution of the local lift coefficient (C subscript L) and as a surface pressure distribution. The results offer an insight into the physics of rudder-propeller interaction. The data presented are suitable for design purposes and will also be of considerable use in numerically modelling the flow interaction and in the development of more advanced ship manoeuvring simulations...|$|E
