5|$|Johnston {{played as}} a left-arm fast bowler {{when the ball}} was new and conducive to pace bowling, before <b>reverting</b> to finger spin when it became old and lost its shine. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, {{reinforcing}} the new ball pairing of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were {{regarded as one of}} the finest pace duos of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short and sharp new ball bursts against the local batsmen. England had agreed that a new ball would be available every 55 overs, a milestone that usually came more frequently than the old regulation of 200 runs for every ball. This allowed Australiawho had the superior pace attackmore frequent use of a shiny ball, which swung at high pace. Johnston typically bowled pace after the first-choice pair had finished their new ball spell, before <b>reverting</b> to spin when the ball was worn. He took 27 wickets at 23.33 in the Tests, making him the equal-leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall, who averaged 19.62. The Australian pacemen’s tally was substantially more than the next best, recorded by England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22.|$|E
5|$|Parrosaurus missouriensis {{was once}} again moved in 1979, to the genus Hypsibema, this time by Donald Baird and John R. Horner. In the late 1970s, Bruce L.

He was able to purchase the property from {{a member of the}} Chronister family, and in the 1980s, test excavations were performed by Stinchcomb, David Parris, and Barbara Grandstaff, leading them to conclude that H. missouriensis was actually a hadrosaur rather than a sauropod. Thomas Holtz has suggested <b>reverting</b> to Parrosaurus for this species.|$|E

James I sold the castle in the early 17th century and the remaining fortifications were dismantled in the mid-17th century after the English Civil War. By 1928, the castle was in a poor condition, with little interest being shown in it from locals or its owner, Lady Lorna Curzon-Howe.

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the reverse α–γ {{transformation}} by the diffusion mechanism in the Fe– 22.7  wt.% Ni– 0.58  wt.% С alloy gives rise to the formation of complex grain structure of <b>reverted</b> austenite. The diffraction pattern of the <b>reverted</b> austenite has not demonstrated signs of internal stress. The half-width of diffraction peaks of the <b>reverted</b> austenite was significantly smaller than that of the initial austenite. The <b>reverted</b> austenite grains formed in the course of α–γ transformation displayed different orientations and sizes including nanoscale ones. They also possessed significant concentration inhomogeneity characterized by continuous change of nickel concentration in the whole range of its values.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reverted</b> rubber (steam) {{aquaplaning}} {{occurs during}} heavy braking {{that results in}} a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film {{of water on the}} runway is required to facilitate this type of aquaplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the tire off the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to <b>revert</b> to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced <b>reverted</b> rubber aquaplaning, are distinctive 'steam-cleaned' marks on the runway surface and a patch of <b>reverted</b> rubber on the tire.|$|R
