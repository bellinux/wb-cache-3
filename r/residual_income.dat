40|$|Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags ist es, die Auswirkungen von Kongruenzdurchbrechungen auf die Bewertung, Vorteilhaftigkeitsprüfung und Performance-Messung mit buchwertbasierten Residualgewinnen zu bestimmen. Wir wählen dazu folgendes Vorgehen: Kapitel II stellt die Wirkungsweise des Kongruenzprinzips zur Erzielung von Barwertkompatibilität buchwertbasierter Residualgewinne vor. Kapitel III definiert Kongruenzdurchbrechungen bzw. dirty surplus {{accounting}} und beschreibt deren Auftreten in den gängigen Rechnungslegungssystemen. Kapitel IV stellt den Kern der Untersuchung dar und zeigt zunächst anhand von Fallbeispielen die aus Kongruenzdurchbrechungen resultierenden Verzerrungen. Diese werden schließlich formalisiert und Ansätze zu deren Korrektur vorgeschlagen. Kapitel V geht der Frage nach, ob dirty surplus accounting den "link between {{accounting and}} finance" brüchig werden läßt. Wir werden sehen, daß Kongruenzdurchbrechungen für die empirische Anwendung von Residualgewinnen weit weniger Gefahren bergen, als man zunächst anzunehmen geneigt ist. Kapitel VI faßt zusammen. It {{is the goal}} of the paper to determine the impacts of dirty surplus accounting on valuation, net present value calculation, and performance measurement with <b>residual</b> <b>incomes</b> based on book values. The proceeding is as follows: Chapter II introduces the mechanics of the clean surplus relation to assure valuations with <b>residual</b> <b>incomes</b> that are equivalent to those with cash flows. Chapter III defines violations of the clean surplus principle, or dirty surplus accounting respectively, and describes its occurrence in various accounting systems. Chapter IV contains the quintessence of the analysis and identifies on the basis of examples the distortions resulting from dirty surplus accounting. Chapter V goes into the matter if dirty surplus accounting breaks the link between accounting and finance. We will see that violations of the clean surplus relation hold far less pitfalls for empirical applications than previously assumed. Chapter VI concludes.

Using a comprehensive set of 29 governance measures in 4 categories for Taiwanese firms, we find that governance related to ownership structure and divergence between cash flow rights and control rights are important for a firm's market valuation. In particular, information about shareholdings of board directors and supervisors, shareholdings of controlling family, and voting rights are influential for firm value. Controlling for book value and <b>residual</b> <b>incomes</b> in the model, these governance measures track much of the remaining firm valuation that is unrelated to a firm's financial performance.

The findings indicate that the new firm effect on entrepreneurship is positive and statistically significant and remains even after controlling for a worker's ability. Moreover, workers with the lowest and the high- est abilities {{are more likely to}} enter entrepreneurship. This effect on worker's ability is also true for the entrepreneurial transition among incumbent firm employees. In contrast, among new firm employees, women entering into entrepreneurship are drawn from the lowest and the next highest tails of the <b>income</b> <b>residual</b> distribution, while men entering into entrepreneurship are drawn only from the lowest tails of the <b>income</b> <b>residual</b> distribution.

The market value of equity is determined by forecasting <b>residual</b> operating <b>income,</b> which is calculated by charging operating income for the operating assets at a required return that accounts for the tax benefit that comes from borrowing to raise cash for the operations. The model assumes that the firm maintains a deterministic financial leverage ratio, which tends to converge quickly to typical steady-state levels over time.
