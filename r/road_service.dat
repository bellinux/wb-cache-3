Another possible option would have Long Island Rail <b>Road</b> <b>service</b> restored with service to seven stations along the right-of-way, with service ending in Howard Beach. The line would serve upwards of 250,000 passengers per day and would provide access to JFK Airport from Midtown Manhattan. In February 2015, the Regional Plan Association suggested having some F trains, after running through the 63rd Street Tunnel, be rerouted to operate over the Lower Montauk Branch of the LIRR running through underserved Maspeth and Glendale and then meeting up with the Rockaway Beach Branch in Rego Park.|$|E

40|$|<b>Roads</b> <b>Service</b> is {{an agency}} of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, {{responsible}} for over 24, 500 km of public <b>roads.</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Service’s</b> unique position in the United Kingdom and Ireland as the region’s sole road authority gives it the ability to implement consistent and cost-effective practices. <b>Roads</b> <b>Service's</b> overall aim is to ensure the provision of a safe and effective road network throughout Northern Ireland (NI), recognising {{the need to protect}} the quality of the environment. <b>Roads</b> <b>Service</b> employs 1035 professional, technical and administrative staff and 950 direct labour workers. The workforce is involved {{in a wide range of}} work activities, each with its own particular hazards and risk control measures. It is important, therefore, that the safety controls identified through risk assessment are implemented in a way that promotes an improved level of safety across the organisation. Since 1997 <b>Roads</b> <b>Service</b> has completely revised its approach to safety. The resulting system, embracing many of the principles of the International Quality Standard (ISO 9000), is exceptional within the NI public sector and perhaps even within NI industry. This paper addresses the many positive aspects facing an organisation taking this approach...|$|R

25|$|The Super Domes {{were not}} a {{complete}} success in Milwaukee <b>Road</b> <b>service.</b> The heavy cars gave a rough ride, and {{the seats in the}} dome area gave an inferior view because they lay too low compared to the dome's supporting bulkheads. Still, the fame of having the first full-length dome car was good publicity for the railroad. After the discontinuance of the Olympian Hiawatha in 1961 Super Domes were seen on some of the services the Milwaukee Road operated with the Union Pacific, including the City of Denver. In 1964 the Milwaukee Road sold six of the domes to the Canadian National Railway, along with the sleeper-lounge Skytop Lounges. The remaining four domes continued on the Twin Cities Hiawatha.|$|E
25|$|During the {{previous}} year inquiries {{had been made of}} other municipalities as to their experience in the operation of motor buses, principally with a view to motorbus operation on the Carlton <b>Road</b> <b>service,</b> as Bamford was under no obligation to continue his service of horsebuses. As a result, three Thorneycroft double-deckers were ordered for early delivery following Bamford’s withdrawal earlier in the year. Bamford had agreed to take over the tenancy of the Muskham Street stables from 25 March in succession to Common’s Nottingham Carriage Company, which had gone into liquidation, but, following the refusal of the West Bridgford Urban District Council to grant licences for operation in their area, Bamford was released from his agreement.|$|E

25|$|In April 1907, {{barely a}} month after it had started, the Station Street to Colwick <b>Road</b> <b>service</b> was dis{{continued}}, and the cars from the Sherwood to Station Street route continued via London Road to Trent Bridge. This meant that all cars from Sherwood ran to Trent Bridge, alternating via Arkwright Street and via London Road. At about this time the terminal line at Trent Bridge was moved from {{the centre of the}} road to the kerbside outside Hickling’s Cafe, and a new terminal line was put in for the London Road cars. For the first four or five weeks of running all London Road cars had to use the existing Trent Bridge terminus, causing much congestion.|$|E

The early electronic media age arrived with the opening of commercial radio station 2BS on 1 January 1937.

This, together {{with the opening of the}} Wells Road Wilford Road trolleybus service on 20 March, brought about tramcar working alterations. The frequency of the Arnold to Trent Bridge service was reduced, while alternate cars ran only between Villiers Road, Sherwood, and Trent Bridge.
