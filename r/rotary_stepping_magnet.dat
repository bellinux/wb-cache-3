The frequency of conformational fluctuations may modulate the catalytic rate at individual reaction steps.

40|$|A lunar outpost {{will have}} need for deep {{drilling}} operations for both explorative and practical purposes. As in any drilling operation, the cuttings must be cleared from the hole. The hard vacuum of the lunar environment renders conventional flushing methods of cutting removal unfeasible, and requires {{a new system of}} removal. A <b>rotary</b> <b>stepped</b> auger (RSA) is a simple mechanical method of removing dry cuttings from a deep hole, and is ideally suited to the lunar environment. The RSA consists of a helical auger with stepped ramps which allow cuttings to slide up the helix, but will prevent them from sliding back down. The auger is driven in a pulsed manner by applying a periodic function of acceleration to the auger shaft. These pulses will compel the cuttings to slide up the auger's helix while the stepped ramps prevent the cuttings from backsliding while the auger accelerates. A mathematical model of the RSA was developed and experimentally evaluated. The math model produced a good baseline design, but the experimental model required some tuning to account for the approximations made in the math model. This design is suited for lunar drilling because it is mechanically simple, integral to the drill string, requires no fluids, is suited to the dry soil, and has relatively low weight and power requirements...|$|R

40|$|F 1 -ATPase is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} molecular motor that can synthesize ATP driven by a mechanical torque. Its ability to function reversibly in either direction requires tight mechanochemical coupling between the catalytic domain and the rotating central shaft, as well as temporal control of substrate binding and product release. Despite great efforts and significant progress, the molecular details of this synchronized and fine-tuned energy conversion mechanism are not fully understood. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to reconcile recent single-molecule experiments with structural data and provide a consistent thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanistic description of the main rotary substep in the synthetic cycle of mammalian ATP synthase. The calculated free energy profiles capture a discrete pattern in {{the rotation of the}} central γ-shaft, with a metastable intermediate located—consistently with recent experimental findings—at 70 ° relative to the X-ray position. We identify this <b>rotary</b> <b>step</b> as the ATP-dependent substep, and find that the associated free energy input supports the mechanism involving concurrent nucleotide binding and release. During the main substep, our simulations show no significant opening of the ATP-bound β subunit; instead, we observe that mechanical energy is transmitted to its nucleotide binding site, thus lowering the affinity for ATP. Simultaneously, the empty subunit assumes a conformation that enables the enzyme to harness the free energy of ADP binding to drive ATP release. Finally, we show that ligand exchange is regulated by a checkpoint mechanism, an apparent prerequisite for high efficiency in protein nanomotors...|$|R

The prototype motor has shown that piezoelectric stack actuators {{can be used for}} rotary inchworm motor. The discrete linear motion of piezoelectric stacks can be converted into <b>rotary</b> <b>stepping</b> motion. The stacks with its high force and displacement output are suitable actuators for use in piezoelectric motor. The designed motor is capable of delivering high torque and speed. Critical issues involving the design and operation of piezoelectric motors were studied. The tolerance between the contact shoes and the rotor has proved to be very critical to the performance of the motor. Based on the prototype motor, a waveform optimization scheme was proposed and implemented to improve the performance of the motor. The motor was successfully modeled in MATLAB. The model closely represents the behavior of the prototype motor. Using the motor model, the input waveforms were successfully optimized to improve the performance of the motor in term of speed, torque, power and precision. These optimized waveforms drastically improve the speed of the motor at different frequencies and loading conditions experimentally. The optimized waveforms also increase the level of precision of the motor. The use of the optimized waveform is a break-away from the traditional use of sinusoidal and square waves as the driving signals. This waveform optimization scheme can be applied to any inchworm motors to improve their performance. The prototype motor in this dissertation as a proof of concept was designed to be robust and large.

40|$|AbstractThe proton-driven ATP synthase (FOF 1) is {{comprised}} of two <b>rotary,</b> <b>stepping</b> motors (FO and F 1) coupled by an elastic power transmission. The elastic compliance resides in the rotor module that includes the membrane-embedded FO c-ring. Proton transport by FO is firmly coupled to {{the rotation of the}} c-ring relative to other FO subunits (ab 2). It drives ATP synthesis. We used a computational method to investigate the contribution of the c-ring to the total elastic compliance. We performed principal component analysis of conformational ensembles built using distance constraints from the bovine mitochondrial c-ring x-ray structure. Angular rotary twist, the dominant ring motion, was estimated to show that the c-ring accounted in part for the measured compliance. Ring rotation was entrained to rotation of the external helix within each hairpin-shaped c-subunit in the ring. Ensembles of monomer and dimers extracted from complete c-rings showed that the coupling between collective ring and the individual subunit motions was independent {{of the size of the}} c-ring, which varies between organisms. Molecular determinants were identified by covariance analysis of residue coevolution and structural-alphabet-based local dynamics correlations. The residue coevolution gave a readout of subunit architecture. The dynamic couplings revealed that the hinge for both ring and subunit helix rotations was constructed from the proton-binding site and the adjacent glycine motif (IB-GGGG) in the midmembrane plane. IB-GGGG motifs were linked by long-range couplings across the ring, while intrasubunit couplings connected the motif to the conserved cytoplasmic loop and adjacent segments. The correlation with principal collective motions shows that the couplings underlie both ring rotary and bending motions. Noncontact couplings between IB-GGGG motifs matched the coevolution signal as well as contact couplings. The residue coevolution reflects the physiological importance of the dynamics that may link proton transfer to ring compliance...|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} robots that require {{some sort of}} safety measures in operation, compliant robots capable of interacting with the environment in a gentle way and perform self-adjustment according to the surroundings are of greater need nowadays. To achieve compliance, robots with variable stiffness are highly desirable. Principles of stiffness control for conventional actuators and rigid robots, such as spring-based variable stiffness and impedance mechanisms, have been thoroughly studied. In this thesis, {{the focus is on}} the novel principles of variable stiffness, in particular, on geometry-based and jamming-based methods, and their innovative applications in robotics. The utilization of 3 D printing technology in this research brings new insight into robotic research. At first, a non-assembly design of a compliant pneumatic stepper motor based on the ratchet and pawl mechanism is proposed for robotic drives. The proposed stepper motor can generate <b>rotary</b> <b>stepping</b> motion in response to a train of pulse air pressure. In addition, the pawl is designed as a compliant mechanism instead of conventional rigid component. As a result, the whole mechanism can be fabricated by 3 D printing without any post-assembly or installation of other components. However, the ratchet and pawl mechanism based stepper motor has speed limitation and velocity discontinuity problems. An updated design of non-assembly pneumatic stepper motor allows velocity control, and the switch between continuous motion and stepping motion. The key element to realize the dual motion pattern is an innovative design of a roller valve inspired by the cam-follower mechanism. The roller valve can also modulate the stiffness of robots by air pressure control. The proposed concept of non-assembly robotic design and fabrication based on 3 D printing and the proposed stepper motor designs can bring design innovation to various robots, such as household robots, industrial robots and so on. The geometry-based principle is applicable for compliant robots with rigid parts. For better compliance, jamming technique is applied to a proposed soft robotic spine design. The soft robotic spine is proposed based on the integration of particle jamming and ball joint. The combined mechanism effectively overcomes the unpredictable behavior of jamming due to particle rearrangement and deformation which severely affects its repeatability and stability. The experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13 times. The compliant spine mechanism can be coupled with an actuation method such as wires/tendons, or soft actuators for robotic applications. The research also finds that the particle jamming technology can bring unexpected effects into biomimetic robotic hand design. The proposed robotic finger design based on the integration of particle jamming and fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator provides an instructive model for robotic gripper applications. The prototype robotic hand demonstrates great performance of reliable grasping. Based on similar jamming interface, a bioinspired robotic palm is designed for the hand. The property of controllable stiffness of the palm allows a full contact of the palm with the object being grasped, thus providing a stable support for object grasping. The proposed palm design demonstrates a close emulation of human palm functions. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
