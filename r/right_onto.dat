5|$|From 1915, Summer Hill {{was served}} by trams from Hurlstone Park. Trams left New Canterbury Road {{and went down}} Prospect Road, then swung <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Smith Street. They turned onto Lackey Street, where they went right and {{terminated}} at the station. Low usage and rival buses saw the line closed in 1933, however some remains can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{was born}} in Bedum, a {{satellite}} town of Groningen, in the northeastern Netherlands. He took to football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben's skill in ball control and technical footwork made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC Groningen. Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> his left foot to score some quite spectacular goals.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
50|$|By 1984, Gerry Bron's Bronze Records were in {{financial}} difficulty {{leading to a}} hiatus in recording activity for Motörhead. Eventually, Motörhead managers Douglas Smith and Dave Simmons bought the band out of their contract and Bron subsequently sold the Bronze Records <b>rights</b> <b>onto</b> Legacy Records owner Ray Richards.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Benjamin Cardozo {{held that}} the Due Process Clause {{protected}} only those rights that were [...] "of {{the very essence of}} a scheme of ordered liberty" [...] and that the court should therefore incorporate the Bill of <b>Rights</b> <b>onto</b> the States gradually, as justiciable violations arose, based on whether the infringed right met that test.|$|R

5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} M-108 {{designation}} was commissioned along a rare three-legged route connecting the State Highway Ferry Docks with the Fort Michilimackinac State Historic Park and US 31. At one point while traveling westbound on M-108, motorists could turn <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> northbound M-108 or left onto southbound M-108. In {{preparation for the}} opening of the Mackinac Bridge, the Michigan State Highway Department transferred all of M-108 to local control in late 1957, decommissioning the designation at the same time. In 1960, the current M-108 was commissioned along the final routing.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|Continuing into Onondaga County and {{the village}} of Jordan, NY31 begins to make a turn northward while {{connecting}} to {{the northern end of}} NY317 (the former northern terminus of NY31C) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment {{in the shadow of the}} Thruway. Once inside the limits of Van Buren, NY31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of NY173 in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of Baldwinsville, where NY31 turns to the <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Downer Street to avoid the Seneca River to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY31 merges with NY690 northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.|$|E

5|$|MD 300 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 213 (Church Hill Road) {{in the northern}} part of the town of Church Hill. The highway heads east as two-lane Sudlersville Road and intersects MD 19 (Main Street) before leaving the town. The state highway heads northeast and intersects US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection next to a park and ride lot in the southwest quadrant. Traffic on MD 300 is required to turn <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> US 301, perform a U-turn, then turn right again to continue on MD 300. The highway curves east at Dudley Corners, where the route crosses Red Lion Branch and meets the southern end of MD 290 (Dudley Corner Road) and the north end of Benton Corners Road, which leads to the historic Dudley's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 and County Route 573 {{continue}} {{north on}} Highland Avenue and cross into Haddonfield, {{where the road}} becomes Chews Landing Road. The two routes meet County Route 551 Spur (Kings Highway), and they bear to the <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Kings Highway, heading northeast. They pass over New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line and the PATCO Speedline and then intersect County Route 561 (Haddon Avenue) Past CR 561, the road crosses the Cooper River into Cherry Hill Township. Route 41 and County Route 573 make a right turn onto a four-lane divided highway and intersect Route 154 (Brace Road). At this point, County Route 573 ends and Route 41 makes a left turn onto a six-lane divided highway, becoming state-maintained again and forming a concurrency with Route 154.|$|E
5|$|SR 243 {{begins at}} SR 74 in the San Jacinto Wilderness near Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The highway {{traverses}} north along a winding road through {{the community of}} Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left turn at the intersection with Circle Drive and continues through Pine Cove. The road continues through the forest past Mount San Jacinto State Park through Twin Pines and the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a few switchbacks and descending {{en route to the}} city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The highway continues as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a left onto Lincoln Street and a <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> 8th Street and terminating at a diamond interchange with I-10.|$|E

5|$|The route {{crosses the}} Big Timber Creek into Camden County, {{running along the}} border of Runnemede and Gloucester Township. County Route 544 veers to the <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Evesham Road, and Route 41 {{continues}} northeast on Clements Bridge Road into Runnemede. At the intersection with Route 168, Route 41 becomes county-maintained and runs concurrent with County Route 573. The two routes cross into Barrington, where they pass over the New Jersey Turnpike. Upon crossing a Conrail railroad line, Route 41 and County Route 573 run along the border of Barrington and Haddon Heights, with Barrington to the southeast and Haddon Heights to the northwest. The two routes pass under Interstate 295 before meeting U.S. Route 30 at a modified traffic circle.|$|E
5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E

25|$|When U.S. 52 {{went through}} Downtown Indianapolis, it went onto Brookville Road, then turned <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> English Avenue. It then joined U.S. 421 when it turns <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Southeastern Avenue. US 52/421 joined U.S. 40 {{when it turned}} left onto Washington Street. It then splits into Washington Street (westbound) and Maryland Street (eastbound). US 52 then turned <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> West Street (from West Street, it turned left onto Maryland Street). U.S. 52 turned left on either Indiana Avenue or 16th Street (US 136). Eventually, U.S. 52 would overlap U.S. 136 on 16th Street. It then turned <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Lafayette Road, which became Indianapolis Road when {{reaching}} Zionsville. When I-65 was completed through Downtown Indianapolis, U.S. 52 got on I-65 from the Lafayette Road interchange, and traveled on I-65 {{the rest of the}} way. In 1970, the route was re-routed onto the south belt of I-465 from Brookville Road to I-65. It was re-routed again on its current route around Indianapolis in either 2000 or 2001.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} line, as {{it existed}} {{at the end of}} 1885, traveled from Fulton Ferry in Downtown Brooklyn east to East New York, passing over York Street, turning <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Hudson Avenue (the relevant section is now called Navy Street), left onto Park Avenue, <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Grand Avenue (which has now been fragmented), left onto Lexington Avenue, <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Broadway, and slight left onto Fulton Street.

50|$|The {{controversy}} over {{the construction of the}} hydro-electric power station in Alta in 1979 brought Sami <b>rights</b> <b>onto</b> the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem ("Sámi soga lávlla") and flag (Sami flag) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the Finnmark Act was passed in the Norwegian parliament giving the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially {{to the people of the}} province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{departure}} from the Esplanade terminus, {{at the corner of}} Mandalong Road, trams travelled south-East along The Esplanade. After passing Botanic Road the line swung <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Henry Plunkett Reserve. From this point the line went off-road and ascended uphill onto its own reservation, travelling through a narrow rock cutting, now public walking track (pictured). After a steep ascent through the reserve the line crossed several small residential streets along the way, such as; Mulbring, Gordon, Plunkett and Beaconsfield Street, before once again entering onto Gordon Street where the line swung <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Middle Head Road. The tram then joined the main line at the point where Bradleys Head Road, Military Road and Middle Head Road meet. Travelling along Military Road and then Falcon Street, services to Chatswood turned <b>right</b> <b>onto</b> Willoughby Road, and eventually terminated at Chatswood railway station, Victoria Avenue Terminus, while services to Lane Cove travelled along the Pacific Highway, terminating at the Lane Cove council chambers. Services to Wynyard via North Sydney swung left into Miller street before crossing the Pacific Highway and entering onto the on ramp that led to the steel arch bridge that once crossed over the Bradfield Highway and thence to {{the eastern side of the}} Sydney Harbour Bridge.|$|E
