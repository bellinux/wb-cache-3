40|$|MDMA use is {{commonly}} accompanied {{by use of}} other substances, most notably cannabis. Both MDMA and cannabis have probable effects <b>on</b> <b>cognition.</b> This paper reviews research into long-term effects <b>on</b> <b>cognition</b> which are likely to represent neurotoxicity. Research is hampered by numerous confounds and methodological difficulties. With recent cannabis use there is both an acute and a residual effect <b>on</b> <b>cognition,</b> making it {{important to have a}} significant abstinence period from cannabis when studying effects of MDMA in recreational users of both substances. It would appear that MDMA does indeed have subtle long-term effects on complex memory and executive functions that are independent of cannabis and may remain with abstention. This is consistent with evidence of disruption of the serotonin system in animal and human studies. Chronic effects <b>on</b> <b>cognition</b> due to cannabis are less consistently demonstrated, but more sensitive tests including electrophysiological measures have revealed long-term deficits in attention...|$|R

40|$|Food {{restriction}} {{has been}} reported to have positive effects <b>on</b> <b>cognition.</b> This study examines how another environmental factor, daylength, can alter the impact of food <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> the brain and behavior. Female California mice (Peromyscus californicus), housed on either long days (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness) or short days (8 h of light and 16 h of darkness), were restricted to 80 % of their normal baseline food intake or provided with food ad libitum. Testing in a Barnes maze revealed that the effects of food <b>restriction</b> depended <b>on</b> photoperiod, and that these effects differed for acquisition vs. reversal learning. During acquisition testing, food restriction increased latency to finding the target hole in short-day mice but not in long-day mice. In reversal testing, food restriction decreased latency to finding the target hole in long-day mice but not in short-day mice. Latency to finding the hole was positively and independently correlated with both errors and time spent freezing, suggesting that changes in both spatial learning and anxiety-like behavior contributed to performance. Short days increased hippocampal expression of the synaptic protein, synapsin I, which was reversed by food restriction. Short days also reduced plasma corticosterone levels, but diet had no effect. There was no effect of diet or photoperiod on hippocampal expression of the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein. The present findings suggest that, in female California mice, the differential effects of food <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> acquisition and reversal learning are photoperiod-dependent. These results justify further testing of the relationship between food restriction and hippocampal synapsin I in the context of spatial learning...|$|R
