40|$|Eric Posner 2 ̆ 7 s and Adrian Vermeule 2 ̆ 7 s essay, <b>Reparations</b> for Slavery and Other Historic Injustices, seeks a {{framework}} for defining <b>reparations</b> and evaluating <b>reparations</b> claims. It explores a limited set of past <b>reparations,</b> {{as well as the}} connections between those asked to pay <b>reparations</b> and past wrongdoers, and the connections between those receiving <b>reparations</b> and those injured in the past. Posner and Vermeule use that framework to evaluate the morality of <b>reparations</b> and the legal problems that arise in implementing <b>reparations</b> proposals. This Essay takes up the Posner-Vermeule analysis at several points. It challenges their limited definition of <b>reparations</b> and their limited catalog of <b>reparations</b> in American history. In contrast to Posner and Vermeule, who date the origin of <b>reparations</b> action in the United States to 1946, this Essay presents a series of legislative 2 ̆ 2 <b>reparations</b> 2 ̆ 2 throughout American history. Using that historical evidence and a 2 ̆ 2 legislative model 2 ̆ 2 of <b>reparations,</b> the Essay proposes a relaxation of the relationship between wrongdoer and payer, and injured and recipient. Then it suggests several factors for a legislature to consider in designing <b>reparations</b> for historical injustice. This Essay, thereby, proposes an alternative framework for evaluating the morality and utility of <b>reparations...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Reparations</b> are broadly {{understood}} as compensation given for an abuse or injury. The colloquial meaning of <b>reparations</b> has changed substantively {{over the last}} century.

40|$|The {{growing body}} of {{literature}} on <b>reparations</b> consists primarily of articles showing that black <b>reparations</b> are consistent with various legal theories, promote racial justice, or further broader societal goals like eliminating poverty and promoting education. This article takes the distinct position of challenging <b>reparations</b> supporters to justify their confidence {{in the legal system}} to deliver meaningful <b>reparations</b> for slavery and segregation in light of the historic use of law as a means of instantiating white racial supremacy and the prospective individualistic approach to race adopted by contemporary judges and legislators. The article also challenges those who oppose <b>reparations</b> based on its supposed unfairness to contemporary citizens to explain how their position differs from that of past generations who opposed <b>reparations</b> and related legal efforts to redress racial injustices as unfair at that time. To support the challenge to <b>reparations</b> commentators, the article examines the historical framework of blacks’ relationship to the law through legislation and court rulings from 1619 – 1963.

40|$|Disturbing the Peace: Cultural Narratives and <b>Reparations</b> African Americans' {{pursuit of}} <b>reparations</b> {{began in the}} eighteenth century and {{continues}} in the present. At the twilight of the twentieth century, African American slavery and <b>reparations</b> for that experience became a controversial topic in popular and public discourse. Inevitably, the conversation turned to economics, specifically monetary compensation. Responding to this now-global controversy, Nigerian scholar Chinweizu observed that <b>reparations</b> are not primarily about money. Instead, he insists, <b>reparations</b> are about psychological repairs, institutional repairs, educational repairs, self-made repairs, repairs of all types. Drawing on Chinweizu's conception of <b>reparations,</b> "Disturbing the Peace: Cultural Narratives and Reparations" examines Toni Morrison's Beloved, Ernest Gaines's A Lesson Before Dying, Sidney Lumet's The Wiz, Spike Lee's Get on the Bus, and Marc Forster's Monster's Ball as cultural narratives that illuminate the pitfalls of pursuing <b>reparations</b> that are restricted to the legal arena. While this dissertation responds to a historical-political project, I do not offer these cultural narratives as political instruction on how to pursue <b>reparations.</b> Rather, this project examines how individuals and communities within these cultural narratives pursue <b>reparations</b> outside of the legal arena. Despite popular representations of the pursuit of <b>reparations</b> as being primarily about money, I argue that the pursuit of <b>reparations</b> is also a narrative pursuit that disturbs the highly imagined peace of national unity. As such, investigating cultural narratives for {{the ways in which they}} engage and revise popular notions of <b>reparations</b> encourages a more expansive approach to identifying and repairing racial injuries for individuals and communities. Narrative does more than calculate debts; it reminds individuals of what they owe both to themselves and to the communities they inhabit, reminds them that their lives and their histories are more than notations in slave ledgers, and reminds them that they are, first and foremost, human beings. Against this legal history, the cultural narratives under consideration in "Disturbing the Peace" suggest, as does Chinweizu, that <b>reparations</b> depend on communities' willingness and/or ability to initiate self-made repairs...|$|R
