5|$|During {{his return}} to Northumbria Wilfrid's ship was blown ashore on the Sussex coast, the {{inhabitants}} of which were at that time pagan. On being attacked by the locals, Wilfrid's party killed the head priest before <b>refloating</b> their ship and making their escape. The historian Marion Gibbs suggests that after this episode Wilfrid visited Kent again, and {{took part in the}} diplomacy related to Wigheard's appointment to the see of Canterbury. Wilfrid may also have taken part in negotiations to persuade King Cenwalh of Wessex to allow Agilbert to return to his see.|$|E
5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any <b>refloating</b> attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the raid}} on Genoa, the {{authorities}} in Leghorn ordered Impérieuse to leave immediately. The frigate sailed north and took shelter at Fezzano, near the port of La Spezia. The French had decided that since capture was inevitable, the frigate should be destroyed, and beached the ship in order to remove guns and stores. Six days after the capture of Modeste, Captain reached La Spezia, acting on reports that Impérieuse was in the bay. Reeve discovered the French ship under the guns of the Santa Maria shore battery, and the following morning, 12 October, used his ship's boats to tow Captain alongside Impérieuse. At 08:00 boat parties from the ship of the line boarded the frigate, discovering that the remaining French crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during the night and scuttled it in shallow water. The British {{were able to take}} possession of Impérieuse without opposition from the battery. Reeve instructed his carpenters to make the frigate seaworthy again, <b>refloating</b> the ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 October before sailing back to Toulon with his prize.|$|E

5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from <b>refloating</b> the {{grounded}} ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit <b>refloating.</b> Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E
5|$|While {{the landing}} force drove off the {{defenders}} and captured the fortifications, the naval squadron entered the harbour {{and opened up}} an overwhelming fire on the outnumbered Caroline. Shot was also fired at the captured East Indiamen, various other vessels in the harbour and any small batteries or shore positions that remained in French hands. Feretier and the other French naval officers, recognising that their position was hopeless, cut the anchor cables of their ships and allowed them to drift ashore, where they abandoned ship to escape capture. The British squadron then anchored in the harbour as their crews set about <b>refloating</b> the grounded French ships on the beach. In addition to Caroline and the East Indiamen, Rowley's squadron successfully captured a 14-gun privateer brig named Grappler and five or six smaller ships. With the harbour and fortifications in British hands, Keating and Willoughby entered the town of Saint-Paul without further combat.|$|E

50|$|At midday Virginia withdrew toward Norfolk and the Union Navy resumed {{its efforts}} to <b>refloat</b> Minnesota. Early the next morning steamer S. R. Spaulding and several tugs managed to <b>refloat</b> the frigate and she {{anchored}} opposite Fort Monroe for temporary repairs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Refloated</b> 1947 {{and broken}} up.|$|R
25|$|On 15 January 2013, {{the final}} two bodies were {{thought to have been}} located (those of a female {{passenger}} and a male crew member), but they reportedly could not be recovered, because their location near the stern made their recovery inaccessible until the ship could be rotated. However, the companies performing the <b>refloating</b> operation denied finding any bodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{total cost}} of the disaster, {{including}} victims' compensation, <b>refloating,</b> towing and scrapping costs, is estimated to be around $2 billion, {{more than three times the}} $612 million construction cost of the ship. Costa Cruises offered compensation to passengers (to a limit of €11,000 a person) to pay for all damages, including the value of the cruise. One-third of the survivors took the offer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} that the <b>refloating</b> attempt would proceed despite {{concerns}} that the ship was too badly damaged to be refloated. Any attempt at moving the ship was to occur at high tide, when the ship's own buoyancy would reduce the towing force required and the chance of it breaking into two. The salvage attempt was not to involve removing any of the fuel or oil off the vessel.|$|E

25|$|Various {{attempts}} for <b>refloating</b> {{the ship}} were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between {{grains of sand}} and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether {{this would have been}} effective in this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled up and over the rocks.|$|E
25|$|Built by Caird & Company of Greenock, Scotland, and {{launched}} on 18 December 1872, the SS Bokhara had a two-cylinder compound inverted steam engine and was registered in London. The passenger liner travelled mainly to India and the Far East and in 1875 had its registry transferred to Greenock. On the ship's maiden voyage, in 1873, it was stranded on an uncharted rock off Hong Kong and after eventually <b>refloating,</b> {{it had to}} be docked at Kowloon for repairs. In 1884 the ship was used as a transport vessel for soldiers in the Mahdist War.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{to salvage}} Pasha Bulker used anchors laid out at sea, which {{the ship was}} to use to then winch itself seawards, and three tug boats towing it {{with the aim of}} {{dragging}} the bow over a rock reef. The carrier would then be pulled seaward in a path between two rocky reefs. A hydrographic survey was conducted to survey and map {{the bottom of the ocean}} through the surf zone using a surf ski single beam echo sounder and GPS. This gave the salvage team more insight into the direction for <b>refloating</b> the ship.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of Friday 15 July 1977 while {{returning}} from a cruise and approaching Dunoon pier, Waverleys steering failed and she struck the rocks to the south called The Gantocks. Firmly aground and {{down by the head}} the ship was extensively damaged. There was some doubt about whether or not she would hold together on <b>refloating</b> but she did, and she was repaired and returned to service. Her survival was attributed to her heavier than normal post World War II construction which had included provision for minesweeping gear and a deck gun in case she was ever requisitioned by the Admiralty for use in a future war.|$|E
25|$|The council {{unanimously}} {{requested to}} return to Brest, but Morard read the orders of the Convention and gave a speech that convinced it to request further orders from the National Convention. It was decided that the squadron would set sail to escort a convoy that had been anchored for several days off Morbihan. The frigate Bellone, which escorted it, had run aground when arriving, and her crew had refused to execute orders, preventing her officers from <b>refloating</b> her. However, with his letter to the Convention, Morard had added that, since order would last only until favourable winds to the return to Brest, {{in order to maintain}} the pretence of authority, he was determined {{to return to}} Brest as soon as possible in any case.|$|E
25|$|It was {{immediately}} {{clear that the}} 1898 explosion had done far more damage to the Maine than previously assumed, and that the ship might not be capable of <b>refloating</b> at all. The caisson plan, however, was nevertheless considered risky. The Special Board sought the approval of President Taft for the caisson plan and the decision to sink the wreck at sea. The work included contracting for local labor wherever possible, but using U.S. Navy ships and derricks. Taft gave his approval on October 13. Taft invited Cuba and Spain to name a representative to be on-site during the salvage operation at all times. The Spanish agreed to observer status. With the plan approved, the Lackawanna Steel Company began manufacturing the interlocking steel piles to create the caisson walls.|$|E
50|$|On 7 April 1929, Paris ran aground in New York Harbor; she was <b>refloated</b> 36 hours later. On 18 April 1929, she ran aground again, {{this time}} on the Eddystone Rocks, Cornwall, United Kingdom. She was <b>refloated</b> two hours later, then {{anchored}} off Penlee, Cornwall, where 157 of her passengers were taken off by a tender and landed at Plymouth, Devon. She was severely damaged by fire at Le Havre, Seine-Maritime, France, on 20 August 1929 and sank, but was <b>refloated</b> on 11 September 1929, was repaired, and returned to service.|$|R

25|$|Letitia ran aground {{twice in}} 1935. The {{first time was}} on 11 April at Cape Papas, Patras, Greece, where she was <b>refloated</b> on 13 April.

25|$|Thomas now {{took up a}} posting to HMS Bellerophon as flag-lieutenant to his cousin, Rear Admiral Sir Algernon Lyons, {{which had}} been {{arranged}} before his illness. A letter to prince George noted {{that he was still}} not fully recovered, hoping that the climate in Bermuda would be good for him. He remained on Bellerophon for nine months, before returning to England for ten months, again on half pay for health reasons. In August 1888 he was sent to the sail training ship, HMS St Vincent, from which home leave was possible and he assisted in his father's election campaign to the local council. In spring 1889 he attended Excellent for a gunnery course, and then Vernon for torpedo training. Prince George also attended at the same time. In 1889 he served briefly on , before a permanent posting to her in December when she sailed to the Mediterranean as flagship to Vice Admiral Sir Anthony Hiley Hoskins. In May 1890 the ship was 'swapped' for , which had been intended to serve as flagship, but whose construction had been delayed. The crews of the two ships changed places, with Camperdown returning to the Channel fleet. Hoskins was impressed with Evan-Thomas' performance, placing him in charge of arrangements for <b>refloating</b> Victoria after she ran aground in the Gulf of Corinth in February 1891. Hoskins was in the habit of leaving the bridge during manoeuvres, so that his junior officers would get a chance acting as admiral to complete them.|$|E
25|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{said its}} {{investigation}} of {{the wreck of the}} Maine would cease at the end of November 1911. The stern section of the ship proved watertight, and a wooden bulkhead was built across the section to allow it to float. <b>Refloating</b> the wreck, sinking it at sea, and removing the caissons would take another $250,000, the Corps said on November 8. By mid-December the funds had not been appropriated, and working on the Maine was scheduled to halt. When debate on the funds opened on December 16, Representative James R. Mann and Representative Thomas U. Sisson nearly came to blows when Sisson proposed that parts of the wreck be sold at auction to reduce the costs of the salvage operation. Both Sisson and Representative Robert B. Macon had also proposed exhibiting the wreck for a fee, but Representative John J. Fitzgerald (chair of the House Appropriations Committee) said there would be public riots anywhere it appeared. While members of the House disagreed over whether to sell parts of the Maine, they were united in allowing the Secretary of the Navy to donate relics and portions of the hull to any municipality or patriotic organization which asked for them. Additionally, the House voted to give the city of Havana a portion of the wreck {{for the construction of a}} memorial. This version of the legislation passed. On January 13, the Secretary of the Navy established a two-person panel consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Edward Burr (Army Corps of Engineers) and Commander Richard H. Leigh (U.S. Navy) to determine which cities and groups should get relics from the wreck.|$|E
500|$|As the British attack {{proceeded}} against Confiante, {{the crew}} of Vésuve succeeded in <b>refloating</b> her and soon had their ship anchored {{under the protection of}} gun batteries at Sallenelles. These defences were augmented by additional batteries set up by 200soldiers under Captain Muskein, drawn from the barges that had been trapped in the town by the British blockade. By the time Confiante had been destroyed, the mouth of the Dives had been heavily fortified and even the arrival of the 38-gun frigate [...] under Captain Sir Richard Strachan on 1June was insufficient to counterbalance French numerical superiority. Eventually Laforey was forced to retire from the blockade of Sallenelles, and while he was absent Vésuve managed to get underway and reach Le Havre without further incident.|$|E
