40|$|Monitoring {{ecological}} restoration at {{the community}} scale provides insight into how the population dynamics and community interactions are progressing through time in comparison to a restoration’s goals and reference conditions. This study monitored the early post-restoration dynamics of a sand plain located in the Carolinian Canada ecozone called Lake Erie Farms. The restoration consisted of restoring three habitats via sculptured seeding: a mesic forest, oak woodland, and sand barren. The hypothesis {{of this study is}} that the restoration efforts have established population dynamics and community interactions consistent with successional patterns expected from comparative literature. Community ecology, directed succession, and alternative stable states are the underlying theories that provided a conceptual and theoretical lens from which to study the objectives and hypothesis. To gain insight into the community dynamics at Lake Erie Farms the vegetation abundance, seed abundance and viability of the seedbank, seed viability of the 6 most dominant species (3 most dominant native species & 3 most dominant weedy species), and soil moisture & pH were monitored. The analysis was conducted using a RMANOVA of a nested design (P > 0. 001, 0. 01 and 0. 05) to compare the variables in relation to the site (i. e. the sum of all the quadrats), the restoration treatment nested within the site, the field nested within the site, the transect nested within the restoration treatment and the quadrat nested within the restoration treatment. The significant findings of this study include: i) the restoration treatments are producing similar results as those expected from the literature, though there is evidence of the sculptured seeding treatment accelerating the successional stage at Lake Erie Farms compared to abandoned agricultural fields in similar ecosystems because of the presence of later-successional species; ii) the control areas are less diverse than each of the <b>restoration</b> <b>units</b> (P> 0. 05); and iii) the soil moisture among the treatments is beginning to diverge into the desired <b>restoration</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|Freeway-incident-management (FIM) {{programs}} are receiving growing attention, {{since they have}} the potential of generating substantial savings for highway users. The goal of any incident-management program is the minimization of incident delay through the rapid restoration of the freeway capacity. The {{most important aspect of}} freeway-incident management is the servicing and the removal of the incidents. Currently a number of FIM programs use a fleet of trucks for the quick restoration of freeway capacity. Although the deployment of these traffic-flow <b>restoration</b> <b>units</b> (TFRUs) is an important component of freeway-management operations, the literature lacks analytical models {{that can be used to}} rationalize the deployment of the TFRUs. The present paper proposes an integrated methodological framework for the minimization of freeway-incident delays through the optimum deployment of TFRUs. The proposed model consists of three basic modules. The first module determines the number of required TFRUs and their service territories. The second module simulates the generation of freeway incidents and the traffic-flow restoration operations to estimate the total incident clearance time for each incident. Finally, the third module estimates the freeway-incident delay based on the total incident clearance time and the geometric and traffic characteristics of the freeway under study. The proposed model can be used to determine the number of TFRUs, and their dispatch policy, to achieve a threshold value of freeway-incident delay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Plant {{population}} {{models are}} valuable tools for assessing ecological tradeoffs between forest management approaches. In addition, these models can pro-vide insight on plant life history patterns and processes important for persistence and recovery of populations in changing environments. In this study, we evaluated {{a set of}} ecological restoration alternatives for their long-term effects on buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri Gray), a shrub common in understories of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the southwestern United States. The field {{data were collected from}} a set of forest <b>restoration</b> <b>units</b> located on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest. We constructed simple stage-based models in order to simulate 25 -year population dynamics. Results showed that scenarios that included overstory thinning, herbivore protection, and prescribed fire resulted in buckbrush populations with significantly greater numbers of aboveground stems than populations in the oth-er alternatives. Vegetative stem recruitment, flowering, and seedling emergence were important in producing these results. For alternatives that included protection from herbivores, burning at 2 -year frequencies resulted in populations with significantly greater numbers of aboveground stems than scenarios with longer intervals between burning. In contrast, frequent burning in alternatives without herbivore protection resulted in population decline. These results indicate that protecting buckbrush from large herbivores allowed plants to complete life cycles and fully express these life his-tory traits. This research demonstrates that population modeling can help illuminate ecological tradeoffs associated with land management alternatives...|$|R

50|$|Hair follicles {{form the}} basis of the two primary methods of hair {{transplantation}} in hair <b>restoration,</b> Follicular <b>Unit</b> Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). In each of these methods, naturally occurring groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are extracted from the hair restoration patient and then surgically implanted in the balding area of the patient's scalp, known as the recipient area. These follicles are extracted from donor areas of the scalp, or other parts of the body, which are typically resistant to the miniaturization effects of the hormone DHT. It is this miniaturization of the hair shaft that is the primary predictive indicator of androgenetic alopecia, commonly referred to as male pattern baldness or male hair loss. When these DHT-resistant follicles are transplanted to the recipient area, they continue to grow hair in the normal hair cycle, thus providing the hair restoration patient with permanent, naturally-growing hair.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In 1989 The Nature Conservancy, in {{conjunction}} with both {{state and federal agencies}} and private landowners, initiated a riparian forest restoration program along the 161 -km section of the Sacramento River between Red Bluff and Colusa. By 1995, valley oak (Quercus lobata) had been planted at six different <b>restoration</b> <b>units.</b> Survival and growth varied among the units because of different maintenance regimes and different site conditions. Seed germination and survival through the first year was highly variable, ranging from 35 to 90 percent. Mean height ranged from 20 to 45 cm. Seven years into this project we will report costs associated with different restoration techniques and our recommendations for site selection, maintenance (irrigation, weed control, herbivore control), and performance standards for establishing valley oaks in large (> 80 ha) retired agricultural fields. Riparian forests support more species of wildlife than any other forest type in California (Williams and Kilburn 1984). Two important factors may be their proximity to water and the complex structure of their vegetation, which allows many species of wildlife to find habitat space. Valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee) grows on deep alluvial soils in the floodplains of the rivers and streams of the Great Central Valley and the Coast Ranges of California. It is the dominant species in a distinctive and threatened riparian forest community (Holland 1986). Valley oak riparian forest of the Great Central Valley is best developed on finer-textured soils (clay- and silt-loams of the Columbia soil series) at sites which are flooded only infrequently. It was formerly abundant on the high terraces of the Sacramento River floodplain. These comprise some of the best agricultural soils in the state, and most were cleared and converted to agriculture in the nineteenth century. With the completion of Shasta Dam in 1945, most of the remaining valley oak riparian forest in midterrace, flood-prone areas near the river was converted to agriculture. In the past decade remnant individuals and groves have been severely affected by urban development in the Great Central Valley. In 1989, the Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge was created by th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Current service {{restoration}} methods in distribution systems mainly {{focus on the}} single fault. When the distribution system deals {{with more than one}} fault, current {{service restoration}} methods will not be applicable. A service restoration method for multiple faults is proposed to solve the problem mentioned above. Fault outage areas connected through a loop switch compose an unaided fault recovery area which is regarded as a service <b>restoration</b> <b>unit.</b> In order to eliminate the interaction of communal feeders which are connected to more than one unaided fault recovery area, each communal feeder is decoupled into multiple virtual feeders which are assigned to corresponding unaided fault recovery areas based on load balancing distribution. After the process above, the fault recovery area of multiple faults is divided into several independent fault recovery areas and each independent fault recovery area can be restored by traditional service restoration methods. So the contribution of this algorithm is {{to solve the problem of}} service restoration of multiple faults. The result of a calculation example proved the validity of the algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Restoration</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Ministry for Resources and Rural Affairs of Malta has {{launched}} a survey and documentation project of the Citadel of Gozo. This is a really complex task for the <b>Restoration</b> <b>Unit</b> of the Ministry for Resources and Rural Affairs, Malta, involved for years in important researches and restorations. The project was developed through the European Regional Development Fund Malta 2007 - 2013 (Operational Program I - Cohesion Policy 2007 - 2013, Investing in Competitiveness for a Better Quality of Life), funded by the European Union for 85 % with the ERDF and for 15 % with Maltese national funds. Led by the Ferrara Research Consortium,the documentation plan for the restorationwas developed by the Italian group of companies affiliated with Prorestauro (Italian Association for the Restoration and Conservation of Cultural Heritage). Experts in survey, diagnostic, conservation of stones and 3 D modelling, worked together in an integrated process analysis and post-processing of data. Built with {{the main purpose of}} defending the island against invasion of pirates, the Citadel of Gozo present importance is not only due to the architecture but also to its cultural and historical significance. It is located in the central-west area of the island, {{at the top of a}} rocky hill 140 meters above sea level, covering an area of about 2500 square meters, half of which are in a state of ruin. Citadel was one of the main centers of activity since ancient times, due to its location and to the shape of the land. Besides the primary documentation, the main goal of the high-definition three-dimensional survey, is to develop a geometric database able to identify the geometry and morphology of every element of the fortifications. Furthermore it provides to operate metric, morphological and diagnostic multi-scale analysis of the architectural complex, considering also the relationships with the surrounding area. Thehigh-definition description of the environment was to highlight all the natural and anthropic elements, like a series of dry stone walls for the "containment" of the sloping ground, surrounding the Citadel. This was important because several hydrogeological landslides are happening in the area and many assumptions identify the cause in the lack of maintenance. Another main task of the project involved the detailed survey of the outer and inner surfaces of the walls of the fortress of the Citadel and the documentation of the condition of structures and surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} {{ecosystem}} restoration has recently shifted from pure rehabilitation objectives to both improving ecological functioning and {{the delivery of}} ecosystem services. However, these different targets need to be integrated to create a unified, synergistic, and balanced restoration approach. This should be done by combining state-of-the-art knowledge from natural and social sciences to create manageable units of restoration that consider both the temporal and multiple spatial scales of ecosystems, legislative units, and policy agendas. Only by considering these aspects combined can we accomplish more cost-efficient restoration resulting in resilient ecosystems that provide a wealth of ecosystem services and the possibility for sustainable economic development in the future. We propose a novel conceptual framework that will yield more effective ecosystem restoration: the Operational <b>Restoration</b> <b>Unit.</b> This is based on scale-dependent restoration actions that can adhere easily to the relevant environmental legislation, encompass the spatial and temporal resilience of aquatic ecosystems, and consider the sum of human pressures acting on water bodies.

40|$|The {{traditional}} excavation tools {{applied to}} Archaeology (i. e. trowels, shovels, bulldozers, etc.) produce, generally, a fast and invasive {{reconstruction of the}} ancient past. The geophysical instruments, instead, seem {{to go in the}} opposite direction giving, rapidly and non-destructively, geo-archaeological information. Moreover, the economic aspect should not be underestimated: where the former invest {{a lot of money in}} order to carry out an excavation or restoration, the latter spend much less to manage a geophysical survey, locating precisely the targets. Survey information gathered using non-invasive methods contributes to the creation of site strategies, conservation, preservation and, if necessary, accurate location of excavation and <b>restoration</b> <b>units,</b> without destructive testing methods, also in well-known archaeological sites [1]-[3]. In particular, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has, recently, become the most important physical technique in archaeological investigations, allowing the detection of targets with both very high vertical and horizontal resolution, and has been successfully applied both to archaeological and diagnostic purposes in historical and monumental sites [4]. GPR configuration, antenna frequency and survey modality can be different, depending on the scope of the measurements, the nature of the site or the type of targets. Two-dimensional (2 D) time/depth slices and radargrams should be generated and integrated with information obtained from other buried or similar artifacts to provide age, structure and context of the surveyed sites. In the present work, we present three case-histories on well-known Roman archaeological sites in Rome, in which GPR technique has been successfully used. To obtain 2 D maps of the explored area, a bistatic GPR (250 MHz and 500 MHz antennas) was applied, acquiring data along several parallel profiles. The GPR results reveal the presence of similar circular anomalies in all the investigated archaeological sites. In particular, in the Domus Aurea, in the Domitian Stadium, and in the San Cesario in Palatio church, the processing of the GPR data highlights not only the presence of Roman circular bases/insoles of pillars not yet brought to the light, but also their structural disposition and geometry. These three examples show that GPR technique is a valid support which, in exhaustive way, can underline the unexpected presence of ancient structures beneath the soil, also in well-known archaeological sites...|$|R
