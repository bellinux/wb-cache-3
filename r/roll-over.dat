25|$|Panels for {{the body}} were {{produced}} using a new process called VARI (Vacuum Assisted Resin Injection). This method, which was patented by Lotus, offered advantages over the previous hand lay-up process. Kevlar reinforcement {{was added to the}} roof and sides for <b>roll-over</b> protection. This also increased the Esprit's torsional rigidity by 22%.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s {{the vehicle}} {{attempted}} to climb {{more and more}} upmarket, while remaining true to its working roots. This trend was epitomised by limited-edition vehicles, such as the SV90 in 1992 with <b>roll-over</b> protection cage, alloy wheels and metallic paint and the 50th anniversary 90 in 1998, equipped with automatic transmission, air conditioning and Range Rover 4.0-litre V8 engine.|$|E
25|$|As with {{previous}} production-based Mustang race cars, Multimatic Engineering was engaged by Ford Performance {{to develop a}} complete turn-key race-only version of the S550 Shelby GT350R. The resulting competition derivative, the GT350R-C, features safety equipment and <b>roll-over</b> protection homologated to FIA and IMSA specifications; Bosch MS5.0 ECU and ABS controller; MoTeC instrumentation and datalogging; adjustable anti-roll bars; Multimatic DSSV spool-valve dampers and other competition upgrades.|$|E
25|$|In legacy {{databases}} whose size {{could not}} be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days (ordinal date in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual <b>roll-over</b> problem {{to the end of}} the year 2899.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Bohm {{obtained}} a $2,025,000 personal injury verdict in Ieremia v. Hilmar Unified School District (2007, San Joaquin County Superior Court). Plaintiff, {{a working mother}} of five was ejected during a <b>roll-over</b> accident resulting in painful scarring on her left side and face. The case was appealed and resulted in a published opinion affirming the verdict and clarifying the law concerning recovery for uninsured plaintiffs. Ieremia v. Hilmar Unified School District, 166 Cal.App.4th 324 (2008).|$|E
25|$|Lifetime, {{which held}} {{the rights to}} The Golden Girls at the time, aired reruns of The Golden Palace {{in the summer of}} 2005, and again in December of that year. This was the first time since 1993 that The Golden Palace was seen on American television. Until April 2006, Lifetime played the series as a virtual season eight, airing the series in between the {{conclusion}} of the final season and the syndicated <b>roll-over</b> to season one.|$|E
25|$|The {{new body}} also {{featured}} a double shell roof for improved <b>roll-over</b> protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents {{mounted in the}} trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and <b>roll-over</b> protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
2500|$|A 2003 Montana study {{suggested}} that on Interstates, shoulder rumble reduced the <b>roll-over</b> accident rates but {{the severity of}} unprevented <b>roll-over</b> accidents increased. [...] This {{was thought to be}} due to the rumble strip [...] "scaring" [...] sleeping drivers {{to the extent that they}} overreacted. This problem was more pronounced on primary highways (that have narrower shoulders) with rumble strips.|$|E
2500|$|A spot {{transaction}} is {{a two-day}} delivery transaction (except {{in the case}} of trades between the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Turkish lira, euro and Russian ruble, which settle the next business day), as opposed to the futures contracts, which are usually three months. This trade represents a “direct exchange” between two currencies, has the shortest time frame, involves cash rather than a contract, and interest is not included in the agreed-upon transaction. [...] Spot trading {{is one of the most}} common types of Forex Trading. Often, a forex broker will charge a small fee to the client to <b>roll-over</b> the expiring transaction into a new identical transaction for a continuation of the trade. This <b>roll-over</b> fee is known as the [...] "Swap" [...] fee.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2011/2012 season World Snooker {{introduced}} a <b>roll-over</b> {{system for the}} maximum break prize money, the [...] "rolling 147 prize". A maximum break is worth £5,000 in the televised stages and £500 in qualifying stages of major ranking events. There is a £500 prize in the Players Tour Championship events from the last 128 onwards. If a maximum is not made then the prize rolls over to the next event until somebody wins it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} year for new GM C-body shared with Oldsmobile 98 and Cadillac, the 1971 Electra 225 rode on a new body chassis which {{retained}} the [...] wheelbase with styling evolutionary from previous models. The new design included a double-shell roof for improved <b>roll-over</b> protection and noise reduction. Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel shared with B-body LeSabre and Centurion models that grouped all instruments with easy reach of the driver.|$|E
2500|$|Y2K is a numeronym and was {{the common}} {{abbreviation}} for the year 2000 software problem. The abbreviation combines the letter Y for [...] "year", and k for the SI unit prefix kilo meaning 1000; hence, 2K signifies 2000. It was also named the [...] "Millennium Bug" [...] because it {{was associated with the}} popular (rather than literal) <b>roll-over</b> of the millennium, even though most of the problems could have occurred at the end of any ordinary century.|$|E
2500|$|Davey Allison's 1989 season did {{not start}} well. [...] A year after he and his father's one-two Daytona 500 finish, Davey started at 16th, then was {{involved}} in an early incident with Geoff Bodine that sent his car careening into the sand bar separating the track's backstretch from Lake Lloyd. [...] The car made one slow, complete, <b>roll-over</b> with Davey eventually restarting the car and driving {{it back to the}} pits. [...] He drove the damaged, hood-less car to a 25th-place finish and had a heated exchange with Bodine following the race (the first of several exchanges with other drivers during his career).|$|E
2500|$|On a single-lane highway, an overreacting driver {{has less}} room to regain control, which may {{exacerbate}} their initial overreaction after striking the strips, {{resulting in a}} <b>roll-over</b> or head-on collision. A crash investigating officer stated: [...] "It's consistent with someone who falls asleep or overreacts to the rumble strips", which implied {{that this was not}} the first time the officer has witnessed this situation. [...] Note that in the KATU.com article photograph (in the upper left-hand corner) of the crash scene, the passenger-side tire print in the soft shoulder that suggests that all four wheels passed over the rumble strip before the driver attempted the unsuccessful recovery.|$|E
2500|$|For Land Rover's 50th {{anniversary in}} 1998 two special editions were built. The {{first was the}} Defender 50th which was {{essentially}} a NAS (North American spec) Defender 90. It was powered by a [...] 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine {{and was the first}} Land Rover outside North America to be fitted with an automatic transmission. Air conditioning made them very comfortable vehicles. For the UK and Europe they were painted Atlantis blue, a dark green-blue flip-flop colour, and had a safety devices <b>roll-over</b> protection cage for the front seat occupants. In total 1071 50th anniversary Defenders were built; 385 for the UK home market, the rest for Japan, Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|All A-bodies, {{including}} the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated [...] crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, performance {{was on the}} decline due to another federal standard—a new emissions control system. The most notable styling feature of this generation was {{the appearance of the}} fixed opera window, replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year's Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop with frameless door glass as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding <b>roll-over</b> protection that would have ultimately spelled the end of pillarless and convertible bodystyles, a mandate that never materialized.|$|E
2500|$|Antwerp {{was then}} Europe's largest {{financial}} and international trading centre, taking {{as much as}} 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth, and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir Thomas Gresham, the English financier who arranged Elizabeth I's borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks en route; he needed to <b>roll-over</b> 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, {{he was asked if}} [...] "the English were minded to depart this town or not", and wrote to William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief minister, [...] "in alarm that he [...] "liked none of their proceedings" [...] but [...] "apprehended great mischief", and urged that the English government [...] "should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place" [...] for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} protocol has {{a transfer}} file size limit of 512 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 32MB. In 1998 this limit {{was extended to}} 65535 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 4GB by TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348. If the defined blocksize produces an IP packet size that exceeds the minimum MTU at any point of the network path, IP fragmentation and reassembly will occur not only adding more overhead but also leading to total transfer failure when the minimalist IP stack implementation in a host's BOOTP or PXE ROM does not (or fails to properly) implement IP fragmentation and reassembly [...] If TFTP packets should be kept within the standard Ethernet MTU (1500), the blocksize value is calculated as 1500 minus headers of TFTP (4 bytes), UDP (8 bytes) and IP (20 bytes) = 1468 bytes/block, this gives a limit of 1468 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 92MB. Today most servers and clients support block number <b>roll-over</b> (block counter going back to 0 after 65535) which gives an essentially unlimited transfer file size.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Deere {{introduced}} its new 'Sound Idea' tractors, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically {{similar to the}} New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator's cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body. [...] This insulated cab that included a <b>roll-over</b> protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An 8-track tape player was also available as an option. [...] The 5020 {{was replaced by the}} very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere's 'Iron Horse' series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840. [...] The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupe—named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a <b>roll-over</b> type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.|$|E
