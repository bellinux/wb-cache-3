Acute patients moved more than age-matched controls (P =. 003); the following comparisons were not significantly different: chronic patients vs. age-matched controls; and patients in the two stages of recovery.

40|$|Background: Betel nut chewing {{has long}} been a social habit in Taiwan and other Asian and {{tropical}} countries. It produces various autonomic and psychoneurologic effects including tachycardia, flushing, warmth, cholinergic activation, alertness, and euphoria. Although the oral carcinogenic effects are well known, data concern-ing its acute toxicity are few. To better understand the toxicity of betel nut, cases reported to the Taiwan Poison Control Center as probable or possible betel nut– related toxicity (January 1988 –June 1998) were reviewed. In the 17 cases suitable for review (14 males, 3 females, age 21 to 60 years), the most common manifesta-tions were tachycardia/palpitations (7); tachypnea/dyspnea (6); hypotension and sweating (5); vomiting, dizziness, and chest discomfort (4); abdominal colic, nausea, numbness, and coma (3); and acute myocardial infarction and related manifesta-tions (2). The <b>reported</b> <b>quantity</b> of betel nut used was low (1 to 6 nuts), except an extract of 100 betel nuts was used in 1 case and 66 chewed in another. Most cases recovered within 24 hours after the exposure. One patient developed probable acute myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation and died despite repeated cardiac defibrillation. Although betel nut chewing is widespread, significant toxicity as re-ported to a poison center is rare. Because most betel nut–related effects are tran-sient and mild in nature, the incidence of such events is likely to be underreported. Nevertheless, betel nut chewing can produce significant cholinergic, neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations. It is possible that it may aggra-vate cardiac diseases in susceptible patients but this hypothesis must be furthe...|$|E

30|$|The {{recoverable}} {{shale gas}} volume presented in Table  1 {{shows that in}} {{all over the world}} there is around 7795 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of only shale gas are present. This <b>reported</b> <b>quantity</b> of shale gas is massive in comparison with other unconventional gas reservoirs such as tight gas and coalbed methane. Therefore, the stakeholders, investors have paid their attention on shale gas reservoirs (EIA 2013). From EIA (2013) study shows that the reserves of shale gas are quiet large to meet the world’s energy need for future. But the main problem to produce from shale gas reservoirs is that the gas is confined within fine sedimentary rock and has extremely low permeability and poor porosity. However, in recent years, many of the success stories are heard about the shale formations production at profitable rates due to the technological advancement. Hence, it is possible to produce from such reservoirs by use of advanced technology. Drilling horizontal wells and hydraulically fracturing these wells could result in profitable gas production from such low-permeability reservoirs. The first commercial gas production came to existence from shale reservoirs of US which are the result of use of advanced technologies. According to EIA (2015) report, USA is the largest producer of shale gas, the production from shale gas raised to 10 Tcf, from 9.5 Tcf in 2012 and it is predicted that it will grow up to 30 Tcf during upcoming years 2040. The production from US shale gas formations will increase from its current production of 40 % in 2012 to 50 % in 2040. Many other countries such as China, Pakistan, Canada, Argentina, and Mexico have shown great interest to invest and to produce from shale gas reserves. Aforementioned countries’ E&P companies and their governments have also initiated research activities for exploitation of shale gas reservoirs.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In 1989 {{the state}} of Pennsylvania ranked eighth in the nation for annual toxic {{releases}} and transfers from manufacturing facilities. This statistic is derived from data required pursuant to the Emergency Planning and Community Right to-Know Act (EPCRA) for manufacturing facilities with ten or more employees that use, manufacture, or process any of the 320 chemicals identified as toxic by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These data have been collected by the EPA and reported in a Toxics Release Inventory (fRI) since 1987. This paper reviews the existing TRI data for the years 1987 - 1990, paying particular attention to its relevance in {{the state of}} Pennsylvania. Data are analyzed for the four year period, and the reasons for the differences in <b>reported</b> <b>quantity</b> of toxics during this time span are considered. Another focus of this paper is the voluntary reduction of toxic releases and transfers from facilities due to the mandatory reporting requirement set forth in EPCRA. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines pollution prevention as an umbrella term used {{for a wide range of}} source reduction activities which include toxic use reduction, chemical substitution, process modification, product redesign and better management practices. In an effort to promote a national environmental strategy, the United States Government has established a hierarchy of legislation which mandates toxic release reporting and strives to promote pollution prevention efforts. Federal actions of this sort have increased public awareness about toxic pollution and allowed industries to see the depth of community concern about toxic waste. As industries are faced with the current focus on environmental issues, many have voluntarily turned to pollution prevention practices which offer a cleaner, safer and more cost-effective alternative...|$|E
40|$|CCQM-K 9. 2 was {{performed}} supplementary {{to the key}} comparison CCQM-K 9 [1] on the pH determination of a phosphate buffer with nominal pH ~ 6. 9 (at 25 °C). The sample composition was very similar in both comparisons. Only {{the source of the}} starting material used for sample preparation was different. The comparison was restricted {{to the use of the}} primary method for pH (Harned cell measurement) as defined in the IUPAC Recommendations [2]. The measurement temperatures were 15 °C, 25 °C, 37 °C. CCQM-K 9. 2, CCQM-K. 9 and the first supplementary comparison CCQM-K 9. 1 [5] are activities of the Electrochemical Working Group (EAWG) of the CCQM. All three comparisons were coordinated by the PTB, Germany. The Danish Primary Laboratory (DPL) successfully took part in the CCQM-K 9 Meanwhile the primary set-up for pH in Denmark moved from DPL affiliated to Radiometer Medical to DFM, Denmark. The subsequent comparison allows assessing the degree of equivalence for the measurement of pH at DFM after the move. Due to the interest of other laboratories to demonstrate their progress in pH measurements on the primary level the CCQM-K 9. 2 supplementary comparison was extended to other participants than DFM, namely NMIJ, VNIIFTRI, INMETRO and CMI. The <b>reported</b> <b>quantity</b> for CCQM-K 9. 2 was not the pH of the sample but the acidity function at zero chloride molality (see chapter 12). To calculate the pH value from the acidity function it is necessary to know the ionic strength of the sample buffer solution which was undisclosed by the coordinator. With the exception of the Czech Metrology Institute, CMI, good agreement in the determined acidity function is found between the participants.

However, inter-observer agreement using uptake ratios was slightly inferior compared to quantitation.

40|$|Clinical {{trials and}} cohort studies that collect {{survival}} data frequently involve patients who may fail {{from one of}} multiple causes (failure types). These causes are called competing risks. The cumulative incidence function (CIF), or subdistribution, is a commonly <b>reported</b> <b>quantity</b> that describes the crude failure type-specific probability of the study population. The proportional subdistribution hazards model has been widely applied to {{study the effects of}} covariates on the CIF. In practice however, the time of failure may be recorded but the cause may be unknown or missing. To avoid bias, we developed two semiparametric estimators of covariate effects: the inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator and the augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimator. We showed that these estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Their finite sample size properties and robustness were demonstrated through simulations. In many situations, investigators are interested in the marginal survival distribution of latent failure times, rather than the CIF. Because of the identifiability problem in competing risks, we derived an estimator of covariate effects in the Cox proportional hazards model by incorporating the random signs censoring (RSC) principle, which assumes that the main event failure time is independent of the indicator that the main event precedes the competing event. Unlike identifying assumptions that are typically imposed in practice, RSC is verifiable via stochastic ordering in the observed data. We further relaxed the RSC assumption by positing that independence is achieved conditional on some covariates. We showed that the resulting estimator is not only easy to implement but also has desirable asymptotic properties. We evaluated the estimator's finite sample size performance through simulations. Medical datasets were used to illustrate the proposed methods. Public Health Significance: Biomedical and public health studies with time-to-event endpoint are abundant and often influence regulatory decisions. Trustworthiness of the research results not only relies on the design quality, but also on the soundness of the analytical approach used. The methodologies we propose account for two potential sources of bias in the conduct of such studies [...] competing risks and missing data...|$|E
