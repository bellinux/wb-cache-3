5|$|During Davuluri's {{visit to}} Central York High School in Pennsylvania, 18-year-old Patrick Farves was {{suspended}} for inviting her to his 2014 prom during a question-and-answer session. Although she requested that the suspension be lifted in a Facebook post, school administrators said that they must maintain standards for student behavior. Farves later stated that he <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> joke as it overshadowed her platform.|$|E

The documentary was included in Pertaruhan (At Stake), a compilation of works produced by the Kalyana Shira Foundation. In August 2006, Ucu released a short story compilation, Dunia di Kepala Alice (The World in Alice's Head), and a novel, Being Ing. On 4 June 2009, the Tulungagung government shut down the prostitution district {{as a result of}} the documentary; in response, Ucu said that she <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> decision.|$|E

The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship among general <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning after <b>the</b> purchasing and to determine the characteristic properties which are effective on these three types of regret. This study is applied on the students of Eskisehir Osmangazi University and Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University and it is benefited from the convenience sampling in the study. The data of this study is collected via questionnaire and in a method of drop-and-collect. The results of the study shows that there is a positive meaningful relationship among <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning after <b>the</b> purchasing. Moreover, as a result of this study, it is established that the characteristic properties like extravagant, restrained, easily tempered, careless, enjoy spending and a planner have positive meaningful effects on <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning <b>the</b> process of purchasing and <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> concerning after <b>the</b> purchasing. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. Several {{theories}} have been advanced to explain variation in <b>the</b> intensity of <b>regret.</b> Thus far, these {{theories have}} been tested in isolation. Aim: To compare the effects of several key theoretical variables on <b>regret</b> intensity: <b>The</b> time since <b>the</b> <b>regretted</b> event, whether <b>the</b> <b>regret</b> was one of action or inaction, the level of justification felt, {{and whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>regretted</b> decision violated <b>the</b> participant’s personal life rules. Method: A postal survey of 429 New Zealand adults. Conclusions: Contradicting folk wisdom and previous research, action regrets were felt more intensely than inaction <b>regrets.</b> <b>The</b> passing of time led to action regrets being felt even more intensely (in comparison to regrets of inaction), falsifying a prediction of the temporal theory of <b>regret.</b> <b>The</b> strongest predictor of <b>regret</b> intensity was <b>the</b> domain of regret: Regrets in intimate domains were felt more intensely than regrets in non-intimate domains. falsefalsefalsefalsefalsefalsePublishedPublishedNew ZealandNew Zealan...|$|R
5|$|The Naps soon <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> trade. With the Yankees, Peckinpaugh {{emerged as}} a team leader. He was named captain in 1914 by manager Frank Chance. Chance {{resigned}} with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player–manager {{for the remainder of}} the season; at the age of 23, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He finished the 1914 season fifth in the AL with 38 stolen bases.|$|E
5|$|When Tintin in the Congo {{was first}} {{released}} by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E
5|$|Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra {{were cast}} in the lead roles.

After Dostana release, she <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E

5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Generals owner Donald Trump had given Taylor a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor immediately <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> decision. The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E
5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in {{their opposition to the}} article in an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E

5|$|In 1892 Gaudí was {{commissioned}} by Claudio López Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions {{for the city of}} Tangier, in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaudí conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaudí deeply <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Família, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Appeals Court in Rome tried Opačić, General Ljubomir Bajić, {{commander}} of the 5th Aviation Corps, and Colonel Božidar Martinović, head of the Yugoslav Air Defence operational centre in Belgrade in absentia for the attack. Opačić and Bajić were convicted and each sentenced to 28 years in prison, while Martinović was acquitted. The court also ordered Serbia to pay compensation to families of those killed in the attack, in the provisional amount of 950,000 Euros. In a 2008 interview, Šišić said he <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> deaths of the crew but felt no remorse for his actions.|$|E
5|$|In December 1995, Miceli {{signed with}} WCW, {{and as part}} of a storyline by booker Eric Bischoff, showed up on WCW Monday Nitro on December 18, where she threw the WWF Women's Title belt into a trash can.

Miceli immediately began using the Madusa name again, and the company brought in Bull Nakano to feud with her; they battled in a match at Hog Wild in August 1996. Due to pre-match stipulations, Madusa was allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle after the match.|$|E

5|$|SASO decided after {{a debate}} to remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, but would {{nevertheless}} recognise the larger organisation {{as the national}} student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference. In 1970 SASO withdrew its recognition of NUSAS, accusing it of attempting to hinder SASO's growth on various campuses. SASO's split from NUSAS was a traumatic experience for many white liberal youth who had committed themselves {{to the idea of}} a multi-racial organisation and felt that their attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.|$|E
5|$|With Harrison's entry, the Quarrymen now {{had four}} guitarists. Lennon and McCartney {{suggested}} to Griffiths that he instead buy a bass guitar, but Griffiths refused {{because of the}} expense. The two subsequently convinced Nigel Walley, still acting as the group's manager, to fire Griffiths. Walley <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> incident, {{and as a result}} gradually severed his ties with the Quarrymen. Around this same time, Len Garry contracted tubercular meningitis, and spent seven months in the hospital, never playing with the group again. This left Colin Hanton as the last of the group of Lennon's Quarry Bank classmates that originally comprised the group. In March, McCartney bought an Elpico amplifier with two inputs, and he and Harrison added pickups to their guitars, giving the Quarrymen an electric sound for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Boas Munyonga {{represented}} Zambia in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an additional {{place in the}} additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. He participated in the men's middleweight class, which includes athletes under 90 kilograms in weight. Munyonga was Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Olympic Games, at age 31, and was taking part in his first Olympic Games. He {{said that he would}} do his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal the start of the match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signalled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that he <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> move and that he had forgotten about a rule which stated the leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor.|$|E

5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in reflection on the writings. In rereading his work, he realized he disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book and index, since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled over issues of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as {{he was eager to}} see the book published.|$|E
5|$|The two {{discussed}} {{the matter at}} a meeting in early 1952 in Palm Beach, Florida, where Rodgers was vacationing as he worked on melodic sketches for the television documentary Victory at Sea. Rodgers suggested dispensing with the overture, reserving that for the overture of the show-within-the-show. Following another meeting in mid-1952, they called in long-time Rodgers and Hammerstein stage designer Jo Mielziner and hired him to design the sets. Mielziner confirmed that a scene could be played part onstage and part in the backstage world, but that this would be expensive. In August 1952, Hammerstein began a sketch of the plot; by early October he had a near-complete first draft. As the show was to be musical comedy, the pair hired one of the top musical comedy directors, George Abbott, who accepted the position without reading the script. He <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> haste of this decision as soon as he read the script, finding it sentimental and melodramatic. He confided his concerns to the pair; in response, Hammerstein told him to make whatever changes in the script he thought best. With Hammerstein's permission, Abbott made major changes to the plot.|$|E
5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor <b>regretted</b> <b>the</b> decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
