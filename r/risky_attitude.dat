40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} between emotional abilities and the influence of this relationship on self reported drivers’ <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes.</b> The <b>risky</b> driving <b>attitudes</b> and emotional abilities of 177 future driving instructors were measured.

Regression analysis showed that adaptability and interpersonal abilities explained the differences observed in the global risk attitude index. There were some differences in the specific risk factors. The variability observed in the speed and distraction and fatigue factors could also be explained by interpersonal and adaptability abilities. Nevertheless the tendency to take risks was explained by stress management and also interpersonal components. Emotional abilities have the weakest relation with alcohol and drugs factor, and in this case the variability observed was explained by the adaptability component. The results obtained highlight the importance take off including emotional abilities in prevention programs to reduce risky driving behavior...|$|R
40|$|Motor vehicle {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the principal causes of adolescent disability or mortality and male drivers {{are more likely to be}} involved in road accidents than female drivers. In part such associations between driver age and sex have been linked to differences in risky behaviour (e. g. speed, violations) and individual characteristics (e. g. sensation seeking, deviant behaviour). The aim of this research is to determine whether associations between risky road user behaviour and individual characteristics are a function of driver behaviour or whether they are intrinsic and measurable in individuals too young to drive. Five hundred and sixty-seven pre-driver students aged 11 - 16 from three secondary schools completed questionnaires measuring enthusiasm for speed, sensation seeking, deviant behaviour and attitudes towards driver violations. Boys reported more <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> than girls for all measures. Associations between sensation seeking, deviant behaviour and <b>attitudes</b> towards <b>risky</b> road use were present from early adolescence and were strongest around age 14, before individuals learn to drive. <b>Risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards road use are associated with individual characteristics and are observed in adolescents long before they learn to drive. Safe attitudes towards road use and driver behaviour should be promoted from childhood in order to be effective. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Young {{drivers are}} at {{increased}} crash risk {{as a result}} of adopting risky driving styles. The present work examines the development of <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> from pre-driving to fully-qualified driving, focussing on speed related attitudes. Methods Data were drawn from a UK longitudinal study of adolescent behaviour development in the general population (the G 1219 study). At baseline (modal age 17 years) there were 1596 participants, only 18 % of whom were fully-qualified drivers. At follow-up (modal age 20 years) 64 % were fully-qualified drivers. Attitudes to driving violations, particularly speeding, were measured in all participants at both assessments. Self-reported driving violations, also related to speeding, were measured in fully-qualified drivers at follow-up. Results <b>Attitudes</b> became <b>riskier</b> with driver training/experience. Baseline attitudes measured in pre-drivers did not independently predict violations in those that had become fully-qualified drivers at follow-up. The attitudes of learner and fully-qualified drivers at baseline independently predicted violations at follow-up.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{recognition}} that the antecedents of <b>risky</b> driving <b>attitudes</b> {{can be traced to}} the pre-driving period. Few measures of driving-specific risk taking aimed at pre-drivers (defined here as those who are not permitted to drive independently) have been validated, however, meaning our understanding of the development of <b>risky</b> driving <b>attitudes</b> is limited. This paper reports the construction of a self-report Violation Willingness Scale (VWS) for pre-drivers, examination of the existing Attitudes to Driving Violations Scale (ADVS) in pre-drivers and some preliminary data on the development of propensity to risky driving. Study One found that the VWS and ADVS had strong psychometric properties in a sample of pre-drivers aged 16 – 19 years of age. Study Two found the VWS and ADVS showed moderate to strong and somewhat independent relationships with a number of existing measures of risky driving behaviour in a sample of fully licensed drivers (age range 18 – 65 years). This evidence supports the ADVS and VWS as valid tools to measure the propensity to risky driving in pre-drivers. We also discuss preliminary evidence on the relationship between propensity to risky driving and stage of driver training and experience, which indicates that willingness to commit most violations diminishes with driving experience while attitudes and willingness to speed become riskier. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of {{motorisation}} in China {{has been well}} documented, as has the large road trauma burden the Chinese citizens are facing as a result. China’s unique political system represents an important consideration in helping reduce road trauma, yet political factors have not been previously investigated in this context. Recently, emerging issues on the road involving the adult children of politically powerful families have become a serious social problem in China, and have drawn widespread media and public attention. This study took a novel approach to examining factors associated with <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> and <b>risky</b> road use in China by investigating {{the economic and political}} background status of a sample of young Chinese drivers. An online survey was conducted in May 2015 with a sample size of 476 Chinese young drivers from across the country, aged between 18 and 28, including 305 males and 171 females. The results suggest that for participants who reported having a familial political background, more risky driving behaviours were reported among those participants who reported more impact on their life from that political background; while for participants without political background, higher personal income was associated with more risky driving behaviours.

40|$|Intervention or {{evaluation}} studies {{represent a}} small proportion of traffic psychology research. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a road safety intervention by measuring attitudes toward unsafe driving behaviors and risk perception. A sample of high school students (n = 133) participated in a road safety intervention program focusing on attitudes and risk perceptions of young people as novice drivers, pre-drivers, and passengers. This sample was compared with a matched sample of students who did not take the program (n = 172) on their attitudes and perceived risk toward unsafe driving, both prior to the program (T 1), immediately after the program (T 2), and at 6 -week follow-up (T 3). While no changes in attitudes toward unsafe driving were found for the control group, the intervention group reported <b>riskier</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward unsafe driving behaviors from T 1 to T 2 and T 3. No differences were found from T 1 to T 3 in perceived risk toward unsafe driving for either the intervention or control groups. Implications of the study include encouraging a higher rate of road safety program evaluations, leading to better understanding of the effectiveness of road safety intervention programs and how they may be designed and delivered to ensure lower engagement in unsafe driving behaviors by young drivers.

40|$|Young drivers {{between the}} ages of 16 and 24 are {{over-represented}} in motor-vehicle accident statistics worldwide. Several studies suggest that age could be a major crash risk factor in young drivers because their frontal lobes are not yet fully developed. The frontal lobes help inhibit impulsive behaviour and control executive functions which could otherwise result in higher risk taking propensity, impulsivity and reduced cognitive function which may lead to risky driving behaviours resulting in traffic accidents. This study examined the differences between 45 young (ages 16 - 18 years) and 32 adult (ages 25 years and over) male drivers in relation to cognitive ability, executive functioning, driving and risk attitudes, and impulsivity using cognitive tests and self-report questionnaires. The results showed that young drivers displayed attitudes significantly more approving of risk taking and risky driving, had significantly higher impulsivity, and were much more inclined to committing future driving violations. The adult drivers generally demonstrated higher cognitive ability and better executive functioning. A strong link was found between high risk propensity and <b>riskier</b> driving <b>attitudes,</b> which were both associated with better cognitive ability especially for young drivers. For the young drivers specifically, higher impulsivity and higher risk taking attitudes were linked with higher intentions to commit future driving violations. Also, for young drivers, poor fluency and switching were linked with a <b>riskier</b> driving <b>attitude,</b> and a safer attitude was linked to better inhibition. For the adult drivers, poor complex information processing was linked to higher risk taking attitudes.

Anticipating vulnerable profiles is crucial thereby {{in order to prevent}} the development of such pathological conditions [1, 2, 3]. Previous research has consistently shown that individual differences in Self-esteem, Impulsiveness, Obsessiveness, Ineffectiveness, and Interoceptive Awareness represent significant correlates of eating disorders [4]. The present longitudinal study was aimed at exploring distinctive personality profiles of non-clinical adolescents with stable <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards food, dieting, and their body image. EDI- 2 and a selected subset of MMPI-A content scales were administered twice, with a 7 -month interval, to a sample of 142 adolescents. For the present study, we focused on the subsample of participants with reliably stable scores on the critical EDI- 2 scales of Drive for Thinness (DT), Bulimia (Bu), and Body Dissatisfaction (BD) across the two measurement occasions, t 1 and t 2. When average profiles of adolescents with higher (> 85 ° percentile) vs lower (≤ 85 ° percentile) scores on the three EDI- 2 scales at t 1 were compared along the EDI- 2 and MMPI-A scales via one-way ANOVA, results indicated that adolescents with higher stable levels of DT revealed higher dissatisfaction with their body, higher Obsessiveness and depression levels and lower self-esteem levels; adolescents very dissatisfied with their body referred high DT scores, but they did not report higher Obsessiveness levels; adolescents with higher scores on Bu revealed lower Interoceptive Awareness and higher impulsivity, but did not refer higher levels of BD or DT. These differences in profile shapes were observed at t 1 as well as at t 2. Consistent with literature [5 - 10] our findings suggest that distinctive profile shapes might help to early identify adolescents who are at risk of developing EDs...|$|R

There were gaps in the knowledge of both healthcare providers and parents. Global adherence to the guidelines was lower among the pediatric nurses than the other healthcare providers (odds ratio 0. 875; 95 % confidence interval 0. 795 – 0. 964).

40|$|Purpose: Young novice drivers {{continue}} to be overrepresented in fatalities and injuries arising from crashes even {{with the introduction of}} countermeasures such as graduated driver licensing (GDL). Enhancing countermeasures requires {{a better understanding of the}} variables influencing risky driving. One of the most common risky behaviours performed by drivers of all ages is speeding, which is particularly risky for young novice drivers who, due to their driving inexperience, have difficulty in identifying and responding appropriately to road hazards. Psychosocial theory can improve our understanding of contributors to speeding, thereby informing countermeasure development and evaluation. This paper reports an application of Akers' social learning theory (SLT), augmented by Gerrard and Gibbons' prototype/willingness model (PWM), in addition to personal characteristics of age, gender, car ownership, and psychological traits/states of anxiety, depression, sensation seeking propensity and reward sensitivity, to examine the influences on self-reported speeding of young novice drivers with a Provisional (intermediate) licence in Queensland, Australia. Method: Young drivers (n = 378) recruited in 2010 for longitudinal research completed two surveys containing the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale, and reported their attitudes and behaviours as pre-Licence/Learner (Survey 1) and Provisional (Survey 2) drivers and their sociodemographic characteristics. Results: An Akers' measurement model was created. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that (1) personal characteristics (PC) explained 20. 3 %; (2) the combination of PC and SLT explained 41. 1 %; (3) the combination of PC, SLT and PWM explained 53. 7 % of variance in self-reported speeding. Whilst there appeared to be considerable shared variance, the significant predictors in the final model included gender, car ownership, reward sensitivity, depression, personal attitudes, and Learner speeding. Conclusions: These results highlight the capacity for psychosocial theory to improve our understanding of speeding by young novice drivers, revealing relationships between previous behaviour, attitudes, psychosocial characteristics and speeding. The findings suggest multi-faceted countermeasures should target the risky behaviour of Learners, and Learner supervisors should be encouraged to monitor their Learners' driving speed. Novice drivers should be discouraged from developing <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards speeding. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} a strong {{community}} perception that specialised driver training is an effective road safety countermeasure, there is currently no clear evidence that it produces safer drivers compared to less formalised approaches to learning. A number of factors have been suggested to account for this apparent lack of effectiveness. In particular, {{it has been suggested that}} conventional approaches to driver training do not systematically address the perceptual and cognitive skills required for safe driving, or the motivational or attitudinal factors which can exert a powerful influence on driver judgement and decision-making. Hence, it is possible that with further research and development that more effective driver training programs could be developed. With this prospect in mind, this paper identifies three main priorities for future research in the area. While assessing the crash outcomes achieved by driver training should remain a priority, {{there is a}} need for evaluations to focus on a broader range of outcomes and on the processes involved in training. There is a need to focus more research attention on improving current driver training practices, particularly in relation to the development of hazard perception and decision-making skills, self-monitoring processes, and strategies to reduce the impact of <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes</b> and motivations on driving. There is a need for more theory-driven approaches to the development and evaluation of innovative training programs. This is required to ensure that training practices are based on sound principles of behaviour change, rather than on expert opinion. It is important to note that the research priorities identified in this paper cannot be addressed in any one program of research. Rather, a philosophy of incremental improvement is required. While some important driver training research initiatives continue to occur in Australia, it is an area that receives limited funding. While this is perhaps not surprising, given the state of the evidence, there is a need to ensure that the research that does occur is well directed and coordinated, and communicated to practitioners. This is vital to bridge the gap that currently exists between research and practice in the area of driver training...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle crashes {{account for}} {{the highest number of}} {{fatalities}} for persons aged between 17 and 25 years of age in New Zealand. Despite a myriad of factors precipitating vehicle crashes, excess or inappropriate vehicle speed has been identified as the greatest predictor of crash likelihood and severity. Excess or inappropriate speed reduces a driver’s control over the vehicle, while exaggerating both collision force and the distances required in stopping or safely manoeuvring. One of the major differences identified between young and inexperienced and older more experienced drivers is the ability to adapt driving behaviour to road conditions. Young drivers are more prone to speeding through both a lack of awareness of risks and a desire to seek out novel and stimulating experiences. Recent developments in cognitive models of risk taking propose that older more experienced drivers may adapt their speed by “feeling out” the road conditions, where as young drivers may depend more upon posted limits to determine their speed. A video speed task was developed to measure speed preferences on a selection of road conditions (or ‘environments’) commonly confronting New Zealand motorists. Analyses of speed preferences revealed that young and inexperienced drivers preferred speeds close to the road-limit irrespective of conditions, whereas older and more experienced drivers preferred speeds clearly below the road limit, and demonstrated greater variation in speed preferences on different road environments. This suggests that young and inexperienced drivers both prefer faster speeds and may use the road limit as a target in determining an appropriate speed. Older and more experienced drivers prefer slower speeds, and adapt driving to changing road conditions. Faster preferred speeds were found to be related to a <b>riskier</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards driving in general, and more lenient attitudes toward speeding in particular. In addition, faster preferred speeds were found to be related to a heightened enjoyment of risk taking, as well as the number of speeding convictions issued in the previous 12 months. The used video speed task provided a convenient measure of speeding behaviour in natural driving scenarios, and appeared to be sensitive to differences in the way drivers adjust their behaviour across changing driving conditions. The video speed task might be useful in determining differences in speed choice between day and night time driving scenarios, as well as expanding the road conditions to including wet or foggy driving situations. This may be particularly useful in determining the pre- and post-effectiveness of driver training programs...|$|R

The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) {{has been used}} to identify individuals who are likely to engage in behaviours, such as speeding, which are associated with increased accident involvement. In an attempt to investigate adolescents‟ attitudes and behaviours from pre- to post-driver training, the studies presented incorporate past behaviour into the TPB. Three questionnaire-based studies were conducted in Scotland and New Zealand. The first study explored adolescent pre-drivers‟ road behaviour, driving attitudes and speeding intentions. Adolescents‟ with the greatest speeding intentions frequently engaged in high-risk road behaviour and had more accepting attitudes towards driving violations. The second study explored the development of attitudes and intentions from pre- to post-driver training. Drivers who frequently violated reported more accepting attitudes towards violations and engagement in frequent high-risk road behaviours as pre-drivers. The third study assessed the stability of pre-drivers‟ driving attitudes and speeding intentions. Adolescents‟ attitudes and intentions fluctuated significantly; however, males reported <b>riskier</b> driving <b>attitudes</b> and greater speeding intentions.

Although this audit did not measure risk attitudes or behaviour, it was envisaged that these safety-critical workers {{may be subject to}} a number of additional stressors as a consequence of their specific working environment and the need for them to negotiate personal and general risk on a day-to-day basis. The present thesis examined the relationship between the appraisal of work characteristics, psychological well-being, and risk behaviour in the safety-critical environment.. The first exploratory study was a repetition of the original well-being audit. Using the' same measures as at time one, this afforded a comparison between ratings in 2001 and two years later, in 2003. New measures were also included in order to explore the potential relationships. of interest. The results of this survey suggested that while well-being had improved, high-risk Ã‚Â·attitudes were predicted by both work characteristics and dispositional affect. ~tings of anxiety. were associated with an increase in <b>risky</b> <b>attitudes,</b> a relationship which was not easily explained by a history ofcontradictory research findings. The remainder. of the thesis sought to evaluate some of these c'ontradictory findings. Firstly an experimental study conducted in a laboratory setting analysed the contribution of egodepletion to changes in risk behaviour (risk appraisal, and risky decision making) and incidental mood-risk relationships. The findings suggested that fluctuations in risk behaviour are not a direct consequence of the depletion of a self-regulatory resource. Any relationships between mood and risk were masked by the ego-depletion manipulation. In a second experimental study the use of the simulation heuristic was examined as a possible mediator/moderator of the moodrisk relationship. The findings revealed that wh;en par:ticipants were able to minimise uncertainty. during the. decision making process they were less likely to take a risk on the Personal Risk Inventory (PR!). The ability to simulate was not related to state or trait mood however. A final applied study used the findings of a concurrent participant observation, and.. accident statistics to develop a'specific Eurostar PersonalInventory (EPRl). The analysis of the relationship between mood and risk behaviour on this measure revealed a strong positive correlation for between both trait anxiety and trait fatigue, and risky decision. making, an association moderated by the ability to simulate. Trait happiness was related to a decrease in rlskydecision making, a direct relationship not affected by the ability t,o simulate, and explained in terms ofmood regulation. The findi~gs provide an insight into. risk behaviour in this specific setting and it is envisaged that there is a clear incentive for further research in this area.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown the personality factors of impulsivity and conscientiousness are linked to engagement in health related risk-taking behaviours in the general population. Study 1 aimed to investigate how useful the personality traits of rash-spontaneous impulsivity (as conceptualised by Dawe and Loxton’s (2004) two factor model of impulsivity) and conscientiousness were in differentiating between regular (at least monthly) ecstasy users (REU) who engaged in additional risk-taking behaviours (e. g., sexual risk-taking, drug driving) versus REU who did not, {{as well as their}} ability to predict REU’s engagement in additional risk-taking behaviours. Rash-spontaneous impulsivity scores were significantly higher in REU deemed at risk for the categories of sexual, alcohol driving and binge risk. Interestingly, rash-spontaneous impulsivity scores were significantly lower in REU who engaged in injecting risk-taking behaviours than REU who did not. In a predictive fashion, rash-spontaneous impulsivity successfully predicted REU who drove under the influence of alcohol, cannabis and party drugs. There were no differences in conscientiousness scores between REU who engaged in risk-taking behaviours versus REU who did not for any domain of risk-taking, and conscientiousness did not predict engagement in any risk-taking behaviour. On a whole, findings from Study 1 contributed to the validity of models that implicate rash-spontaneous impulsivity in contributing to substance use and risk-taking behaviours, whilst providing contrary results to models that implicate conscientiousness’ role in protecting against risk-taking behaviours. Whilst this study was exploratory in nature, these preliminary findings suggest that the rashspontaneous factor of impulsivity plays a role in risky behaviours over and beyond regular ecstasy use. Study 2 aimed to further investigate the extent to which both factors of Dawe and Loxton’s (2004) model of impulsivity, rash-spontaneous impulsivity and reward sensitivity, as well as conscientiousness were able to predict engagement in risktaking behaviours as well as harm reduction behaviours in a larger, online sample of REU. Study 2 also measured and controlled for the role that attitudes towards sex and driving practices may play in predicting sexual and driving risk-taking behaviours. Results indicated that <b>riskier</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards safer sex were predictive of a greater frequency of engagement in risky sexual behaviours. Notably, driving attitudes were not successful predictors of drug driving behaviour. In relation to personality, rash-spontaneous impulsivity {{was a significant predictor of}} injecting risk-taking behaviours, and it approached significance in relation to predicting binge and overdose risk-taking behaviours. Additionally, rash-spontaneous impulsivity was a significant predictor of harm reduction behaviours in an inverse fashion. Reward sensitivity and conscientiousness were not significant predictor variables in relation to any domain of risk-taking or of engaging in harm reduction behaviour. On a whole, findings from Study 2 contributed to the validity of models that implicate rash-spontaneous impulsivity in substance use and risk-taking behaviours, whilst providing contrary results to the involvement of reward sensitivity and conscientiousness. The clinical application and usefulness of these results regarding the development and implementation of harm reduction programs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{build on}} both our {{theoretical}} and empirical work on modelling the demand for paid sex (Della Giusta et al., 2009 a, 2009 b) and examine the demand for paid sex, considering the effects of <b>risky</b> behaviours and <b>attitudes</b> to relationships and to women on demand. We find that those who declare to have purchased sex have both different socio-demographics (older, with fewer children, more educated but with lower professional status), and different sexual and risky behaviours as well as attitudes to relationships. As expected {{in the light of}} findings in the literature (well summarised in a 2004 Urban Studies special issue and in more recent literature) a clear city effect in the sample, mostly driven by London, which goes beyond the attitudes captured in the survey and thus combines a mixture of factors related to the supply of paid sex and unobserved characteristics of city-dwelling respondents...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{respondents}} {{from the}} P. R. C., U. S. A., Germany, and Poland {{were found to}} differ in risk preference, as measured by buying prices for risky financial options. Chinese respondents were significantly less risk-averse in their pricing than Americans when risk preference was assessed in the traditional expected-utility framework. However, these apparent differences in risk preference were associated primarily with cultural differences {{in the perception of}} the risk of the financial options rather than with cultural differences in attitude towards perceived risk. In all cultures, an equal proportion (the majority) of respondents was willing to pay more for options perceived as less risky, i. e., were perceived-risk averse. These results are most naturally explained within a risk-return conceptualization of risky choice. They have practical implications for cross-cultural negotiation and commerce by suggesting the locus of cultural differences in risky choice that may allow for the creation of joint gains.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} <b>risky</b> cybersecurity behaviours, <b>attitudes</b> towards cybersecurity in a business environment, Internet addiction, and impulsivity. 538 participants in part-time or full-time employment in the UK completed an online questionnaire, with responses from 515 {{being used in the}} data analysis. The survey included an attitude towards cybercrime and cybersecurity in business scale, a measure of impulsivity, Internet addiction and a ‘risky’ cybersecurity behaviours scale. The results demonstrated that Internet addiction was a significant predictor for risky cybersecurity behaviours. A positive attitude towards cybersecurity in business was negatively related to risky cybersecurity behaviours. Finally, the measure of impulsivity revealed that both attentional and motor impulsivity were both significant positive predictors of risky cybersecurity behaviours, with non-planning being a significant negative predictor. The results present a further step in understanding the individual differences that may govern good cybersecurity practices, highlighting the need to focus directly on more effective training and awareness mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in the United States. Lifeguards are at {{increased}} risk of excessive sun exposure and sunburn. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine changes in: (1) sunburn frequency over a summer while controlling for sun exposure, sun protection habits, and participation in a skin cancer prevention program; and (2) tanning attitudes while controlling for participation in the program. METHODS: Participants in this study were lifeguards (n = 3014) at swimming pools participating in the Pool Cool program in 2005. Lifeguards completed surveys at the beginning and end of the summer. Sequential regression analyses were used to assess changes in sunburn frequency and tanning attitudes. RESULTS: Sunburn frequency decreased between baseline and follow-up. Having a sunburn over the summer was significantly predicted by baseline sunburn history, ethnicity, skin cancer risk, and sun exposure. The tanning attitude, "People are more attractive if they have a tan," was significantly predicted from baseline tanning attitude and ethnicity. The second tanning attitude, "It helps to have a good base suntan," was significantly predicted by baseline tanning attitude, ethnicity, basic/enhanced group, and moderate skin cancer risk. LIMITATIONS: Self-reported data and limited generalizability to lifeguards at other outdoor pools are limitations. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that previous sunburn history is an important predictor of sunburn prospectively. In addition, a more <b>risky</b> tanning <b>attitude</b> is an important predictor of future attitudes toward tanning. Active involvement in targeted prevention programs may help to increase preventive behavior and health risk reduction...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing {{challenge}} {{for public health}} and safety is that motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are {{the leading cause of death}} for U. S. teenagers, a population with disproportionately high crash involvement relative to other road users. Quantitative and qualitative research has identified distracted driving as a significant contributor to young drivers’ overrepresentation in MVCs. This study was designed in the context of this notable public health concern, and the primary goal was to examine psychological factors that are hypothesized, via the Theory of Planned Behavior, to underlie teenage drivers’ decisions to text-while-driving (TWD) with a focus on the influence of ADHD symptoms. The psychological factors of interest were attitudes toward TWD, perceptions of crash risk while TWD, self-perceptions of competence as a driver, and perceptions of task performance. The aims of this project were addressed through a program evaluation of an experiential driver training program designed to educate young novice drivers on the dangers associated with TWD. This program, Turn Off Texting (TOT), was designed and run by the Youth Safety Council of Vermont and the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, Safety and Education Unit. Participants included 1203 high school teenagers who participated in 42 TOT program demonstrations across Vermont. The first aim of this study was to examine the influence of ADHD symptoms on psychological factors and behavioral intentions while controlling for and examining the effects of age, gender, and driving experience. ADHD symptoms were associated with more favorable attitudes toward TWD, greater intentions to TWD in the future, and lesser intentions to intervene on a distracted driver in the future. Male gender and increased driving experience also tended to be associated with <b>riskier</b> <b>attitudes,</b> perceptions, and intentions. The second aim of this work was to examine if the psychological factors mediate the associations between ADHD symptoms and the two behavioral intention variables. Results from multiple mediation models showed that only attitudes toward TWD mediated the relations for both intentions to TWD and to intervene in the future. ADHD symptoms continued to have a direct effect on behavioral intentions even when accounting for the indirect effects of the psychological factors; these findings suggest a direct relation of ADHD symptoms and an indirect relation via attitudes. The third and final aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ADHD symptoms, as well as age, gender, and driving experience, on the rate of change in the psychological factors and behavioral intention variables over the course of the TOT program. Findings from two-level regression models showed that the TOT program generally was effective in its goal to produce safer views in regards to the psychological factors and intended behaviors. As hypothesized, ADHD symptoms were associated with less change toward safer attitudes, perceptions of crash risk, and both intentions to TWD and intentions to intervene in the future; the influences of male gender and increased driving experience were similar in their associations with less change toward safer attitudes, perceptions, and intentions. The findings from this study’s three aims have important implications for the development and continued evaluation of specialized driver training programs. Namely, attitudes toward TWD are a viable target for intervention given this factor’s direct and indirect (in the association of ADHD symptoms) effect on intended behavior. Increasing ADHD symptoms and male gender were associated with less change over the course of the program, which represent two areas for more specialized intervention and study...|$|R
40|$|This study {{employed}} {{an experimental}} design {{to test the}} effects of exposure to televised portrayals of differing types of negative consequences of casual sex on emerging adults' sexual beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Male and female undergraduates {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three viewing conditions. Participants either viewed a program that portrayed negative emotional/social consequences of casual sex (i. e., guilt, regret, embarrassment, disapproval of family and friends), a negative physical consequence of casual sex (i. e., an unplanned/unwanted pregnancy), or a program without any sexual content. Outcomes were assessed immediately after exposure. Five outcome variables were examined: negative outcome expectancies of <b>risky</b> sex, <b>attitudes</b> toward casual sex, attitudes toward condoms, behavioral intentions to avoid casual sex, and behavioral intentions to use condoms. Driven by social cognitive theory, hypotheses address expected differences among the three conditions on these five outcome variables. Hypotheses about the expected effects of portrayals of negative consequences of casual sex were not confirmed. Results indicate that exposure to negative consequences of casual sex on television does not uniformly influence emerging adults' sexual beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Rather, the relationship between exposure and subsequent effects was found to be moderated by their sexual risk experience. Emerging adults with different amounts of sexual risk experience responded differently to the experimental stimuli. Participants who had extensive sexual risk experience were not influenced by the stimuli. However, effects of exposure to the negative consequence conditions were identified among participants who had little to moderate amounts of sexual risk experience. Both the negative physical and emotional/social consequence conditions led these participants to report safer sex outcomes. Findings imply that portrayals of both negative emotional/social and negative physical consequences of casual sex on television have the potential to positively influence the sexual attitudes and behavioral intentions of young people who do not already have substantial sexual risk experience...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} mechanisms proposed {{to explain the}} roles of harsh parenting and association with deviant peers on adolescent involvement in tobacco, alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Prospective, longitudinal data came from youth who participated throughout adolescence (n= 451). Information regarding observed harsh parenting and adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s relations with their peers was assessed in early adolescence (13 years), adolescent attitudes and intentions about risky behavior was assessed during middle adolescence (15 years), and engagement in risky behavior was assessed in late adolescence (18 years). Adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s gender, parents 2 ̆ 7 education, parent tobacco and alcohol use and early adolescent 2 ̆ 7 involvement in risky behaviors were used as control variables. Both harsh parenting and involvement with deviant peers was directly related to adolescent engagement in tobacco use, alcohol use and sexual behavior. Also, adolescent attitudes and intentions mediated this relationship. That is, harsh parenting and involvement with deviant peers was no longer associated with <b>risky</b> behavior once <b>attitudes</b> and intentions about risky behaviors was added in the model. This was true even after parent substance use and adolescent early involvement in risky behaviors were taken into account...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} adolescent antisocial behaviour from two theoretical perspectives: attachment and coercion theories. Adolescents (N = 662, mean age: 15. 8 years) completed measures of coping styles, attachment styles and coercive interactions (with mother and father), and rated their parents' use of hostile punishment and parental monitoring. They also reported involvement in delinquent activity and drug use, and sexual attitudes and behaviours. According to attachment theory, insecurity {{may be related}} to behavioral maladjustment directly, or indirectly through dysfunctional ways of coping. Consistent with this view, two forms of insecure attachment (dismissing and fearful) were directly associated with more delinquency, experimentation with more drugs, and using drugs in response to strong emotions. Dismissing attachment was also related to <b>riskier</b> sexual <b>attitudes.</b> However, coping style did not mediate the attachment-antisocial behaviour link. Nonetheless, attachment styles were differentially related to ways of coping with stress. Secure teens used more constructive coping and less unhealthy strategies. Those who were more dismissing or preoccupied used more emotion avoidance, and those who were more fearful tended to be self-critical and to withdraw emotionally and behaviorally. A non-significant trend between fearful attachment and angry confrontation was also found. According to coercion theory, ineffective parenting contributes to adolescent antisocial behaviour indirectly, through association with deviant peers. Consistent with this model, results from structural equation modeling showed that teens who are monitored more associate with less deviant peers, and engage in less antisocial activity. Those whose parents use hostile punishment are more antisocial. The combination of both theoretical perspectives, using path analysis, allowed a more complete understanding of adolescent antisocial behaviour. Insecure attachment was indirectly related to delinquency and substance use, through a contentious home environment (characterized by hostile punishment, coercive interactions, and poor monitoring). The link between insecure attachment with father and antisocial outcomes was also mediated by more frequent coercive interactions and teens' use of more angry confrontation. These findings highlight the relevance of considering both affective and social learning processes for understanding adolescent risk behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Road Ready Teens video game "Streetwise, " in (1) raising teen awareness of key driving risks, (2) strengthening positive attitudes toward driving safety guidelines, and (3) emphasizing that the experience they get through practice-driving helps them become safe drivers. Twenty-four teens who were either within three months of beginning, or were currently taking but had not completed driver education, were evaluated before and after 50 minutes of playing Streetwise, and then participated in a focus group lasting one hour. Pre- and post-game comparisons indicated that playing Streetwise significantly increased perceptions of personal driving risk; however, intentions to avoid <b>risky</b> driving behaviors, <b>attitudes</b> toward driving guidelines, and acceptance of driving guidelines did not change significantly from pre- to post-test. Girls were more likely than boys to report increased awareness of driving risks, greater acceptance of driving guidelines, and clearer perceptions of personal driving risk. Prior driving experience, video game playing experience, risk-taking propensity, driving risk-taking, and living locale (i. e., rural vs. in-town) also related to game outcomes. Teens in the focus groups said the video game gave too little opportunity to make driving decisions and not enough vehicle control to practice safe driving. The...|$|R
