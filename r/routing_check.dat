30|$|Each node {{maintains}} {{this space}} parameter calculated from (2) {{in order to}} determine their congestion state. Once the route request is received by any node, the <b>routing</b> algorithm <b>checks</b> for the node’s queue space. If it is less than the threshold value Lmin, it is marked as congested. It implies that the node cannot hold any more of the data. So, alternate route is searched to reach the destination. If the node is free, then its neighbors are checked for congestion state. If all the neighbors are congested, node has no alternate way to forward the route request RREQ. So, a priority queue is maintained and the RREQ is transmitted using that priority queue as there are no neighbors for forwarding the request. This is the extreme rare case in a MANET. So, our algorithm checks for least possible cases of routing in a MANET. In this manner, the route request reaches the destination or any intermediate node replies with a route reply.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Gridtechnology emerges {{with the}} needof {{resource}} sharing andcooperation in wide area. Comparedwith the traditional single computer system, effective resource locating in Gridis {{difficult because of}} huge amount and wide-area distribution of dynamical resources. In this paper, we propose a Routing-Transferring resource discovery model, which includes three basic roles: the resource requester, the resource router and the resource provider. The provider sends its resource information to a router, which maintains this information in routing tables. When a router receives a resource request from a requester, it <b>checks</b> <b>routing</b> tables to choose a route for it andtransfer it to another router or provider. We give the formalization of this model and analyze {{the complexity of the}} SD-RT (Shortest Distance Routing-Transferring) algorithm. The analysis shows that the resource discovery time depends on topology (the longest path in the graph) anddistribution of resources. When topology and distribution are definite, the SD-RT algorithm can finda resource in the shortest time. Our experiments also show that when topology is definite, the performance is determined by resource distribution, which includes two important factors: resource frequency andresource location. The testing result shows that high frequency and even location of resources can reduce the resource discovery time significantly. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{business}} {{markets of}} today are continuously becoming more globalized making {{the quality of}} delivered products and services more important for companies to achieve customer satisfaction and long-term business growth. One essential part of quality work {{is to reduce the}} costs of poor quality which is partially represented by yield loss. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate why yield loss occurs in manufacturing of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications and how it can be reduced. The work of the thesis was limited to one product group and carried out as an improvement project in accordance to the five phases of Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). Yield loss of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications is measured {{at the end of the}} assembly process where 100 percent of the radio base stations are connected to automatic testing equipment and run through a series of automatic tests. A radio base station that fails to pass the first series of tests is considered a failed product and thereby contributes to yield loss. In the define phase the average yield loss for the past ten weeks was calculated as 83 percent and compared to the target level of 90 percent. A high-level understanding of the assembly and testing process was also created through a SIPOC map. The measure phase established a more detailed understanding of assembly and testing by creation of process flow charts for the whole process. A more detailed understanding of the test procedure was also developed by mapping the different connection interfaces between the radio base station and the test station. This description also made it clear that the test can be divided into test groups consisting of test points which in turn consist of individual test cases constituting measurement values and limits. The flow of information around the test process was also mapped to provide knowledge of where necessary data could be found and collected. The analyze phase started with a breakdown of yield loss where measurement values categorized as outliers were found to represent a large portion of yield loss. Looking into the outliers-category, radio base stations with no fault code given (products that have failed the first test and passed a retest without any action) was identified as interesting. Through brainstorming and an affinity diagram workshop, about causes to outliers with no fault code given, connection issues and different measurement values were highlighted for analysis. Further construction and analysis of Pareto charts showed that some interface connections and measurement values were more frequently involved in outliers with no fault code given. By looking into test points for relevant interface connections and combining these with measurement values the test point External Alarm Check was found relevant for root-cause analysis. An initial time series analysis of the occurrence of External Alarm Check did not lead to any clear root-causes. Through further investigation of the problem together with a test engineer in the production it was identified that the test point failure was caused by improper connection of two cables used during the test. Further analysis of what could cause this improper connection indicated problems with missing connection <b>checks,</b> <b>routing</b> of cables, fixing of test equipment, connector design, and maintenance routines. The analysis of this test point also highlighted problems related to unclear working routines and insufficient documentation of actions for products that pass a retest. Based on the findings the improve phase focused on developing improvement suggestions to minimize the impact from identified issues. Nanjing Communications were recommended to stabilize and align the test station environment, use connection checks for all test points, develop robust connectors, evaluate maintenance routines, standardize retest procedures, and ensure documentation of actions. At last the control phase emphasized the importance of communication between different production sites in relation to suggested improvements as well as ensuring that implemented improvements are standardized and documented for future work.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{toward the}} design of a quality-of-service (QoS) aware network layer for wireless ad hoc networks. With the lack of an infrastructure in ad hoc networks, the role of the network layer is not only to perform multihop routing between a source node and a destination node, but also to establish an end-to-end connection between communicating peers that satisfies the service level requirements of multimedia applications running on those peers. Wireless ad hoc networks represent autonomous distributed systems that are infrastructure-less, fully distributed, and multi-hop in nature. Over the last few years, wireless ad hoc networks have attracted significant attention from researchers. This has been fueled by recent technological advances in the development of multifunction and low-cost wireless communication gadgets. Wireless ad hoc networks have diverse applications spanning several domains, including military, commercial, medical, and home networks. Projections indicate that these self-organizing wireless ad hoc networks will eventually become the dominant form of the architecture of telecommunications networks in the near future. Recently, due to increasing popularity of multimedia applications, QoS support in wireless ad hoc networks has become an important yet challenging objective. The challenge lies in the need to support the heterogeneous QoS requirements (e. g., data rate, packet loss probability, and delay constraints) for multimedia applications and, at the same time, to achieve efficient radio resource utilization, taking into account user mobility and dynamics of multimedia traffic. In terms of research contributions, we first present a position-based QoS routing framework for wireless ad-hoc networks. The scheme provides QoS guarantee in terms of packet loss ratio and average end-to-end delay (or throughput) to ad hoc networks loaded with constant rate traffic. Via cross-layer design, we apply call admission control and temporary bandwidth reservation on discovered routes, taking into consideration the physical layer multi-rate capability and the medium access control (MAC) interactions such as simultaneous transmission and self interference from route members. Next, we address the network-layer resource allocation where a single-hop ad hoc network is loaded with random traffic. As a starting point, we study the behavior of the service process of the widely deployed IEEE 802. 11 DCF MAC when the network is under different traffic load conditions. Our study investigates the near-memoryless behavior of the service time for IEEE 802. 11 saturated single-hop ad hoc networks. We show that the number of packets successfully transmitted by any node over a time interval follows a general distribution, which is close to a Poisson distribution with an upper bounded distribution distance. We also show that the service time distribution can be approximated by the geometric distribution and illustrate that a simplified queuing system can be used efficiently as a resource allocation tool for single hop IEEE 802. 11 ad hoc networks near saturation. After that, we shift our focus to providing probabilistic packet delay guarantee to multimedia users in non-saturated IEEE 802. 11 single hop ad hoc networks. We propose a novel stochastic link-layer channel model to characterize the variations of the IEEE 802. 11 channel service process. We use the model to calculate the effective capacity of the IEEE 802. 11 channel. The channel effective capacity concept is the dual of the effective bandwidth theory. Our approach offers a tool for distributed statistical resource allocation in single hop ad hoc networks, which combines both efficient resource utilization and QoS provisioning to a certain probabilistic limit. Finally, we propose a statistical QoS routing scheme for multihop IEEE 802. 11 ad hoc networks. Unlike most of QoS routing schemes in literature, the proposed scheme provides stochastic end-to-end delay guarantee, instead of average delay guarantee, to delay-sensitive bursty traffic sources. Via a cross-layer design approach, the scheme selects the routes based on a geographical on-demand ad hoc <b>routing</b> protocol and <b>checks</b> the availability of network resources by using traffic source and link-layer channel models, incorporating the IEEE 802. 11 characteristics and interaction.
