500|$|Large scale {{oligonucleotide}} synthesizers {{were often}} developed by augmenting {{the capabilities of}} a preexisting instrument platform. One of the first mid scale synthesizers appeared in the late 1980s, manufactured by the Biosearch company in Novato, CA (The 8800). This platform was originally designed as a peptide synthesizer and made use of a fluidized bed reactor essential for accommodating the swelling characteristics of polystyrene supports used in the Merrifield methodology. Oligonucleotide synthesis involved the use of CPG (controlled pore glass) which is a <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> and is more suited for column reactors as described above. The scale of the 8800 {{was limited to the}} flow rate required to fluidize the support. Some novel reactor designs as well as higher than normal pressures enabled the 8800 to achieve scales that would prepare 1 mmole of oligonucleotide. In the mid 1990s several companies developed platforms that were based on semi-preparative and preparative liquid chromatographs. These systems were well suited for a column reactor approach. In most cases all that was required was to augment the number of fluids that could be delivered to the column. Oligo synthesis requires a minimum of 10 and liquid chromatographs usually accommodate 4. This was an easy design task and some semi-automatic strategies worked without any modifications to the preexisting LC equipment. PerSeptive Biosystems as well as Pharmacia (GE) were two of several companies that developed synthesizers out of liquid chromatographs. Genomic Technologies, Inc. {{was one of the few}} companies to develop a large scale oligonucleotide synthesizer that was, from the ground up, an oligonucleotide synthesizer. The initial platform called the VLSS for very large scale synthesizer utilized large Pharmacia liquid chromatograph columns as reactors and could synthesize up to 75 millimoles of material. Many oligonucleotide synthesis factories designed and manufactured their own custom platforms and little is known due to the designs being proprietary. The VLSS design continued to be refined and is continued in the QMaster synthesizer [...] which is a scaled down platform providing milligram to gram amounts of synthetic oligonucleotide.|$|E

2500|$|Lower {{extremity}} casts {{are classified}} similarly, with a cast encasing both the foot and the leg to the hip {{being called a}} long leg cast, while a cast encasing the patient's foot, ankle and lower leg ending below the knee {{is referred to as}} a short leg cast. A walking heel may be applied for ambulation. These heels, when properly applied, elevate the toes and offer the wearer the advantage of keeping the toes out of the dirt and moisture of the street. [...] The walking heel provides a small contact patch for the cast and creates a fluid rocking motion during the stride and allows the cast to pivot easily in any direction. Similarly, a cast shoe/cast boot/cast sandal may be provided to the patient to be used during ambulation of the immobilized limb during convalescence (referred to as being weight bearing). [...] Additionally, a castshoe may be used to simply protect the patient's casted foot while helping to maintain a higher degree of hygiene by preventing the cast from directly contacting potentially dirty or wet ground surfaces. [...] Where the patient is not to walk on the injured limb, crutches or a wheelchair may be provided. The foot's under-sole portion of a leg cast may be extended terminating {{at the tip of the}} patient's toes, to create a <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> which limits motion of the metatarsals in both weight bearing and non-weight bearing leg casts. [...] These are referred to as toeplates in the orthopedic discipline of medicine. This addition may be applied to further support and stabilize the metatarsals by limiting motion through a higher degree of immobilization, as well as protecting the toes from additional blunt force trauma. Typically leg casts which incorporate a toeplate are prescribed for injuries to the foot and metatarsals. [...] Ordinarily, a leg cast applied for the treatment of a stable ankle fracture would not use the toeplate design because there is no need to immobilize and limit the motion of the patient's toes.|$|E

Enclosed supports are not widely used, applicable to main roadways suffering high stresses.|$|R

40|$|A dynamic mechanical. thermal {{analysis}} (DMTA) performed on stacked coated supports or on samples sandwiched between <b>rigid</b> <b>supports</b> (carbon or glass fibers, metal or glass plates, [...] .) is described. The {{choice of a}} dual cantilever deformation favors the shear strain of the less stiff material between the more <b>rigid</b> <b>supports.</b> A theoretical model demonstrates that the less stiff material response is mainly recorded and moreover amplified. An exceptional sensitivity to the soft material is therefore observed. This method does not require any special sample (only stacking of coated supports or sample sandwiching) whilst it enables to characterize in situ polymer coating, even nanocoating. This characterization is of prime interest in technological coating developments such as paints, fiber sizings, glues, [...] . This possible measurement of thermal transitions peculiar to nanocoatings also opens more fundamental studies as the probing of interface influence on thermal transitions.

Box 800, Riyadh 11451, Saudi ArabiaA {{versatile}} finite strip {{model for}} plate bending capable {{of dealing with}} plates continuous over <b>rigid</b> <b>supports,</b> in both directions, is developed.

40|$|Evaluation of {{the ability}} of three models of the ulna to predict ulnar {{resonant}} frequency.

In model I the tube is attached at each end to <b>rigid</b> <b>supports</b> by hinges, in model II the tube is attached to <b>rigid</b> <b>supports</b> by springs rather than hinges, while model III is the same as model II except for the addition of a spring-mass system simulating an accelerometer strapped to the wrist. It is found that all three models exhibit comparable effectiveness in predicting the allowed cyclic vibration frequency, although model I is marginally better than models II or III in predicting this parameter. All three models also yield relatively realistic values for Young's modulus. In terms of results, therefore, there is no clear choice between the models. However, owing to greater costs incurred with models II and III, it is concluded that model I is the most useful, even though it is the least 'realistic' of the three models evaluated. ...|$|R
