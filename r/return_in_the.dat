40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} <b>the</b> relationship between <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residential property markets and two key economic variables of output and interest rates. The main focus was on the short-term rates path {{and how it is}} influenced by the Taylor rule fundamentals and in turn, its effect on <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property markets within the developing countries of South Africa, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Czech Republic. A secondary focus was on building a model that can be further developed into a full forecasting model of <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residential property markets. Output was found to be a strong driver of <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residential property markets across all four countries. Real changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> economic activity feed into the residential property markets and drives returns. Output can be incorporated into a forecasting framework for <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residential property markets within these countries The short-term rate paths within the countries studied were found to be consistent with the Taylor rule but with heavy short run deviations from the rule. Short-term rates deviated from <b>the</b> rule <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run, but showed a tendency to revert to <b>the</b> rule <b>in</b> subsequent periods. <b>Returns</b> and prices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property markets were driven by the short-term rates only <b>in</b> two of <b>the</b> emerging markets. For these countries, this link between rate and returns mean there was also a link between monetary policy and <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property sector. Similar to the Taylor rule process, property <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two emerging markets were found to have short run deviations which could not be explained by interest rates and output. For the purposes of building a fully fledged forecasting model, this model must be expanded to include other explanatory factors.
