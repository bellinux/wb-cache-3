40|$|Tissue {{assembly}} is {{a fundamental}} biological process that arises from complex cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Angiogenesis {{is the process of}} capillary formation that enables normal physiological responses like wound healing and mediates disease states like tumorigenesis. During angiogenesis, capillary endothelial cells degrade the basement membrane, proliferate, migrate, and assemble a new vascular network. While there is much focus on growth factor signaling cascades that enable angiogenesis, less {{attention has been paid to}} the role of mechanics in capillary formation. Notably, capillary <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> has been demonstrated on compliant, but not stiff, substrates suggesting that the mechanical microenvironment also mediates angiogenesis. However, it is unknown whether, or how, substrate stiffness regulates capillary <b>network</b> <b>assembly.</b> Herein, we demonstrate that substrate stiffness regulates capillary <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> and mediates endothelial cell behaviors that enable assembly. Compliant (E 1 kPa), substrates promote the self-assembly of endothelial cell networks that result from a balance of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Substrate stiffness alters the localization of VE-cadherin and focal adhesions, mediators of endothelial cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, respectively. Endothelial <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> also requires polymerization of the matrix protein fibronectin that stabilizes cell-cell interactions. Analogously, we demonstrate that mammary cell <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> is also sensitive to substrate stiffness and requires the deposition of laminin. Our findings indicate that compliant substrates foster <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> by promoting cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, and reducing cell-matrix adhesion. We further investigate the role of substrate stiffness in mediating changes in cell shape and contractility. We determine that substrate stiffness and ligand density alter cell area, and that both stiffness and cell area are significant predictors of traction force generation in endothelial cells during cell-cell contact. In addition, we demonstrate that substrate stiffness alters the synthesis and deposition of fibronectin and extra domain B-fibronectin, an isoform preferentially localized to neovasculature, by modulating cell shape and the directionality of traction forces in endothelial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that substrate stiffness regulates capillary <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> by altering endothelial cell behaviors that facilitate assembly. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the mechanical microenvironment regulates capillary <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> and enable approaches to control angiogenesis for therapeutic use...|$|R

40|$|Using human MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) lacking VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) {{receptor}}s, we {{show that}} the pro-angiogenic receptor neuropilin- 1 associates with phosphorylated PDGFRs [PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptors], thereby regulating cell signalling, migration, prolifera-tion and <b>network</b> <b>assembly.</b> Neuropilin- 1 co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with phosphorylated PDGFRs {{in the presence of}} growth factors. Neuropilin- 1 knockdown blocked PDGF-AA-induced PDGFRα phosphorylation and migration, reduced PDGF-BB-induced PDGFRβ activation and migration, blocked VEGF-A activation of both PDGFRs, and attenuated proliferation. Neuropilin- 1 prominently co-localized with both PDGFRs within MSC networks assembled in MatrigelTM and in the chorioallantoic membrane vasculature microenvironment, and its knockdown grossly disrupted <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> and decreased PDGFR signalling. Thus neuropilin- 1 regulates MSCs by forming ligand-specific receptor complexes that direct PDGFR signalling, especially the PDGFRα homodimer. This receptor cross-talk may control the mobilization of MSCs in neovascularization and tissue remodelling.

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a general {{acceptance}} world-wide {{in the role of}} satellite in serving the telecommunication needs of rural areas, including most of the local access connections to the main terrestrial national network. Further, it is even possible to replace the whole basic terrestrial network entirely by a satellite network, whenever, it is economically feasible. Therefore, the study of the economic of satellite <b>rural</b> <b>network</b> is of a considerable importance. This paper presents a case study of the <b>rural</b> telecommunication <b>network</b> in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that combines both satellite and local conductivity. The study aimed towards showing that for serving a large number of the Kingdom rural regions it may be more economical to fulfil the regions telecommunication requirements through satellite facilities rather than terrestrial alternatives. The cost optimization model developed by Roy D. Rosner was applied by this study on selected districts of the Kingdom. The averge overall rural requirement of the Kingdom is then estimated by generalization of the results obtained. The study shows that the least cost solution of the Saudi <b>rural</b> <b>network</b> can be achieved by a hybrid network that uses satellite technology as well as terrestrial facilities. In addition, this study examines the relationship among various elements of the <b>rural</b> <b>network</b> that influence the optimization of the network design, and presents a comparison of the economics of the satellite earth stations access with various terrestrial rural communication alternatives...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of National <b>Rural</b> <b>Networks</b> is a requisite for all EU member states following {{adoption of the}} 2005 Rural Development Regulation. Although networking, particularly {{in the form of}} exchanging experience and/or establishing partnerships, is not a novelty, the setting up of national <b>rural</b> <b>networks</b> is envisaged by policy makers in Brussels as an instrument that will enhance the effectiveness of rural development policy across the Community. However, the implementation of such an instrument represents a challenge for the new member states. This is particularly the case for Romania, where experience with networking is sparse. Building on a survey of network members in Romania, this paper identifies major challenges for the actors involved and explores the potential for networking in that country. Findings show that Romania's NRN faces difficulties in exploiting the benefits that ânetworkingâ theoretically offers. For Romania, where administration and beneficiaries lack experience and capacities, and where the policy delivery process needs to be improved, the potential technical assistance through the NRN is likely to have a significant impact, but there is a long way to go. Keys for successful implementation are clearly defined endogenously grown objectives, sufficient communication and the political will.

40|$|Objective—The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the role of Cdc 42 in embryonic vasculogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. Methods and Results — By using genetically modified mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, we demonstrate that ablation of the Rho GTPase Cdc 42 blocks vascular <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> during embryoid body (EB) vasculogenesis without affecting endothelial lineage differentiation. Reexpression of Cdc 42 in mutant EBs rescues the mutant phenotype, establishing an essential role for Cdc 42 in vasculogenesis. Chimeric analysis revealed that the vascular phenotype is caused by inactivation of Cdc 42 in endothelial cells rather than surrounding cells. Endothelial cells isolated from Cdc 42 -null EBs are defective in directional migration and <b>network</b> <b>assembly.</b> In addition, activation of atypical protein kinase C (PKC) is abolished in Cdc 42 -null endothelial cells, and PKC ablation phenocopies the vascular abnormalities of the Cdc 42 -null EBs. Moreover, the inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) at Ser 9 depends on Cdc 42 and PKC, and expression of kinase-dead GSK- 3 in Cdc 42 -null EBs promotes the formation of linear endothelial segments without branches. These results suggest that PKC and GSK- 3 are downstream effectors of Cdc 42 during vascular morphogenesis. Conclusion — Cdc 42 controls vascular <b>network</b> <b>assembly</b> but not endothelial lineage differentiation by activating PKC during embryonic vasculogenesis.
