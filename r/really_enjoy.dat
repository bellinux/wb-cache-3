In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

25|$|Maxwell {{approached}} her agent for ideas. The agent {{suggested that she}} look into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as all three were becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized {{that she would not}} enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were well written, she did not <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> the first four stories. The last one that she read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her {{fall in love with the}} genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty additional category romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career. This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann's middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan's middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.|$|E

500|$|Yard {{believed}} that eligible national parks {{had to be}} scenically stunning. [...] He noted in his 1919 volume The Book of the National Parks that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. [...] He wrote, [...] "e shall not <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until we realize that scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, and until we learn to read that page."

500|$|Titan Quest {{received}} positive reviews upon release: aggregate site Metacritic {{recorded a}} score of 77/100 based on 51 critic reviews. Eric Neigher of 1UP.com enjoyed Titan Quest while noting that it stayed within genre traditions: he rounded off his review by saying [...] "While it may not break, or even dent, any new ground, Titan Quest features a beautifully realized game world based on a tried-and-true core mechanic, with tons of replayability". Jim Rossignol of Eurogamer said that, while it stood high among its contemporary peers, Titan Quest did not evolve the genre {{enough for him to}} <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> it. GameSpy's Miguel Lopez praised the visuals, gameplay, character customization and editing tools. His main criticisms were performance difficulties and the large potential for cheating in multiplayer. GameSpot's Ryan Davis called it [...] "the next-best thing" [...] to a new Diablo title, praising its single-player campaign and multiplayer while faulting its familiar feel, inventory system and recurring technical issues.|$|E

[...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, [...] "The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E

It also happens to be one of Konami’s best products!" [...] They added that [...] "With superb Roland sound (the TV show theme and opening animations are quite good) and smooth animation, our only wish is that Konami would consider releasing this fine arcade delight with full VGA support sometime in the future. If you like Bart and <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> arcade games, you have to get this one." [...] William Burrill of Toronto Star commented that [...] "the graphics in House of Weirdness are sharp and colorful, and look much like the television show. Music from the real show is also included, along with digitized samples of Bart's rather whining voice." [...] Computer Gaming World liked the graphics' resemblance to the TV show, and concluded that [...] "House of Weirdness stands up as well as any 'Super-Maroid' arcade game".|$|E

You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'"

You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you {{to come out and}} play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction."

500|$|Peters {{was born}} in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He began riding at age seven, and {{competing}} in weekend dressage shows. By 15, he was competing outside of Germany, at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark. He received his first horse, Udon, at age 16 as a gift from his father; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1984, he spent the summer training in San Diego, California, before returning to Germany to perform his army service. In 1985, {{he returned to the}} United States with Udon. In 1991, he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor, Lila Kommerstad, who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters' Arroyo Del Mar training barn. Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992, saying, [...] "The whole idea of being so patriotic, of feeling so close to one's country makes a difference. There are not too many other countries where the people are so patriotic. I <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> this about America." [...] Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife, Shannon. Their large dressage barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012, around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders.

[...] He continued that {{it is unlikely that}} [...] "Right Round" [...] would have gone over well in Brooklyn in the '80s, calling it [...] "as hard as Jell-O." [...] Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated in his review of the song, [...] "It's pretty difficult to ruin a pop classic, but Flo Rida gives it a pretty good stab here." [...] He added that [...] "Right Round" [...] is [...] "illed with more misogyny than a 1970s working mens' club", and called it [...] "an unpleasant affair that's only saved from the trashcan by its sample." [...] Fletcher concluded, [...] "The fuzzy synths, electro beats and infectious chorus hook sung by Kesha are almost enough to fool the casual listener into enjoying themselves. But sadly it's never too long before Flo Rida turns up again to spoil things." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a horrendous rap remake of Dead or Alive's 'You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).'" [...] Noting that the song was, at the time, the number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, he added, [...] "What does all this say about us as a society? Mainly that we really, <b>really</b> <b>enjoy</b> cheesetastic '80s hair-pop hits in whatever form we can get 'em, I guess." ...|$|E
