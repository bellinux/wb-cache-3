The {{output transistor}} {{is not allowed}} to saturate (i.e. its base-collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor. Since <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> is equal to the sum of its own base-emitter <b>voltage</b> and the <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage.

IGBTs {{have been reported to}} fail under excessive electrical and thermal stresses in variable speed drives and are considered as reliability problems in wind turbines, inverters in hybrid electric vehicles and railway traction motors. There is a need to develop methods to detect anomalous behavior and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of IGBTs to prevent system downtime and costly failures. In this study, a framework for prognostics of IGBTs was developed to provide early warnings of failure and predict the remaining useful life. The prognostic framework was implemented on non punch through (NPT) IGBTs. Power cycling of IGBTs was performed and the gate-emitter <b>voltage,</b> <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage,</b> <b>collector-emitter</b> current and case temperature was monitored in-situ during aging. The on-state collector-emitter current (ICE(ON)) and <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> (VCE(ON)) were identified as precursors to IGBT failure.
