25|$|The {{geography}} of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most {{of the country}} is dominated by the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra delta; the northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh has 57 trans-boundary rivers, making the resolution of water issues to be politically complicated, in most cases, as the country is a lower <b>riparian</b> <b>state</b> to India.|$|E

Also dam failures in upstream states can create flash floods or further dam failures in downstream states causing unprecedented property damage and loss of human lives. IRWD Act (section 3) clearly stipulates that mere anticipation of a <b>riparian</b> <b>state</b> actions which can affect other <b>riparian</b> <b>state</b> interests is enough to raise interstate water dispute.|$|E

40|$|Rival use {{of limited}} water {{resources}} among <b>riparian</b> <b>states</b> is often problematic and politically contentious. The hydro-politics for transboundary rivers links its riparians in complex multidimensional networks of environmental, political, economic, and security interdependencies. In regions where water is politically scarce, {{expected to become}} hydrologically more so, and shared, it may be considered more valuable, thus potentially rendering cooperation or conflict prospects more significant. Given the number of agreements, basin organizations, and joint and permanent commissions/ committees, transboundary water cooperation amongst southern Africa basin riparians is considered high. Still, a <b>riparian</b> <b>state’s</b> competing claims for limited water resources is often problematic and politically contentious because: (a) water agreements are often not about water, (b) cooperation does not equal a lack of no conflict, and (c) understanding the strategic interaction among <b>riparian</b> <b>states</b> as signatories to transboundary river agreements requires a contextual framework. Water {{may not be the}} only story and history and hydro-hegemony are important. In this research, the contextual framework focuses on understanding when an...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explore the core drivers of international cooperation over shared water courses particularly in Southern African, using {{the example of the}} Okavango River Basin as a case study. As a starting point it highlights the hydro-political context of Southern African, which is dominated by more than 21 shared water courses and faces significant challenges to its water sector namely through climate variability and population growth. In light of these pressing issues which could create a security complex for sovereign <b>riparian</b> <b>states,</b> international cooperation over trans-boundary water sources is imperative. Drawing on core theories of international relations, this dissertation suggests that cooperation between <b>riparian</b> <b>states</b> is a result of strong institutional frameworks, at a river-basin, regional and international level. Cooperation is further reinforced through development functionalism which {{plays an important role in}} facilitating cooperation through the advancement of regional development goals and initiatives. Finally, the dissertation explores the role of international norms of cooperation over trans-boundary water courses and the important role they play in fostering cooperation. Using the case of the Okavango River Basin, the dissertation suggests that in Southern Africa, the strongest driver of cooperation is strong legal and institutional frameworks, which once established, form the basis for sustainable cooperation for water diplomacy between <b>riparian</b> <b>states.</b> Cooperation over the Okavango River Basin and the twenty years of cooperation established between Angola, Namibia and Botswana through the Permanent Cubango-Okavango River Basin Commission (OKACOM) highlights an optimistic account for hydro-political cooperation over trans-boundary water systems between sovereign <b>riparian</b> <b>states</b> and provides a useful model for water basin agreements that are yet to be established. This thesis thus concludes that in light of the growing challenges facing the water sector in Southern Africa, strong institutions and legal frameworks are required to enhance cooperation among <b>riparian</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

The following critical examination of the treaties brings to light numerous legal defects associated with fraud, coercion, exclusivity and the deficiency of many of the precepts of the international law. Moreover, the lower riparian states’ advocacy for the succession of colonial treaties, which is branded as the re-affirmation of colonialism, is found to be incompatible with the principles of the clean-slate theory adopted by the upper <b>riparian</b> <b>states.</b> Therefore, the region lacks an efficacious regime that could address the interests of all <b>riparian</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

30|$|In an {{environmentally}} interdependent world the environmental or ecological decline of one country or region {{is a problem}} for the entire community of nations on earth. With the emergence of post-colonial nation states, an array of demarcation lines was drawn on the common rivers according to the borders of newly established states. It developed a sense of individual ownership instead of collective ownership of the common rivers. Rivers were no longer being considered as an integrated unit of resources. Upper <b>riparian</b> <b>states</b> started to use common rivers to the end of their own interests at the cost of the interests of the lower <b>riparian</b> <b>states.</b> And this can be identified as one of the major reasons that created problems among the co-riparian states around the world.|$|R

While widely varying hydrologic and economic characteristics of river basins create a large set of possible outcomes, a range of stylized case studies indicates that percentage compacts are likely to generate greater net benefits and to result in more equitable risk-sharing than fixed compacts under many circumstances.
