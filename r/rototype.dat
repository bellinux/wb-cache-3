5000|$|The Alfa Romeo G1 was {{the first}} all-new design from Alfa Romeo {{after the end of}} the A.L.F.A. brand. Giuseppe Merosi, while engaged in a legal dispute with Nicola Romeo {{regarding}} the brand takeover conditions, designed the update for the prewar 24HP into the revised 20/30ES and the new luxury G1. The chassis was lengethened and stiffened from the 1914 40-60 HP model, entering into market territory competition with Rolls-Royce. A new 6.3 L straight-6 engine was introduced, producing [...] and 216 lbft Nm of torque. The G1 achieved a maximum speed of 86 mi/h km/h, winning its production class at the Coppa del Garda race. Total production was only 52 copies; it found virtually no customers in Italy and all 50 (bar 2 <b>rototypes)</b> found their way to Australia. Only one known survivoir exists; is owned by New Zealand's Alfa importer and is the oldest surviving Alfa Romeo-branded car.|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of IMECE 2005 1 Copyright © 2005 by ASME ested. The paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} some of the issues hat need to be addressed by this approach. Significant areas of oncern include link design and tolerancing issues. NTRODUCTION One of the principal challenges in constructing working <b>rototypes</b> of spatial mechanisms is the large amount of custom esign and machining for each individual assembly. We are uilding multiple testable prototypes in pursuit of automated ssembly uses for low degree-of-freedom spatial mechanisms, ith particular interest in the spherical four-bar. The tests are ntended to compare actual performance and control methods to heoretical values [2][3][10]. As a result, we have developed a ethod for economically and quickly constructing a spherical our-bar. This method will build a mechanism with the interior ngles and initial joint axes that define the kinematics. It is ssumed that the particular angle and axes have been etermined by a separate synthesis method. From the initial ata, a procedure is followed which produces mechanical rawings based on standardized elements. The elements are esigned for ease of manufacture on a standard 2 -axis mill, ven without CNC capabilities. The final product is a functional spherical four-bar echanism. The mechanism has a smooth motion profile with assembly tasks that would otherwise be completed by a robot. Ruth and McCarthy [9] demonstrated the versatility of a spherical four-bar (s 4 R) by showing that {{it can be used to}} move an object to four specified orientations. Tse and Larochelle [11] showed how spherical mechanisms may be used to solve spherical approximations of general spatial tasks. Larochelle e...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} role of context-aware policy matching in an event-driven architecture (EDA). In particular, a context-aware rule engine is adopted to derive conclusions based on the current contexts and business policies. Figure 1 shows the functional modules of the <b>rototype</b> designed to demonstrate {{the advantages of the}} proposed approach. In the Underlying Architecture layer, standard SOA is combined with EDA. The Context-Aware Rule Engine layer consists of three distinct agents for collecting preference profiles, ambient or context information, and dynamic events. All information collected will be forwarded to the Rule Engine, augmented with the Rule Repository and Context Ontology. Results from the Rule Engine will be given to the Action Agent that performs the desired sequence of actions. The following sections contain detailed description of each module...|$|E
40|$|General Directorate of Forests (GDF) {{has not yet}} {{created the}} spatial forest {{database}} to manage forest and catch the developed countries in forestry. The lack of spatial forest database results in collection of the spatial data redundancy, communication problems among the forestry organizations. Also it causes Turkish forestry to be backward of informatics’ era. To solve these problems; GDF should establish spatial forest database supported Geographic Information System (GIS). To design the spatial database, supported GIS, which provides accurate, on time and current data/info for decision makers and operators in forestry, and to develop sample interface program to apply and monitor classical forest management plans is paramount in contemporary forest management planning process. This research is composed of three major stages: (i) spatial <b>rototype</b> database design considering required by the three hierarchical organizations of GDF (regional directorate of forests, forest enterprise, and territorial division), (ii) user interface program developed to apply and monitor classical management plans based on the designed database, (iii) {{the implementation of the}} designed database and its user interface in Artvin Central Planning Unit...|$|E
40|$|SLMS (TM) {{a thermal}} {{technology}} has been demonstrated in the small 4 -foot helium cryogenic test chamber located at the NASA/MSFC X-Ray Calibration Facility (XRCF). A SLMS (TM) Ultraviolet Demonstrator Mirror (UVDM) produced by Schafer under a NASA/MSFC Phase I SBIR was helium cryo tested both free standing and bonded to a Schafer designed prototype carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide (Cesic) mount. Surface figure data was obtained with a test measurement system that featured an Instantaneous Phase Interferometer (IPI) by ADE Phase Shift. The test measurement system s minimum resolvable differential figure deformation and possible contributions from test chamber ambient to cryo window deformation are under investigation. The free standing results showed differential figure deformation of 10. 4 nm rms from 295 K to 27 K and 3. 9 nm rms after one cryo cycle. The surface figure of the UVDM degraded by lambda/ 70 rms HeNe once it was bonded to the prototype Cesic mount. The change was due to a small astigmatic aberration in the <b>rototype</b> Cesic mount {{due to lack of}} finish machining and not the bonding technique. This effect was seen in SLMST (TM) optical assembly results, which showed differential figure deformation of 46. 5 nm rms from 294 K to 27 K, 42. 9 nm rms from 294 K to 77 K, 28. 0 nm rms from 294 K to 193 K and 6. 2 nm rms after one cryo cycle...|$|E
40|$|Publisher横浜Student final reports Group 16 Japan {{currently}} {{has one of}} the highest pedestrian death rates in the world. While the number of traffic accident deaths of passengers in cars has decreased sharply over the years, the number of pedestrian deaths has remained relatively high, overtaking the number of passenger deaths in 2009 to be the top contributor to traffic accident deaths in Japan. In yet other statistical survey, it is revealed that the main cause of traffic accidents in Japan can be attributed to the lack of due consideration to safety on the part of drivers, whereas the fault of pedestrians as a cause of traffic accidents only takes up a small percentage. The above lend evidence that "pedestrian deaths" as a societal problem has not been adequately addressed and that the safety consideration of drivers needs to be looked into. Our design project thus hopes to come up with an appropriate recommendation, while meeting the requirements of our project sponsor, Suzuki Motor Corporation, which hopes to develop its own automobile software that can contribute to the realization of a safer mobility system for society. A myriad of tools were used in creating the final solution. Through VOX benchmarking, we found out that there was strong emphasis on using hardware innovation to reduce the number of traffic accidents while there was little competition in the field of automobile safety software. We also talked to the key stakeholders (drivers and pedestrians) and found that dimly-lit roads and road intersections were examples of what, to them, constituted as danger on the roads. Scenario Graph and Use Case taught us that software for drivers and that for pedestrians should have slightly differentiated functions. CVCA was especially helpful when devising our business model that relies on both advertising revenue and royalty fees. QFD showed us that the most important solution element was software (relative weight of 20 %). FMEA taught us that to just rely on users as the only source of information of dangerous locations may pose a high risk to the usefulness of the system,whereas <b>rototyping</b> gave us a means of visualizing the "final" form of our product. Through financial evaluation, we calculated that the NPV at a rate of return of 15 % is $ 8489000. We thus recommend a car navigation software that makes use of a unified safety map for both drivers and pedestrians in order to realize a safer mobility system for society. Lack of funding is a probable risk factor that can hinder the progress of our project and should it occur, we would have to launch our product on an even smaller scale in the early stages to mitigate the risk...|$|R

40|$|Harold Schellenger was Director of the News Bureau, {{and later}} Director of Public Relations, at Ohio State University from 1933 to 1947. He {{graduated}} from the School of Journalism in 1924, and for eight years edited a newspaper in Jackson, Ohio. He succeeded as Director James E. Pollard who had been chosen to be Director of the School of Journalism. 	 Originally the News Bureau, which was started before the 1920 ’s, was intended to publicize the Athletic Department, especially the football program. It reported directly to the President. For some years the Director of the News Bureau {{was not allowed to}} attend the meetings of the Board of Trustees. In time, however, the News Bureau gained much greater access to university meetings and personnel. At one memorable meeting of the Faculty Council, Schellenger presented a forthright assessment of the proper role of the News Bureau, i. e. that it could not spin the news to make the university look any better than it was. All the Bureau could do was report what the faculty did, for good or for bad. Despite some discomfiture of President Bevis, the report was circulated to the entire faculty, and indeed all over the country. 	 Various means were used to get out the story of Ohio State to the community at large. Regular news releases were issued, and Schellenger responded to calls from the news media. He also wrote and read each week a fifteen-minute campus news summary on WOSU, the university radio station. Gradually changes were made in the New Bureau. The staff grew from the Director and one secretary in 1933 to seven full-time and seven part-time people, all students, by 1947. The name was changed from News Bureau to the Bureau of Public Relations. The hours were expanded from 8 : 00 a. m. until 10 : 00 p. m. every night, plus Sunday afternoon. Another innovation was the creation of the Visitor Information Center. In {{the early days of the}} News Bureau newspapers had no regular reporters on campus, and they relied on Schellenger and his staff for information. The Bureau sent out a packet of stories each weekend to all the non-daily newspapers in the state. Among the topics included in the packets would be faculty research and new appointments. Usually the dailies could get what they needed from the wire services. Internal communications between members of the faculty were sporadic, and Schellenger started the Faculty Review that included summaries of Board of Trustees and Faculty Council meetings, and a listing of speeches or publications of all faculty, including instructors. There was also a separate publication in the 1940 ’s containing news for parents of students. Schellenger came to Ohio State in 1932 in the depths of the Depression. His salary was low, and raises were infrequent. World War II brought many changes to the campus. There were virtually no male regular students. Women were housed in the men’s fraternity houses, and the dormitories turned over to the Army’s specialized trainees; at one time there were 3, 500 on campus. Schellenger had one of the first automatic typewriters in the city, the <b>rototype,</b> and using this new machine sent a letter to the parents of every one of the 3, 500 specialized trainees. He had fond memories of Bill North, then the single police officer for Ohio State. He recalled less fondly Charles Kettering who gave substantial money to Ohio State to create a Homeopathic Medical College, and then retracted his gift when the regular medical faculty objected. 	Schellenger was the first President of the American College Public Relations Association, formerly known as the American College Publicity Association. He laments the trend since his own day to choose “fancy titles,” such as the Case Council for Support and Advancement of Education that conceal the fact that it is really public relations they’re concerned with. At Ohio State the Bureau of Public Relations has become the Office of Public Affairs. In 1947 Schellenger left Ohio State to work for a local advertising agency. Then, in 1951, he became for fifteen years Executive Director of the Ohio Foundation of Independent Colleges, and finally served two years as Administrative Assistant to Congressman Chalmers P. Wylie. He also handled publicity for some years for the annual Ohio State Fair.
