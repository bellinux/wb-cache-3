40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the sustainability of}} the unprecedentedly high aggregate GDP growth witnessed in India from 2003 - 04 till the eruption of the global crisis. It argues that the post-liberalization highly non-inclusive and corporate-sector led growth trajectory in India suffers from a fundamental contradiction which renders it inherently unstable. This contradiction is between increasing dependence <b>of</b> growth on <b>investment</b> demand {{and the absence of}} a commensurate expansion of either output or employment in organized manufacturing, the main sector where rapid growth of capital formation tends to be relatively concentrated. This had already generated a collapse <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and a manufacturing centered growth slowdown {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. The paper shows that high growth in India after 2003 - 04 did not eliminate this contradiction. Instead, the transmission effects generated by an exceptionally expansionary phase of the global economy enabled a sharp <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> which generated this growth, but in the process the contradiction started surfacing again. With the global crisis this phase came to an end, and in the post-crisis situation <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> that growth trajectory appears unlikely. In such circumstances even modest gains on the development front from via the positive effects of high growth on public revenues cannot be guaranteed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main problem}} that necessitates the <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in joint stock {{companies}} is unsatisfactory condition {{of fixed assets}} of enterprises. The low rate of production capacity renewal {{in recent years has}} even become slower; the equipment wear rate is 4 – 5 times lower than in the industrialized countries. In addition to these points, one should consider a significant qualitative lag of domestic technologies in comparison with the world analogues. The purpose of this research is the generalization and improvement of the existing approaches to the formation of motivations system of domestic corporations production investing and the development <b>of</b> corporation <b>investment</b> strategy. The subject of the work is the system of motivations of production investing, formation of which will be provided by the unique complex influence on the <b>investment</b> activity <b>of</b> domestic corporations. All the directions and forms <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity <b>of</b> corporations are carried out due to the investment resources. Forming the investment resources strategy is the important component of financial strategy of a corporation. Among the domestic sources <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> financing, the main element is profit, or rather the part that remains at the disposal of the corporation after payment and settlement with shareholders. Another important source is depreciation. Their size depends on the amount of assets of the corporation and depreciation reserved. Under the conditions of the developed financial market the important source of the external financing is emission of own securities (stocks and bonds). Another motivational factor of bringing in of long-term fund raising can be the use of leasing. Leasing, as a source <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> resources has certain advantages in comparison with other forms of investing. The important sources of capital for productive investment are the foreign investments. In author's opinion, it is possible to increase the <b>investment</b> attractiveness <b>of</b> Ukrainian joint stock companies, by improving the legal, economic and information mechanism <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activities. Consequently, characterizing the system of motivations of the production investing of stock associations {{it should be noted that}} the considerable part of capital is generated by an enterprise itself due to the depreciation reserves, others act due to a capital issue under the concrete investment programs and projects, bringing in the investment funds, resources insurance companies, commercial banks, non-standard methods <b>of</b> financing <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the single monetary policy and introduction of the euro, it is pertinent to investigate the link between financial stability and integration. Is there a complementarity between the two or are financial stability and integration a contradiction in terms? In other words, isn’t a search for a highly integrated financial system that would strengthen stability a bit like a search for the Holy Grail? Investment has been the cementing element of EU integration, institutions and policies – in brief, in creating more Europe. More concretely, investment in people, in knowledge and in physical assets, to ensure that Europe preserves its role and position in the world. The current crisis transcends national, even continental borders. Europe is reminded of its severity on a daily basis. Record unemployment is one of the consequences; shrinking public budgets and financial austerity another. In the run-up to the current recession investment grew by 5 - 6 % a years. Exporters and home buyers drove this expansion, which ended in 2008. Since then, the lack <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> has been a main source of demand weakness in the European Union. A collapse <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity <b>of</b> this magnitude has inevitable repercussions for economic expansion in the longer term. If productive capital stocks do not grow – indeed, if they are not even maintained - EU growth potential will inevitably shrink. A <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> activity is therefore crucial to the long-term growth prospects of Europe. One precondition for such an investment revival is access to reasonably priced funding for long-term projects. The process of fiscal consolidation at national and European level has already placed a severe restriction on public budgets – {{and will continue to do}} so in the medium term. This pressure means that the EU has to find ways to achieve more with less. In particular, at European level, one needs to ensure that a limited EU budget is used to maximum effect. The newly established EU project bond initiative is seen as a means to go ahead in the current circumstances. As it does not impose an additional burden on domestic budgets, sovereign debt or contingent liabilities. The review looks into the type <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> that can be catered by the project bond initiative and the sectors selected for magnifying the growth potential. ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{ecological}} {{situation and}} negative influence of ecological factors on {{public health in}} the Russian Federation are analysed in this article. Russia {{is one of the}} most polluted countries in the world, and the environmental problem is very important here. In spite of some decrease in pollution during the crisis period, nature does not have time to neutralize pollution accumulated before, and as a result, there is an increase in the pollution concentration. In 66 cities (40 million people) with excess 10 times and more than permitted maximum concentration level, the morbidity is above the average Russian level of 1. 6 — 2 times. The forecast of emission according to the various scenarios of Russian development has been done: a pessimistic scenario with a slowdown in economic growth and an optimistic scenario with the acceleration of economic growth. The optimistic scenario is realized under the hypothesis about the oil prices increase and the real rouble exchange rate strengthening at the end <b>of</b> 2015, the <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> processes, the successful policy of import substitution, and the competent using of the instruments of monetary and fiscal policy. The pessimistic scenario is implemented under the assumption of negative economic tendency prolongation of 2014. For the forecast analysis, the dynamic inter-industry model with the ecological block was used. At the optimistic scenario implementation, the additional burden on the natural environment should be expected. The most important result of the research is the estimation of the rates of ecological payments which are necessary for performing the functions stimulating the environmental protection activity. The article presents the findings about the need to improve the institutional ecological structures, the scientific basis of pollution taxes, the introductions of the stimulating tools of the economic nature protection mechanism. The results presented in the article may be used both in elaborating the eco-economic forecasts of the development of Russia and as the information and analytical recommendations in developing the directions of the state and regional nature protection policy...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis, some SEACEN {{countries have}} been unable to achieve pre-crisis levels <b>of</b> <b>investments.</b> Many reasons were cited by the literature and these include a shift in investors¡¯ perceptions, weaker exchange rates which make prices <b>of</b> imported <b>investment</b> goods more expensive, overinvestment in various sectors of the economy, unsettled political and security conditions, weak financial systems and governance systems, implicit state guarantees and the ¡®hollowing out¡¯ effect where excessive outward foreign investment has reduced domestic investment. This paper notes that the region has successfully implemented various policies related to investment such as liberalisation <b>of</b> the <b>investment</b> sectors, the promotion of the competitive sector, direct involvement of the government and privatisation to encourage investment. The study also highlights the importance of research and the infusion of capital and technology in promoting new investment. From a macro perspective, the study suggests that central banks can also {{play an important role in}} promoting investment. Marco economic factors such as real interest rates, the availability of domestic credit, exchange rate volatility are important determinants <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> This implies that given the right economic fundamentals, to stimulate investment, central banks should ceteris paribus, adopt an expansionary monetary stance while heeding the inflation rate. The study also suggests the importance of the banking sector in the promotion <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> As the financial sectors of the SEACEN countries are already liberalised, pro-active financial supervision can play an important role in ensuring financial stability in order to facilitate improved access to credit. It is also noted that the current US mortgage sub-prime crisis will raise new challenges to the <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> private <b>investment</b> in the SEACEN countries. While the direct effect of the subprime crisis is through the external sector, its indirect effect through distressed and non-performing loans may result in selfreinforcement between the financial markets and the real economy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} nexus between {{investment}} and oil price volatility {{in the context}} of a developing industrialised economy, Thailand. In the post Asian Crisis era, Thailand has been on a steady phase of recovery with industrial expansion as well as <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and output growth. A significant portion of such growth is attributable to investment growth in metal products, machineries and other transportable goods which are the energy dependent industries. Implicit in these phenomena is the need to further scrutinise the impact of the exogenous shock emanating from uncertainty in oil market on the scale <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in various sectors of the Thai economy. Using a threshold-based components generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (CGARCH) model, the oil price volatility is decomposed into permanent and transitory volatilities. The oil price volatility components are then analysed in a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework, along with investment and other key macroeconomic variables. Dynamic impulse response functions obtained from the SVAR model reveal significant dampening effects of the conditional and transitory oil price volatility shocks on Thailand’s aggregate and sectoral level investments. The impulse responses clearly indicate that as the temporary volatility in oil price rises, total investment decreases significantly. At sectoral level, the responses <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in food and textiles products suggest a significant dampening effect on investments due to shocks in both the conditional and transitory volatilities of oil prices. In contrast, a shock in the permanent volatility leads to only a small decline in investment in this sector, and for only about a quarter. Similar effects were also observed for other transportable goods, consisting primarily of wood products, furniture, and cork, straw and plaiting materials. The investment in the business services sector, which comprises investment in real estate services, does not exhibit any significant effects of shocks in the conditional, permanent and transitory volatilities of oil prices. The findings of this study have important implications for policy. Firstly, since the Thai economy is relatively energy intensive, any dynamic shock emanating from energy market will be detrimental to investment and economic growth. Secondly, the significant and stronger adverse effects of the temporary oil volatility point to the absence of insurance markets for guarding against any volatility risks, or the lack of managerial expertise for identifying and accommodating the negative impacts of a heightened transitory or permanent oil price volatility. Thirdly, firms operating in energy-dependent industries ought to remain vigilant especially in regards to weather adverse impacts of any transitory volatility of oil prices...|$|R
