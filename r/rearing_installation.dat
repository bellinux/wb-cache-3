40|$|Due to stricter {{emissions}} legislations {{and increasing}} fuel prices vehicle efficiency must be improved. A trend {{that has been}} seen during recent years is increased engine power for many vehicle segments. Different exhaust gas after-treatment systems have also been introduced {{to be able to}} meet the emission demands. Though, these implementations do not only affect the engine power and the emission levels, they also tend to increase the cooling demand. Therefore, the cooling performance for vehicles has to be increased. At the same time the cooling installation {{in the front of the}} vehicle accounts for a substantial part of the total aerodynamic resistance of the vehicle. To reduce the fuel consumption the grill in the front could be covered and the cooling module could be relocated elsewhere. This would decrease the aerodynamic resistance; but the fan would most likely be needed to operate more frequent to achieve the same cooling performance. This thesis presents a comparative study of front-mounted and rear-mounted cooling package installations, using four different configurations for the <b>rear</b> <b>installation.</b> For each case the cooling performance and aerodynamic resistance were compared for different operating conditions at both lower and higher vehicle speeds and engine loads. The results show that the cooling performance was favourable, at the same time the total power demand was lowered for two of the rear-mounted cooling package installations. The grill design and the inlet duct shape were shown to be of great importance to avoid separation, and to assist air entering the inlet duct at higher vehicle speeds. The power required due to aerodynamics and cooling performance was lowered by 1. 9 percent for a rear-mounted compared to the front-mounted one seen on the vehicles today. For equivalent cases, at 90 km/h, the rear-mounted installations only received approximately 50 percent of the mass airflow compared to the front-mounted one, when the fan was not operating. In critical cooling situations the cooling performance was higher for three of the <b>rear</b> <b>installations,</b> compared to the front-mounted installation. The main reason for this result was due to the high fan operating speed and the lower system restriction. Hence, a rear-mounted installation can result in higher cooling performance and lower power demand due to aerodynamics and fan operation. Therefore, such an installation has potential for fuel savings...|$|R

40|$|A {{deep market}} {{analysis}} on the regional and commuter aircraft has revealed that nowadays the volatility of oil price (more and more prone to international political crises), the huge growth of air transport traffic and the increasing attention to the aircraft environmental footprint considerably lead the interest of specialists towards new configurations of regional and commuter transport aircraft. Also the major airlines in this segment have been addressing the replacement for many hundreds of heritage airplanes in the 20 - 150 seats categories currently in service around the world. Turboprop configuration could be the ideal answer to this request. An innovative turboprop configuration with a <b>rear</b> propeller <b>installation</b> {{can lead to a}} cleaner wing with possibilities to achieve laminar flow extension.

The IRON project will also address the conventional (wing mounted propeller) turboprop configuration. In this case one of the key element is the reduction of the perceived annoyance due to propeller noise emissions. A low-noise propeller system will be designed after exploring emerging technologies.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is a continuing}} analysis of cooling performance and aerodynamic properties of a rear mounted cooling module on a semi generic commercial vehicle, which {{was carried out by}} Larsson, LÃ¶fdahl and Wiklund [1]. In the previous study two designs of the cooling package installation were positioned behind the rear wheelhouse and the results were compared to a front mounted cooling module. The investigation was mainly focused on a critical cooling situation occurring at lower vehicle speeds for a distribution vehicle. The conclusion from the study was that the cooling performance for one of the <b>rear</b> mounted <b>installation</b> was favorable compared to the front mounted cooling package. This was mainly due to the low vehicle speed, the high fan speed and to fewer obstacles around the cooling module resulting in a lower system restriction within the installation. The main purpose with the present investigation was to determine the power needed to overcome the aerodynamic drag together with the power needed by the fan to obtain a specific cooling performance at a higher vehicle speed. One front and three rear mounted cooling package installations with a vehicle operating at 90 km/h were included in the analysis. The study the vehicle geometry was modified to be able to implement the changes for the <b>rear</b> cooling module <b>installations.</b> The design of the air inlet, air outlet and the duct in front of and after the cooling package were changed for the rear mounted cooling package installation to improve the airflow and as a result the cooling performance. The investigation was performed by the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics. It was found that the total power required due to aerodynamic drag and fan operation to obtain a specific cooling performance was reduced for two of the rear mounted compared to the front mounted cooling module. Even though the fan for these installations required more power, the total power needed by the vehicle was decreased due to a lower aerodynamic resistance. The total power demand was decreased by 1. 9 kW for one of the <b>rear</b> mounted <b>installations</b> compared to the front mounted cooling package. Furthermore it was established that the design of the air inlet for a rear mounted cooling package was important to obtain a low total power demand, a high mass flow of air through the cooling module and to obtain an uniform flow over the heat exchangers. For a critical driving situation due to cooling performance, occurring at lower vehicle speeds, the rear mounted cooling packages were also favorable due to cooling performance compared to the front mounted cooling module installation. This was mainly due to the lower system resistance and higher static fan efficiency received for these installations. To increase the cooling performance and decrease the required power even more the air inlet, the fan choice and the duct geometry can be further developed...|$|R

For each case the cooling performance, fan demand and aerodynamic resistance were compared for different operating conditions at both lower and higher vehicle speeds and engine loads. The study was based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), where the simulations were performed in zero and five-degree yaw conditions, with and without a trailer added behind the truck. It was seen that a relocation of the cooling module has a potential for fuel savings at higher vehicle speeds, due to the reduction in power to overcome the aerodynamic resistance. At lower vehicle speeds the cooling performance was increased since a lower system restriction was observed for the rear-mounted configurations. Results also showed that both the cooling performance and the aerodynamic drag was affected by the yawed air condition and when adding a trailer behind the truck. The mass airflow was increased when the air was directed towards the air intake, while it was decreased when the air intake was positioned at the leeward side of the vehicle. When the trailer was added behind the vehicle less air entered the cooling module at a higher vehicle speed. But for the critical cooling situation the trailer did not affect the amount of air entering the cooling module...|$|R

It was inspected on 25 September, and the USAAF was not impressed. The inspectors believed that the radar operator needed to be moved forward, closer to the pilot, with both crewmen under a single canopy, the magnesium components of the wing replaced by aluminum, and the fuel stowage directly above the engines moved. Other changes {{had to be made}} as wind tunnel and other aerodynamic tests were conducted. The swept wings proved to be less satisfactory at low speeds, and a thin straight wing was selected instead. Delivery of the first prototype was scheduled for November 1947, 14 months after the inspection. The position of the horizontal stabilizer proved to be unsatisfactory, as it was affected by the engine exhaust, and it would be [...] "blanked-out" [...] by airflow from the wing at high angles of attack. It was moved halfway up the tail, but its position flush with {{the leading edge of the}} vertical stabilizer proved to cause extra drag through turbulence and reduced the effectiveness of the elevators and rudder. Moving the horizontal stabilizer forward solved the problem. Another major change occurred when USAAF revised its specification to delete the <b>rear</b> gun <b>installation</b> on 8 October. Another inspection of the mock-up was held on 17 December, and the inspectors only suggested minor changes, even though the fuselage fuel tanks were still above the engines. Northrop's efforts to protect the fuel tanks were considered sufficient, as the only alternative was to redesign the entire aircraft.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} this paper present the {{morphological}} analysis of nine different types of tractor assemblies used in forestry practice in timber forwarding from thinning operations of lowland forests. Among these tractor assemblies 4 types are older, equipped mechanical cranes. The remaining 5 tractor assemblies, manufactured more recently, are equipped with hydraulic cranes, {{and two of them}} are additionally equipped with double-drum winches. According to the research results, older tractor assemblies have very favourable morphological characteristics, according to which they are classified as ecologically acceptable vehicles for the timber forwarding from thinning operations in lowland forests. However, work technology requires from the vehicle to reach each timber assortment processed in the stand, which also means higher possibility of damage to forest soil of poor bearing strength in lowland areas. Technical design of more recent types of tractor assemblies ensures environmental suitability in timber forwarding from thinning operations. The installation of an articulated joint on the semi-trailer shaft ensures small turning diameter and hence lower risk of causing damage to standing trees. The adequate breadth of tractor assemblies is achieved by use of narrower tyres on <b>rear</b> tractor wheels. <b>Installation</b> of the forest winch on the tractor assembly causes lower soil tracking and lower damage to soil and standing trees. They also exert imaginary pressure on the soil between 2 kPa and 4 kPa and hence they are more adequate for the work on forest soils of poor bearing strength than forwarders, as the lowest imaginary pressure exerted by forwarders is around 4 kPa...|$|R

40|$|The master thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} for Volvo 3 P {{on the site}} of Lyon in France, and in the premises of the design office front and <b>rear</b> axle <b>installation</b> of the product development department. This unit {{is in charge of the}} conception, the design and the production of the chassis and of the power steering system of all the trucks of the Volvo AB group. The sizing of the circuits is currently grounded on the experience of the member of the design office. Each new steering circuit has to follow a serial of test in different condition of utilization in order to be validated by Volvo and its suppliers. To secure the design process, the introduction of a simulation method in the design process of steering circuits has been wished. The simulation tool is intended to need input data simple enough so that it can be used in the early development stage of a design process. It has been decided to simulate static tests, when the engine runs at constant speed without air circulation. The tool has to be able to predict the oil temperature with an error of 10 %. To validate the tool, the results need to be correlated on different circuit architectures. Finally the tool needs to be confronted to reality by comparing the prediction with measurement lead on a prototype vehicle. The software Amesim has been chosen to develop the simulation tool. In fact a pre study of the problem has shown that different scientific domains have to be taken in account to model the steering oil temperature evolution. In particular the heat transfers and the fluid mechanic have to be considered. Based on the bond graph theory, Amesim is a convenient software to model complex physical phenomena. To model correctly a steering circuit, the key components have to be identified and characterized in static functioning. The pump, the oil tank, the pipes and the steering gear are the principle components of interest. Their pressure losses and heat transfers have been thoroughly defined in static condition so as to obtain pertinent results. The Simulations have been realized on two completely different steering circuits, and the results obtain are encouraging. Four test cases have been studied on a Premium Lancer LC 8 x 4 MD 11 with results differences inferior to 5 % with tests. Two test cases have also been studied on a Premium 4 x 2 MD 11 and have given results with errors inferior to 7 % compared to reality. Nevertheless it has been impossible to confront the models with the reality due to delaying of testing because of the international financial crisis. Then the steering gear hydraulic path has been identified as an influencing parameter on the oil temperature and has been approximated. A close work with the suppliers must lead in the future to a better knowledge of that component. Finally the influence of the surrounding temperature has also been highlighted. The next step is to consider the fan strategy in the modelling of steering circuit so as to enhance the accuracy of the model. Finally it is necessary to confront the simulation to the reality in order to validate the modelling method...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the cooling performance of two cooling package positions for distribution vehicles by using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The first cooling package was positioned in the front of the vehicle, behind the grill and the second position was at the rear of the vehicle. Each case was evaluated by its cooling performance for a critical driving situation and its aerodynamic drag at 90 km/h, where the largest challenge of an alternative position is the cooling air availability. The geometry used was a semi-generic commercial vehicle, based on a medium size distribution truck with a heat rejection value set to a fixed typical level at maximum power for a 13 litre Euro 6 diesel engine. The heat exchangers included in the study were the air conditioning condenser, the charge air cooler and the radiator. It was found that the main problem with the <b>rear</b> mounted cooling <b>installation</b> was the combination of the fan and the geometry after the fan. The combination of these parameters for the rear mounted cooling module resulted in a high system restriction and low cooling performance values. To obtain the same cooling performance as the front mounted installation the fan had to rotate 23 % faster, corresponding to 86 % more power for the fan, for a maximum power driving situation. For the rearward installation it was seen that the drag was reduced and no recirculation was present at low velocities as it was for the frontal positioned cooling module. Thereafter the duct after the fan for the rear mounted position was removed and the cooling performance became better than the front positioned cooling module. The conclusions made from the study were that the rearward positioned cooling module was an advantage at lower vehicle velocities, at higher speeds the air inlet has to be redesigned to obtain a more uniform airflow over the heat exchangers as well as obtaining higher cooling performance, and that the combination of the fan and its environment must be carefully matched. Though, this study was based on distribution vehicles mainly operating at lower velocities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNatural Laminar Flow (NLF) is, in aerodynamics, {{one of the}} key {{technologies}} that could lead to the most important improvement in aircraft performance at cruise, with significant reduction of fuel consumption and consequently of environmental pollutants emission. Within the GRA ITD project this technology has been applied and assessed to Regional Aircraft concepts of 130 passengers for a range of 3, 000 nm, cruise Mach 0. 74 and Flight level 35, 000 ft, with <b>rear</b> fuselage engine <b>installation.</b> Aircraft preliminary design studies have delivered challenging top-level performance requirements, at cruise and low speed, general geometrical characteristics and weight assessment. In order to meet such requirements the wing design has been achieved in three steps: aerodynamic design at cruise trying to maximise the benefit of NLF technology, aeroelastic and structural design by multi-disciplinary optimisation (MDO), aerodynamic and kinematic design of high lift devices (HLD). The aerodynamic wing design was performed with the objective of an extended laminar flow at cruise, with constraints on buffet margins and maximum lift in low speed conditions. This design was done with high fidelity CFD methods. Different design loops were performed. Despite the limitations due to low speed constraints, it was possible to obtain laminar flow extent over 60 % chord and lift-to-drag ratio around 25 for the wing-fuselage configuration at cruise design point. Surface roughness, being a critical issue for laminar flows, was investigated and manufacturing requirements were defined. A further step in the design was the development of wing aeroelastic model. It was done by an MDO process to reduce wing bending moment design loads through tailored torsional stiffness, so to minimise wing box structural weight, by taking into account aerodynamics, static/dynamic loads and aeroelasticity. The next step was the numerical aerodynamic design and the definition of preliminary kinematic systems of several HLDs, matching the maximum lift requirement at landing. A slotted flap concept combined with a Krueger slat was selected after a down-selection process, relying on the results of 3 D CFD/CAA analyses, 2 D WT tests results and by also considering structural impact, complexity issues, maturity level, etc. The aerodynamic and aeroelastic wing designs will be validated through transonic WT tests on a (1 : 3) scale half-wing innovative flexible model reproducing the wing structural static deformation, to assess laminar flow extent at cruise and load control & alleviation devices performances in high-speed off-design conditions under a realistic high-Reynolds experimental environment...|$|R
