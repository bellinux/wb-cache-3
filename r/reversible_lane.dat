25|$|The two truss bridges {{had become}} {{functionally}} obsolete by 1979. Extensive metal deterioration {{caused by the}} lack of maintenance shortly after Grace Bridge's tolls were removed limited the capacity of the older Grace bridge to ten ton vehicles (later five tons), and the <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> on the Pearman was eliminated (it had been able to switch to three lanes northbound for rush hour traffic), making that lane southbound permanently, diverting all heavy trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles to that lane on the Pearman bridge. Neither of the bridges had emergency lanes, and the Pearman bridge had no median between the northbound and southbound lanes because of its <b>reversible</b> <b>lane,</b> and it was not until 2002 when flexible barriers were added to the Pearman bridge to prevent head-on collisions.|$|E
25|$|The Tasman Bridge was {{eventually}} repaired, which took {{over two years}} and cost an additional $44 million. Many additional safety features, such as navigation aids, were added, and the opportunity was taken to expand the capacity to five lanes. The fifth lane is a central <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> that follows am and pm peak hour crossing times.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA flow {{direction}} changing method of <b>reversible</b> <b>lanes</b> on urban arterial roadways is presented based on signal timing, coil detectors and overhead changeable lane-use signals, {{hoping that the}} safety of lane changing maneuvers on <b>reversible</b> <b>lanes</b> will be improved and the transition of periodic {{flow direction}} change will be smoother. First, a new layout of signalized intersection approaches along <b>reversible</b> <b>lanes</b> is proposed. That is, lane function of signalized intersection approach doesnâ€™t change with the direction of <b>reversible</b> <b>lanes.</b> Then, direction changing method of <b>reversible</b> <b>lanes</b> on urban arterial roadways from off-peak periods to peak periods is provided. The method can change direction of <b>reversible</b> <b>lanes</b> in certain signal cycles...|$|R

25|$|In Phoenix on 7th Avenue between McDowell Road and Northern Avenue, and 7th Street between McDowell Road and Cave Creek Road/Dunlap Avenue. On both roads, {{the lane}} {{configuration}} is 2 southbound and 3 northbound, {{with the center}} lane open for southbound traffic between 6-9am and open to northbound traffic between 3-6pm. Left turns are prohibited from the <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> at most arterial and collector street intersections during these hours but still allowed at driveways and non-signaled street intersections.|$|E
25|$|The Alfords Point Bridge in the {{south-western}} {{suburbs of}} Sydney, New South Wales. Three lanes total, with the centre lane reversible using manual placement of plastic bollards. Originally this bridge was built with two lanes, and {{was to be}} part of twin spans, but only the foundations and excavations for approach works were built for the Eastern span, and the bridge was opened with one lane used in each direction. New approach works commenced in January 2007 for the second span, at a cost of 45 million AUD, eliminating the need for a <b>reversible</b> <b>lane.</b> However, a 300-metre reversible centre lane will still remain on Alfords Point Road over Henry Lawson Drive, approximately 500 meters north of this proposed bridge.|$|E
500|$|Maryland Route 177 (MD 177) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Mountain Road, the highway runs [...] from MD 2 in Pasadena east to Gibson Island. MD 177 serves as an {{arterial}} highway through Pasadena, Jacobsville, and the Lake Shore area of northeastern Anne Arundel County. The highway is paralleled by MD 100 through Pasadena and Jacobsville. MD 177 originally began near what is now its western intersection with MD 648, which was originally part of MD 2. A short section of the highway was built in Pasadena in the early 1910s. MD 177 was extended east through Jacobsville in the early 1920s and to Gibson Island in the late 1920s. The highway was extended west in the late 1930s after MD 2 was relocated to its present four-lane divided highway. A freeway section of MD 177 was constructed between MD 3 in Glen Burnie and MD 2 in the mid-1960s; the freeway was renumbered MD 100 when that highway was completed from Pasadena to Jacobsville in the early 1970s. Congestion east of MD 100 led to {{the addition of a}} <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> (British English: tidal flow) is a lane {{in which}} traffic may travel in either direction, {{depending}} on certain conditions.

The middle two lanes were {{reversible}} (usually occurring during rush hour) with a varying lane always reserved {{as a center}} turn lane; hence 3 lanes were used for one direction of travel and 2 for the other[...] However, due to rising traffic volumes during peak hours that made traffic flows equivalent, the <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> system was removed in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|What Is now Route 347 was {{originally}} an unnumbered local road connecting to Route 47 at both ends. [...] Route 347 {{was created in}} the 1990s, replacing what {{was originally}} designated as Route 47 Alternate. A third lane is currently being proposed along Route 347 in order to handle additional traffic at peak times in the summer season. Either a <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> or extra shoulder space is being considered for the additional lane. Originally, the route was to be widened to four total lanes. Auxiliary lanes are also planned to be built at the southern terminus with Route 47 in Dennis Township and the Route 47/CR 670 junction in Maurice River Township in order to alleviate traffic. The Route 347 corridor, along with a part of Route 47, is being considered for a southern expansion of Route 55 to the Garden State Parkway in Cape May County.|$|E

[...] Eastbound buses travel in this <b>reversible</b> <b>lane</b> to {{the approach to}} the toll plaza at the Lincoln Tunnel, {{at the other end}} of which is the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The lane is fed by the New Jersey Turnpike at Exits16E and 17, and the western terminus of New Jersey Route3. Both the tunnel and terminal are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bi-state agency that also operates the [...] reversible, express bus lane along the left lane of three westbound lanes.

Over 100 bus carriers utilize the Exclusive Bus Lane. New Jersey Transit operates numerous interstate bus routes through the Lincoln Tunnel, as do numerous regional and long distance companies.|$|E
