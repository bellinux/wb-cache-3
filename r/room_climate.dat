Within this project the behaviour of the <b>room</b> <b>climate</b> in Linderhof Palace of the Bavarian King Ludwig II is investigated. The <b>room</b> <b>climate</b> plays a decisive role for the durable preservation of art. The real measured <b>room</b> <b>climate</b> is replicated by a building simulation model ased on the adjacent room climates. The results are compared with the measured data of the considered room. In rder to adjust the simulation model to the real <b>room</b> <b>climate</b> further investigations had to be made on building aterials and construction details. By using a passive tracer gas method the air change rates of specific rooms were easured.

In 10 subjects the palm was exposed to <b>room</b> <b>climate,</b> pure convective air currents, and pure radiation, which resulted in skin temperatures between 23 and 36 °C. Skin blood flow was estimated by laser Doppler flowmetry and local skin temperature was measured by a thermistor probe. Linear regression of SBF on skin temperature revealed significant correlations (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 05) within subjects and large variations in estimated slopes (s/m = 34 %) between subjects. Therefore, SBF was normalized to the <b>room</b> <b>climate</b> value in each separate experiment.

Of the litter originally present Degree of shading had no effect on litter decomposition. In the second experiment, cuttings of P. radiata were planted in troughs designed to expose weighed experi-mental litter to the influence of plant roots but not to the influence of plant tops. Shades were placed over the trough surfaces and the plants grown until mycelial wefts were visible in the litter.

Facility management (FM) aligns by aiming for {{higher levels of}} employee satisfaction and cost savings with introducing the shared features and facilities of activity based working (ABW). However, lack of proof of desired advantages of NewWoW is feeding a more reserved attitude towards NewWoW. Previous studies on employee satisfaction have used either single case studies or focus on one country. Also, many studies do not distinguish clearly between features and facilities. This study aims to identify differences between traditional and ABW environments in supporting workplace satisfaction. Questionnaires amongst 47, 913 office employees, mainly in Western European organizations, provided answers on 31 workplace features, fifteen facilities and employee satisfaction in the period 2010 - 2014. Respondents were split in two groups: ABW environments versus traditional work environments. Factor analyses identified ten components of the work environment that influence satisfaction. Independent samples t-tests were used to identify significant differences between both groups on their satisfaction with the work environment factors. Besides ‘ICT & equipment’, all factors showed significant differences in satisfaction between both groups. NewWoW employees are more satisfied with seclusion <b>rooms,</b> <b>climate,</b> décor, cleanliness and leisure.

The characteristic values of sun entry depend on several factors: intensity of sun irradiation, regional position of a house and the predominant climate, aeration, construction and heat storage behavior of the inside structural components. By means of thermal computer simulations, the influence of insulating panels consisting of polyurethane rigid foam and wood fibre panels in different constructions of high-peaked roofs on the <b>room</b> <b>climate</b> is investigated.

It causes energy waste because it takes too much time for control process stability, which is caused by the characteristics of controlled objects such as lagging, inertia and uncertainty.

While the thermal chamber which is used for simulating indoor temperature is on a long-time delay, large inertia (forced disturb is not allowed), and a new type of immune controller is designed by learning from the functions of self-adjustment, antigen memory and immunity response in biology immunity systems.
