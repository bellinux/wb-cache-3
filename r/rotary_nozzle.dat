If the pressure drop is high, at least , the material is often finely atomized, as in a diesel injector. At lower pressures, this type of nozzle is often used for tank cleaning, either as a fixed position compound spray nozzle or as a <b>rotary</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E
40|$|In organic farming, {{the control}} of {{broad-leaved}} dock (Rumex obtusi-folius) via hot-water treatment of the upper root region (hypocotyl) is a new alternative to the current standard control method involving manual digging-out of the roots. This comparative study looks at five different hot-water application techniques. The aim is to optimise the control method in terms of water and energy requirement to obtain a mortality rate of the treated plants of at least 80 %. The studied param-eters were the application, the amount of water, the water tempera-ture, the soil moisture content and the soil type. In total, 813 plants of varying size were treated (120 - 225 plants per treatment). The success of each treatment was rated 12 weeks after it was applied. Based on the results, the preferred treatment in terms of water and energy requirement was a commercially available <b>rotary</b> <b>nozzle.</b> With this noz-zle, for example, at 40 vol. - % soil moisture, 1. 6 L of water at a temper-ature of 90 °C was necessary for successful Rumex control. The <b>rotary</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{could be used as}} a non-contact system, and was therefore the most user-friendly of the application techniques examined...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMosquito Control in France {{represents}} about 45 000 ha (domestic and overseas area) and represents {{a public health}} concern operated by public authorities. Apart from aerial spraying, mosquito control is mainly achieved by agricultural sprayers (pickup – ATV or manually mounted mist blowers). As spraying applications may lead to variable performance, a specif-ic research program was designed in order to simultaneously assess spray deposition and biological efficacy. This study {{was a part of}} the overarching project (Life + Integrated Mosqui-to Control Management - LIFE 08 /ENV/F/ 000488). Four mist blowers were tested (Martignani B 748 – Tifone City 300 (ATR- TVI nozzles) – Swingtec Mobilstar – knapsack mist blower with AU 8000 <b>rotary</b> <b>nozzle)</b> as used for larvicide application. 22 tests were conducted including 3 repetitions for each equipment setup. BTi (Bacillius Thuringiensis Israelensis) was applied with an application volume of 8 to 12. 5 L/ha including 1 to 2. 5 L/ha of BTi Vectobac WG® or Aquabac XT® respectively. Each tank mix contained about 1 g/L of Brillant SulfloFlavine (BSF) dye tracer. Deposition values at different distances were calculated after tracer content measurement. 3 Petri dishes (f 8 cm) were used to collect ground deposits and placed around a jar including 25 mosquito larvae (Aedes Aegypty L.) for biological control. Alive lar-vae were counted immediately after application, 24 h and 48 h after application. Average deposition in 3 Petri dishes was compared with alive larvae at different distances and for each kind of equipment. 30 collecting plots placed on a 10 m x 10 m grid leading to 5 lines of 4 plots located at 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 m from the application path. A central line of collectors placed every 5 m was used from 55 to 90 m. Applications were realized downwind as advised by mosquito control operators at 8 km/h for vehicle mounted sprayers and 4 km/h for hand op-erated sprayer. Individual performance of each sprayer (i. e. efficient spray range) was com-pared to others and to manufacturer indications. A deeper analysis in terms of lethal dosage of Bti was also realized. For example, an application volume of 0. 5 L/ha (1 / 25 th of legal appli-cation volume) was found to generate acceptable mortality in some cases. Tentative of ex-planation regarding the global variability obtained after crossing physical deposits and biolog-ical efficacy was conducted. Among all parameters of influence, droplet size and atmospheric conditions were mainly identified. Indeed, best biological efficacy was obtained with lower application volume when small droplet size were produced (Tifone and <b>rotary</b> <b>nozzle)</b> ...|$|E

The decontamination solution (EnviroTru) was tagged with a known concentration of fluorescein permitting determination of both airborne decontaminant concentration and surface deposited decontaminant solution so that the effective deposition rates and surface coverage could be determined and correlated {{with the amount of}} material sprayed. Six aerosol dispersion tests were conducted. In each test, aluminum foil deposition coupons were set out throughout the passenger area and the aerosol was dispersed. The aerosol concentration was measured with filter samplers as well as with optical techniques Average aerosol deposition ranged from 3 to 15 grams of decontamination solution per square meter. Some disagreement was observed between various instruments utilizing different measurement principles. These results demonstrate a potentially effective method to disperse decontaminant to interior surfaces of a passenger aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The use of multi-orifice <b>rotary</b> <b>nozzles</b> greatly {{increases}} {{the speed and}} stripping effectiveness of high pressure water blasting systems, but also greatly {{increases the}} complexity of selecting and optimizing the operating parameters. The rotational speed of the nozzle must be coupled with its transverse velocity as it passes {{across the surface of}} the substrate being stripped. The radial and angular positions of each orifice must be included in the analysis of the nozzle configuration. Orifices at the outer edge of the nozzle head move at a faster rate than the orifices located near the center. The energy transmitted to the surface from the impact force of the water stream from an outer orifice is therefore spread over a larger area than energy from an inner orifice. Utilizing a larger diameter orifice in the outer radial positions increases the total energy transmitted from the outer orifice to compensate for the wider distribution of energy. The total flow rate from the combination of all orifices must be monitored and should be kept below the pump capacity while choosing orifice to insert in each position. The energy distribution from the orifice pattern is further complicated since the rotary path of all the orifices in the nozzle head pass through the center section. All orifices contribute to the stripping in the center of the path while only the outer most orifice contributes to the stripping at the edge of the nozzle. Additional orifices contribute to the stripping from the outer edge toward the center section. With all these parameters to configure and each parameter change affecting the others, a computer model was developed to track and coordinate these parameters. The computer simulation graphically indicates the cumulative affect from each parameter selected. The result from the proper choices in parameters is a well designed, highly efficient stripping system. A poorly chosen set of parameters will cause the nozzle to strip aggressively in some areas while leaving the coating untouched in adjacent sections. The high pressure water stripping system can be set to extremely aggressive conditions allowing stripping of hard to remove adhesives, paint systems, and even cladding and chromate conversion coatings. The energy force can also be reduced to strip coatings from thin aluminum substrates without causing any damage or deterioration to the substrate's surface. High pressure water stripping of aerospace components has thus proven to be an efficient and cost effective method for cleaning and removing coatings...|$|R
40|$|Water jetting as a {{means for}} {{removing}} anomalous materials from cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) piles was examined. The primary objective of this research was to establish empirical relationships between different jetting parameters and the removal of commonly occurring anomalous zone materials, including low-strength concrete, slurry mixed concrete, grout, and clay soil. Also investigated was the current standard-of-practice used by water jetting contractors within California. The testing specimens consisted of typical anomalous material with unconfined compressive strengths between 5 and 6, 000 psi. The experimental work consisted of water blasting submerged specimens using <b>rotary</b> jets, <b>nozzles,</b> and pumping equipment typically used in construction practice. Two testing protocols were developed. The first testing protocol called for the nozzle to be held stationary and the second allowed the nozzle to be cycled up and down across the anomaly. During testing, material removal rates were measured as a function of jet pressure and standoff distance. Water blasted specimens were cut apart after testing to confirm erosion measurements and to permit inspection of the water blasted surfaces. Based on the results, erosion rates and the effectiveness of water jetting are primarily influenced by unconfined compressive strength, when using standard test equipment and jetting pressures. Further, aggregate size and material type in the anomalous material does not appear to influence both total erosion and erosion rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of removing anomalous material from cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) piles by water jetting was examined. The primary objectives {{of this research}} were to examine how reinforcing steel influences water jetting and to evaluate how jetting pressures and standoff distance from the material surface affect water jetting of concrete type materials and PVC tubing. The experimental work consisted of water blasting submerged test specimens using <b>rotary</b> jets, <b>nozzles,</b> pumping equipment, and testing procedures currently used in construction practice. The concrete test specimens were comprised of ring- and cylinder-shaped samples, containing materials with compressive strengths of approximately 160 and 3, 600 psi. Typical PVC tubing used as inspection access holes for non-destructive testing in CIDH piles was utilized for tubing specimens. During testing, erosion depths were measured {{as a function of}} standoff distance and jetting pressure. Water jetted specimens containing reinforcing steel were cut apart after testing to permit inspection of the erosion cavity and eroded material surfaces behind the steel reinforcement. Reinforcing steel bars in CIDH piles do interfere with the jet path and will locally influence material erosion and water-jetting effectiveness. For a relatively weak material, water-jetting pressures between 10, 000 and 11, 000 psi produced erosion up to a radial distance of approximately 12 inches from the water jet. This erosion distance is less than half the typical maximum design spacing of PVC inspection access tubing installed in CIDH piles...|$|R
40|$|Spray drying is an {{essential}} unit operation for the manufacture of many products with specific powder properties. It is characterized by atomization of a solution or suspension into droplets, followed by subsequent drying of these droplets by evaporation of water or other solvents. Spray drying {{is used for the}} manufacture of many consumer and industrial products such as instant food products, laundry detergents, and pharmaceuticals. It is well suited to continuous production of dry solids in powder, granulate or agglomerate particle form from liquid feed-stocks. Spray drying starts with the atomization of a liquid feedstock into a spray of droplets. Next, the droplets are put in contact with hot air in a drying chamber. The sprays are produced by either <b>rotary</b> (wheel) or <b>nozzle</b> atomizers of different types. Evaporation of moisture from the droplets and formation of dry particles proceed under controlled temperature and airflow conditions. Powder is continuously discharged from the drying chamber and recovered from the exhaust gases using a cyclone or a bag filter. The whole process generally takes {{no more than a few}} seconds. Correct atomization and air distribution are the keys to the spray drying process, as both greatly influence the final powder structure and quality. Often, spray dryers are equipped with high-speed centrifugal atomizers ensuring sturdy and reliable operation. High-Pressure nozzle atomization is used especially for products where a rather coarse powder with narrow particle distribution and high bulk density is required. In the nozzle atomizer, fines are returned around one or more central nozzles in order to facilitate optimum agglomeration. Two-Fluid nozzle agglomeration is typically applied in small chambers allowing maximum flexibility in particle design and particle engineering for both super-fine and agglomerated particles...|$|R
40|$|Present {{studies show}} {{the ability of}} cold spray {{processing}} (prilling) to tailor the morphology of simple or double emulsion-based fluid systems as investigated for two types of air-assisted nozzle geometries under various processing conditions. The spray process parameters varied were: (i) gas to liquid flow rate ratio (GLR), (ii) spraying pressure and (iii) total mass flow rate. The results depicted that the emulsion flow inside the nozzle (liquid cap) {{as well as in}} the spray (outside nozzle) have a distinct impact on the resulting product structure due to the respective flow stresses acting. Increasing the flow stresses either lead to an additional dispersing impact or to separation and coalescence of the disperse fluid phase(s). Besides the process parameters, the material characteristics of the emulsion systems such as viscosity ratio λ of dispersed to continuous phase and the interfacial tension γ were varied in a wider range. The results demonstrated a systematic increase in structure stability for higher λ values within a range of 0. 32 – 30. As representative dimensionless numbers, (a) a critical liquid Weber number Wel,Drop,cr/λ and (b) a critical gas Weber number Weg,Drop,cr/λ were defined to describe the effect of liquid cap-tip and air-assisted spraying, respectively, with respect to preserving the disperse microstructure of the treated emulsions. Above these critical We numbers, the dispersed emulsion phase drops were broken up and drop mean sizes were exponentially decreased due to the flow stresses acting either in the liquid flow inside the nozzle or in the spray filament outside the nozzle. Dynamic viscosity η and dynamic moduli (G′, G″) of treated emulsions increased with decreasing droplet size of the dispersed phase(s) thus altering the spraying performance as well as the properties of the liquid product systems reconstituted from resulting spray-chilled powders. A third critical Weber number Weg,Nozzle,cr was derived for the spray droplet (tertiary droplet) generation by the spray filament breakup providing information of the smallest spray droplet that could be attained, while keeping the dispersed emulsion (secondary) droplets unchanged in size. The impact of Weg,Nozzle on the resulting spray (tertiary) mean drop size was systematically explored for internal (INMIX) and external (EXMIX) liquid-gas mixing air-assisted nozzles. High-speed videography and laser shadowgraphy were applied to visualize liquid spray filament stretching and breakup, as well as the velocity distribution in the sprays. Sufficiently gentle spray conditions for complete preservation of the disperse emulsion structure were only achieved in the Rayleigh filament breakup regime. Accordingly, a pressure controlled rotary “Rayleigh atomizer” was developed to study emulsion spraying by filament stretching and gently spray drop formation, preserving the emulsion (secondary) droplet structure. At the same time pressure adjustment enabled higher throughput rates compared to conventional <b>rotary</b> spraying <b>nozzles</b> for which only centrifugal forces determine filament stretch and throughput rate simultaneously. Filament length and drop size decreased with increasing rotational speed at a given total pressure (centrifugal pressure + static liquid pressure at the nozzle inlet) or flow rate, and the filament length and drop size increased with higher liquid pressures and related throughput rates at a given rotational speed. Chilling solidification of the spray drops was superimposed in selected cases. Prilling (spraying[*]+[*]chilling) was carried out for various emulsion systems in a prilling tower applying average air temperatures of ca. − 10 °C for higher melting fat-continuous emulsions down to − 50 °C for low melting oil- or water-continuous emulsions, in order to produce solid powder particles. The microstructure of the solid particles was analyzed in further detail by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). Concerning emulsion structure preservation in the sprayed products, the results clearly demonstrated that the disperse structure can differ significantly from the initial emulsion structure if critical flow stress conditions are exceeded. Respective process-structure functions were also quantified. For emulsion-based prilled powders, the applicability and adjustability as functional component carriers for controlled release applications is of big interest in industries such as food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics. For related functional component release experiments we designed an in vitro gastric/duodenal setup. With this, the release kinetics of functional components encapsulated/embedded in dispersed secondary or primary emulsion drop phase(s) were quantified under simulated gastric or duodenal digestion conditions. Accordingly, an iron compound (micronutrient) was encapsulated into the primary and/or secondary dispersed emulsion droplets of simple or double emulsions, and related solid emulsion powder particles were produced through prilling applying our selected air-assist atomizers. In a first testing step, the iron release kinetics for selected products were systematically investigated in the in-vitro gastric system at pH[*]≈[*] 2. 0, and quantified as a function of prill powder particle size, secondary emulsion drop size and prill powder storage time under ambient conditions...|$|R
