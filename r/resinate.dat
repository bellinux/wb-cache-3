Until the 19th century, verdigris was the most vibrant green pigment available and was frequently used in painting.

A simple dosing scheme with a once- or twice-daily {{administration of the}} antihypertensive agent is known to increase patient compliance. The present research endeavour was directed towards {{the development of a}} Extended release tablet formulation containing diltiazem hydrochloride loaded <b>resinates,</b> with goal of delivering the same dose of the drug through a tablet taken once rather than {{two or three times a}} day. The selection of resin was done on the basis of drug loading. Effect of Swelling time, stirring time, pH, and drug to resin ratio was employed to optimize <b>resinates.</b> The Optimized diltiazem hydrochloride <b>resinates</b> with wet granulation technique were utilized for the formulation of extended release tablet. Polymer such as Eudragit RS 100, Eudragit RL 100, Ethyl cellulose and PVP were utilized as granulating agent and optimized to obtain extended drug release. It was found that <b>resinates</b> based once daily extended release of diltiazem hydrochloride were successfully formulated using Eudragit RS 100 as granulating agent showing the best physical tablet properties, and the best drug release characteristics, releasing the drug for the period of 24 hrs.

40|$|A {{substantial}} number of new chemical entities and marketed drugs show poor solubility characteristics and amorphisation {{is one of the}} favorable approaches to enhance solubility characteristics of such poorly soluble drugs. Formulation efforts {{in the present study were}} devoted to investigate amorphisation of a model poorly soluble drug, atorvastatin calcium by molecular complexation with anion exchange resin, Duolite® AP 143 / 1093 and hence enhancement in its solubility characteristics. Drug <b>resinates</b> in 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 4 weight ratios were prepared by simple batch operation and subsequently studied for drug content, residual solvent content, molecular interactions, solid state characterisation and solubility characteristics. During initial characterisation, all the proportions of drug <b>resinates,</b> except 1 : 1 proportion showed partial amorphisation of the drug, whereas 1 : 1 proportion showed complete amorphisation of the drug. This proportion reported distinctly enhanced solubility characteristics over pure drug and other proportions. Such amorphisation and solubility enhancement could be attributed to the binding of individual drug molecules to the functional sites of the resin molecules, either partially or completely, resulting in reduction of crystal lattice energy, a main barrier to dissolution. Hydrophilic nature of ion exchange resin matrices also assisted in enhancing dissolution of the drug from the <b>resinates.</b> During accelerated stability study, there was an insignificant decrease in solubility characteristics of the drug and its amorphous form was also found to be stable in 1 : 1 proportion. Atorvastatin <b>resinates</b> formed in 1 : 1 weight ratio were in stoichiometric proportion and such drug <b>resinates</b> in stoichiometric proportion showed to have tremendous potential in conversion of crystalline form of drug substances to its amorphous form and subsequent stabilisation.

40|$|Rosin is {{a natural}} product from pine forests and it {{is used as a}} raw {{material}} in <b>resinate</b> syntheses. Resinates are polyvalent metal salts of rosin acids and especially Ca- and Ca/Mg- resinates find wide application in the printing ink industry. In this thesis, analytical methods were applied to increase general knowledge of <b>resinate</b> chemistry and the reaction kinetics was studied in order to model the non linear solution viscosity increase during <b>resinate</b> syntheses by the fusion method. Solution viscosity in toluene is an important quality factor for resinates to be used in printing inks. The concept of critical <b>resinate</b> concentration, c crit, was introduced to define an abrupt change in viscosity dependence on <b>resinate</b> concentration in the solution. The concept was then used to explain the non-inear solution viscosity increase during <b>resinate</b> syntheses. A semi empirical model with two estimated parameters was derived for the viscosity increase on the basis of apparent reaction kinetics. The model was used to control the viscosity and to predict the total reaction time of the <b>resinate</b> process. The kinetic data from the complex reaction media was obtained by acid value titration and by FTIR spectroscopic analyses using a conventional calibration method to measure the <b>resinate</b> concentration and the concentration of free rosin acids. A multivariate calibration method was successfully applied to make partial least square (PLS) models for monitoring acid value and solution viscosity in both mid-infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR) regions during the syntheses. The calibration models can be used for on line <b>resinate</b> process monitoring. In kinetic studies, two main reaction steps were observed during the syntheses. First a fast irreversible resination reaction occurs at 235 °C and then a slow thermal decarboxylation of rosin acids starts to take place at 265 °C. Rosin oil is formed during the decarboxylation reaction step causing significant mass loss as the rosin oil evaporates from the system while the viscosity increases to the target level. The mass balance of the syntheses was determined based on the <b>resinate</b> concentration increase during the decarboxylation reaction step. A mechanistic study of the decarboxylation reaction was based on the observation that <b>resinate</b> molecules are partly solvated by rosin acids during the syntheses. Different decarboxylation mechanisms were proposed for the free and solvating rosin acids. The deduced kinetic model supported the analytical data of the syntheses in a wide <b>resinate</b> concentration region, over a wide range of viscosity values and at different reaction temperatures. In addition, the application of the kinetic model to the modified <b>resinate</b> syntheses gave a good fit. A novel synthesis method with the addition of decarboxylated rosin (i. e. rosin oil) to the reaction mixture was introduced. The conversion of rosin acid to <b>resinate</b> was increased to the level necessary to obtain the target viscosity for the product at 235 °C. Due to a lower reaction temperature than in traditional fusion synthesis at 265 °C, thermal decarboxylation is avoided. As a consequence, the mass yield of the <b>resinate</b> syntheses can be increased from ca. 70 % to almost 100 % by recycling the added rosin oil...|$|E

The presence of a consistent amount of <b>resinates</b> in the sample {{from the pulpit}} (B 53) points to the formation of carboxylates due to the reaction of the abietane and pimarane acids from the resin from one or more unpigmented layer with the metal ions present in the adjacent pigmented paint layers, indicating the ability of the paint constituents to migrate through the different strata.|$|R

In this paper we present an optimization and the validation of a GC/MS method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of mixtures of terpenoid acids and aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids and metal carboxylates of terpenoid and aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids in the same paint microsample. This is based on a two-step analytical approach entailing the subsequent use of two silylating agents, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide for the analysis of free acids and metal carboxylates, and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexamethyldisilazane for the analysis of free acids. The application of this approach is possible because of the good stability at room temperature of the TMS derivatives of aliphatic and terpenoid species, characterized by high boiling points and relatively low vapour pressures.
