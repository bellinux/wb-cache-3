40|$|Background Previous {{studies found}} {{increased}} case fatality after myocardial infarction and more frequent sudden death in RA patients compared to non-RA subjects. The RA associated CV risk might {{be explained by}} the combined effects of chronic systemic inflammation and increased lifestyle associated cardiovascular risk factors, and modified by the use of medication such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Trends in case fatality rate in RA after the introduction of potent anti-inflammatory biologic therapies and treat-to-target treatment strategies aiming at remission are not known. This study was performed to examine the cardiovascular fatality rate in current low disease activity RA, and to evaluate trends in RA associated <b>CV</b> <b>case</b> fatality over time. Methods Prospective study to determine the incidence of fatal and nonfatal CV events in 480 RA patients included in the ACT-CVD cohort between February 2009 and December 2011. Patients with prior CV disease were excluded. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine CV event risk and contributing risk factors over time. The results of the cohort analysis were put into the context of {{a review of the literature}} to evaluate trends in RA associated CV fatality rate over time. Results The study included 480 RA patients, 72. 3 % female with median disease duration of 4. 2 years, 72. 1 % being in clinical remission (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints). During a mean follow up of 2. 9 years 29 patients (6 %) experienced a first CV event, 2 fatal and 27 non-fatal, corresponding to a 6. 9 % case fatality rate. Comparison with previous studies in cohorts with successive enrolment periods shows a trend towards a decrease in <b>CV</b> <b>case</b> fatality in RA from 52. 9 % in 1998 to 6. 9 % in our study.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} tools, terminologies and systems used by poisons centres’ (PCs) to record {{information}} about exposures to chemical consumer products, {{to compare the}} information collected when documenting enquiries, and to assess {{the extent to which}} PCs collect information that is useful for industry and risk management. This study was carried out as part of Subcomponent 3 of the research project ‘Description of the Nature of Accidental Misuse of Chemicals and Chemical Products (DeNaMiC). Methods: A questionnaire was sent to European PCs and other institutions. The questionnaire was structured in six parts: Contact data; General information (tasks, customers and workload in terms of poisons enquiries); Documentation system (Documentation and further processing); Product information (sources, updates, handling); Documented cases (kind of information); Toxicovigilance Activity. Results: 26 replies were received from PCs and hospitals that give poisons advice in 19 countries. The product/chemical information system and the <b>case</b> <b>documentation</b> depend on national regulations and number and type of enquiries. Self-created, electronic databases for case records and for product information are common in European PCs even when product databases are provided by a governmental agency. PCs collect the same basic data set about cases (patient data, amount and physical state of chemical, exposure route). The circumstances of poisoning (location, use/ storage by the consumer, efficiency of Risk Management Measures (RMMs)) are not documented routinely in all PCs. A number of PCs use the INTOX definition to classify the “circumstances of exposure”. Conclusion: To gather Europe-wide data about poisonings e. g. for root cause analysis, to check the efficiency of RMMs, PCs need support from industry to maintain their knowledge about products. The classification of products needs improvement and harmonisation. <b>Case</b> <b>documentation</b> would need to be expanded to include some exposure factors, using standardised terminology...|$|R

Our method can be applied straightforwardly to multi-atom systems for measuring the Wigner function of their collective spin state.
