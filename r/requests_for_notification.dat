5000|$|The second memo, titled Secure Communities, was {{addressed}} to ICE and the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. It announced the discontinuation of S-COMM {{and the creation of}} PEP as a replacement for it. The memo announced an immediate end to the I-247 detainers used as part of S-COMM and asked the ICE to come up with updated forms that would function as <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> rather than detention. The Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was asked to develop a plan to monitor the implementation of the program by state and local LEAs to guard against the violation of people's civil rights and civil liberties. Based on this memo, the ICE would come up with the new detainer forms (I-247N, I-247D, and I-247X).|$|E
5000|$|In a memo dated November 20, 2014, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson {{discontinued}} the Secure Communities program. Johnson states, [...] "The overarching goal of Secure Communities {{remains in}} my view a valid and important law enforcement objective, but a fresh start and a new program are necessary. ... Further, to address {{the increasing number of}} federal court decisions that hold that detainer-based detention by state and local law enforcement agencies violates the Fourth Amendment, I am directing ICE to replace requests for detention (i.e., requests that an agency hold an individual beyond the point at which they would otherwise be released) with <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> (i.e. ,requests that state or local law enforcement notify ICE of a pending release during the time that person is otherwise in custody under state or local authority)." [...] Secure Communities was replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This report {{describes}} NotX—service oriented system, {{that applies}} ideas of CEP and SOA to build highly reusable, flexible, bothplatform and protocol independentsolution. Service oriented system NotX {{is capable of}} notifying users of external information system via various engines; currently: SMS engine, voice synthesizer (call engine) and mail engine. Adaptable design decision {{makes it possible to}} easily extend NotX with interesting capabilities. The engines are added as plug-ins written in Java. There are plans to further extend NotX with following engines: Facebook engine, Twitter engine, content management system engine. Also the design of NotX allows to notify users in theirs own language with full localization support which is necessary to bring value in today’s market. Most importantly, the core design of NotX allows to run under heavy load comprising thousands of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> per second via various protocols (currently Thrift, Web Services, Java Client). Thus NotX is designed to be used by state of the art Enterprise Applications that require by default certain properties of theirs external systems as scalability, reliability and fail-over...|$|E

30|$|It {{was assumed}} that eCall would have been {{installed}} in each vehicle involved in these accidents, except for bicycles, trams and trains. Case reports made by road accident investigation teams were examined specifically focusing on the injury reports, estimated delays {{and the possibility of}} rapid medical treatment such as first aid. The following factors were gathered from reports: time and place of the accident, development of injuries, characteristics of injuries (principal and immediate cause of death), time and place of death, time of the accident based on the police report, time of the beginning of the accident investigation based on the police report, time of notification of police based on the police report, eye witnesses, manner of the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> help, estimated <b>notification</b> delay, and any problems in the determination of the accident site.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{research}} on workflow activity patterns emerged {{in order to}} increase the reuse of recurring business functions (e. g., <b>request</b> <b>for</b> task execution, <b>notification,</b> approval and decision). While workflow patterns have been defined for several aspects related to process execution, recurrent business functions have been only partially addressed by existing work. Related to this challenge we proposed a set of seven workflow activity patterns in previous work. In this paper we report on the results of several case studies we performed in Brazilian and European companies in order to investigate how frequently the activity patterns occur in real-world process models. We further formalize the identified activity patterns using π−calculus. This formalization as well as our analysis results are applied {{in the development of a}} BPM tool fostering the reuse of business functions specifications. 1...|$|R
