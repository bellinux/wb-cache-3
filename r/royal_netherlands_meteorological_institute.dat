40|$|Dutch peatlands {{have been}} subsiding due to peat decomposition, {{shrinkage}} and compression, since their reclamation in the 11 th century. Currently, subsidence amounts to 1 - 2 cm/year. Water management {{in these areas}} is complex and costly, greenhouse gases are being emitted, and surface water quality is relatively poor. Regional and local authorities and landowners responsible for peatland management have recognized these problems. In addition, the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Royal</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> predicts higher temperatures and drier summers, which both are expected to enhance peat decomposition. Stakeholder workshops have been organized in three case study areas {{in the province of}} Friesland to exchange knowledge on subsidence and explore future subsidence rates and the effects of land use and management changes on subsidence rates. Subsidence rates were up to 3 cm/year in deeply drained parcels and increased when we included climate change in the modeling exercises. This means that the relatively thin peat layers in this province (ca 1 m) would shrink or even disappear {{by the end of the}} century when current practices continue. Adaptation measures were explored, such as extensive dairy farming and the production of new crops in wetter conditions, but little experience has been gained on best practices. The workshops have resulted in useful exchange of ideas on possible measures and their consequences for land use and water management in the three case study areas. The province and the regional water board will use the results to develop land use and water management policies for the next decades...|$|R

40|$|Since February 2003, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) {{aboard the}} first Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) {{satellite}} has provided radiance data in 12 spectral bands {{for a full}} Earth hemisphere every 15 minutes. This high frame rate renders it an excellent tool for studies of atmospheric transport of pollutants, aerosol and clouds. TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research) is currently developing an algorithm for the retrieval of aerosol properties from MSG-SEVIRI observations over cloud-free scenes. This requires rigorous cloud screening for which a fast and stand-alone algorithm is developed. The detection technique described in this paper, {{which is based on}} the ATSR- 2 (Along Track Scanning Radiometer 2) cloud screening algorithm, can be easily implemented, and satisfactorily identifies clouds.

Cloud detection results are compared to the KNMI/MF (<b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Institute/Meteo-France) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud detection algorithms.

The method combines a simple form of data assimilation with a moving window calibration of a deterministic model describing {{flow in the}} unsaturated zone as well as regional drainage. Previous work with physically-deterministic models (Knotters and Bierkens, 2000; Knotters and De Gooijer, 1999) has focussed on offline calibration and validation. However, availabil-ity of online measurements makes online forecasting possible. Online forecasting {{can be used for}} both drought and flood warnings, enabling more timely and accurate operational water management. Also, online calibration provides substantially better forecasts than offline calibration.

Following the quality standards {{established by the}} European and global weather radar networking referents, the present thesis aims {{for the improvement of}} the base data quality control in the regional weather radar network operated by the Meteorological Service of Catalonia, the XRAD. This objective is accomplished through the analysis, development and implementation of new or existing procedures and algorithms for radar data quality assessment and improvement. Attending to the current radar technology and to the already implemented quality control procedures for the XRAD, the work is focused on the continuous evaluation of the radar system calibration status and on the correction of Doppler velocity data. The quality control algorithms and recommendations presented are easily translatable to any other operative weather radar networking environment. A Sun-based, fully automatic procedure for online monitoring the antenna alignment and the receiver chain calibration is adapted and operationally implemented for the XRAD. This Sun-monitoring technique was developed at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> and Finnish <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institutes</b> and is included in the quality control flow of numerous weather radar networks around the world. The method is modified for a robust detection and characterisation of solar interferences in raw data at all scan elevations, even when only data at relatively short ranges is available. The modified detection algorithm is also suitable for detecting interferences from wireless devices, which are stored for monitoring their incidence in the XRAD. The solar interferences detected, in turn, are input observations for the inversion of a two-dimensional Gaussian model that yields estimates of the calibration parameters of interest. A complete theoretical derivation of the model establishes its validity limits and provides analytical estimates of the effective solar widths directly from radar parameters. Results of application of this Sun-monitoring methodology to XRAD data reveal its ability to determine the accuracy of the antenna pointing and to detect changes in receiver calibration and radar system operation status. In order to facilitate the usage of the Sun-monitoring technique and the interpretation of its estimates, the methodology is reproduced under controlled conditions based on the distributions of solar observations collected by two of the XRAD radars. The analysis shows that the accuracy of the estimated calibration parameters is conditioned by the precision, number and distribution of the solar observations which constitute key variables that need to be controlled to ensure reliable estimates. In addition, the Sun-monitoring technique is compared under actual operative conditions with two other common techniques for quantifying the antenna azimuth and elevation pointing offsets. Pointing bias estimates gathered in a dedicated short-term campaign are studied in a direct inter- comparison of the methods that reflects the advantages and limitations in each case. The analysis of the bias estimates reported by the methods {{in the course of a}} one-year period reveals that the performance of the techniques depends on the antenna position at the time of the measurement. After this study, a reanalysis of the Sun-monitoring method results is proposed, which allows to additionally quantify the antenna pedestal levelling error. Finally, a post-processing, spatial image filtering algorithm for identification and correction of unfolding errors in dual-PRF Doppler velocity data is proposed. The correction of these errors benefits the usage of radar velocity data in downstream applications such as wind- shear and mesocyclone detection algorithms or assimilation in numerical weather prediction models. The main strengths of the proposed algorithm, in comparison with existing correction techniques, are its robustness to the presence of clustered unfolding errors and that it can be employed independently of post-processing dealiasing algorithms. By means of simulated dual-PRF velocity fields, the correction ability of the algorithm is quantitatively analysed and discussed with particular emphasis on the correction of clustered errors. The quality improvement in real dual-PRF data brought out by the new algorithm is illustrated through application to three selected severe weather events registered by the XRAD. Seguint els estàndards de qualitat establerts per a les xarxes de radars meteorològics de referència a nivell europeu i global, la present tesi té com a objectiu la millora del control de qualitat de les dades de la xarxa regional de radars meteorològics operada pel Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya (la XRAD). Atenent als procediments de control de qualitat ja implementats per a la XRAD, el treball es centra en l'avaluació contínua de l'estat del calibratge del sistema radar i en la correcció de les dades de velocitat Doppler. Es presenta l'adaptació i aplicació d’un procediment totalment automàtic basat en el Sol, que permet la quantificació remota dels errors d'alineació de l'antena i de calibratge en recepció del radar a la XRAD. El mètode ha estat modificat per a la detecció i caracterització robusta d'interferències solars a les dades primàries de radar. Les interferències solars són utilitzades per a la inversió d'un model físic que proporciona estimacions dels paràmetres de calibratge d'interès. L'algoritme de detecció modificat també és adequat per a la identificació d'interferències procedents de dispositius electrònics externs. Aquestes interferències són emmagatzemades per al seguiment de la seva incidència a la XRAD. La metodologia solar esmentada es modelitza en condicions controlades a partir de la distribució de les observacions solars recollides per dos dels radars de la XRAD. L'anàlisi mostra que la precisió, el nombre i la distribució de les observacions solars constitueixen variables clau que necessiten ser controlades per garantir estimacions fiables dels paràmetres de calibrage. A més, la tècnica solar es compara, sota condicions operatives reals, amb altres dues tècniques habitualment emprades per a la quantificació de l'error d'apuntament de l'antena. A partir d'aquest estudi, es proposa un nou mètode d'anàlisi de les interferències solars, el cual permet quantificar l'error d'anivellament del pedestal de l'antena. Finalment, es desenvolupa i valida un algoritme de filtrat d'imatges per a la identificació i correcció dels errors característics que es donen lloc a les dades dual-PRF de velocitat Doppler. Els punts forts de l'algoritme proposat, en comparació amb les tècniques de correcció existents, són la seva robustesa en la correció d'errors agrupats i que pot emprar- se amb independència dels algoritmes de dealiasing. La millora de la qualitat de les dades reals de velocitat s'il·lustra mitjançant l'aplicació de l’algoritme a tres episodis de temps sever enregistrats per la XRAD...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen dioxide {{vertical}} column density (NO 2 VCD) measurements via satellite are {{compared with a}} fine-scale regional chemistry transport model, using a new approach that considers varying satellite footprint sizes. Space-borne NO 2 VCD measurement {{has been used as}} a proxy for surface nitrogen oxide (NO x) emission, especially for anthropogenic urban emission, so accurate comparison of satellite and modeled NO 2 VCD is important in determining the future direction of NO x emission policy. The NASA Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO 2 VCD measurements, retrieved by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Institute (KNMI), are compared with a 12 km Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We found that the OMI footprint-pixel sizes are too coarse to resolve urban NO 2 plumes, resulting in a possible underestimation in the urban core and overestimation outside. In order to quantify this effect of resolution geometry, we have made two estimates. First, we constructed pseudo-OMI data using fine-scale outputs of the model simulation. Assuming the fine-scale model output is a true measurement, we then collected real OMI footprint coverages and performed conservative spatial regridding to generate a set of fake OMI pixels out of fine-scale model outputs. When compared to the original data, the pseudo-OMI data clearly showed smoothed signals over urban locations, resulting in roughly 20 – 30 % underestimation over major cities. Second, we further conducted conservative downscaling of OMI NO 2 VCDs using spatial information from the fine-scale model to adjust the spatial distribution, and also applied averaging kernel (AK) information to adjust the vertical structure. Four-way comparisons were conducted between OMI with and without downscaling and CMAQ with and without AK information. Results show that OMI and CMAQ NO 2 VCDs show the best agreement when both downscaling and AK methods are applied, with the correlation coefficient R = 0. 89. This study suggests that satellite footprint sizes might have a considerable effect on the measurement of fine-scale urban NO 2 plumes. The impact of satellite footprint resolution should be considered when using satellite observations in emission policy making, and the new downscaling approach can provide a reference uncertainty for the use of satellite NO 2 measurements over most cities...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{update on}} the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of the {{ground-level}} ozone (O 3) can benefit from {{a better understanding of}} its source contributions in different US regions during recent years. In the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution experiment phase  1 (HTAP 1), various global models were used to determine the O 3 source–receptor (SR) relationships among three continents in the Northern Hemisphere in 2001. In support of the HTAP phase  2 (HTAP 2) experiment that studies more recent years and involves higher-resolution global models and regional models' participation, we conduct a number of regional-scale Sulfur Transport and dEposition Model (STEM) air quality base and sensitivity simulations over North America during May–June  2010. STEM's top and lateral chemical boundary conditions were downscaled from three global chemical transport models' (i. e., GEOS-Chem, RAQMS, and ECMWF C-IFS) base and sensitivity simulations in which the East Asian (EAS) anthropogenic emissions were reduced by 20  %. The mean differences between STEM surface O 3 sensitivities to the emission changes and its corresponding boundary condition model's are smaller than those among its boundary condition models, in terms of the regional/period-mean (<[*] 10  %) and the spatial distributions. An additional STEM simulation was performed in which the boundary conditions were downscaled from a RAQMS (Realtime Air Quality Modeling System) simulation without EAS anthropogenic emissions. The scalability of O 3 sensitivities {{to the size of the}} emission perturbation is spatially varying, and the full (i. e., based on a 100  % emission reduction) source contribution obtained from linearly scaling the North American mean O 3 sensitivities to a 20  % reduction in the EAS anthropogenic emissions may be underestimated by at least 10  %. The three boundary condition models' mean O 3 sensitivities to the 20  % EAS emission perturbations are ∼[*] 8  % (May–June  2010) /∼  11  % (2010 annual) lower than those estimated by eight global models, and the multi-model ensemble estimates are higher than the HTAP 1 reported 2001 conditions. GEOS-Chem sensitivities indicate that the EAS anthropogenic NO x emissions matter more than the other EAS O 3 precursors to the North American O 3, qualitatively consistent with previous adjoint sensitivity calculations. In addition to the analyses on large spatial–temporal scales relative to the HTAP 1, we also show results on subcontinental and event scales that are more relevant to the US air quality management. The EAS pollution impacts are weaker during observed O 3   exceedances than on all days in most US regions except over some high-terrain western US rural/remote areas. Satellite O 3 (TES, JPL–IASI, and AIRS) and carbon monoxide (TES and AIRS) products, along with surface measurements and model calculations, show that during certain episodes stratospheric O 3 intrusions and the transported EAS pollution influenced O 3 in the western and the eastern US differently. Free-running (i. e., without chemical data assimilation) global models underpredicted the transported background O 3 during these episodes, posing difficulties for STEM to accurately simulate the surface O 3 and its source contribution. Although we effectively improved the modeled O 3 by incorporating satellite O 3 (OMI and MLS) and evaluated the quality of the HTAP 2 emission inventory with the <b>Royal</b> <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Meteorological</b> Institute–Ozone Monitoring Instrument (KNMI–OMI) nitrogen dioxide, using observations to evaluate and improve O 3 source attribution still remains to be further explored...|$|R
