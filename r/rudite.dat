25|$|Clastic {{sedimentary}} rocks, are subdivided {{according to}} the dominant particle size. Most geologists use the Udden-Wentworth grain size scale and divide unconsolidated sediment into three fractions: gravel (>2mm diameter), sand (1/16 to 2mm diameter), and mud (clay is <1/256nbsp&mm and silt is between 1/16 and 1/256nbsp&mm). The classification of clastic sedimentary rocks parallels this scheme; conglomerates and breccias are made mostly of gravel, sandstones are made mostly of sand, and mudrocks are made mostly of the finest material. This tripartite subdivision is mirrored by the broad categories of <b>rudites,</b> arenites, and lutites, respectively, in older literature.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The Lizard Complex rests tectonically on the Meneage Formation {{within the}} top of the flysch {{dominated}} Gramscatho Group of sediments. The Meneage Formation is a Middle to Upper Devonian sedimentary melange sequence with interbedded <b>rudites.</b> The possibility that one or both of these lithologies include Lizard-derived debris is examined in detail. The rudaceous debris is characterized by a range of meta-psammitic, pelitic and basic lithologies which cannot be matched with a Lizard source. Parts of this suite, notably granite gneiss and amphibolitic material, are found to be quite different from superficially similar. possible Lizard source rocks. A cratonic source is required. The only widespread type of melange phacoid with a possible Lizard source is greenstone. Geochemically these have ocean floor tholeiite affinities. Gabbro and amphibolite occur within, and serpentinite near, one particularly large greenstone phacoid. However, no precise geochemical comparison can be made between greenstones and Lizard dykes. Autochthonous oceanic tholeiites in the Gramscatho Group sequence, and the absence of varied and widespread possible Lizard-derived material, suggest that the Lizard Complex is an unlikely source for the allochthonous greenstones. A separate local development of oceanic crust now no longer exposed, and autochthonous volcanics, are postulated as mor...|$|R

During episode 1, a subsident coastal salina filled with Ca-sulphates was formed in the downthrown block of two normal faults. Erosion of the Upper Triassic units (Keuper facies and Imón Fm) and deposition of terrestrial facies (lutites, sandstones and polymict breccias), took place in the uplifted blocks. During episode 2, tectonic reactivation combined to long-term sea level rise, resulted in the setting of tidal flat facies, preserved as dolomitic breccias, cellular limestones and finelly-crystalline limestones. Deposition of shallow subtidal facies (mudstones and oolitic-peloidal and bioclastic packstones-grainstones) was favoured in the more subsident areas of downthrown blocks. Cracking and fracturing of the early lithified subtidal carbonates also originated the local deposition in these areas of calcareous breccias and <b>rudite...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the largest of the ‘classical’ rias in W. Galicia, the Ría de Arosa (length 25 km, depths of over 65 m). The bottom of the ria {{displays}} a complex topography. The wide variety of the surrounding rock types results in the supply of heavy minerals and clay minerals of a variegated composition. The different types of sediment occurring in the bay are described. The results of various laboratory analyses of some 400 grab samples form the basis of the discussions, but punch-core and boring samples were also studied. The present sedimentary processes are inferred from data obtained from textural and petrographical analyses in combination with the oceanographical and biological characteristics of the ria. Two types of bioclasts are distinguished: lithothamnion <b>rudite</b> and shell debris. Accumulations of Lithothamnion (two species) are restricted to shallow areas, where they sometimes constitute the entire sediment. The innermost part of the ria lacks calcareous algae; the depth-limit of growth shifts downward on approaching the Atlantic Ocean. Shell debris is found throughout the ria, the amount increasing {{in the direction of the}} ocean. Accumulations of shell debris are also encountered in shallow areas. The moderate sorting and the absence of a dominant species in the heavy-mineral association of the samples taken in the bed of the largest river flowing into the ria (the Ulla), indicate that these sediments are not in equilibrium with their present environment. This also accounts for the pebbly sands of the Umia River, the second most important confluent to the ria. The rivers supply sandy particles to the ria only occasionally. Coarse-grained sediments, mainly restricted to the coastal zones, derive from the local bedrock. The distributional boundaries of the eight heavy-mineral associations distinguished in the Ría de Arosa reflect local petrological differences on the mainland, thus indicating the insignificance of long-shore currents. One metamorphic association is exceptional, because the adjoining bedrock is an intrusive granite. The origin of this — presumably relict — sediment found along part of the eastern coast remains a problem. Immaturity of the sandy sediments is confirmed by roundness and quartz/feldspar ratios. Muds and sandy muds are the predominating types of bottom sediments in the Ría de Arosa. Black liquid muds, smelling strongly of hydrogen sulphide, are encountered in the inner part of the ria. Greenish-grey firm inodoriferous muds are found in the central and outer regions. These physical differences are caused by the decrease in both the oxygen content and the velocity of the bottom current flowing into the ria. This water circulation pattern also governs the distribution of the clay minerals. The muds are only partially supplied by the rivers, which carry kaolinite, illite, gibbsite, and other minerals. Marine clay minerals, also consisting mainly of kaolinite and illite but characterized by the additional presence of montmorillonite, are brought into the ria by bottom currents...|$|E

The strata, {{folded and}} locally overturned, young {{predominantly}} to the NW but blocks to the SW contain younger sequences. Analogous configurations occur in modern accretionary margins. The oldest rocks, generally of pelagic and hemipelagic origin, are Arenig basalts, dolerites, cherts and brown mudstones underlying red mudstones, possibly Llanvirn, and black fossiliferous mudstones and cherts of Llandeilo and Caradoc age. Trench sediments overlying pelagic sequences represent a range of depositional mechanisms. <b>Rudites</b> and associated fine-grained lithologies of lateral origin relate to a lower trench-slope canyon system, whilst axially transported sands, originating on the lower trench slope, were deposited by turbidity currents and related flows. Sandstone petrography varies markedly across strike, with quartz-rich compositions suggesting a recycled orogen source, and ferromagnesian-rich compositions a dissected magmatic arc provenance. Faults, initially low-angle thrusts, facilitated thrust nappe formation; faults and bedding were rotated through the vertical within the accretionary complex, predating or accompanying slaty cleavage development. Soft sediment deformation, two fold phases and a kink-band set are recognised.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rock {{types and}} {{sedimentary}} {{structures in the}} New York Devonian nearshore marine Catskill Delta provide inter-relationships {{that can be used}} to identify other deltaic paleoenvironments. Triangular prisms with four rock types as end members were con-structed in order to display the range in lithology existing in outcrops where a given sedimentary structure was identified. The structural prisms were then arranged according to the similarities and differences of their patterns. This arrangement resulted in a structural ranking: low rank-flute casts to high rank-oscillation ripples. A low rank signifies an environment of low energy and hydrodynamic unsteadiness (variability) whereas high rank indicates higher energy and a more hydrodynamically steady state. Siltstones, shales and mudstones tend to be associated with the former, sandstones and <b>rudites</b> with the latter. Lithologie and structural data have been reorganized according to an earlier field-based paleoenvironmental classification. Higher ranked structures and coarser sediments were significantly abundant in the delta front and distributary bar environments hut significantly rare in the open shelf and prodelta environments. Just the opposite is true for the finer-grained sediments and low-ranked structures. The platform, estuarine and lagoonal paleo-enviromnents provide less well-defined patterns attributable to the greater ange of energy levels operating there. These associations provide criteria that can help to distinguish the paleoenvironments in other marine deltaic settings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Gildirli Formation is {{the oldest}} Neogene rock unit in the Adana Basin and was formed prior to the {{regionally}} extensive Early Miocene marine transgression. These coarse clastic red-beds provide important evidence about the causes and early phases of filling in this large trough, because the Gildirli Formation sediments fill an irregular palaeotopography carved out of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic basement rocks. Detailed study of the Gildirli Formation reveals the existence {{of at least two}} alluvial fans supplied from different source areas. A northeastern fan, exposed around Gildirli Village, was fed by streams draining an area of ophiolitic mélange, Mesozoic and older limestones, and fills an irregular palaeomorphology around and northeast of Gildirli. The southwestern fan, in the Nergizlik area, is dominated by debris flow and sheet flow <b>rudites</b> derived from an area of entirely carbonate bedrock. The lower part of the southwestern fan is characterised by well-bedded carbonate breccias and conglomerates that occupy deep, steep-sided palaeovalleys with approximate E–W trends (parallelling the main basin-margin), whereas higher parts of this fan are muddier and show channelised fluvial and floodplain attributes. The two fans display different provenance characteristics and evidently were fed into an intervening pre-existing depression, probably tectonically controlled. The Lower to Middle Miocene sediments that succeed the Gildirli Formation fan clastics on this basin margin form a mosaic of facies associations, partly contemporaneous and partly diachronous.

40|$|During the Pliocene, {{along the}} Apennines front of Southern Italy (Acerenza area), a {{sector of the}} wedge-top basin hosted shallow- marine siliciclastic-carbonate (-bioclastic) sedimentation. Sediments consist of mixed arenites and <b>rudites</b> forming an up to 30 m thick unit. Based on the {{recognition}} of textural features, sedimentary structures, and degree of segregation between siliciclastic and bioclastic particles, facies analysis revealed 10 facies grouped into 5 associations. They suggest the occurrence of either wave or current dominated environments, showing different degrees of heterolithic segregation between siliciclastic and bioclastic particles. The depositional system was characterised by a gentle sloping profile irregularly undulated by syndepositional gentle folds. Waves dominated the shallowest areas of the mixed system and the terrigenous fraction derived mainly from wave erosion of substrate (arenaceous) rocks. These areas were located {{at the top of}} anticlines at depths corresponding to that of an upper shoreface sector of a classic coastal profile. The bioclastic fraction derived from the fragmentation of an in situ heterozoan skeletal-carbonate factory. Almost constant waves activity prevented segregation of the siliciclastic and bioclastic fractions in the lower shoreface zones. In relatively deeper environment of the mixed system (offshore transition), persistent unidirectional currents dominated, with development of tide-influenced 2 D and 3 D dunes. Repeated oscillations of the water column in the sheltered coastal areas produced modulation of current velocity favouring segregation of the heterolithic fractions along the dune foresets. Finally, in the deepest sector of the system (offshore), pervasive bioturbation dominated causing unsegregation of the siliciclastic and bioclastic fractions...|$|R

40|$|Provenance studies most {{commonly}} apply the classical approach based on petrographic modal analysis of arenites. In this this is combined to both petrographic study on conglomerate clasts and to geochemical investigation on major and trace elements of pelites. This work is aimed to: i) {{understand the nature}} of the source areas of the Mesozoic sedimentary covers of the Ligure-Piemontese oceanic basin, a branch of Western Tethys; these sedimentary successions are preserved as tectonic units in the Alpine-Apennine belt (Balagne Nappe in Alpine Corsica and Internal and External Ligurian units in Northern Apennines); ii) provide further constraints {{to the understanding of the}} Jurassic rifting process. Petrographic and geochemical results indicate significant differences between Corsica and Internal Ligurian units against External Ligurian units. Petrography of pebbles from <b>rudites</b> and lithic fragments from arenites shows that Corsica and Internal Ligurian units contain a debris of low-grade metamorphic rocks and carbonate platform rock fragments, while the External Ligurian units are represented by low-, medium- and high-grade metamorphic rocks; mm-sized Cr-spinel probably derived from a mantle-rock source; additionally, both carbonate platform and pelagic siliceous/carbonatic rock fragments have been found. Geochemical data on pelites show that samples from External Ligurian units suggest a more mafic/ultramafic character: they are enriched in elements such as Cr, Co, Ni (abundant in mafic-ultramafic rocks), and the Th/Sc/Cr/V/Ni relationships show a systematic shift towards ultramafic contribution. On the whole, petrographic and chemical data collected in this paper indicate that the source for sediments of Corsica and Internal Ligurian units were similar, and made up by the upper part of a continental basement and its carbonatic sedimentary cover (the Europe continental margin). On the other hand, the sedimentary cover of the External Ligurian units was supplied by a source area where a complete lithospheric section was exposed, from the upper mantle up to the deep sea sedimentary cover (the Adria continental margin). These findings are useful to unravel the processes related to the opening mechanisms of the Ligure-Piemontese oceanic basin: among the different rifting models existing, our data support an asymmetric mechanism dominated by a west-dipping detachment fault, with the Adria margin acting as the lower plate...|$|R
40|$|Provenance studies {{started in}} the 19 th century {{with the aim of}} {{determining}} the parent rocks of single minerals or mineral varieties. With the advent of the Plate Tectonic theory, classification schemes were proposed, to quantitatively evaluate sandstone composition, which in turn was used to relate sandstone composition to the tectonic setting of the source areas. The traditional provenance studies based on modal analysis of arenites were enhanced by the application of other methods not limited solely to the sand-sized fraction. After the development/improvement of high resolution analytical techniques, the geochemical features of fine-grained siliciclastic rocks have been fruitfully used in provenance studies, along with the petrographic and chemical analysis of coarse-grained deposits. Moreover, the field of provenance analysis has undergone a revolution with the development of high resolution single-crystal isotope-dating techniques, such as SHRIMP U-Pb dating on zircons and laserprobe 40 Ar – 39 Ar dating. As suggested and recommended in recent works dealing with siliciclastic provenance, a multi-disciplinary approach is highly desirable. In this PhD thesis, a multidisciplinary approach is proposed to face a provenance issue, which combines: i) petrography and geochemistry of conglomerate clasts, ii) modal analysis of arenites, iii) geochemistry of major (XRF) and trace element (ICP-MS) of pelites and arenites, iv) Ar-Ar geochronology of detrital white micas. This approach has been applied to sedimentary rocks in order to unravel a geological problem: the reconstruction of the configuration of continental margins of the Ligure-Piemontese oceanic basin (a branch of Western Tethys opened during Jurassic between the Corsica/Europe and Adria plates). The main goals related to this issue are: i) to unravel the composition of the two margins, which in turn can provide further constraints for their configurations prior to their involvement in the collisional events; ii) to discuss the results in order to evaluate the different models existing for the opening history of the Ligure Piemontese Ocean. Remnants of the Ligure Piemontese oceanic basin, today preserved as tectonic units within the Alpine-Apennine belt (originated after the continental collision between Corsica/Europe and Adria plates during Eocene), display well developed Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous sedimentary successions. The investigated units are: the Err-Platta units from the Central Alps, the Balagne Nappe from Corsica, the Internal and External Ligurian units from Northern Apennines. Paleogeographic reconstructions permit the pristine location of these units in the Ligure Piemontese oceanic basin. The studied sedimentary rocks were all fed by the passive margins of the Ligure Piemontese Ocean, making it possible to investigate the nature of the source areas located in the two conjugate margins. The geochemical investigation of pelites permitted to highlight ‘time’-related first-order chemical large-scale features for the sediments of the Ligure Piemontese oceanic basin. A more mafic character is shown by the Radiolarite formation vs the Calpionella Limestone and Palombini Shale formations sampled in the different investigated units (the three formations representing the pelagic post-rift deposits of the Ligure Piemontese oceanic basin). This difference in composition can be explained considering the erosion and distribution inside the oceanic basin of the rough primary morphologies of the basaltic sea-floor at the time of deposition of the Radiolarites. This possibly resulted in a mafic geochemical signature inherited by the fine-grained siliciclastic sediments from the first post-rift oceanic formation (the Radiolarite Formation). This common oceanic basin-scale chemical feature is preserved and still decipherable thanks to the geochemical features, despite the investigated formations belong to tectonic units from various sectors of the Alpine-Apennine chain that experienced different tectonic/metamorphic histories. The composition of the sedimentary covers from the Ligure Piemontese oceanic basin has been then considered under the ‘space’-related perspective, comparing the units to each other. Along a Corsica-Apennines transect, petrographic data from <b>rudites</b> and arenites have been combined with geochemical data from pelites, and the main features of the source areas (i. e. the continental margins) have been highlighted using the differences in composition inferred from these data. The source area of Corsica and Internal Ligurian units, regarded as the Corsica/Europe continental margin, was made up of the upper part of a continental basement plus its carbonate sedimentary cover. The sedimentary record generated by its erosion is in fact represented by turbidite deposits derived from low-grade metamorphic rocks, granites, acidic volcanic rocks and carbonate platform rocks. The geochemical data relative to the fine-grained siliciclastic fraction of these deposits indicate a composition resulting from the mixing of felsic and mafic sources, with the felsic component being prominent. On the other hand, the source area of the External Ligurian units (the Adria margin) was represented by a complete lithospheric section, from the upper mantle to the siliceous/carbonate sedimentary cover. The erosion of this margin produced turbidite deposits derived from mantle rocks, low- to high- grade metamorphic rocks, granites, acidic volcanic rocks, carbonatic platform rocks and pelagic sedimentary rocks. The geochemical data relative to the fine-grained siliciclastic fraction of these deposits indicate an ultramafic source standing out from the mafic-felsic components also contributing to the sediment. This local second-order chemical feature overprints the first-order time-related one, recognized on a basin scale. Petrographic and geochemical data of <b>rudites</b> and arenites from the Alpine transect, where the Err-Platta nappes represent the Ocean-Continent (Adria) Transition, do not show contrasting evidence with this overall asymmetric compositional picture, and in some cases point to that direction (e. g. : rare occurrence in these deposits of material from possible lower crust/mantle sources). On the whole, the ‘space’-related differences in composition between the Corsica/Europe and the Adria continental margins are thought to reflect different configurations of the two margins that in turn provide further constraints {{to the understanding of the}} rifting process. Data collected in this work lend support to an asymmetric opening mechanism for the Ligure-Piemontese oceanic basin, with the Adria margin acting as the lower plate during the rifting processes (west-dipping detachment fault). Concerning this point, the multidisciplinary study of sediments can be considered a valuable tool in paleotectonic reconstructions, especially in those cases in which the regional-scale features of the investigated geological framework are lost due to major successive tectonic events. 40 Ar – 39 Ar geochronological data on detrital white micas from the Corsica/Europe and Adria margin-sourced deposits have been presented in this thesis. The age-distribution of the two arenite samples from Corsica and Internal Ligurian units well match the known-from the literature picture defined by the Variscan ages found in the crystalline rocks from the Corsica/Europe basement. The age-distribution of the sample from External Ligurian units partially overlaps the oldest Variscan white mica ages known from the literature for the Adria basement. Hence, this sample gives an original contribution to the geochronological characterization of the Adria continental basement. The geochronological data collected along a Corsica-Northern Apennines transect indicate that: i) the detrital micas occurring in the Mesozoic sedimentary covers of the Ligure Piemontese Ocean were sourced by crystalline igneous and variably metamorphosed basement rocks of Variscan age, and ii) detrital white mica geochronology in provenance studies is a useful tool for the characterization of source areas. After having investigated the compositional features of the sediments from the Ligure Piemontese Ocean, with the aim of characterize their origin, (i. e. the source areas), an attempt is made to explore their fate, i. e. what kind of modifications they undergo when involved in a subduction setting. This is a noteworthy issue, since variably metamorphosed sediments and ocean floor can give a geochemical contribution to the mantle-wedge (and related arc-magmas) in terms of released fluids/elements. The composition of basalts and siliciclastic sediments from the Ligure Piemontese oceanic basin are compared to the corresponding metabasalt/calc-schist from tectonic units metamorphosed under blue schist and eclogite facies conditions. The almost unaffected chemical patterns of the metamorphic equivalent both of the basalt and sediment lend support to those works from the literature suggesting the occurrence of the processes responsible for the mobilization of elements at "deeper" levels than eclogite facies along the subducting slab. In summary, a multidisciplinary approach is definitely to recommend when a provenance study of sediments is pursued. The combined analysis of the different grain size fractions of sedimentary rocks by means of various methods has in fact the potential to provide a comprehensive picture of the case study, being pelites, arenites and <b>rudites</b> able to supply different kinds of geological meaningful informations...|$|R

Previous studies on Australian opal were geologically uncontrolled and analysed specimens were commonly from an unknown source. This research is the first integrated geologically-controlled study of sedimentary opal in Australia {{with the aim of}} refining models for opal genesis. The work was undertaken in the recently-discovered Hebel field of southern Queensland. Mapping, underground sampling and RAB drilling specifically for this project were undertaken. After petrography, weathered host rocks and opal were analysed by XRF, XRD, INAA, LA-ICP-MS mass spectrometry. Geologically-constrained precious and non-precious opal samples were analysed by using mass spectrometry, EMPA, IR, NMR, SEM and bioluminescence. Opal is hosted by porous, low density kaolinite-bearing Early Cretaceous argillaceous sediments overlain by Tertiary <b>rudites</b> and arenites. The sequence is highly weathered and mapping, mineralogical, geochemical and isotope studies show that weathering becomes less intense with depth. Deep weathering took place in the Late Cretaceous and silicification associated with tropical weathering took place in the Early Tertiary. Later Tertiary cooler more arid weathering features overprint the earlier weathering. Geochemical and isotopic studies show that during the long period of weathering, there was constant re-equilibration in an open dynamic evolving system as it still is today. Opal occurrences are stratigraphically controlled by smectitic-bearing clay horizons. There are possible local structures such as faults, joints and bedding planes which allowed the plastic deformation of opaline gel by dehydration into the enveloping smectitic sediments. Opal underwent post-consolidation brittle deformation. Continued long term weathering produced bleaching of and trace element stripping from of the outer rims of opal. This study confirmed structural differences between nonprecious and precious opal and showed that opal operates as a molecular sponge. Hence {{it was not possible to}} obtain a RblSr age of formation of opal but it was possible to show, on the basis of 0 and H isotopes, that there were several periods of isotopic overprinting, probably related to different episodes of weathering. NMR, IR and EMP A studies showed that the molecular structure of opal is governed by impurities, water occurs as OH- and possible short chain aliphatic organic compounds occur in the structure. Short chain aliphatic compounds are of biological origin. SEM studies show bacterial microfossil silica pseudomorphs. No DNA was detected in opal. Opal formed from long-term intense tropical weathering of porous permeable clastic sediments. Descending silica-laden fluids were dehydrated by expanding-lattice clays and formed as gel in structural sites in favourable stratigraphic horizons. Ubiquitous microorganisms probably played a role in opal deposition, possibly providing the locus for structural distortion during colloidal precipitation thereby promoting the formation of nonprecious opal. It is suggested that precious opal has formed from colloidal silica precipitation in the absence of bacteria thereby explaining the rarity of precious opal. Open Acces...|$|R

During the tectonic-structural evolution of the Xaréu Oil Field and the Mundaú Sub-Basin, the Mundaú Fault played a crucial role on the control of the geometry of both compartments. The main carbonatic unit in the Xaréu Oil Field, named the Trairí Member(Paracuru Formation of Late Aptian to Early Albian age), contains the largest oil volume in the field, concentrated in structurally-controlled accumulations. The Trairí Member is composed by a variety of carbonatic rocks (massive, bedded or laminated calcilutites, ostracodites, calcarenites and carbonatic <b>rudites,</b> all of them presenting variable degrees of dolomitization). The carbonatic rocks are interbedded into thick packages of black shales and marls, besides local beds of siliciclastic conglomerates, sandstones, siltnes and argillites. From the spatial association and the genetic relationships between the carbonatic and siliciclastic units, it is possible to group them in three lithofacies associations (Marginal Plain, Ramp and Lacustrine Interior) that, together, were developed in a lacustrine system associated to a marginal sabkha. Structural studies based on drill coresthat sample the Trairí Member in the Xaréu Oil Field allowed to characterize two generations of meso- to microscale structures: the D 1 group presents a typical hydroplastic character, being characterized by intra/interstratal to oblique-bedding shear zones. The hydroplastic character related to these structures allowed to infer their development at an early-lithilication stage of the Trairí Member, leading to infer an Early Cretaceous age to them. The second group of structures identified in the drill cores, nominated D 2 and ascribed to a Neogene age, presents a strictly brttle character, being typilied by normal faults and slickenfibers of re-crystallized clayminerals, ali olthem displaying variable orientations. Although the present faults in the Xaréu Oil Field (and, consequently, in the Mundaú Sub-Basin) were classically relerred as struetures of essentially normal displacement, the kinematics analysis of the meso-to microscaie D 1 struetures in the drill cores led to deline oblique displacements (normal with a clockwise strike-slip component) to these faults, indicating a main tectonic transport to ENE. These oblique movements would be responsible for the installation of a transtensive context in the Mundaú Sub-Basin, as part of the transcurrent to translormant opening of the Atlantic Equatorial Margin. The balancing of four struetural cross-sections ofthe Xaréu Oil Field indicates that the Mundaú Fault was responsible for more than 50 % of the total stretching (ß factor) registered during the Early Aptian. At the initial stages of the "rifting", during Early Aptianuntil the Holocene, the Mundaú Sub-Basin (and consequently the Xaréu Oil Fleld) accumulated a total stretching between 1. 21 and 1. 23; in other words, the crust in this segment of the Atlantic Equatorial Margin was subjeeted to an elongation of about 20 %. From estimates of oblique displacements related to the faults, it ws possible to construct diagrams that allow the determination of stretching factors related to these displacements. Using these diagrams and assuming the sense 01 dominant teetonictransport towards ENE, it was possible to calculate the real stretching lactors related to the oblique movement 0 of the faults in the Mundaú Sub-Basin. which reached actual values between 1. 28 and 1. 42. ln addnion to the tectonic-structural studies in the Xaréu Oil Field, the interpretation of remote sensing products, coupled wnh characterization of terrain analogues in seleeted areas along the northern Ceará State (continental margins of the Ceará and Potiguar basins), provided addnional data and constraints about the teetonic-structural evolution of the oil lield. The work at the analogue sites was particularly effective in the recognition and mapping, in semidetail scale, several generations of struetures originated under a brittle regime. Ali the obtained information (from the Xaréu Oil Field, the remote sensor data and the terrain analogues) were jointly interpreted, culminating with the proposnion of an evolutionary model lor this segment of the Atlantic Equatorial Margin; this model that {{can be applied to the}} whole Margin, as well. This segmentof the Atlantic Equatorial Margin was delormedin an early E-W (when considered lhe present-day position of the South American Plate) transcurrent to transform regime with dextral kinematics, started Irom, at least, the Early Aptian, which left its record in several outcrops along the continental margin of the Ceará State and specilically in the Xaréu off Field. The continuous operation of the regime, through the Albian and later periods, led to the definitive separation between the South American and African plates, with the formation of oceanic lithosphere between the two continental blocks, due to the emplacement off spreading centers. This process involved the subsequent transition of the transcurrent to a translorm dextral regime, creating lhe Equatorial Atlantic Oceano With the separation between the South American and African plates already completed and the increasing separation between lhe continental masses, other tecton ic mechanisms began to act during the Cenozoic (even though the Cretaceous tectonic regime lasted until the Neogene), like an E-W compressive stress líeld (related to the spreading olthe oceanic floor along lhe M id-Atlantic Ridge and to the compression of the Andean Chain) effective Irom the Late Cretaceous, and a state of general extension olthe horizontal surface (due to the thermal uplift ofthe central portion of Borborema Province), effective during the Neogene. The overlap of these mechanisms during the Cenozoic led to the imprint of a complex tectonic framework, which apparently influenced the migration and entrapment 01 hydrocarbon in the Ceará Basi...|$|R
