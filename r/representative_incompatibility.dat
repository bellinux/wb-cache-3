50|$|He was {{member of}} the House of Representatives from 1896 to 1918 and of the Diet of Hungary from 1918 to 1926. He {{was one of the}} plenary sessions' most active representative. He {{represented}} Csorna until 1918 as politician of the Catholic People's Party. He served as parliamentarian clerk between 1896 and 1899. Rakovszky signed in the names of his party the pact between the opposition and Prime Minister Kálmán Széll on 23 February 1899.

40|$|The hemolysin (Hly/Bac) {{determinant}} in {{strains of}} Enterococcus faecalis {{was found to}} be present on plasmids in different incompatibility groups (conferring different sex pheromone responses) {{as well as on the}} chromosome. Of 33 Hly/Bac plasmids identified in clinical isolates, the related pheromone for 30 was cAD 1; the related pheromone for another two (pYI 1 and pYI 3) or one (pYI 2) was cOB 1 or cY 12, respectively. The representative Hly/Bac plasmids pAD 1, pYI 1, pOB 1, and pYI 2, which responded to pheromones cAD 1, cOB 1, cOB 1, and cYI 2, respectively, were compatible with one another. As additions to the incompatibility group IncHly of pAD 1, groups for pOB 1, pYI 1, and pYI 2 were designated IncHlyII, IncHlyIII, and IncHlyIV, respectively. Eleven of the 30 plasmids conferring a response to cAD 1 were very similar to pAD 1 on the basis of their restriction endonuclease profiles. EcoRI fragment D, F, or H containing parts of the Hly/Bac gene(s) of pAD 1 hybridized to similar EcoRI fragments from each of the other three <b>representatives</b> of <b>incompatibility</b> groups (i. e., pOB 1, pYI 1, and pYI 2) and to homologous DNA representing the chromosome of the plasmid-free Hly/Bac strain YI 6 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Self-transmissible and mobilizable {{plasmids}} {{contribute to}} the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria by enabling the horizontal transfer of acquired antibiotic resistance. The objective {{of this study was}} to capture and characterize self-transmissible and mobilizable resistance plasmids from a coastal wetland impacted by urban stormwater runoff and human wastewater during the rainy season. Four plasmids were captured, two self-transmissible and two mobilizable, using both mating and enrichment approaches. Plasmid genomes, sequenced with either Illumina or PacBio platforms, revealed <b>representatives</b> of <b>incompatibility</b> groups IncP- 6, IncR, IncN 3, and IncF. The plasmids ranged in size from 36 to 144 kb and encoded known resistance genes for most of the major classes of antibiotics used to treat Gram-negative infections (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and amphenicols). The mobilizable IncP- 6 plasmid pLNU- 11 was discovered in a strain of Citrobacter freundii enriched from the wetland sediments with tetracycline and nalidixic acid, and encodes a novel AmpC-like β-lactamase (blaWDC- 1), which shares less than 62 % amino acid sequence identity with the PDC class of β-lactamases found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although the IncR plasmid pTRE- 1611 was captured by mating wetland bacteria with P. putida KT 2440 as recipient, it was found to be mobilizable rather than self-transmissible. Two self-transmissible multidrug-resistance plasmids were also captured: the small (48 kb) IncN 3 plasmid pTRE- 131 was captured by mating wetland bacteria with Escherichia coli HY 842 where it is seemed to be maintained at nearly 240 copies per cell, while the large (144 kb) IncF plasmid pTRE- 2011, which was isolated from a cefotaxime-resistant environmental strain of E. coli ST 744, exists at just a single copy per cell. Furthermore, pTRE- 2011 bears the globally epidemic blaCTX-M- 55 extended-spectrum β-lactamase downstream of ISEcp 1. Our results indicate that urban coastal wetlands are reservoirs of diverse self-transmissible and mobilizable plasmids of relevance to human health...|$|R
40|$|We {{surveyed}} plasmids <b>representative</b> of most <b>incompatibility</b> {{groups for}} their conferred deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) primase activity. RP 4 (IncP) {{was one of}} the few with such activity although, unlike the derepressed IncIalpha plasmids (which also specify a primase), it did not suppress the dnaG mutation. Using deletion and Tn 7 derivatives of RP 4, we located the presumed primase structural gene (pri) in the 37 - to 42 -kilobase region. Tn 7 insertions in the adjacent Tra 1 region also reduced or caused overproduction of primase. We purified the RP 4 primase to a single polypeptide of molecular weight 118, 000. It is an anisometric molecule and functions as a monomer, initiating complementary strand synthesis on phi X 174 DNA in Escherichia coli dnaG cell extracts in the presence of ribonucleotide triphosphates and rifampin. It is immunologically unrelated to either the E. coli dnaG or the IncIalpha plasmid-specified DNA primases. RP 4 pri mutants conjugated with a lower efficiency into some bacterial species, including Salmonella typhimurium. Back-transfer experiments showed that this effect was recipient specific. There was also a comparable reduction in mobilization efficiency of R 300 B by RP 4 pri into such recipients. Loss of RP 4 primase led to detectable plasmid instability. The RP 4 -specified primase therefore seems to serve two functions: the single DNA strand transferred during conjugation is primed by it in the recipient cell, and it appears to be necessary for the efficient priming of discontinuous plasmid DNA replication despite the presence of the chromosomal priming system...|$|R
