40|$|After {{a period}} of {{relative}} laissez faire, governments {{around the world are}} beginning to attempt to regulate online life, for a variety of reasons, through various mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> and control. The drive to enforce the respect of copyright is at the forefront of these attempts, a highly controversial topic which pits proponents <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the creative industry against advocates of freedom of speech. Apart from their inflammatory nature, one distinguishing characteristic of most of these schemes is that they are mediated: that is, they are conducted with the help of third parties, most often internet service providers. The mediation <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> is something as yet relatively underexplored by the field <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> studies, whose theoretical tools are by and large focussed on a two way relationship between watcher and watched. This article seeks to remedy this deficit, by examining the dynamics of mediation in the context of online copyright enforcement. We argue that, far from being a neutral process, the displacement <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> to third parties has a crucial impact on {{the way in which it}} is conducted. In particular, the expanding capacity of mediators becomes a reason for justifying <b>surveillance</b> in and <b>of</b> itself...|$|R
40|$|Critical Security Methods {{offers a}} new {{approach}} to research methods in critical security studies. It argues that methods are not simply tools {{to bridge the gap between}} security theory and security practice. Rather, to practise methods critically means engaging in a more free and experimental interplay between theory, methods and practice. This recognises that the security practices we research are often methods in their own <b>right,</b> as forms <b>of</b> <b>surveillance,</b> data mining, visualisation, and so on, and that our own research methods are themselves practices that intervene and interfere in those sites of security and insecurity. Against the familiar methdological language of rigour, detachment and procedural consistency, Critical Security Methods reclaims the idea of method as experiment. The chapters offer a series of methodological experimentations that assemble concepts, theory and empirical cases into new frameworks for critical security research. They show how critical engagement and methodological innovation can be practiced as interventions into diverse instances of insecurity and securitisation, including airports, drug trafficking, peasant struggles, biometrics and police kettling. The book will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in critical security studies, politics and international relations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{critically}} the everyday conditions <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> in the contemporary secondary school context. Using a classical ethnographic approach, it seeks to unpack the range <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> practices and processes that are at work within schools as institutional settings, and how these are encountered and experienced by students, teachers, administrators, and other members of a school community. The main concern is with the hypothesized evolution of panoptic to post-panoptic surveillance and whether or not surveillance in schools emulates such developments, specifically with regards to the levelling of power hierarchies as a result of the incorporation of both vertical and horizontal modes <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b> To offer concrete examples of this shift in models <b>of</b> <b>surveillance,</b> this paper examine three manifestations <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> in schools: CCTV, mobile phones, and elearning and content management platforms as modes of dataveillance, a particularized form <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> that has come to characterize modern surveillance functions.

The use <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> technologies and techniques at state borders, however, does not stop at the geographical borderlines of a territory: the stateâ€™s focus has shifted from an emphasis on border control to a more general focus on the control or management of peopleâ€™s mobility.

40|$|Abstract: The overall aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify how we can theorize and systemize {{economic}} surveillance. Surveillance studies scholars like David Lyon stress that economic surveillance such as monitoring consumers or the workplace are central aspects <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> societies. The approach that is advanced in this work recognizes the importance of the role of the economy in contemporary surveillance societies. The paper at hand constructs theoretically founded typologies in order to systemize the existing literature <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> studies and to analyze examples <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Therefore, it main-ly is a theoretical approach combined with illustrative examples. This contribution contains a systematic discussion of the state of the art <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> and clarifies how different notions treat economic aspects <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b> In this work it is argued that the existing literature is insufficient for studying economic surveillance. In contrast, a typology <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> in the modern economy, which is based on foundations of a political economy approach, allows providing a systematic analy-sis <b>of</b> economic <b>surveillance</b> on the basis of current developments on the Internet. Finally, some political recommendations are drawn in order to overcome economic surveillance. This contribution can be fruitful for scholars who want to undertake...|$|R
