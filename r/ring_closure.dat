5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E
5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, {{it was his}} study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
50|$|Both five- and {{six-membered}} rings {{could be}} {{formed in the}} iodolactonization shown below, but the five-membered ring is formed preferentially as predicted by Baldwin's rules for ring closure.According to the rules, 5-exo-tet <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> are favored while 6-endo-tet <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> are disfavored. The regioselectivity of each iodolactonization can be predicted and explained using Baldwin's rules.|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{the title}} compounds by manganese(III) acetate in acetic acid at 50 - 80 °C affords products of intramolecular aromatic alkylation. High yield and selectivity are observed in six-membered <b>ring</b> <b>closures,</b> whereas five- and seven-membered <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> are associated with side products of dimerization and/or hydrogen abstraction. The aromatic substitution is favored in all cases by a high electron density of the aromatic carbon atom a to the carbonylalkyl substituent. The activation parameters for the oxidative cyclization of diethyl α-(2 -naphthoxyethyl) malonate were determined (ΔH‡ = 25. 2 ± 0. 3 kcal/mol, ΔS‡ = 2. 1 ± 0. 5 cal/K mol). The reaction is interpreted to proceed through electrophilic Mn(III) -complexed β-dicarbonylalkyl radicals, formed by reversible inner-sphere electron transfer of Mn(III) carbonyl complexes, which add reversibly to the aromatic rin...|$|R

25|$|The Pictet–Spengler {{reaction}} is a chemical reaction {{in which a}} β-arylethylamine such as tryptamine undergoes <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> after condensation with an aldehyde or ketone.

This species undergoes a Michael-like addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyls {{in the presence of}} ammonium acetate to undergo <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> and formation of the targeted substituted pyridine as well as pyridinium bromide.|$|E

5000|$|Norsteroids (nor-, L. norma; [...] "normal" [...] in chemistry, {{indicating}} carbon removal) and homosteroids (homo-, Greek homos; [...] "same", indicating carbon addition) are structural subclasses {{of steroids}} formed from biosynthetic steps. The former involves enzymic ring expansion-contraction reactions, {{and the latter}} is accomplished (biomimetically) or (more frequently) through <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> of acyclic precursors with more (or fewer) ring atoms than the parent steroid framework.|$|R
50|$|Baldwin's rules {{discuss the}} {{relative}} rates of <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> of these various types. These terms {{are not meant}} to describe the absolute probability that a reaction will or will not take place, rather they are used in a relative sense. A reaction that is disfavoured (slow) does not have a rate that is able to compete effectively with an alternative reaction that is favoured (fast). However, the disfavoured product may be observed, if no alternate reactions are more favoured.|$|R
25|$|The {{starting}} {{materials in the}} Piloty–Robinson pyrrole synthesis, named for Gertrude and Robert Robinson and Oskar Piloty, are two equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine. The product is a pyrrole with substituents at the 3 and 4 positions. The aldehyde reacts with the diamine to an intermediate di-imine (R–C=N−N=C–R). In the second step, a -sigmatropic rearrangement takes place between. Addition of hydrochloric acid leads to <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole. The mechanism {{was developed by the}} Robinsons.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem of oxidation is to replace the hydrogens ortho to the carbon-carbon double bond by groups that can not be removed during the oxidation. Following the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, the photochemical 6π cyclization takes place in a conrotatory fashion, leading to products with an anti configuration of the methyl substitutents. As both methyl groups are attached to a stereogenic center, two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) are formed, normally as a racemic mixture. This approach also has the advantage that the thermal (disrotatory) <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> can not take place because of steric hindrance between the substitution groups.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of reactive organometallics {{has become a}} vital part synthetic chemistry. Organosilanes potentially represent a cheap, robust, and environmentally benign precursor to reactive organometallics, but {{the nature of the}} very stable C−Si bond has generally prevented their use as precursors to more reactive organometallics. We present investigations into copper fluoride complexes which activate organosilanes in anhydrous media under mild conditions, effecting transmetalation to produce stable and in some cases isolable organocopper species containing sensitive functional groups including carbonyl groups, aryl bromides, benzylic chlorides, and alkyl ketones.
