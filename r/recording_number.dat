50|$|In {{contrast}} to his signature recordings during the RCA/BMG years (1996-2003), where much of his focus was on projects involving large ensembles, big bands and chamber orchestras, Harrell's more recent works demonstrate his skills {{as a leader of}} a tight, smaller unit. Harrell has made four albums with the current quintet of six years, which comprises tenor saxophonist Wayne Escoffery, pianist Danny Grissett, bassist Ugonna Okegwo who has performed with Harrell since 1997, and drummer Johnathan Blake. The group is noted for the strong chemistry between the musicians and the distinctive sound achieved primarily through Harrell's compositions. Harrell's current quintet differs from previous editions of quintets he has formed and worked with, in the use of Fender Rhodes and acoustic piano.

One of Paray's most renowned recordings, made in October 1957, {{is that of}} the Saint-Saëns' Symphony No. 3 in C minor [...] "Organ". The circumstances surrounding the recording were fortuitous. Paray had built the Detroit Symphony Orchestra into one of the world's most distinguished. Marcel Dupré, a friend and fellow student from childhood, was organist for the session. Dupré, as a young student, had pulled the organ stops for the composer Camille Saint-Saëns in a performance of the Symphony No. 3 in Paris, and the organ of Ford Auditorium in Detroit was well suited to the work. As well as being among the most authoritative readings of the work, the original analogue recording on the Mercury label remains an audiophile reference in vinyl, and the analogue-to-digital transfer produced by the original recording director Wilma Cozart for compact disc is also available from Mercury (<b>recording</b> <b>number</b> 432 719-2).|$|E

Methods: The design was a cross-sectional postal survey of 116 patients with collagenous colitis.

40|$|Several studies {{indicate}} health problems among hairdressers {{to be related}} to their chemical exposure at work. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the exposure of chemical compounds in the air of Spanish hairdresser salons, and to study differences between salons in central and suburban areas. Ten hairdresser salons were examined for two days, by <b>recording</b> <b>number</b> and type of customers, ventilation and size of salon. Both stationary and personal borne samples for organic compounds were collected, as well as stationary samples of ammonia. TVOC was calculated. Air temperature, relative humidity, CO and CO 2 were logged for 48 h in each salon. Fifty-six personal and 28 stationary samples were analysed for organic compounds. Thirty-five different air-borne compounds were found in the working environment of the hairdressers. All levels were well below the limit values in Spain and USA, both for ammonia and organic compounds. TVOC ranged from 48. 37 mg/m 3 to 237. 60 mg/m 3, meaning that many salons had levels above suggested comfort values of 25. There were only minor differences in exposure between central and suburban salons. No salons had ventilation systems, and the CO 2 was increasing during the day. The exposure was higher for several chemical compounds when hair dying was performed. Hairdressers were exposed to low air levels of a large number of chemical substances mostly related to work related to hair dying. There were no differences between exposure levels in salons in central and suburban areas.

40|$|Severe fetal acidemia during labour {{can result}} in life-lasting {{neurological}} deficits, but the timely detection of this condition is often not possible. This is because the positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, the mainstay of fetal health surveillance during labour, to detect concerning fetal acidemia is around 50 %. In fetal sheep model of human labour, we reported that severe fetal acidemia (pH, 7. 00) during repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCOs) is preceded, 60 minutes by the synchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) and FHR. However, EEG and FHR are cyclic and noisy, and although the synchronization might be visually evident, {{it is challenging to}} detect automatically, a necessary condition for bedside utility. Here we present and validate a novel non-parametric statistical method to detect fetal acidemia during labour by using EEG and FHR. The underlying algorithm handles non-stationary and noisy data by <b>recording</b> <b>number</b> of abnormal episodes in both EEG and FHR. A logistic regression is then deployed to test whether these episodes are significantly related to each other. We then apply the method in a prospective study of human labour using fetal sheep model (n = 20). Our results render a PPV of 68 % for detecting impending severe fetal acidemia, 60 min prior to pH drop to less than 7. 00 with 100 % negative predictive value. We conclude that this method has a great potential to improve PPV for detection of fetal acidemia when it is implemented at the bedside. We outline directions for further refinement of th...|$|E
40|$|The Egyptian Goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) is {{an exotic}} {{member of the}} Anatidae that has been {{residing}} in northwestern Arkansas since the 1980 s (Smith and James 2012). Following the discovery of Egyptian Geese in the area, not much {{attention has been given}} to the consequences of population increase. The Egyptian Goose has shown many diverse population growth patterns in areas where it has been introduced and started feral populations. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the current population size of the Egyptian Goose in northwestern Arkansas,and confirm successful breeding. The methods used in this study included conducting road surveys of suitable habitats for the Egyptian Goose, and <b>recording</b> <b>number</b> of adults, chicks, and other avian species interacting with the geese. Yearly densities, as well as monthly densities were compared between two years of data collection to determine population growth. The results showed a reasonably constant population size with relatively low breeding success. More study needs to be conducted on the breeding success of the Egyptian Goose, with radio tagging during the non-breeding season so that pairs can be more easily found during the breeding season. Along with looking at Egyptian Geese in northwestern Arkansas, data from the United States of America was analyzed to see if areas with Egyptian Geese are increasing in population size. The final recommendation of this study proposes that northwestern Arkansas is a dispersal point for the Egyptian Goose for more suitable habitats in surrounding areas, and should be eradicated from the area before the species follows other non-native species and becomes invasive...|$|E
40|$|Introduction  Inaccuracy in Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) /Casemix-based {{data has}} been {{reported}} as high as 26 %. This results in financial waste and makes effective audit impossible. We aimed to develop a novel web-based outcome audit system. Methods  A web-based online audit system, Patientsmate©, was developed using an integrated database system written in the programme language PHP. Data were inputted by the surgical team responsible for the patients care. A prospective comparison study of the new Patientsmate© and the standard HIPE systems, was performed over a 1 -month period and involving two general surgical teams in April 2010. In addition, a Likert-scale based questionnaire was designed and hosted within the Patientsmate© system. A focus group of those clinicians directly involved in data accessing and input were then invited to complete the questionnaire {{in order to assess}} usability of the system. Results  During the study period there were a total of 108 patients and 88 procedures. Our study confirms the accuracy of clinician derived data, with the Patientsmate© system more accurately <b>recording</b> <b>number</b> of patients (83 % vs. 80. 6 %), number of procedures (85. 2 % vs. 68. 1 %) and hospital day case rate (52 % vs. 47. 1 %).

Of those using the system, 75 % reported feeling comfortable after using it once only and 100 % were satisfied with the layout of the online interface. Conclusion  The Patientsmate© system allows for increased accuracy in outcome-based data as compared with the HIPE system, facilitating audit, financial savings and the appropriate allocation of services...|$|E
