On the one hand it concentrates the historical motive force of society; on the other hand, it disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e. it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man {{in the form of}} food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil...But by destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism...it compels its systematic restoration as a <b>regulative</b> <b>law</b> of social production, and in a form adequate to the full development of the human race...All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress toward ruining the more long-lasting sources of that fertility...Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that German {{agriculture}} is embedded in an intricate structure of <b>regulative</b> <b>law</b> {{for the protection of}} the environment, in the 1980 s, groundwater in some areas still contained high nitrate concentrations and revealed a lack of law enforcement. This especially held true for a federal state like Lower Saxony where more than two third of agricultural value added comes from animal production, and liquid manure application on the field is a considerable source for groundwater pollution. As a response and supplementary to <b>regulative</b> <b>law,</b> the “Co-operation Decree” (“Kooperationserlass”) as a basis for the so-called “Lower Saxon Co-operation Model” was issued. Its objective was to initiate the formation of locally adapted and goal orientated initiatives (socalled “groundwater co-operations”) among farmers, water suppliers and local administrations in order to find solutions which satisfy both, the protection of groundwater, as well as the profitability of agriculture. Since traditional forms of professional organisation in agricultural and environmental protection interest groups were transcended, stakeholders had to negotiate “face-to-face” and, for the case of farmers, had to find new forms of organisation within these groundwater co-operations. Furthermore, a sound moderation in the beginning of the co-operations' work was necessary. This brought private entities, engineering consultancies, in who, based on their technical expertise, at first mediated among conflicting parties, to then facilitate the joint development of groundwater protecting measures to be realised by farmers. The Co-operation Model's “water extraction fee” further guarantees financial compensation of farmers in cases of yield losses caused by measure implementation. After an at times difficult start, work in groundwater co-operations up until now shows that through opening up and cooperating with other stakeholders, agriculture can considerably develop and improve itself, and at the same time respond to emerging new societal demands. A case will exemplify that farmers made use of the co-operation in the course of time and extended it to other areas of their concern in order to improve their agricultural business. Furthermore, according to the so-called “Lower Saxon Co-operation Model”, agriculture is not just a producer of a maximum of yield. The protection of drinking water resources is seen as a further societal interest which can be realised through groundwater protecting measures developed in local co-operations. This approach was further developed with the granting of the project H 2 Ö. Here, a change to groundwater protecting agriculture is not “compensated” through subsidies, but H 2 Ö tries to integrate organic agriculture, as one form of groundwater protecting agriculture, in a market structure, as well as it tries to support the development of this structure. At the same time, with a reform of the Co-operation Model, the financial autonomy of groundwater co-operations and their responsibility for the realisation of measures will increase. It remains to be seen how this new responsibility of cooperations may reinforce identification and creativity on the part of farmers to further develop groundwater protecting agriculture...|$|E

40|$|I {{discuss how}} the scientificity characterizing Adam Smith’s {{political}} economy has to exteriorize social conflict {{in order to}} sustain its objectivation of social interaction in terms of <b>regulative</b> <b>laws.</b> I claim that this exteriorization constitutes an internal point of subversion, {{not only because it}} resists economic objectivation, but first and foremost because it forces Smith to employ political strategies that both contradict and guarantee the scientificity of his theory. I show how the place of conflict in modern economy, according to Smith, can actually be determined in three different ways: as a concrete place {{when it comes to the}} confrontations between workers and capitalists; as a theoretical place in the sense of being an arbitrary disturbance of the spontaneous organization of the market; and as a place that, as being the intersection between economic naturalization and social contingency, problematizes the scientificity of Smith’s political economy. In this sense, I develop three cases where Smith invokes an argumentative circularity that reveals the paradoxical politics of his economic scientificity, beyond its official laissez-faire politics: State coercion, monetary power and capitalist competition...|$|R
30|$|This {{study was}} {{informed}} by two theories of organizational behavior—institutional theory and stakeholder theory. Institutional theory posits that an organization must {{conform to the}} rules and belief systems that serve as the authoritative guidelines for social behavior in a given field in order to earn legitimacy (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Scott, 2004, 2005). Scott (2005) asserts that institutions are comprised of <b>regulative</b> (<b>laws,</b> regulations), normative (social prescriptions and obligations), and cultural-cognitive (shared cultural meanings or understanding) elements and that “all three elements are at work, albeit in varying ways, to stabilize social behavior” (p. 10) and the elements “may not be aligned, and one may undermine {{the effects of the}} other” (p. 11). Further, the dominance of any one element may vary across institutions as well as within institutions over time (Scott, 2005). Thus, organizations may engage in social behaviors, including CSR initiatives and reporting, for a variety of reasons, irrespective of their ethical beliefs (Holder-Webb et al., 2009). For instance, organizations may perceive that CSR initiatives are needed to establish competitive position as well as legitimacy. Further, institutional theory proposes selective disclosure of information that directs attention toward positive (and away from negative) behaviors and outcomes (Elsbach & Sutton, 1992; Meyer & Rowan, 1977).|$|R
40|$|In recent days, {{the need}} for {{systematically}} dealing with the challenges, which appear in relation to environment protection and sustainable development is ever more frequently pointed to. In {{the center of that}} problematics are climate changes and their effects. The work points out the fact that the climate is changing due to human activities, as well as the laws of nature which have been formulated by Milutin Milanković. In this regard, society should put organized work into eliminating the anthropogenic factors, while simultaneously adapting to the climate changes that are inevitable. The European Union has adopted a special Strategy for adaptation to climate changes. That document defines guidlines for development of public policies and operative measures in different areas. Similar (national) strategies have been adopted by certain countries. Efficient application of strategic documents and public policies is not possible without adequate legal <b>regulative.</b> <b>Law</b> traditionally comes late, as compared to social needs, including those related to reacting to climate changes and their effects. The work points out {{the need for}} civil law to be adapted to current trends. The author thinks that redifining the property rights are inevitable, and that it will be, due to climate changes, further restricted, in public interest, {{and for the sake of}} protection of existential interests of individuals and smaller social groups, alike. In this regard, thinkings of certain European and American authors on social function of that and other institutes of private law have been pointed out. In order for a higher level of social cohesion to be achieved in crisis situations, legal regulative should be harmonized with moral rules to a greater extent. Society should create a more just law, while individuals should apply it with more mutual understanding and solidarity. The author thinks that the traditional imission law should be transformed as well. Rules on imission should not be directed only to protection of private interests, but also to protection of public interests. In this regard, responsibility should not be bound only to unallowed influence on neighboring property, but should be expanded to cases in which someone emits into environment something that poses a threat to a wider community. The work also points out the need to more precisely regulate problems regarding erosion of soil, changing of water flows, servitudes, etc...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between emergent technology and the legal response to it. The focus is on the making of the Motor Car Act 1909 (Vic). It is shown that notwithstanding popular anxieties regarding the new 'motors', the Act did not reflect those concerns through speed limits and restrictions. Instead, the Act established a regulatory scheme that was largely pro-motoring. This dissociation between the community's concerns and the legislation is explained through emphasising other factors influencing the Act. In particular, it is suggested that the notion of progress through technology (legislating for the future) and the ideal of the <b>regulative</b> state (<b>law</b> as technology) went to the essence of the Act. The article concludes by suggesting that these factors are not just historical and particular to the motor vehicle, but can be identified in other legal responses to technological changeArts, Education & Law Group, School of LawFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This {{volume is}} {{concerned}} with the language used in legal discourse (English, German and French) in general, and with contract law in particular. Language, central to human affairs, assumes a particularly critical role in law. In fact, in a very basic sense, law would not exist without language. There are two primary functions of law; one is the ordering of human relations, the other the restoration of social order when order breaks down (see, e. g. Danet l 980, l 985). With regard to the former, the function of the <b>law</b> is two-fold: <b>regulative</b> and constitutive. <b>Law</b> defines and regulates relationships between judicial entities; and by means of law, new relations are created where none existed before (cf., e. g. marriage ceremonies). Language used in activities aimed at restoring social order unfolds in civil law in conflicts between individuals and in criminal law in conflicts between the individual and the state.

They can decide not to cooperate or provide some form of tax cooperation. Because of harmful tax competition among countries and efforts of international organizations, all {{countries in the world}} are oblidged to comply with one of multiple alternatives for tax cooperation. Situation in European Union (hereinafter EU) is specific. EU is not country or classic international organization. By the reason of its successful functioning, EU has need for tax cooperation. EU has attempted to harmonise tax policies of member states, but member states did not approve that. Only indirect taxes are harmonized on EU level, direct taxes are harmonized only to the point necessarily for functioning of single market. That is why tax cooperation instruments are so important.

Generelle Unterschiede in der institutionellen Organisation der jeweiligen politischen Ökonomie in Deutschland und in den USA führen zu unterschiedlichen Formen der Modernisierung des Vertragsrechts in beiden Ländern. Dies hat wichtige Auswirkungen auf den Typus der Innovationsentwicklung. Die spezifische Ausprägung des Institutionengefüges in Deutschland begünstigt vor allem eine kooperativ angelegte 'diversifizierte Qualitätsproduktion', an der mehrere Unternehmen beteiligt sind. Dies wird gestützt durch ein hochreguliertes Vertragsrecht und starke Gewerkschaften die Verbände nutzen das, um für alle Unternehmen geltende Regelungen zu entwickeln. In den USA ist die juristische Kompetenz, gerade was die Klärung juristischer Grundsatzfragen angeht, auf viele Unternehmen verteilt. Gewerkschaften haben nur geringe Möglichkeiten, die Gesetzgebung zu beeinflussen, und die Gerichte regulieren nicht, wie die Risiken bei der Zusammenarbeit von Unternehmen verteilt werden. Die rechtlichen 'Rahmungen' vertraglicher Vereinbarungen werden fallweise in Unternehmen entwickelt gerichtliche Musterentscheidungen passen sie dann Schritt für Schritt an die bestehenden gesetzlichen Regeln an.

" (Autorenreferat) "How are {{new forms}} of industrial organization accommodated into a country's legal frameworks, and what effect does this have {{on the ability of}} firms to innovate? Variations in the broad institutional organization of the German and US political economies result in different processes of contract law modernization in the two countries, with important implications for innovation trajectories. The German institutional infrastructure encourages firms to develop cooperative 'diversified quality production' (DQP) inter-firm strategies. This is promoted through highly <b>regulative</b> contract <b>laws</b> and the existence of strong trade associations that firms engage to create standardized industry frameworks. These contracting arrangements allow the diffusion of standardized governance structures showing firms how to create rules needed to manage complex {{new forms of}} organization. While strongly supporting DQP strategies and discouraging opportunistic product market strategies, German patterns of contract law regulation place important constraints against more innovative product market strategies. In the United States legal resources are decentralized across firms, trade associations have few law-making competencies, and courts do not regulate the distribution of risks across firms. Contractual frameworks are developed on a firm-by-firm basis and slowly accommodated within the legal system through the generation of court precedent. This system encourages radical innovation in the law, an important prerequisite for innovative product market strategies more generally. However, the paper shows that a necessary trade-off of legal innovation in the US is that courts cannot implement German-style contract law regulation to constrain opportunism, while the decentralization of legal resource inhibits the creation of standardized contractual frameworks needed for DQP strategies. Through an extensive game theory analysis of bargaining between courts and large firms, the paper explains why these equilibria are maintained, despite strong incentives in the German case for some large firms to deviate.

40|$|How is {{possible}} to manage many numerous risks, {{in order to achieve}} human as well as environmental wellbeing, and to form modern insurance industry? This issue is very modern and it requires rational answers. Also, this is field of scientific research. Research results are commonly used by <b>law</b> <b>regulative</b> as row model for the profession and practice. Is mentioned line we can identify challenges in insurance sector. What are the characteristics of these challenges in developed and developing countries? What is the behavior of countries that are liders and those that are not? What are financial components, and what are social and personal effects of the modern insurance industry development? Insurance sector always has its own clear mission: to achieve as high as possible level of spiritual and material safety of the person insured. The vision should be achieving as high as possible level of spiritual and material safety of the person insured in real environment. Mission and vision of the insurance continuously transformed industry from everyday human activity to modern industry. This trend can not be stopped, because we are able to identify more and more risks every day and their identification, processing and management is more challenging. Two components are very important: financial and social. Developed countries formed the insurance industry as powerful and respectful sector that is important part of financial market. Its users are hundreds of millions of citizens and companies. Financial effects of life insurance are much higher that those of non-life. Developing countries has no alternative than to follow, as quickly as they can, the developed countries path. That should make easier building own insurance industry. Globalization, controlled liberalization and all migration movements are additional and unavoidable factors that support insurance challenges. What is the suggestion for small, not enough developed countries as Bosnia and Herzegovina or all countries of ex-Yugoslavia? Basic scientific truths in this field are continuous: probability theory and great numbers law, actuarial calculus based on relevant empiric research. Insurance challenges start with actuarial calculus and data needed. That follows portfolio formulation and investment of temporarily available funds. That means participation of insurance companies at financial markets as financial intermediates.
