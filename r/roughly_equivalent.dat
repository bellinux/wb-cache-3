5|$|At Unicamp, {{academic}} {{studies are}} usually {{divided into four}} main areas: exact sciences (which includes formal and physical sciences), human sciences (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to social science, including Arts), biological sciences (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to life sciences) and technologies (including engineering and technical studies). This division reflects on how the university are structured how the campuses was designed.|$|E
5|$|The A-135 {{anti-ballistic missile}} system {{replaced}} the A-35, and is <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> of NIke-X.|$|E
5|$|The A-35 {{anti-ballistic missile}} system was a Soviet system <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the Nike Zeus.|$|E

5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent,</b> reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{national}} survey of drug use by the US Department of Health and Human Services concluded {{that the number of}} first-time psilocybin mushroom users in the United States was <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the number of first-time users of cannabis. In European countries, the lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults (15–34 years) range from 0.3% to 14.1%.|$|E
5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS). Although not technically a stealth aircraft {{in a comprehensive}} sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this is about 26ft² or 2.4m², <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the RCS of a small fighter aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Around Decimal Day, British Rail {{introduced}} the [...] "Superloo", improved public toilets that charged 2p (<b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of 6d.).|$|R

5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} {{his enthusiasm}} for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E
50|$|Juho Kusti Paasikivi (seventh President of Finland) {{graduated}} from Hämeenlinnan lyseon lukio (Hämeenlinnan lyseon lukio is Hämeenlinna Lyseo Upper secondary school, <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of a US highschool).|$|R

5000|$|Likewise, {{the term}} Freiherr in [...] "Kurt Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord" [...] is now also a name element, {{and not a}} title. Freiherr was <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of [...] "Baron".|$|R
5|$|Day and Foxe {{completed}} a second {{edition of the}} Book of Martyrs in 1570. It was even larger than the first—a total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes—and at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had to paste smaller sheets together to make do. This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} release the film earned $33.6 million in North American theater rentals (the distributor's {{share of the}} box office), {{generating}} approximately $74.7 million in box office sales. Outside of North America, it earned $32.5 million in rentals (about $72.2 million at the box office) for a worldwide total of $66.1 million in rental earnings, <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to $146.9 million in box office receipts. It was the fastest-grossing film {{as well as the}} highest-grossing film of 1959, in the process becoming the second-highest-grossing film of all-time (at that time) behind Gone with the Wind. Ben-Hur saved MGM from financial disaster, making a profit of $20,409,000 on its initial release, and another $10.1 million in profits when re-released in 1969. By 1989, Ben-Hur had earned $90 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.|$|E
5|$|His brother Joseph, who was 24 years older, {{acted as}} a {{surrogate}} father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory, a school operated by the Dominican Order in Washington County, Kentucky. At the time, {{he was the only}} Protestant student at the school. In 1818 Davis returned to Mississippi, studying at Jefferson College at Washington. Three years later in 1821, he returned to Kentucky, where he studied at Transylvania University in Lexington. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to high schools.) His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Bai Juyi often {{referred}} to himself in life as Letian (Wade-Giles: Lo-t'ien), <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of [...] "happy-go-lucky". Later in life, he referred to himself as the Hermit of Xiangshan.|$|R
50|$|The stellar {{wind from}} this supergiant is {{expelling}} matter {{from the star}} {{at the rate of}} 1.55 × 10−6 solar masses per year, or <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> to the Sun's mass every 640,000 years.|$|R
5000|$|Nodes {{represent}} entities such as people, businesses, accounts, or {{any other}} item to be tracked. They are <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of the record, relation, or row in a relational database, or the document in a document database.|$|R
5|$|In 1755, Kościuszko began {{attending}} school in Lyubeshiv, but never finished {{due to his}} family's financial straits after his father's death in 1758. Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski established a Corps of Cadets (Korpus Kadetów) in 1765, at what is now Warsaw University, to educate military officers and government officials. Kościuszko enrolled in the Corps on December 18, 1765, likely thanks to the patronage of the Czartoryski family. The school emphasized military subjects and the liberal arts, and after graduating on December 20, 1766, Kościuszko was promoted to chorąży (a military rank <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to modern lieutenant); he stayed on as a student instructor and by 1768 had attained the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|In late August, the 7th Battalion, with a {{frontage}} {{equal to}} just over half its authorised strength, was transferred to Ypres, in Belgium, where they manned trenches near the Ypres–Commines canal. During this time they {{were not involved in}} any major attacks, however, each night they sent patrols out into no man's land and established listening posts to gather intelligence. On 30 September, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke with a force <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to two platoons. The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing a section of the German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing.|$|E
5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E
50|$|The clasps {{are awarded}} for gallantry to {{any member of}} the French {{military}} or its allies and are, depending on the degree, <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> for U.S. Bronze Star and Silver Star or UK Military Cross and Military Medal.|$|R
2500|$|Known {{variously}} as the [...] "Conseil privé" [...] or [...] "Conseil d'État privé", or [...] "Conseil des parties", the Privy Council was {{the main}} body for decisions on France's judicial system, and as such it was <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of today's Conseil d'État.|$|R
50|$|He {{had studied}} in the Scientific Research Institute of {{industrial}} and building materials USSR during 1982 and 1985 for the post-graduate work on his dissertation in Economics which he defended in 1985 receiving the degree of Candidate of Science (<b>roughly</b> Ph.D. <b>equivalent).</b>|$|R
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Milne Bay (25 August– 7 September 1942), {{also known}} as Operation RE or the Battle of Rabi (ラビの戦い) by the Japanese, was a battle of the Pacific {{campaign}} of World War II. Elite Japanese naval troops, known as Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai (Special Naval Landing Forces), with two small tanks attacked the Allied airfields at Milne Bay that had been established on the eastern tip of New Guinea. Due to poor intelligence work, the Japanese miscalculated {{the size of the}} predominantly Australian garrison and, believing that the airfields were only defended by two or three companies, initially landed a force <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> in size to one battalion on 25 August 1942. The Allies, forewarned by intelligence from Ultra, had heavily reinforced the garrison.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the exhaust}} from the P&W R-4360 was ducted {{straight}} {{out of the back of}} the nacelles. This provided additional thrust. Research showed that <b>roughly</b> 250 <b>equivalent</b> horsepower was generated by each engine exhaust during high speed cruise at 40,000 ft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, it is <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of a {{bilateral}} contract {{and may be}} contrasted with a gift (as such a relationship {{is not one of}} contract) or a unilateral contract in which only one party makes an enforceable promise.|$|R
5000|$|Known {{variously}} as the [...] "Conseil privé" [...] or [...] "Conseil d'État privé", or [...] "Conseil des parties", the Privy Council was {{the main}} body for decisions on France's judicial system, and as such it was <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> of today's Conseil d'État.|$|R
