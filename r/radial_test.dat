40|$|Increased Distributed Generation (DG) {{presence}} on radial distribution feeders {{is becoming a}} common trend. The existing Overcurrent Protection (OCP) scheme on such feeders consists mainly of overcurrent protection devices (OCPDs) such as fuses and reclosers. When DG {{is placed on the}} remote end of a 3 -phase lateral, the radial configuration of the feeder is lost. As a result, OCP issues may arise which lead to permanent outages even when the fault is temporary. This thesis presents a new approach that revises the existing OCP scheme of a radial feeder to address the presence of DG. The fuses on the laterals with DGs are removed and multifunction recloser/relays (MFRs) are added to address three specific OCP issues; fuse fatigue, nuisance fuse blowing, and fuse misoperation. The new approach requires no communication medium, provides backup protection for the DG unit, and allows the remaining laterals to retain their existing protective devices. The results are reported using the IEEE 34 node <b>radial</b> <b>test</b> feeder to validate the new approach and the IEEE 123 node <b>radial</b> <b>test</b> feeder to generalize the approach. The new approach completely mitigated the fuse misoperation and nuisance fuse blowing issues and most of the fuse fatigue issues that were present on the <b>radial</b> <b>test</b> feeders. Specifically, the approach demonstrates that coordination between the existing protection devices on radial distribution feeders is maintained in the presence of DG...|$|E

Such objectives include loss reduction, weighted consensus of phase angle deviations, oscillations in nodal frequency, and other graphical metrics. The framework is then used to study the problem of optimal topology design for robust control goals of different grids. For radial grids, the problem is shown as equivalent to the hard "optimum communication spanning tree" problem in graph theory and a combinatorial topology construction is presented with bounded approximation gap.

40|$|The {{intent of}} power {{distribution}} companies (DISCOs) is to deliver electric power {{to their customers}} in an efficient and reliable manner – with minimal energy loss cost. One major way to minimise power loss on a given power system is to install distributed generation (DG) units on the distribution networks.

A significative response of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies against the S-LPS antigen was evident in sera from the rabbits orogastrically infected with pYV+ strains.

In contrast, few differences were observed in the titers and evolution of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against the S-LPS antigen in rabbits intravenously infected with pYV+ and pYV- strains.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method to}} perform {{distribution}} grid power flow calculations using stochastic load profiles and meteorological data {{is presented in}} this paper. The method is based on two previously presented algorithms: The first algorithm generates stochastic household load profiles and the second generates stochastic irradiance data, both using a sampling rate of one minute. Applying this data to an electrical power distribution grid containing {{a significant number of}} photovoltaic systems, realistic power flow and system voltage scenarios are obtained. The results are used to precisely answer a broad range of questions concerning grid integration of photovoltaic systems. The main purpose is to find the maximum photovoltaic power which can be installed in a given distribution grid and to evaluate different measures to raise this limit, such as respecting the correlation between irradiance and loads, active power curtailment, reactive power control or power management algorithms. In contrast to previous works, this paper not only addresses certain situations such as best or worst case scenarios, but also analyses the entire range of possible outcomes in Monte Carlo style simulations. Unacceptable situations in the power grid (e. g. overvoltages) can be quantified in probability of occurrence, time of day and their durations.

40|$|Due to the {{expected}} increase in penetration levels of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), the demand {{on the distribution}} power grid {{is expected to rise}} significantly during PEV charging. However, as PEV charging in many cases may not be time critical, they are suitable for load management tasks where the power consumption of PEVs is controlled to support the grid. Additionally, PEVs may also be enabled to inject power into the grid to lower peak demand or counteract the influence of intermittent renewable energy generation, such as that produced by solar photovoltaic panels. Further, PEV active rectifiers can be used to balance reactive power in a local area if required, to reduce the necessity for long distance transport of reactive power. To achieve these objectives, we adapt a known distributed algorithm, Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease, to control both the active and reactive power consumption and injection. Here, we present this algorithm in a unified framework and illustrate the flexibility of the algorithm to accommodate different user objectives. We illustrate this with three scenarios, including a domestic scenario and a workplace scenario. In these scenarios the various objectives allow us to define a type of "fairness" for how the PEVs should adapt their power consumption, i. e. equal charging rates, or charging rates based on energy requirements. We then validate the algorithms by simulations of a simple <b>radial</b> <b>test</b> network. The simulations presented use the power simulation tool OpenDSS interlinked with MATLAB...|$|E
40|$|The disk {{instability}} {{mechanism for}} giant planet formation {{is based on}} the formation of clumps in a marginally-gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disk, which must lose thermal energy through a combination of convection and radiative cooling if they are to survive and contract to become giant protoplanets. While there is good observational support for forming at least some giant planets by disk instability, the mechanism has become theoretically contentious, with different three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics codes often yielding different results. Rigorous code testing is required to make further progress. Here we present two new analytical solutions for radiative transfer in spherical coordinates, suitable for testing the code employed in all of the Boss disk instability calculations. The testing shows that the Boss code radiative transfer routines do an excellent job of relaxing to and maintaining the analytical results for the radial temperature and radiative flux profiles for a spherical cloud with high or moderate optical depths, including the transition from optically thick to optically thin regions. These <b>radial</b> <b>test</b> results are independent of whether the Eddington approximation, diffusion approximation, or flux-limited diffusion approximation routines are employed. The Boss code does an equally excellent job of relaxing to and maintaining the analytical results for the vertical (theta) temperature and radiative flux profiles for a disk with a height proportional to the radial distance. These tests strongly support the disk instability mechanism for forming giant planets. Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures. ApJ, accepte...|$|E

This paper describes a probability model for prediction of fatigue failures of aluminum disc wheels, which intends to better link the prediction using simulation results with historical test data. Finite element models of 54 aluminum wheels, which are already physically tested, are constructed to simulate the dynamic cornering fatigue test. Their mean stresses and stress amplitudes during the fatigue loading cycle are calculated and plotted on a two-dimensional plane. Matching with historical test data, the failure probability contour can be drawn. For a new wheel, the failure probability of dynamic cornering fatigue test can be read directly from this probability contour. The test result of the new wheel can be added into the set of historical test data and the failure probability contour is updated.
