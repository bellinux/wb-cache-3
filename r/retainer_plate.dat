40|$|Translating {{a desired}} user’s input using Conventional {{methods such as}} a {{keyboard}} and mouse for the computer, or a joystick for a wheelchair, is a major challenge faced by users whom have no limb control. This paper describes an iteration of Resistopalatography, a method using the tongue as a pointing device to emulate {{the use of the}} hand for cursor movement and wheelchair control. The system employs force sensitive sensors located within the mouth on a dental <b>retainer</b> <b>plate</b> to measure the tongue’s pressure against the hard palate. The position and force of the tongue against the sensors can be translated into mouse cursor or wheelchair joystick equivalents...|$|E
40|$|A {{stationary}} {{model is}} adopted {{to determine the}} criticalcondition for which the slipper {{moves away from the}} swashplatein an axial piston machine. The aim of the analysis is to find thecritical speed, i. e. the value of the machine speed for which theslipper moves away from the swashplate; usually this conditionmay determine bad operating behaviour of the machine, althougha <b>retainer</b> <b>plate</b> is used to maintain the slipper sufficiently near tothe swashplate. The influences of the pressure transition in the cylinder, theswashplate angle and the radial clearance between piston andcylinder on the critical speed are depicted. Successively, the roleof the position of the point of application of the resultant forcedue to the slipper-retaining plate contact is analyzed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Evaluate {{resistance}} of Hawley retainers {{in three different}} acrylic configurations in order to evaluate if its format or the addition of internal wire interferes in its resistance. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 45 Hawley retainers were fabricated, divided into three groups (n = 15) : Group 1 - acrylic covering the entire hard palate, Group 2 - plate with relief at the deepest region of the palate, leaving it with a "U" conformation and Group 3 - similar to Group 2, {{with the addition of}} 0. 7 mm wire 2 cm internally of the acrylic at the region of the palatine ridges. The compressive strength was tested in a universal mechanical testing machine (Stable Microsystems, London, United Kingdom), measuring the applied force until plate rupture occurred. The differences between the formats being compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The significance level was set at 5 % (&# 945; = 0. 05). RESULT: Group 1 showed the highest resistance, with a mean of about five times higher than Group 2 and three times higher than Group 3. CONCLUSION: acrylic reduction in dental <b>retainer</b> <b>plates</b> {{is directly related to the}} reduction of its compressive strength, the inclusion of orthodontic wire inside the acrylic increases the {{resistance of}} the plate, being a good alternative when more comfort is wanted for the patient without loss of the mechanical characteristics of the dental retainers...|$|R
40|$|Final {{activities}} are reported for gamma ray emitting isotopes measured in 35 samples from LDEF. In 26 steel trunnion samples, activities of Mn- 54 and Co- 57 were measured and limits set on other isotopes. In five Al end support <b>retainer</b> <b>plates</b> and two Al keel plate samples, Na- 22 was measured. In two Ti clip samples, Na- 22 was measured, limits for Sc- 46 were obtained, and high activities for impurity Uranium and daughter isotopes were observed. Four sets of depth vs activity profiles were measured for the D {{sections of the}} trunnion. For all 4 profiles, the activities first decreased with increasing distance {{from the surface of}} the trunnion but were fairly flat near the center. These profiles are consistent with production by both the lower energy (approx. 100 MeV) trapped particles and high energy (approx. 10 GeV) galactic-cosmic ray particles. For the near surface samples, the earth quadrant had more Mn- 54 than the space quadrant. For the D sections, there was less Mn- 54 in the east trunnion than in the west trunnion. Comparisons are made among the samples and with activities measured by others. The limit for Sc- 46 in the Ti clips is compared with the activities of Mn- 54 produced in the steel pieces by similar reactions. Activities predicted by several models are compared with the measured activities...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-six {{stainless}} steel trunnion samples, five aluminum end support <b>retainer</b> <b>plate</b> samples, two aluminum keel plate samples, and two titanium clips were analyzed. The shielded high purity germanium detectors used had efficiencies of 33, 54, and 80 pcts. at 1332 keV. Detector efficiencies {{as a function}} of energy and corrections for self absorption in the samples were determined with calibrated sources, unactivated control samples, and calculations. Several measurements were made on most samples. In the trunnion samples, Mn- 54 and Co- 57 were seen and limits were obtained for other isotopes. The results agree well with 1 -D activation calculations for an anisotropic trapped proton model. In the aluminum samples, Na- 22 and Be- 7 were seen. Other results are presented...|$|E
40|$|The pyrogen igniter has the {{function}} to furnish a controlled, high temperature, high pressure gas to ignite solid propellant surfaces in a rocket motor. Present pyrogens consist of numerous inert components. The Standard Molded Pyrogen Igniter (SMPI) {{consists of three}} basic parts, a cap with several integrally molded features, an ignition pellet <b>retainer</b> <b>plate,</b> and a tube with additional integrally molded features. A description is presented of an investigation which indicates that the SMPI concept is a viable approach to the design and manufacture of pyrogen igniters for solid propellant rocket motors. For some applications, combining the structural and thermal properties of molded composites can result {{in the manufacture of}} lighter assemblies at considerable cost reduction.

40|$|This report, {{presented}} in three volumes, provides {{the results of}} a two-motor Delta Qualification 2 program conducted in 1993 to certify the following enhancements for incorporation into booster separation motor (BSM 0 flight hardware: vulcanized-in-place nozzle aft closure insulation; new iso-static ATJ bulk graphite throat insert material, adhesive EA 9394 for bonding the nozzle throat, igniter grain rod/centering insert/igniter case; deletion of the igniter adapter insulator ring; deletion of the igniter adapter/igniter case interface RTV; and deletion of loctite from igniter <b>retainer</b> <b>plate</b> threads. The enhancements above directly resulted from (1) the BSM total quality management (TQM) team initiatives to enhance the BSM producibility, and (2) the necessity to qualify new throat insert and adhesive systems to replace existing materials that will not be available. Testing was completed at both the component and motor levels. Component testing was accomplished to screen candidate materials (e. g., throat materials, adhesive systems) and to optimize processes (e. g., aft closure insulator vulcanization approach) prior to their incorporation into the test motors. Motor testing [...] consisting of two motors, randomly selected by USBI's on-site quality personnel from production lot AAY, which were modified to accept the enhancements [...] was completed to provide the final qualification of the enhancements for incorporation into flight hardware. Volume 3, Book 2 provides various supporting documentation to the previous volumes with regards to the testing of the two Delta qualification units: data acceptance records, thermal conditioning analysis, igniter adapter thermal flake analysis, laboratory adhesive (EA- 9394) qualification report, throat insert thermal/structural analysis, Delta Qualification Nonconformance Reports (NCR's), O-ring seating tests, and interim test report for vulcanization process qualification...|$|E

40|$|We treated a 21 -year-old {{woman with}} a severe open bite and {{macroglossia}} with a standard edgewise appliance and without partial glossectomy. This was followed by retention using a Begg-type <b>plate</b> <b>retainer</b> for the upper dental arch and a fixed canine-to-canine for the lower arch. A crib {{was added to the}} upper <b>plate</b> <b>retainer</b> for suppression of a tongue thrust. The lower arch relapsed during the retention period, with a widening of the intermolar distance, flaring of the anterior teeth, and increased mobility of the teeth. We chose tongue reduction to resolve these problems and one-third of the middle dorsal part of the tongue was excised. After the tongue reduction, the patient experienced no functional problem in mastication, swallowing, and gustation, but she complained of mild speech difficulty and slight pain on the dorsal portion of her tongue. These symptoms disappeared 6 months after surgery. At this time, the mandibular dental arch was markedly improved. The flared lower dental arch had returned to an upright position and the tooth mobility reduced to normal. No appliance was used after surgery. Most of the recovery changes occurred within 4 months. This case highlights the importance of the teeth tending to move toward a balance between the tongue pressure from the inside and labio-buccal pressure from the outside...|$|R
40|$|Retention is {{required}} {{in the majority of}} orthodontic patients throughout the remainder of their life. The traditional Hawley style retainer is still considered by many orthodontic professionals to be the gold standard in retention appliances. The orthodontic population, in general, is at a higher risk for caries due to plaque accumulation from poor diet, suboptimal oral hygiene, and often a lack of motivation. A Hawley retainer that reduces caries-causing oral microbes could improve oral health and be very beneficial to the post-orthodontic patient. Developing methods to safely include antibacterial products within the Hawley <b>retainer’s</b> base <b>plate</b> material could help effect these improvements and prove to be an additional incentive for continued, regular wear of orthodontic retainers. The oral bacteria most commonly associated with caries formation, Streptococcus mutans, was chosen to study its biofilm formation on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) that is used in the fabrication of traditional Hawley retainers. Biofilm formation was evaluated using a drip flow reactor system followed by staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and morphology analysis. Growth was assessed on four material types: PMMA, PMMA with silver, PMMA with a novel antibacterial agent, CZ- 99, and PMMA with silver and CZ- 99. SEM images were analyzed using a combination of software products including Fiji (Image J), Matlab and MountainMaps 3 D generating software (Digital Surf) to determine percentage area coverage and compared between samples. PMMA that contained silver prevented biofilm growth to the greatest degree. However, although biofilm formation was more pronounced on PMMA infused with CZ- 99 a combination of CZ- 99 and silver, it was found that this was likely due to poor cross-linkage of the polymer that allowed the antimicrobials to elute out fully. In conclusion, results demonstrated significant reduction in biofilm formation in silver infused PMMA. Outcomes provided a compelling argument that the drip flow system and materials could be investigated further to determine if antibacterial PMMA can be used safely in the oral environment and explore their effectiveness in reducing biofilm formation. Future work with in vivo testing would be particularly beneficial...|$|R
