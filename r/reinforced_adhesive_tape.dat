40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{accuracy}} of three copro-microscopic techniques for helminth diagnosis: Kato-Katz, <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> and FLOTAC. A total of 163 children from a peri-urban municipality near Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, participated and submitted multiple stool samples and <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> Ninety children supplied at least two stool samples and two <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> Three stool samples and three <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> were available from 71 and 64 children, respectively. From each stool sample, a single Kato-Katz thick smear was prepared and examined quantitatively. Additionally, the first stool sample was subjected to the FLOTAC technique and helminth eggs were counted. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> were checked for the presence of Enterobius vermicularis eggs. Using pooled results as a diagnostic 'gold' standard, the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, E. vermicularis, Hymenolepis nana and Dicrocoelium dendriticum were 54. 4 %, 13. 3 %, 11. 1 % and 11. 1 %, respectively. Infection intensities were low. When compared to triplicate Kato-Katz, a single FLOTAC was more sensitive for the diagnosis of A. lumbricoides (89. 5 % versus 39. 5 %) and D. dendriticum (88. 9 % versus 33. 3 %), but less sensitive for H. nana (66. 7 % versus 88. 9 %). For E. vermicularis, three <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> showed much higher sensitivity than a single FLOTAC (92. 9 % versus 14. 3 %). FLOTAC yielded significantly higher faecal egg counts than Kato-Katz for A. lumbricoides and D. dendriticum.

Needles peel off an IC chip with an adhesive film from the base material in the pick-up process, by sticking out the backside of the base material. In {{the case that the}} peeling forces of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> decrease as the peeling speeds increase in peeling tests, only two kinds of behaviors were observed in pick-up test; the peeling propagated little and the IC chip was not peeled off under critical needle displacement while the pick-up was completed instantaneously over critical needle displacement. In the case that the peeling forces of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> increase as the peeling speeds increase, the pick-up time decreased as the needle displacement increased. As a result, it can be concluded that the needle displacement where the peeling propagates instantaneously is critical for succeeded pick-up if the peeling forces of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> decrease as the peeling speeds increase. If the peeling forces of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> increase as the peeling speeds increase, the information of peeling speeds at each needle displacement are needed to estimate {{how long it takes to}} pick-up a chip...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the effect of 2 different friction blister treatment regimens, wide area fixation dressing versus <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape.</b> DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: The 2015 Nijmegen Four Days Marches in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2907 participants (45 ± 16 years, 52 % men) were included and received 4131 blister treatments. INTERVENTIONS: Blisters were treated with either a wide area fixation dressing or <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time of treatment application was our primary outcome. In addition, effectiveness and satisfaction were evaluated in a subgroup (n = 254). During a 1 -month follow-up period, blister healing, infection and the need for additional medical treatment were assessed in the subgroup. RESULTS: Time of treatment application was lower (41. 5 minutes; SD = 21. 6 minutes) in the wide area fixation dressing group compared with the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> group (43. 4 minutes; SD = 25. 5 minutes; P = 0. 02). Furthermore, the wide area fixation dressing group demonstrated a significantly higher drop-out rate (11. 7 % vs 4. 0 %, P = 0. 048), delayed blister healing (51. 9 % vs 35. 3 %, P = 0. 02), and a trend toward lower satisfaction (P = 0. 054) when compared with the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> group. CONCLUSIONS: Wide area fixation dressing decreased time of treatment application by 2 minutes (4. 5 %) when compared with <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape.</b> However, because of lower effectiveness and a trend toward lower satisfaction, we do not recommend the use of wide area fixation dressing over <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> in routine first-aid treatment for friction blisters...|$|R
40|$|The tissue {{microarray}} (TMA) technique allows multiple {{tissue samples}} {{in a single}} block.

The objective {{of this study was to}} compare loss of sections adhered to slides using commercial <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> versus using silanized only slides. TMA was constructed with varying tissues using a fixed-base device (Beecher Instruments), placing 108 cylinders of 1 mm diameter in duplicate, spaced 1. 2 mm apart. Section of 4 mu m were cut from the TMA block and adhered to 30 silanized slides and 30 commercial glass slides using <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape,</b> according to manufacturer`s recommendations. Vimentin immunoexpression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Antigenic recovery was realized in citrate buffer using a microwave oven. Cylinder loss in the immunohistochemical process was quantified and expressed as: total (> 80 %), almost complete (75 - 79 %), or partial (50 - 74 %). The commercial <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> group presented lesser total loss (1. 1 versus 6. 4 %), almost complete loss (2. 2 versus 3. 5 %), and partial loss (2. 1 versus 3. 8 %) than the silanized slide group (ANOVA, P < 0. 05). The sum of total and almost complete losses in the silanized slide group was 9. 9 %, greater than the losses in slides using commercial <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> (3. 3 %) and less than reported and considered acceptable in the literature (10 - 30 %). In conclusion, the use of silanized only slides presents very satisfactory results, requires less training, and reduces costs significantly, thus justifying their use in research...|$|R

Unlike the thaw-mounted method, MSI results with undistorted location information of fatty acids and phospholipids present in the corn seed tissue were acquired when the corn seed tissue was mounted using <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape.</b> This was achieved without contamination of the embedding substance gelatin.
