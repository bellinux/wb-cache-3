5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is <b>rough</b> <b>pasture.</b> One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequence}} of Letters then relate {{the history of}} the priors of Selborne, until Letter 24 which relates the takeover of the priory by Magdalen College, Oxford under bishop William Waynflete in 1459. White describes this as a disastrous fall: [...] "Thus fell the considerable and well-endowed priory of Selborne after it had subsisted about two hundred and fifty-four years; about seventy-four years after the suppression of priories alien by Henry V., and about fifty years before the general dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII." [...] The final letter records that [...] "No sooner did the priory [...]. become an appendage to the college, but it must at once have tended to swift decay." [...] White notes that since then, even [...] "the very foundations have been torn up for the repair of the highways" [...] so that nothing is left but a <b>rough</b> <b>pasture</b> [...] "full of hillocks and pits, choaked with nettles, and dwarf-elder, and trampled by the feet of the ox and the heifer". White had reason to be bitter about the takeover by Magdalen College, as it had made them Lords of the Manor of Selborne, which in turn gave them the right to appoint the parish priest. White's biographer Richard Mabey casts doubt on the [...] "frequent assumption" [...] that White's [...] "deepest regret was that he could never be vicar of Selborne", but it was true that he was ineligible, as only fellows of Magdalen could be granted the living.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the land}} was cleared, it was burnt in May and planted immediately. [...] Planting the potatoes, cucumbers, corn and {{pumpkins}} was hard work since the soil often had many rocks and roots requiring the most effective tool: a sharp stick. [...] Turnip and grain seed was sown by hand and covered with soil scratched up by the [...] "burnt-land harrow" [...] made from the crotch of a tree with protruding spikes. [...] This ox drawn harrow was triangular with spikes slanted toward the back {{so as not to}} get stuck between the stumps and rocks. [...] For a year or two after the burn, the Wiles and Hirtles would have enjoyed the rich ash-filled, weed-free soil. [...] Michael Wile refers to this kind of land when he said he wore his new moose skin trousers [...] "in the burnt land" [...] (Desbrisay, 1895). [...] After two or three years, the crops were rotated to another piece of burnt land leaving the depeated soil either for <b>rough</b> <b>pasture</b> or the seeding down to hay (Martin, 1974).|$|E

A green bank and a straggling line of stones, some fallen in large masses and some standing two or three feet high, presently stretched across their path, and Foster stopped for a few moments.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{changes in}} the landscape of a sector of Upper Franconia (Bavaria, Germany) by comparing land use changes over four time periods (1850, 1900, 1960, 2000). Geodetic and other data derived from the Bavarian real estate tax and land register were entered into various temporal layers of a land register-based vector GIS. This multitemporal GIS permits a precise analysis of the historical structure and development of landscapes {{on the basis of}} land plots. In 1850, the study area was almost exclusively agricultural in structure. Woodlands made up only 18 % of the total surface. <b>Rough</b> <b>pastures</b> and wastelands, which covered about 9 % of the total surface, were used for grazing. During {{the first half of the}} 20 th century, the proportion of wooded areas increased considerably. The <b>rough</b> <b>pastures</b> that had formerly been a typical feature of the region nearly disappeared during this period. Agricultural use declined to less than 50 % of the total area. In the course of the period between 1960 and 2000, the livestock industry has become an almost exclusively indoor activity. Village development has started spilling over into the adjacent fields. The causes and background of these changes are discussed in detail. From an ecological standpoint, the land use categories surveyed in this analysis of landscape change can be regarded as vegetation types, thereby constituting habitats for specialized biota.

60|$|Among {{the smaller}} {{vegetable}} ornaments must be reckoned the bilberry, a ground plant, never so beautiful as in early spring, {{when it is}} seen under bare or budding trees, that imperfectly intercept the tomb-stone covering the rocky knolls with a pure mantle of fresh verdure, more lively than the herbage of the open fields;--the broom, that spreads luxuriantly along <b>rough</b> <b>pastures,</b> and {{in the month of}} June interveins the steep copses with its golden blossoms;--and the juniper, a rich evergreen, that thrives in spite of cattle, upon the uninclosed parts of the mountains:--the Dutch myrtle diffuses fragrance in moist places; and there is an endless variety of brilliant flowers in the fields and meadows, which, if the agriculture of the country were more carefully attended to, would disappear. Nor can I omit again to notice the lichens and mosses: their profusion, beauty, and variety, exceed those of any other country I have seen.|$|R

500|$|Saudi Arabia {{has three}} {{categories}} of land: developed land (amir), undeveloped land (mawat), and [...] "protective zones" [...] (harim). Developed land comprises the built environment of towns and villages and agriculturally developed land, and can be bought, sold and inherited by individuals. The undeveloped land comprises <b>rough</b> grazing, <b>pasture</b> and wilderness. <b>Rough</b> grazing and <b>pasture</b> is owned in common and everyone has equal rights to its use. The wilderness {{is owned by the}} state and may be open to everyone unless specific restrictions are imposed. Harim land is a protective buffer between the owned land and the undeveloped land, and is defined, {{in the case of a}} town, as the area that can be reached and returned from in a day for the purposes of collecting fuel and pasturing livestock.|$|R

50|$|In the {{comparatively}} less incised region {{to the west}} which is characterised by large differences in height there are several nature reserves: the Rohrhardsberg-Upper Elz reserves and the two neighbouring reserves to the west, Yacher Zinken and Kostgefäll. The entire region is designated as a Natura 2000 area. On the ridge of the plateau between the Schwedenschanze on the Rohrhardsberg and the Brend are habitats for the capercaillie and hazel grouse and other, in some cases very rare, animal and plant species. For this reason {{it was agreed that}} in the Rohrhardsberg model project, only a narrow axis between the Brend and the Schwedenschanze would be used for sporting and tourist purposes and large areas would be left largely undisturbed. Several other areas would continue to be extensively grazed, because a purely mechanistic approach of leaving the few remaining <b>rough</b> <b>pastures</b> to grow wild would make no sense either for economic or for ecological reasons. This project is a successful cooperation between conservation agencies, the forestry commission, municipalities and various user groups.|$|R

60|$|The {{afternoon}} was {{drawing to a}} close when Andrew, Olcott, and a friend of the latter's, carrying guns and spread out in line, entered a stretch of <b>rough,</b> boggy <b>pasture</b> near the river. Clumps of reeds and rushes grew along the open drains, water gleamed among the grass, and the bare trees on the high bank across the stream stood out sharp and black against a glow of saffron light. The men were wet to the knees, and a white setter, splashed with mire, trotted in front of them. Murray, Olcott's friend, who was on Andrew's right, sprang across a broad drain and laughed when he alighted.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{the area was}} {{identified}} as suitable for environmental management {{as it had been}} untenanted for several years, and as <b>rough</b> grazing <b>pasture</b> it was a rich and scarce ecological habitat which also had recreational potential. An archeological survey identified a pre-Roman landscape pattern, possibly dating back to the Bronze Age. In 2002-03 4.5 hectares was planted as woodland, and a tenant was found to manage the land for grazing. The 42 hectare site had previously had no public access, but an area of 5.5 hectares is now public open space, with a bridle way which connects with Arkley Lane, a Local Nature Reserve in Barnet. There is also public access from Galley Lane.|$|R
