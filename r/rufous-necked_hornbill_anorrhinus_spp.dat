50|$|None of the African {{species of}} {{hornbills}} are seriously threatened, but many Asian hornbills {{are threatened by}} hunting and habitat loss, as they tend to require primary forest. Among these threatened species, only the plain-pouched <b>hornbill</b> and <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> are found on the Asian mainland; all others are insular in their distribution. In the Philippines alone, one species (the Palawan hornbill) is vulnerable, and two species (the Mindoro and Visayan hornbills) are endangered. The only critically endangered hornbills, the rufous-headed hornbill and the Sulu hornbill, are also restricted to the Philippines. The latter species {{is one of the}} world's rarest birds, with only 20 breeding pairs or 40 mature individuals, and faces imminent extinction. The Ticao hornbill, a subspecies of the Visayan hornbill, is probably already extinct.|$|R
40|$|Hornbill has an {{important}} role in forest regeneration, but the limited variety andamount of food available to birds will eventually threaten the population of hornbills. Identification of feed plant and hornbil species diversity was conducted at the HarapanRainforest from March to April 2011. Hornbills plant feed samples were taken right after thebirds were eating. The results showed there are nine plant species of hornbills feed found in theHarapan Rainforest: Santiria apiculata, Elaeocarpus sphaericus, Sapium baccatum, Lithocarpusreinwardtii, Disoxylum excelsum, Ficus curtipes, Knema globularia, Knema furfuracea, andSantiria oblongifolia. Of these nine species, Ficus curtipes is the most preferred feed by thehornbills. Further research also notes that there are seven hornbill species inhabit the HarapanRainforest: crested hornbills (Aceros comatus), rhinoceros hornbills (Buceros rhinoceros), goldhornbill (Aceros undulatus), black kangkareng (Anthracaceros malayanus), black-crestedhornbill (Aceros corrugatus), khilingan <b>hornbills</b> (<b>Anorrhinus</b> galeritus) and ivory hornbill(Rhinoplax vigil...|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{tropical}} forests and associated biodiversity {{is a global}} concern. Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbills</b> Aceros nipalensis was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills Rhyticeros undulatus was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great hornbill Buceros bicornis and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist {{over most of the}} landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the earlier}} {{papers on the}} birds of Namdapha was {{published}} in 1990. The park has about 425 bird species with many more to be recorded from work in the higher areas. There are five species of hornbills recorded from the area. Several species of rare wren-babblers have been recorded in Namdapha. Other bird groups include laughing thrushes, parrotbills, fulvettas, shrike babblers and scimitar babblers. The snowythroated babbler is a rare species of babbler found only in the Patkai and Mishmi hills and nearby areas in Northern Myanmar, is found in Namdapha. Other rare, restricted range or globally endangered species include the <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill,</b> green cochoa, purple cochoa, beautiful nuthatch, Ward's trogon, ruddy kingfisher, blue-eared kingfisher, white-tailed fish eagle, Eurasian hobby, pied falconet, white-winged wood duck, Himalayan wood-owl, rufous-throated hill-partridge, and whitecheeked hill partridge. Several leaf warblers and migrants such as amur falcon and several thrushes can be seen here. The first mid-winter waterfowl census in Namdapha was conducted in 1994 when species such as the white-bellied heron, a critically endangered bird was recorded for the first time.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at the Malaysian National Zoo to ascertain, not only the current {{prevalence}} rate in the birds, but also to determine the association between cryptosporidiosis in birds and the bird handlers. A total of 116 fecal samples from 71 species of birds were collected from six different locations in Zoo Negara, and eight fecal samples from bird handlers were also sampled. Results showed that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in birds and bird handlers were 3. 4 and 12. 5, respectively. The birds that were positive for cryptosporidiosis were Wreathed Hornbill (Aceros undulatus) and Great Currasow (Crax rubra) from the aviary, Bushy-crested <b>Hornbill</b> (<b>Anorrhinus</b> galeritus) from the bird house, and the Common Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) from the lake. Birds at the lake showed the highest percentage (12. 5) of positivity, followed by birds at the aviary (5. 4) and the birdhouse (2. 8). Result {{of the present study}} seemed to indicate that cryptosporidiosis might be spreading to other species of birds and to other locations in the zoo, which was not previously documented. This study also suggested the probable association of cryptosporidiosis among birds and their bird handlers. However, conclusions can only be drawn after the confirmation of speciation found in birds and bird handlers through molecular identification...|$|R
