5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for <b>reinstatement.</b> It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for <b>reinstatement</b> were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we study the {{question}} of how to allocate the reinsurance premium between the sub-portfolios when an excess of loss treaty is to be shared between several sub-portfolios. Several allocation schemes based on the expected value principle and the standard deviation principle are suggested. The calculations are relatively simple with unlimited free <b>reinstatements.</b> However, with limited and/or paid <b>reinstatements</b> the situation becomes rather tricky, and we therefore suggest a simulation scheme...|$|R
50|$|The current {{model for}} memory {{retrieval}} {{in the brain}} is step 1, long term memories occur from the accumulation of synaptic changes in the cortex {{as a result of}} multiple <b>reinstatements</b> of the memory. Step 2, these <b>reinstatements</b> are directed by the hippocampus, perhaps for many years. Step 3, eventually the memory becomes independent of the medial temporal lobe, and this newer, more stable memory trace is permanently stored in the cortex. Step 4, retrieval mechanisms may reconstruct the original pattern of neurons initially recruited during the first moments of learning.|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} {{evaluation of}} pure premiums for {{excess of loss}} reinsurance with <b>reinstatements</b> requires the knowldege of the claim size distribution of the insurance risk. In the situation of incomplete information, where only a few characteristics of the aggregate claims to an excess of loss layer can be estimated, the method of stop-loss ordered bounds yields a simple analytical distribution-free approximation to pure premiums of excess of loss reinsurance with <b>reinstatements.</b> It is shown that the obtained approximation is enough accurate for practical purposes and improves the analytical approximations obtained using either a gamma, translated gamma, translated inverse Gaussian or a mixture {{of the last two}} distribution...|$|R

In the second part we show these procedures on concrete examples for various probability distributions of the amount of claims and the number of claims. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
5|$|On 25 February 1954, Naguib {{announced}} his resignation after the RCC held an official meeting without his presence two days prior. On 26 February, Nasser accepted the resignation, put Naguib under house arrest, and the RCC proclaimed Nasser as both RCC chairman and prime minister. As Naguib intended, a mutiny immediately followed, demanding Naguib's <b>reinstatement</b> and the RCC's dissolution. While visiting the striking officers at Military Headquarters (GHQ) {{to call for}} the mutiny's end, Nasser was initially intimidated into accepting their demands. However, on 27 February, Nasser's supporters in the army launched a raid on the GHQ, ending the mutiny. Later that day, {{hundreds of thousands of}} protesters, mainly belonging to the Brotherhood, called for Naguib's return and Nasser's imprisonment. In response, a sizable group within the RCC, led by Khaled Mohieddin, demanded Naguib's release and return to the presidency. Nasser acquiesced, but delayed Naguib's <b>reinstatement</b> until 4 March, allowing him to promote Amer to Commander of the Armed Forces—a position formerly occupied by Naguib.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Ciências ActuariaisIn this {{dissertation}} {{we present}} a general {{procedure for the calculation}} of the adjustment coefficient of the retained risk for an excess of loss reinsurance with <b>reinstatements,</b> when there is no aggregate deductible, following the model studied by Sundt (1991). We study how to calculate the initial reinsurance premium for this kind of contracts, when there is an aggregate layer, under different premium principles such as pure premium, expected value premium, standard deviation premium and the proportional hazard premium principles. In order to calculate the insurer’s adjustment coefficient we need to find the joint distribution of the insurer’s total claims and the aggregate claims of the reinsurer, considering an excess of loss reinsurance contract without <b>reinstatements.</b> For this reason, we study the bivariate Panjer’s recursion developed by Sundt (1999). Numerical examples, including selection of the optimal layer, are discussed in this dissertation...|$|R
