In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{human rights}} groups have publicized human rights issues in China that they {{consider}} the government to be mishandling, including: the death penalty (capital punishment), the one-child policy (which China had made exceptions for ethnic minorities prior to abolishing it in 2015), the political and legal status of Tibet, and neglect of {{freedom of the press}} in mainland China. Other areas of concern include the lack of legal <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and the lack of an independent judiciary, rule of law, and due process. Further issues raised in regard to human rights include the severe lack of worker's rights (in particular the hukou system which restricts migrant labourers' freedom of movement), the absence of independent labour unions (which have since been changing), and allegations of discrimination against rural workers and ethnic minorities, as well as the lack of religious freedom rights groups have highlighted repression of the Christian, Tibetan Buddhist, and Falun Gong religious groups. Some Chinese activist groups are trying to expand these freedoms, including Human Rights in China, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group. Chinese human rights attorneys who take on cases related to these issues, however, often face harassment, disbarment, and arrest.|$|E

Sexual organs were created for reproduction between the male element and the female element — and everything that deviates from that is not acceptable from a Buddhist point of view," [...] while penis-vagina non-procreative sex is not considered to be sexual misconduct. The Dalai Lama admitted that {{there is a difference between}} the views of believers and unbelievers: [...] "From a Buddhist point of view, men-to-men and women-to-women is generally considered sexual misconduct. From society's point of view, mutually agreeable homosexual relations can be of mutual benefit, enjoyable and harmless." ...|$|E

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about more than one billion people are undernourished and over two billion suffer from micronutrient deficiency. In this respect, this article aims to discuss food issues with a specific perspective especially focused on elderly people as vulnerable category. The paper addresses firstly, the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to food from the international law perspective by placing the greatest emphasis on the content of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Secondly, the focus shifts to the European continent, in order to deal with the protection that the right to food and to an adequate food for the elderly receive both within the context of the European Convention on <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> and under European Union law. Then, the article focuses on the ways to protect the individuals, including the elderly, when faced with violations of the right to food and to adequate food. Finally, some strategies are discussed within the European context for advancing the access to adequate food by elderly people...|$|R
