The thing is, we know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.'

500|$|Earthsuit {{music was}} {{primarily}} rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} <b>really</b> <b>into</b> {{a lot of different things}} ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E
500|$|According to Selway, Radiohead's American label Capitol saw {{the album}} as [...] "more or less, 'commercial suicide'. They weren't <b>really</b> <b>into</b> it.

I don't really know why it's so {{important}} now, but I'm excited about it." [...] Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million units to a half a million. In O'Brien's view only Parlophone, the band's British label, remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed with the lack of potential marketable singles, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead's early hit [...] "Creep".|$|E

It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building." [...] As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson.

Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing. We were <b>really</b> <b>into</b> the blues... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that shit." ...|$|E

We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was [...] "the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion." [...] Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics [...] "to emphasise {{a woman who was}} very set in her ways".|$|E
500|$|During his youth, Starr {{had been}} a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, {{but by the time}} he joined the Texans in 1958, he had {{developed}} a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on." [...] He stated that he [...] "was never <b>really</b> <b>into</b> drummers", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman [...] "Topsy Part Two" [...] as [...] "the one drum record" [...] he bought.|$|E

[...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people that I went in with when I started making the record. I learnt a lot from them. They're really lovely people, they work really hard, they're so talented." ...|$|E

500|$|Club Life: Volume Two Miami is {{the second}} {{installment}} of the Club Life series, succeeding its predecessor [...] (2011). The album serves {{as a tribute to}} the nightlife in Miami, Florida, a city internationally renowned for being an epicenter for electronic dance music. Upon arriving in the United States in 2002, Tiësto was instantly enamored by the city's vibrant electronic music scene, as the genre had yet to garner mainstream popularity {{throughout the rest of the}} country. [...] "Literally the first place I came to in America was Miami," [...] he recalled, [...] "and since then I've always been in love with the city. They've always been very supportive of my music. Like, even in the beginning of 2002, when the whole of America was not <b>really</b> <b>into</b> dance music, Miami had already embraced my music here and played it in all the stores." [...] Tiësto, who performs in the area annually, sought inspiration from varying discothèques in the city. He explained, [...] "I wanted to create songs that give fans the opportunity to experience the sound of Miami clubs, whether they’ve been there or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{connected}} the film's {{story to the}} endangerment of biodiversity in the Amazon rainforests of Brazil by dam construction, logging, mining, and clearing for agriculture. [...] A Newsweek piece commented on the destruction of Home Tree as resembling the rampant tree-felling in Tibet, while another article compared the film's depiction of destructive corporate mining for unobtanium in the Na'vi lands with the mining and milling of uranium near the Navajo reservation in New Mexico. [...] Other critics, however, dismissed Avatars pro-environmental stance as inconsistent. Armond White remarked that, [...] "Cameron’s <b>really</b> <b>into</b> the powie-zowie factor: destructive combat and the deployment of technological force.... Cameron fashionably denounces the same economic and military system that make his technological extravaganza possible. It’s like condemning NASA—yet joyriding on the Mars Exploration Rover." [...] Another author called the film [...] "socialism-disguised-as-nonsense enviro stuff" [...] and argued that the very process of creation and promotion of Avatar emitted enough carbon to undermine the film's ecological message. Similarly, an article in National Review concluded that by resorting to technology for educating viewers of the technology endangered world of Pandora, the film [...] "showcases the contradictions of organic liberalism." ...|$|E

In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, {{all they have to}} do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was <b>really</b> <b>into</b> bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in." [...] On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as [...] "more like a rhythm guitar," [...] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills." ...|$|E
