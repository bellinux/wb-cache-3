40|$|Abstract The <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{is one of}} the {{essential}} indicators of economy’s international competitiveness, and therefore, has a strong impact on a country’s foreign trade development. It is commonly believed that the movements of the <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> have a permanent effect on exports and imports. This study addresses the question of whether exchange rate volatility has any significant and direct impact on trade balance. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to estimate the effect of <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility on the balance of trade of Iran during the year 1993 to 2011.

So, it is important to stress that <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility cannot be used solely in managing the trade balance of Iran with main trading partners.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} main {{determinants}} of <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in Malawi and South Africa. In our empirical analysis, we conducted unit root and cointegration test {{in order to}} determine the time series properties of the data and establish whether there is a long run relationship between <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and explanatory variables. Having ascertained that almost all variables are integrated of order one and cointegrated, an error correction model is formulated and estimated for the two <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> equations using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. The empirical results for both Malawi and South Africa are highly supportive of the real exchange rate model. In particular, we find a negative and significant relationship between <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and the degree of openness for both countries. On the other hand, while there is an inverse relationship between <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and governmernt consumption in the case of Malawi, a positive ralationship between <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and government consumption obtains in the case of South Africa. Additionally, whereas there is a positive relationship between <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and international capital flows in the case of Malawi, a negative relationship obtains in the case of South Africa [...] However, results from both countries indicate a positive relationship between real exchange rate one hand and excess domestic credit and lagged <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> on the other hand. They also indicate a negative relationship between <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and nominal devaluation in both countries. The study yields some policy implications. First, it has been learnt that excessive domestic credit causes the real exchange rate to appreciate for both countries. This therefore calls for prudent fiscal and monetary policy measures. Such measures include mopping out excess liquidity from the market to stem the growth of money supply. For both countries, the most powerful policy is just an intermediate policy and can only be successful if there is fiscal discipline. With fiscal discipline there can be no excess liquidity. Second, the study has found that policies aimed at eliminating trade restrictions depreciate the REER. One policy implication that can be drawn from this finding is that the government should continue implementing trade liberalisation policies that it had already started in 1988. Furthermore, developments in the external sector of the economy (changes in terms of trade, degree of openness anf international capital flows) which are not under the control of domestic authorities seemingly contribute more to changes in <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The policy implications are that the government ability in influencing the behaviour of <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is limited. This is because the ability of a small open economy like that of Malawi to insulate itself from external shock is limited, at best. In the long- run however, appropriate structural changes and conducive competitive policy could be designed and implemented. These may include export diversification (to counter deteriorating terms of trade in specific commodities) and implementing measures to limit market imperfection. Based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that macroeconomic fundamentals play a vital role in explaining changes in <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in both Malawi and South Africa.

Specifically, it considers the impact of global shocks on the competitiveness of individual euro area countries and assesses whether their responses to such shocks have converged, as well as to what pattern. Technically, the paper applies a newly developed methodology based on infinite VAR theory featuring a dominant unit to a large set of over 60 countries' <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> including those of the individual euro area economies, and compares impulse response functions to the estimated systems before and after EMU with respect to three types of shocks: a global US dollar shock, generalised impulse response function shocks and a global shock to risk aversion. Our results show that the way euro area countries' <b>real</b> <b>effective</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> adjust to these shocks has converged indeed, albeit to a pattern that depends crucially {{on the nature of the}} shock. This result is noteworthy given the apparent divergence in competitiveness indicators of these countries in the first ten years of EMU, which suggests that this diverging pattern is unlikely to be due to global external shocks with asymmetric effects but rather to other factors, such as country-specific domestic shocks.
