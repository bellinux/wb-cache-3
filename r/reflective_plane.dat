40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{methodology}} for localizing acoustic pla-nar reflectors in a 3 D geometry, using acoustic measurements ac-quired by a set of microphones. An acoustic source emitting a known signal is placed close to the wall to be identified, and is used for es-timating the source-to-microphone impulse responses. In a prelim-inary step, such estimates are employed for localizing the source. After that, the Times Of Arrival (TOAs) associated to the first order reflective paths are extracted from the impulse responses and con-verted into quadratic constraints (ellipsoids) acting on the <b>reflective</b> <b>plane.</b> The constraints are then collected into a cost function, whose exact minimization leads to the searched plane. A theoretical anal-ysis is performed for predicting the impact of measurement errors on the estimation. Moreover, experimental results in a real meeting room prove the effectiveness of the method.

30|$|The MD atomistic {{model in}} the micro-scale {{framework}} is a deterministic method. In this model, {{the evolution of the}} molecular system is obtained by computing the trajectories of the particles based on the classical molecular model. The continuum conditions can be applied to molecular domain either by the method based on continuous rescaling of atomic velocities or by the periodic resampling method of atomistic velocities that employs velocity distribution functions such as Maxwell-Boltzmann or Chapman-Enskog distribution for non-equilibrium situations of hybrid simulations in dilute gases employing geometrical decomposition and state coupling. The Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution is the natural velocity distribution of an atomic or molecular system in an equilibrium state defining the probability of one-dimensional velocity components of an atom assuming a specific value based on temperature and the atomic mass. The <b>reflective</b> <b>plane</b> placed at the upper boundary of the boundary condition transfer region maintains every particle inside the molecular domain. This scheme is simpler than the velocity reversing scheme, but this can be applied only to incompressible flows because the normal pressure {{is a result of the}} reflected atoms.|$|E

40|$|High {{performance}} coronagraphic imaging of faint structures around {{bright stars}} at small angular separations requires fine control of tip, tilt and other low order aberrations. When such errors occur upstream of a coronagraph, they results in starlight leakage which reduces the dynamic {{range of the}} instrument. This issue has been previously addressed for occulting coronagraphs by sensing the starlight before or at the coronagraphic focal plane. One such solution, the coronagraphic low order wave-front sensor (CLOWFS) uses a partially <b>reflective</b> focal <b>plane</b> mask to measure pointing errors for Lyot-type coronagraphs. To deal with pointing errors in low inner working angle phase mask coronagraphs which {{do not have a}} <b>reflective</b> focal <b>plane</b> mask, we have adapted the CLOWFS technique. This new concept relies on starlight diffracted by the focal plane phase mask being reflected by the Lyot stop towards a sensor which reliably measures low order aberrations such as tip and tilt. This reflective Lyot-based wavefront sensor is a linear reconstructor which provides high sensitivity tip-tilt error measurements with phase mask coronagraphs. Simulations show that the measurement accuracy of pointing errors with realistic post adaptive optics residuals are ≈ 10 − 2 λ/D per mode at λ = 1. 6 µm for a four quadrant phase mask. In addition, we demonstrate the open loop measurement pointing accuracy of 10 − 2 λ/D at 638 nm for a four quadrant phase mask in the laboratory...|$|R

Two arrays, one for each hemisphere, will cover the full sky in a range from few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV improving the sensitivity and angular resolution of the present operating arrays. A prototype of the Large Size Telescope (LST) {{for the study of}} gamma ray astronomy above some tens of GeV will be installed at the Canary Island of La Palma in 2016. The LST camera, made by an array of photomultipliers (PMTs), requires an accurate and systematic calibration over a wide dynamic range. In this contribution, we present an optical calibration system made by a 355 nm wavelength laser with 400 ps pulse width, 1 muJ output energy, up to 4 k Hz repetition rate and a set of neutral density filters to obtain a wide range of photon intensities, up to 1000 photoelectrons/PMT, to be sent to the camera plane 28 m away. The number of photons after the diffuser of the calibration box, located {{in the center of the}} <b>reflective</b> <b>plane,</b> is monitored by a photodiode. The stability of the laser and the ambient parameters inside this calibration box are checked by a multi-task processor and a trigger signal is sent to the camera data acquisition system.

40|$|The {{aeroacoustics}} of {{a simplified}} alternator are analysed {{within the framework}} of this thesis, with the objective being the development of a tool capable of numerically predicting aeroacoustic noise. Focus has been placed on tonal noise and only dipole, rotating noise sources have been modelled. Input for these dipole sources are calculated using instationary CFD computations using the SST turbulence model. The acoustic tool developed is based on Lowson&# 039;s equation, derived from the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equation. Modifications to the formulation are included in order to model the <b>reflective</b> <b>plane</b> present during measurements and to ensure that sound propagates solely away from source surfaces (a half-dipole propagation). Numerical results are compared with experimental measurements, and show discrepancies in total sound power level. This is due to the inability of the methods used to model broadband noise sources that produce energy between the main orders (harmonics) of the alternator. Determining the total energetic content of the sound orders numerically calculated and comparing this to the energetic content of the measured orders yielded positive results; sound power level results were within 2 dB(A) of measurement. Dominant frequencies/orders were calculated generally within an accuracy of 6 dB(A); issues with the periodic boundary conditions and the rotor/stator interface produced spurious fluctuations that, for one tested case, produced strong 8 th order noise. The developed tool was used successfully in a real alternator model, and once again showed very promising results. Fan orders were calculated within very good accuracy, while clawpole orders showed too much energy at higher orders due to the simplified CFD modelling of the casing holes. Total sound power level was computed too low due, once again, to the lack of broadband noise computation. Total energy from the computed orders was however calculated well within the range of the measured samples. The modelling of the casing using the BEM LMS Sysnoise was not possible due to the inability within the software to specify both pressure gradient and pressure boundary conditions, however models simulated using the FEM tool COMSOL Multiphysics showed that the in uence of the casing on most orders, {{with the exception of the}} 40 th and those above the 60 th, was low, in addition to a low effect on the total sound energy...|$|E
40|$|We report {{laboratory}} {{results of}} a coronagraphic test bench to assess the intensity reduction differences between a "Gaussian" tapered focal plane coronagraphic mask and a classical hard-edged "Top Hat" function mask at Extreme Adaptive Optics (ExAO) Strehl ratios of ~ 94 %. However, unlike a traditional coronagraph design, we insert a <b>reflective</b> focal <b>plane</b> mask at 45 degree to the optical axis. We also used an intermediate secondary mask ("Mask_ 2 ") before a final image in order to block additional mask-edge diffracted light. The test bench simulates the 8. 1 m Gemini North telescope. It includes one spider vane, different mask radii (r= 1. 9, 3. 7, 7. 4 lambda/D) and two types of <b>reflective</b> focal <b>plane</b> masks (hard-edged "Top Hat" and "Gaussian" tapered profiles). In order to investigate the relative performance of these competing coronagraphic designs with regard to extra-solar planet detection sensitivity, we utilize the simulation of realistic extra-solar planet populations (Nielson et al. 2006). With an appropriate translation of our laboratory results to expected telescope performance, a "Gaussian" tapered mask radius of 3. 7 lambda/D with an additional mask ("Mask_ 2 ") performs best (highest planet detection sensitivity). For a full survey with this optimal design, the simulation predicts ~ 30 % more planets detected compared to a similar sized "Top Hat" function mask with "Mask_ 2. " Using the best design, the point contrast ratio between the stellar PSF peak and the coronagraphic PSF at 10 lambda/D (0. 4 " in H band if D = 8. 1 m) is ~ 10 times higher than a classical Lyot "Top Hat" coronagraph. Hence, we find a Gaussian apodized mask with an additional blocking mask is a superior (~ 10 x higher contrast) than use of a classical Lyot coronagraph for ExAO-like Strehls.

40|$|Stripe contact (edgeemitting) LEDs {{have been}} found to be {{suitable}} for many applications in present day optical/photonics devices and systems. Polarised light (i. e., light with dominantly a single polarisation direction) is required for various applications. Semiconductor LASERs generate polarized light but such sources may not be suitable due to other reasons such as the ‘speckle’ effect that occurs due to the highly coherent LASER light; also, if the source is to be part of a monolithically integrated optical circuit it will be expensive to produce the two <b>reflective</b> <b>planes</b> needed for the LASER to operate. Unlike semiconductor Lasers, however, stripecontact TM ASE, and yet be easy to fabricate. Rays and Rate Equations analysis is used to model the device. A computationally efficient model for stripe contact semiconductor optical devices is designed and used to obtain design guidelines for the “V”geometry device, which is taking benefits and advantages to design a polarisationselective eeLED device. Simulation results from the model are shown. edgeemitting LEDs in bulk active layer semiconductor material tend to produce nearly unpolarised light. LED sources but with polarised output are attractive for various applications such as in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The objective of this project is to design a simple, inexpensive device structure to achieve polarisation enhanced output by using stripecontact edgeemitting LEDs in bulk active layer semiconductor material, with multilayer, DoubleHeterostructure (DH), as commonly used for semiconductor Lasers and LEDs. As is well known light in the material is primarily generated by spontaneous emission. If the material is ‘pumped’ sufficiently then there will be net stimulated emission which corresponds to having optical gain; in that case the spontaneously emitted light will experience optical emission as it progresses through the material resulting in Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE). In this condition of operation the eeLED is often referred to as the Superluminescent LED (SLED). It is also well known that in bulk active layer semiconductors spontaneous emission occurs uniformly in all polarisations and that the material gain is also polarisation independent. Hence the generated ASE is equally distributed in TE & TM polarisations. The challenge, therefore, is to find a scheme which that would generate dominantly TE or dominantl...|$|R

40|$|High {{contrast}} coronagraphic imaging of {{the immediate}} surrounding of stars requires exquisite control of low-order wavefront aberrations, such as tip-tilt (pointing) and focus. We propose an accurate, efficient and easy to implement technique to measure such aberrations in coronagraphs which use a focal plane mask to block starlight. The Coronagraphic Low Order Wavefront Sensor (CLOWFS) produces a defocused image of a <b>reflective</b> focal <b>plane</b> ring to measure low order aberrations. Even for small levels of wavefront aberration, the proposed scheme produces large intensity signals which can be easily measured, and therefore does not require highly accurate calibration of either the detector or optical elements. The CLOWFS achieves nearly optimal sensitivity and is immune from non-common path errors. This technique is especially well suited for high performance low inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs. On phase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) type coronagraphs, it can unambiguously recover aberrations which originate from {{either side of the}} beam shaping introduced by the PIAA optics. We show that the proposed CLOWFS can measure sub-milliarcsecond telescope pointing errors several orders of magnitude faster than would be possible in the coronagraphic science focal plane alone, and can also accurately calibrate residual coronagraphic leaks due to residual low order aberrations.

40|$|Detection and {{characterization}} of exoplanets by direct imaging requires a coronagraph designed to deliver high contrast at small angular separation. To achieve this, an accurate control of low order aberrations, such as pointing and focus errors, {{is essential to}} optimize coronagraphic rejection and avoid the possible confusion between exoplanet light and coronagraphic leaks in the science image. Simulations and laboratory prototyping have shown that a Coronagraphic Low Order Wave-Front Sensor (CLOWFS), using a single defocused image of a <b>reflective</b> focal <b>plane</b> ring, {{can be used to}} control tip-tilt to an accuracy of 10 ^{- 3 } lambda/D. This paper demonstrates that the data acquired by CLOWFS can also be used in post-processing to calibrate residual coronagraphic leaks from the science image. Using both the CLOWFS camera and the science camera in the system, we quantify the accuracy of the method and its ability to successfully remove light due to low order errors from the science image. We also report the implementation and performance of the CLOWFS on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme AO (SCExAO) system and its expected on-sky performance. In the laboratory, with a level of disturbance similar to what is encountered in a post Adaptive Optics beam, CLOWFS post-processing has achieved speckle calibration to 1 / 300 of the raw speckle level.

40|$|A {{white light}} {{interferometer}} {{is designed to}} measure the distributed polarization coupling (DPC) in polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF). By using a Michelson interferometer to compensate the optical path difference induced by the modal birefringence of PMF, both the coupling strength and position of the coupling point can be acquired. The two reflective mirrors on the fixed and scanning arms should be vertical to each other. But in practice, the movable reflective mirror can’t be vertically aligned exactly to the fixed mirror, which {{would lead to a}}ngle misalignment. The angle misalignment would induce the variance of the optical path difference (OPD), which would reduce the fringe visibility. Finally, the angle error would lead to a decrease on the signal noise ratio (SNR) and miscalculation of the polarization coupling intensity. The angle misalignment and diameter of the incident light beam both {{have an effect on the}} fringe visibility. The simulation results show that the requirement of angle error becomes stricter with the increasing of the light beam diameter.

40|$|Triaxial {{extension}} {{experiments on}} Carrara Marble demonstrate {{that there is}} a continuous transition from extension to shear fracture on the basis of mechanical behavior, macroscopic fracture orientation and fracture morphology where hybrid fractures with extension and shear fracture characteristics are formed at the intermediate stress conditions. Extension fracture surfaces display discrete, highly <b>reflective</b> cleavage <b>planes</b> and shear fracture surfaces are covered with calcite gouge and display grooves and striations that are aligned parallel to slip. This study uses the fractured samples that were formed under triaxial extension experiments to characterize 1) microscopic surface features using scanning electron microscopy, 2) fracture surface morphology using laser profilometry, and 3) off-fracture damage using optical microscopy. These data are used to test the step-crack model of fracture development for the formation of hybrid fractures. Spectral analysis of the profiles demonstrates that microscopic roughness decreases gradually across the extension-to-shear fracture transition in both the orientations parallel and perpendicular to slip. However, macroscopic roughness gradually increases then decreases across the transition in the direction parallel to slip. The greatest macroscopic roughness occurs at the transition from extension fractures to tensile-hybrid fractures and is attributed to the presence of macroscopic steps in hybrid fractures surfaces. The treads of the steps in the hybrid fracture surfaces have characteristics of extension fracture surfaces and the risers have characteristics of shear fracture surfaces. The treads have a right-stepping left lateral geometry that is consistent with the step-crack model. Thin sections of hybrid fractures display systematically spaced, pinnate, microfractures that emanate {{from both sides of the}} macroscopic fracture surface. The pinnate fractures on both sides correlate across the macroscopic fracture, suggesting that they are precursory to the formation of the macroscopic fracture surface. The spacing to length ratio of the pinnate fractures and the macroscopic orientation of the fracture surface are also consistent the relationship dictated by the step-crack model of fault formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of angular dispersion and slit resolution limit of grating spectrometers {{by means of}} variation of grating parameters is limited by its period and allowable order of diffraction. The special solutions (echelle, holographic, immersion gratings) are acceptable in a limited parameter range and are technologically complex in fabrication, thus hardly applicable to instruments of mass production. We propose to decrease slit resolution limit by one-dimensional beam widening in dispersion plane by means of passing it through oblique prism before incidence onto diffraction grating. The {{increase of}} angular dispersion {{can be achieved by}} narrowing of dispersed beams after grating while passing through other oblique prism. We prove that slit resolution limit in such a system changes approximately as multiplied by angular magnification of the first prism (that is less than 1 times). Also angular dispersion changed approximately as multiplied by angular magnification of the second prism. The Fresnel reflection from the faces of prisms is analyzed. Accounting for that factor gives the increase of resolution about 1, 4 – 1, 6 times without loss of light (and can be 2 and more times while using anti-reflective coating). The proposed method is different from the similar ones first of all by its simplicity because it uses simple optical elements – <b>plane</b> <b>reflective</b> grating and thin prisms.
