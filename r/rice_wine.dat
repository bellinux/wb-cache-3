One bottle of wine is made by mixing <b>rice</b> <b>wine</b> with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal.

Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as <b>rice.</b> <b>Wine</b> was also regularly consumed.|$|E

5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had <b>rice</b> <b>wine</b> before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou.

25|$|Raw rice may {{be ground}} into flour for many uses, {{including}} making {{many kinds of}} beverages, such as amazake, horchata, rice milk, and <b>rice</b> <b>wine.</b> Rice does not contain gluten, so is suitable for people on a gluten-free diet.

25|$|Red yeast rice is used {{to colour}} {{a wide variety of}} food products, {{including}} pickled tofu, red rice vinegar, char siu, Peking Duck, and Chinese pastries that require red food colouring. It is also traditionally used in the production of several types of Chinese huangjiu (Shaoxing jiu), Japanese sake (akaisake), and Korean <b>rice</b> <b>wine</b> (hongju), imparting a reddish colour to these wines. Although used mainly for its colour in cuisine, red yeast rice imparts a subtle but pleasant taste to food and is commonly used in the cuisine of Fujian regions of China.|$|E
25|$|Yeast consumes {{the sugar}} in the grapes and {{converts}} it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, {{as well as other}} aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include <b>rice</b> <b>wine</b> and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.|$|E
25|$|According {{to sources}} at the time, {{the trade in}} large native Ruson-tsukuri (literally Luzon made in Japanese: or 呂宋つくり) clay jars used for storing green tea and <b>rice</b> <b>wine</b> with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinense potters had marked each jar with Baybayin letters {{denoting}} the particular urn used and the kiln the jars were manufactured in.

25|$|From the 12th century, a huge {{industry}} centred {{around the}} manufacture and trade of burnay clay pots, {{used for the}} storage of tea and other perishables, {{was set up in}} the northern Philippines with Japanese and Okinawan traders. These pots were known as 'Ruson-tsukuri' (Luzon-made) in Japanese, and were considered among the best storage vessels used for the purpose of keeping tea leaves and <b>rice</b> <b>wine</b> fresh. Hence, Ruson-Tsukuri pots became sought after in Northeast Asia. Each Philippine kiln had its own branding symbol, marked {{on the bottom of the}} Ruson-tsukuri by a single baybayin letter.|$|E
25|$|A 2003 {{report by}} archaeologists {{indicates}} {{a possibility that}} grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented beverages in China {{in the early years}} of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Henan, contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds commonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, such as hawthorn, cannot be ruled out. If these beverages, which seem to be the precursors of <b>rice</b> <b>wine,</b> included grapes rather than other fruits, they would have been any of the several dozen indigenous wild species in China, rather than Vitis vinifera, which was introduced there 6000 years later.|$|E
25|$|Approximately In 1816, Jeong Hak-yu, {{the second}} son of Jeong Yak-yong, a {{prominent}} politician and scholar of Joseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called Nongga Wollyeongga (농가월령가). This poem, {{which is an}} important source of Korean folk history, describes what ordinary Korean farming families did in each month of a year. In the description of the month of August the poem tells of a married woman visiting her birth parents with boiled dog meat, rice cake, and <b>rice</b> <b>wine,</b> thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002). Dongguk Sesigi (동국세시기), a book written by a Korean scholar Hong Seok-mo in 1849, contains a recipe of Bosintang including a boiled dog, green onion, and red chili pepper powder.|$|E
50|$|In Korea, {{the major}} crop has {{historically}} been rice, and thus most Korean traditional alcoholic beverages are <b>rice</b> <b>wines,</b> made from both glutinous rice and non-glutinous rice.

Additionally, Koreans often use fruits, flowers, herbs, and other ingredients to flavor these beverages, to a much greater extent than Chinese wines.|$|R

Koreans also produce a number of <b>rice</b> <b>wines,</b> both in filtered and unfiltered versions.|$|R
