Using firm-level data from five countries {{hardest hit by}} the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98, this study contrasts the effects of financial and corporate governance variables on restructuring choices. The study finds that, during a crisis, financial constraints and corporate governance each have a large effect on the restructuring choice. Financial crises - Asia; Corporate governance...|$|E

Within {{the framework of the}} history and rules of privatisation, the unfavourable investment climate, and the distortions of the internal Russian market, a dual structure of the Russian energy sector developed. Economic survival at present is strongly linked with internationalisation of business activities for one group of companies, while the second group of companies remains trapped in <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and loans and reorganisation of ownership. The members of the first group {{are on their way to}} becoming Western style energy companies with strategies similar to those of their international counterparts. Case study evidence is provided on Lukoil, Gazprom and the power industry. The success of Russian global energy companies will have consequences for international competition, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between technological capabilities and firm performance.

The results also suggest that firms with superior refinement capability tend to possess superior reconfiguration capability. Our findings show that both external and internal factors, such as technological volatility, inter-firm collaboration, and firm age and size, are significantly associated with the level of refinement and reconfiguration capabilities possessed by a firm. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{examination of the}} ways in which companies respond to a country-wide crisis through the <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> their <b>assets</b> (through asset sales, mergers or liquidations) or liabilities. We find the <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> liabilities to be the most common type of response. On the other hand, we argue that firms may be reluctant to engage in major asset sales due to substantial price discounts that need to be applied to these transactions during the crisis. In fact, we document that transaction multiples dropped by 40 % during the crisis, compared to a pre-crisis period. We contrast financial and corporate governance considerations and find strong support for the notion that, during a crisis, financial constraints have a large impact on the restructuring choice. However, we find corporate governance (e. g., control) considerations to matter only marginally both in statistical and economic terms. Corporate governance; Financial crises - Asia...|$|R

40|$|We {{identify}} asset {{purchases and}} sales as channels through which both {{external and internal}} governance affect corporate decisions and shareholders wealth. Firms with more antitakeover provisions (ATPs) are {{significantly more likely to}} engage in <b>asset</b> purchases (instead <b>of</b> making efficient internal investments) and asset sales (rather than efficient internal <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>assets).</b> Indeed, firms less vulnerable to takeovers, are more likely to purchase assets if they have higher investment opportunities and more likely to sell assets when they are larger, have lower investment opportunities and are less profitable. The unexpected purchasers and sellers with more ATPs experience lower abnormal announcement returns. The internal governance mechanisms of insider ownership reduce the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> purchases and sales consistent with incentive alignment. Additional results reveal that (1) the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> buys is decreasing in insider ownership, but only among larger firms, and (2) the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> sales is increasing in institutional ownership, but only among less profitable firms. The announcement effect <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> buys is concave (increasing at a decreasing rate) in insider ownership, and convex in institutional ownership. We also document that just as in the case of buyers and sellers with more ATPs, higher insider and institutional ownership lead to lower post-deal idiosyncratic risk (and lower shareholder wealth), suggesting higher agency costs of managerial conservatism and opacity...|$|R

40|$|Emerging market banks {{continue}} {{to grapple with}} growing non-performing assets (NPAs), making regulatory intervention inevitable to avoid bank failure following corporate default. In the context of India, bankruptcy reforms were enacted {{for the first time}} in 2016 in the form of a unified Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a regulatory intervention by the Indian central bank over the last decade in leading an attempt to prevent bank failure in the absence of a sound bankruptcy process. We assess how the volume <b>of</b> <b>restructured</b> <b>assets</b> at bank level impacted risk taking of Indian banks over the time period 2003 – 2012. During this period, a large number <b>of</b> banks <b>restructured</b> their distressed assets as a means to reduce NPAs. Our results show that higher levels <b>of</b> <b>restructured</b> <b>assets</b> significantly reduced risk taking as banks benefited from low provisioning, and this relation is more pronounced for banks that had lower loan loss provisions. We also find that by restructuring distressed assets, public sector banks benefited significantly more in improving their stability than private sector domestic and foreign banks. Overall, our main results suggest that similar regulatory support in the absence of a strong legal-system, can be implemented to avoid bank fragility in other emerging market economies...|$|R

However, there have been several accusations leveled at government. Some people believe that privatization <b>of</b> state <b>assets</b> has benefited a few. This has led to the enactment of the Broad based black economic empowerment act. There is also a concern from the communities and unions that privatization <b>of</b> state <b>assets</b> will result in poor service delivery and unemployment. The study was conducted through a quantitative methodology. The final questionnaire was administered to 40 taxi owners, 20 government employees, 20 contractors, 20 business owners and 40 local residents. Out of the 140 people, II 0 responded, thus a 79 % response rate, all was used for data analyses. The various variables (responses to individual questions) in the questionnaire were arranged to obtain a rating for each dimension covered. This procedure assumes equality of interval of the Likert scale and therefore the data is regarded as the least interval data (rather than ordinary data). The findings on the study showed that majority of the respondents were not in favour of privatisation. Recommendations made were as follows, the government through its education programmes in schools and in Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) canters must educate citizens about socio-economic and political issues as well as familiarizing them with the government's macro - economic policy, in particular the GEAR policy.

40|$|Companies {{experiencing}} {{financial stress}} can attempt to mitigate financial stress through <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the company's <b>asset</b> base. Management {{may choose to}} expand through activities involving investment in <b>assets</b> in hopes <b>of</b> increasing sales and/or reducing fixed costs per unit produced (sold). Management may also choose to contract the asset base in order to eliminate and/or reduce investment in unprofitable or risky ventures, improve liquidity, reduce earnings volatility, and {{reduce the need for}} operating capital. At issue is the question of how observed changes in the investment base affect the likelihood of emergence from a stressed condition. In this paper, we report on the results of an empirical study that examined this question. We find that, when higher (lower) earnings accompany expansion <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> base, the likelihood of emergence increases (decreases) as compared to the impact of the same level of earnings for firms that are not expanding. Thus, expansion enhances the impact of the earnings signal. Similarly, contracting firms are more likely to emerge when relatively lower earnings accompany contraction. For contracting firms, however, the lower earnings resulting from mitigation partially cancels the normally positive impact of the unconditional current earnings signal (i. e., the relatively higher the earnings, the greater the likelihood of emergence from stress). Thus, in both cases, the knowledge of expansion and contraction appear to be incrementally useful in explaining emergence from corporate financial stress. ...|$|R
