30|$|Eleven vinegars (Table  1) were {{provided}} by the Central Research Institute of Mizkan Group Corporation. These samples were stored at 4 °C until use. In these 11 vinegars, three kinds of vinegar (high-brix nonglutinous brown <b>rice</b> black <b>vinegar,</b> high-brix nonglutinous brown <b>rice</b> black <b>vinegar</b> matured in barrel and high-brix apple vinegar) have the word “high-brix” in their names. The “high-brix” means that these vinegars were produced using a larger amount of initial material than {{were used in the}} production of vinegars lacking the “high-brix”. The initial material of “high-brix nonglutinous brown rice black vinegar” and “high-brix nonglutinous brown <b>rice</b> black <b>vinegar</b> matured in barrel” was nonglutinous brown rice, and one of “high-brix apple vinegar” was apple juice. High-brix nonglutinous brown <b>rice</b> black <b>vinegar</b> matured in barrel and lactic fermented tomato vinegar, which are not currently available on the market, served as test samples for new commodification. High-brix nonglutinous brown <b>rice</b> black <b>vinegar</b> matured in barrel was produced by the maturation of high-brix nonglutinous brown <b>rice</b> black <b>vinegar</b> at 25 °C for a month in a 20 -L barrel. On the other hand, the lactic fermented tomato vinegar was produced through acetic fermentation using the mixture of alcoholic fermented tomato juice and lactic fermented juice.|$|R

In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.|$|E

40|$|Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a common}} painful condition observed in clinics. Dietary habits have been much associated with its development and persistence during and following periodontal treatment. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of vinegars on the removal of smear layer and exposure of dentinal tubules. Extracted human teeth were submitted to manual scaling with Gracey curettes in order to remove the cementum {{as well as to}} form a smear layer. Dentin samples with 3 mm(2) were obtained and distributed into six experimental groups: one control and five types of <b>vinegars</b> (alcohol, apple, <b>rice,</b> white wine and balsamic). Each group included two methods of vinegar application: topical and friction. After routine preparation for SEM analysis, photomicrographs were assessed by a calibrated and blind examiner using an appropriate index system. Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant influence of vinegars on smear layer removal. There was a statistically significant difference between groups treated with apple, white and <b>rice</b> <b>vinegars</b> and the control group (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, Mann-Whitney test indicated that removal of smear layer did not vary with the method of application (topical versus friction) for any of the tested substances. We can conclude that the contact of vinegar may remove smear layer and expose dentinal tubules, regardless of the type of application. However, balsamic vinegar was associated with less removal of smear layer after both methods of application...|$|R
