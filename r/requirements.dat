40|$|Abstract. <b>Requirement</b> Specification {{is gaining}} {{increasingly}} attention {{as a critical}} phase of software systems development. As <b>requirement</b> descriptions evolve, they quickly become error-prone and difficult to understand. Thus, the development of techniques and tools to support <b>requirement</b> specification development, understanding, testing, maintenance and reuse becomes an important issue. This paper extends the well-known technique of program slicing to Functional <b>Requirement</b> Specification based on Use Case Maps notation. This new application of slicing, called UCM <b>Requirement</b> Slicing is useful to aid <b>requirement</b> comprehension and maintenance. In contrast to traditional program slicing, <b>requirement</b> slicing is designed to operate on the <b>requirement</b> specification of a system, rather than the source code of a program. The resulting <b>requirement</b> slice provides knowledge about high-level structure of a system, rather than its low-level implementation details. In order to compute a UCM <b>Requirement</b> slice, we provide a three steps slicing algorithm. Key words: Functional <b>requirement</b> specification, program slicing, use case maps, comprehension, maintenance. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting <b>requirements</b> and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include <b>requirements</b> beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design <b>requirements</b> and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
