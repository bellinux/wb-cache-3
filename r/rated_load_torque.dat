40|$|In sensorless {{induction}} motor drives, flux estimators {{based only on}} the standard motor model work well at sufÔ¨Åciently high stator frequencies, but they fail at frequencies close to zero. To solve this problem, a new observer structure is proposed, combining a speed-adaptive full-order flux observer with a low-frequency signal-injection method. An error signal obtained from the signal-injection method is used as an additional feedback signal in the speed-adaptation law of the observer, resulting in a wide speed range, excellent dynamic properties, and zero-frequency operation capability. The enhanced observer is also robust against parameter errors. Experimental results are shown, including very slow speed reversals and long-term zero-frequency operation under <b>rated</b> <b>load</b> <b>torque,</b> as well as <b>rated</b> <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> steps and fast speed reversals under <b>rated</b> <b>load</b> <b>torque.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E

Only the rotor position is measured {{even for a}} low precision shaft encoder. The instantaneous speed and the disturbance torque are accurately estimated by an extended Luenberger observer inertia adaptive. A current to voltage decoupling and disturbance torque feedforward compensation realize a fast current sensorless torque control with dynamic torque limitation. The mechanical inertia, used for the self-tuning of both speed controller and Luenberger observer, is on-line identified by a discrete time recursive gradient algorithm.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} flux estimators for speed-sensorless {{induction}} motor drives. To enhance {{the stability and}} the performance of state-of-the-art sensorless drives, new flux estimator designs based on the standard motor model are proposed. Theoretical and experimental research methods are both used. The dynamics and stability of flux estimators are analyzed using linearized models, and the effects of parameter errors are investigated using steady-state relations. Performance is evaluated using computer simulations and laboratory experiments. It was found that most sensorless flux estimation methods proposed in the literature have an unstable operating region at low speeds (typically in the regenerating mode) and that the damping at high speeds may be insufficient. A new stable design of the speed-adaptive full-order flux observer is proposed: the observer gain is designed especially for nominal and high-speed operation, while the low-speed operation is stabilized by modifying the speed-adaptation law. Compared to estimators proposed in the literature, the effects of parameter errors on the proposed observer design are shown to be small. To further improve the robustness, the speed-adaptive observer is enhanced with a low-frequency signal-injection method, allowing long-term zero-frequency operation under <b>rated</b> <b>load</b> <b>torque.</b> Furthermore, a computationally efficient version of a voltage-model-based flux estimator and two computationally efficient digital implementations for full-order flux observers are proposed. reviewe...|$|E

This thesis analyses {{the characteristics of}} a concentrated two-layer winding, each coil of which is wound around one tooth and which has a number of slots per pole and per phase less than one (q < 1). Compared to the integer slot winding, the fractional winding (q < 1) has shorter end windings and this, thereby, makes space as well as manufacturing cost saving possible. Several possible ways of winding a fractional slot machine with slots per pole and per phase lessthan one are examined. The winding factor and the winding harmonic components are calculated. The benefits attainable from a machine with concentrated windingsare considered. Rotor structures with surface magnets, radially embedded magnets and embedded magnets in V-position are discussed. The finite element method isused to solve the main values of the motors. The waveform of the induced electro motive force, the no-load and <b>rated</b> <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> ripple as well as the dynamic behavior of the current driven and voltage driven motor are solved. The results obtained from different finite element analyses are given. A simple analytic method to calculate fractional slot machines is introduced and the values are compared to the values obtained with the finite element analysis. Several different fractional slot machines are first designed by using the simple analytical methodand then computed by using the finite element method. All the motors are of thesame 225 -frame size, and have an approximately same amount of magnet material, a same rated torque demand and a 400 - 420 rpm speed.

40|$|For high {{performance}} drive applications, {{the accuracy of}} speed estimation from a digital shaft encoder is reduced in the low speed range. Drive performance can be further impaired at low speed when low cost low-resolution digital encoders are used. This thesis contributes {{to the development of}} a quasi-sensorless solution for AC induction motor drives, where instead of a conventional position sensor and MH" or closed loop observer, an artificial intelligence based 64 PPR SKF sensor bearing is proposed. Furthermore, the performance of speed-controlled IM drives is sensitive to rotor time constant mismatch. A newly developed closed loop RMLE-GNA observer is proposed as a new adaption mechanism with a Model Reference Adaptive Scheme for rotor flux estimation and on-fine rotor time constant adaptation. For {{high performance}} sensorless speed controlled IM drive applications, the IM is required to operate at low speed in all four-quadrants in a stable manner whilst maintaining constant air-gap flux and torque. Such low speed operation fails with conventional open loop observers and MRAS, and closed loop observers such as EKF suffer from a tuning problem and extensive computing time. Parameter uncertainty is a further factor limiting drive performance. A new joint state estimation and parameter adaptation closed loop Recursive Maximum Likelihood Estimator with an iterative Gauss Newton Raphson Algorithm (RMLE-GNA) is developed for the sensorless speed estimation and on-line parameter adaptation of IM drives. Two case studies are presented: correct and stable convergence of the closed loop observer within two iteration local loops utilising a full order IM model, and correct and stable convergence within a single iteration local loop utilising a simplified full order IM model. In both cases it is shown that the closed loop observer can provide satisfactory and stable convergence for 4 -quadrant operation. Of particular interest are the correct convergence, robustness against parameter mismatch and the stability of the sensorless speed controlled IM drive at zero speed and zero stator flux frequency. Thus, a small signal transfer function of the closed loop observer with the sensorless speed vector controlled IM drives is derived. The stability analysis shows the robustness and the convergence of the observer for 4 -quadrant operation for high and low speed' and up to the <b>rated</b> <b>load</b> <b>torque.</b> The effect of various machine model parameters on the stability and convergence of the RMLE-GNA-based sensorless drive system is investigated, providing an insight into the inherent dynamic characteristics of the proposed closed loop observer-based sensorless speed-controlled IM drives.

40|$|The {{human hand}} {{is an amazing}} tool. It {{is one of the}} most {{important}} interface between us and the world by allowing us to touch and manipulate it. Its complexity is certainly similar to its usefulness. To control the manipulatory and the exploratory functions of the hand, the brain needs to collect, to store, and to process adequately a considerable quantity of data about the objects and the environment. When gripping an object with the index finger and the thumb only, all this information is used to control the kinematics and the dynamics of the movement. In some situations, we have to manipulate unbalanced objects that produce <b>load</b> <b>torques</b> at the finger/object interface. The objective of the present work was to further investigate the control strategies during object manipulation in presence of <b>load</b> <b>torques.</b> The results show that the grip force adaptation is slowed down when a <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> is present. The reproduction of a slower adaptation when manipulating torques under microgravity suggests that the presence of <b>load</b> <b>torques</b> experienced during movement may alter our internal estimates of required grip force. The last hypothesis tested was that the difference in control strategies when a <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> is present comes from a poor ability to discriminate <b>load</b> <b>torques.</b> Indeed, a poor ability to discriminate <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> was found during the active task.
