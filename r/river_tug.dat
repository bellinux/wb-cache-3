5|$|On 6 April 1941, {{when the}} World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began, Morava was based at Stara Kanjiža on the Tisza river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division. This force {{was responsible for}} the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the 7th Infantry Division Potiska. The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the <b>river</b> <b>tug</b> R-XXI, the river transport Senta, and a few mobilised customs motorboats, based further south on the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, Morava withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, Poručnik bojnog broda Božidar Aranđelović, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a Luftwaffe Oberstleutnant. On 10 April, Morava was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the 2nd Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from Bačka and Baranja. On the evening of 11 April, Morava anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors Vardar and Sava, and Aranđelović took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.|$|E

50|$|<b>River</b> <b>tugs</b> {{are also}} {{referred}} to as towboats or pushboats. Their hull designs would make open ocean operation dangerous. <b>River</b> <b>tugs</b> usually do not have any significant hawser or winch. Their hulls feature a flat front or bow to line up with the rectangular stern of the barge, often with large pushing knees.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{features}} {{a collection of}} boats including narrowboats, river barges, canal and <b>river</b> <b>tugs,</b> and a steam-powered dredger. There is also a steam crane and heavy oil engine {{in the setting of}} a canal repair yard, complete with working machine shop, forge and weighbridge, and a hydraulic accumulator. The museum uses modern interactive techniques and hands on exhibits, which includes a model of canal.|$|R
50|$|The 1000-kilometre Kinshasa-Kisangani route on the Congo River is {{the longest}} and best-known. It is {{operated}} by <b>river</b> <b>tugs</b> pushing several barges lashed together, and {{for the hundreds of}} passengers and traders these function like small floating towns. Rather than mooring at riverside communities along the route, traders come out by canoe and small boat alongside the river barges and transfer goods on the move.|$|R
50|$|Ordered by the Heereswaffenamt in 1935 {{for use by}} German Army engineers, the Landwasserschlepper (or LWS) was {{intended}} as a lightweight <b>river</b> <b>tug</b> with some capacity to operate on land.|$|E
5000|$|Built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1849 as Yankee, {{the fast}} side-wheel <b>river</b> <b>tug</b> was {{purchased}} at New Orleans on 9 May 1861 by Capt. L. Rousseau, CSN, then strengthened and fitted for {{service in the}} Confederate Navy, and renamed Jackson.|$|E
50|$|Most {{waterway}} routes do {{not operate}} to regular schedules. It is common for an operator to moor a barge at a riverside town and collect freight and passengers {{over a period of}} weeks before hiring a <b>river</b> <b>tug</b> to tow or push the barge to its destination.|$|E
50|$|Zelenodolsk {{also built}} the large missile-armed surface effect ships of the Dergach class (designed by the Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau in St. Petersburg), {{as well as}} some naval auxiliaries. It has {{generally}} also had at least one civilian ship type in production, including Zelenodolsk-class <b>river</b> <b>tugs</b> in the 1950s, Meteor-type passenger hydrofoils (designed in Nizhniy Novgorod) and Caspian Sea trawlers during the 1960s, and 3,700-ton Tatarstan-class refrigerator ships for the fishing industry in the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|His {{discovery}} of Kauri pine in the Woolann area of north Cooloola provided {{the main source}} of timber for the Dundathu Sawmill. By 1865, Pettigrew's men were using bullock teams to drag Kauri pine logs from Woolann (the area around Lake Poona). Early timber-getters are recorded as using a corduroy crossing of tea-tree branches and saplings to cross the tidal flats in the northern Cooloola area. Pettigrew's men dragged the logs to the mouth of Seary's Creek, tied them into large rafts and towed them through the Tin Can Bay Inlet, Great Sandy Strait and up the Mary <b>River.</b> <b>Tugs</b> were then used to haul the rafts of timber to Dundathu.|$|R
50|$|Wheeler {{was born}} in Chaumont, New York {{attended}} the common schools. In 1864, he moved with his parents to East Saginaw, Michigan and attended the Saginaw High School and the Ypsilanti State Normal School (now (Eastern Michigan University). He engaged in boatbuilding and moved to West Bay City in 1876. He became master of the Saginaw <b>River</b> <b>Tug</b> Association and engaged in shipbuilding at the Bay Cities for many years.|$|E
50|$|The Great North <b>River</b> <b>Tug</b> Boat Race and Competition, or {{as it is}} more {{commonly}} known the New York Tug Boat Race or the Hudson River Tugboat Race, was first held in 1991. The event put on by the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and headed by Captain Jerry Roberts. The original course started 79th Street Boat Basin and ended at Pier 86 or as it is also known the Intrepid Pier. The Intrepid Museum held the event for its first 13 years. Captain Jerry Roberts left the Intrepid Museum staff after the 2004 event.|$|E
5000|$|Ten Seconds {{from the}} Sun (2005) {{is a novel}} about a Thames <b>river</b> <b>tug</b> boat captain who as a 12-year-old was sent to jail for murder but on {{completing}} his sentence was released and allowed to rejoin society, until a car accident brings him together with a figure from his past, his former partner in crime and half-sister Celestine. [...] The Observer found it at once a [...] "clever psychological thriller" [...] and a deeper reflection on guilt, memory, truth, and other issues. [...] The Telegraph found it slightly overburdened by research but a [...] "tightly written" [...] exploration of a societal taboo. The novel won the Weishanhu Prize in China for the best foreign novel.|$|E
5|$|In October 1920, the {{question}} was finally settled when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye provided for {{the transfer of the}} obsolete coastal defence ship , eight s, four older s, the repair ship Cyclop, the water carriers Najade and Nixe, the salvage vessel Gigant, three tugs, the yacht Dalmat, four hulks, four river monitors (Bosna, Enns, Körös and Bodrog), one motor launch, three <b>river</b> <b>tugs,</b> 16 small tenders, and a significant number of coal and oil lighters. All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921. As the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were the 12 torpedo boats, the new nation had to build its naval forces from scratch.|$|R
25|$|Kentucky is {{the only}} U.S. state to have a {{continuous}} border of rivers running along three of its sides—the Mississippi River to the west, the Ohio River to the north, and the Big Sandy <b>River</b> and <b>Tug</b> Fork to the east. Its major internal rivers include the Kentucky River, Tennessee River, Cumberland River, Green River and Licking River.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Yugoslav Navy in its {{organization}} had a River flotilla {{composed of a}} command ship Cer based in Novi Sad, one monitor group in Dubovac, four mining-barrage groups in Bezdan, Stara Kanjiza and Senta, Sremski Karlovci and Smederevo and Đerdap sector command in Tekija and Donji Milanovac. The main vessels were four large, heavily armed and armoured river monitors. They were used to patrol the Danube, Drava and Sava rivers in the northern parts of Yugoslavia and its border with Hungary. These monitors, the Drava, Sava, Morava and Vardar had been inherited from the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{at the end of}} First World War. All were of around 400-500t with a main armament of two 120mm guns, two or three 66mm guns, 120mm mortars, 40mm AA guns and machine guns. The River fleet also had two river patrol boats built in 1929, Graničar and Stražar, and three <b>river</b> <b>tugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The works {{employed}} {{as many as}} 350 workers manufacturing {{a wide range of}} marine, mining, civil engineering, railway and general manufacturing components including engines and boilers. The foundry prospered despite high wages and the lack of raw materials it became known for high quality products that competed successfully with any imported articles. By the time of his retirement (shortly before his death) The foundry was one of the largest employers in the Victoria and was responsible for casting the first bell and lamp-posts in the colony. It also cast the boiler of the first train to run in Australia on the Hobson's Bay Railway and successfully launched the first iron vessel, a <b>river</b> <b>tug</b> 109 feet (33 m) in length. This event was cheered by over 3000 spectators. The business was carried on by his sons after Henry's death.|$|E
50|$|The {{event of}} the year in this small town is the Great <b>River</b> <b>Tug</b> Fest, held since 1987 on the second full weekend in August. Following a {{fireworks}} display on Friday night, the Mississippi River is closed on Saturday afternoon. The tug-of-war is made up of 10 men teams of 20 and one woman's team of 25. After a large rope is pulled across the river to Le Claire, Iowa, a tug of war takes place. The side with the most wins gets bragging rights for the year, along with the traveling alabaster trophy. Port Byron, the 2016 champion, holds an overall record of 19-11 in the competition. The rope used for the tug is 2700 feet in length and weighs about 700 lbs. Tug Fest is the only event in the United States that allows the Mississippi River to be closed down. The women on the Illinois side are the only undefeated team in Tug Fest history.|$|E

5|$|In September 1923, new {{regulations}} were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in Zemun, near Belgrade. The Navy Department, {{now known as}} Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions. The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, {{and by the end}} of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four Kaiman-class torpedo boats, six s, four Schichau-class minesweepers, the water carrier Perun (ex-Cyclop), the yachts Vila (ex-Dalmat) and Lada (ex-Quarnero), the training ship Vila Velebit, the salvage vessel Moćni (ex-Gigant), and four tugs. Kumbor (ex-Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf) had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as Vardar, Drava, Morava and Sava respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three <b>river</b> <b>tugs.</b>|$|R
40|$|The “Charles H. Bradley” (126653) {{was built}} in 1890 by F. W. Wheeler & Co. of West Bay City, Michigan. On July 25, 1890, the wooden {{propeller}} vessel was first enrolled at Port Huron, MI. In May 1896, she was grounded on a sandbar in the St. Louis <b>River.</b> Four <b>tugs</b> attempted to start her to no avail. On October 9, 1931, the vessel burned near the Portage Lake Entry of Sturgeon River, Lake Superior...|$|R
60|$|The mate {{was leaning}} {{against the side of the}} schooner, idly {{watching}} a few red-coated linesmen lounging on the Tower Quay. Careful mariners were getting out their side-lights, and careless lightermen were progressing by easy bumps from craft to craft on their way up the <b>river.</b> A <b>tug,</b> half burying itself in its own swell, rushed panting by, and a faint scream came from aboard an approaching skiff as it tossed in the wash.|$|R
25|$|Nearly a {{year later}} in mid October 1928 while coming in across the Richmond bar the Nimbin touched the {{northern}} wall lightly causing the steering gear carried away and some slight damage was done {{to one of the}} plate at the water line.

The steamer proceeded up the <b>river,</b> no <b>tug</b> was available to help the disabled vessel and had the accident happened further out the steamer may have become a wreck.|$|R
50|$|Her {{conversion}} to a barge included removing the vessel's original engines, and cutting a large notch in her stern.As a barge the vessel used two different barge-tug coupling systems.Initially she was {{pushed by the}} Atlantic Hickory. In 1999 her notch was converted to the Bark <b>River</b> Articulated <b>Tug</b> Barge Coupling System. The tug Jane Ann IV has large pins which mate into sockets in the Sarah Spencer's notch.

On November 2, near the mouth of the Rappahannock <b>River,</b> the <b>tug</b> surprised three men attempting to violate the blockade in a canoe. Teaser took them prisoner and turned their contraband over to pro-Union Virginians living on Gwynn's Island.
