5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E

25|$|Research In Motion Limited {{was founded}} in March 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin. At the time, Lazaridis was an {{engineering}} student at the University of Waterloo while Fregin was an engineering student at the University of Windsor. In 1988, RIM became the first wireless data technology developer in North America and the first company outside Scandinavia to develop connectivity products for Mobitex wireless packet-switched data communications networks. In 1990, RIM introduced the DigiSync Film KeyKode Reader. In 1991, RIM introduced the first Mobitex protocol converter. In 1992, RIM introduced the first Mobitex point-of-sale solution, a protocol converter box that interfaced with existing point-of-sale terminal equipment to enable wireless communication. In 1993, RIM introduced the RIMGate, the first general purpose Mobitex X.25 gateway. In the same year, RIM launched Ericsson Mobidem AT and Intel wireless modem containing RIM modem firmware. In 1994, RIM introduced the first Mobitex mobile point-of-sale terminal. In the same year, RIM received the Emmy Award for Technical Innovation and the KPMG High Technology Award. In 1995, RIM introduced Freedom, the first Type II PCMCIA <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> for Mobitex.|$|E

50|$|SATELLINE-1870E and SATELLINE-EASy 869 modems {{operate in}} the Europe-wide license-free 868 - 870 MHz band. Both have a maximum {{transmit}} power 500 mW, which enables coverage up to 2.5 km. By setting up a network with repeater <b>radio</b> <b>modems,</b> much longer distances can be achieved. The <b>radio</b> <b>modems</b> can accommodate point-to-point as well as point-to-multipoint communications.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>modems</b> {{transfer}} data wirelessly {{across a}} range of up to tens of kilometres.Using <b>radio</b> <b>modems</b> is a modern way to create Private Radio Networks (PRN). Private radio networks are used in critical industrial applications, when real-time data communication is needed. <b>Radio</b> <b>modems</b> enable user to be independent of telecommunication or satellite network operators. In most cases users use licensed frequencies either in the UHF or VHF bands. In certain areas licensed frequencies may be reserved for a given user, thus ensuring that there is less likelihood of radio interference from other RF transmitters. Also licence free frequencies are available in most countries, enabling easy implementation, {{but at the same time}} other users may use the same frequency, thus making it possible that a given frequency is blocked.Typical users for <b>radio</b> <b>modems</b> are: Land survey differential GPS, fleet management applications, SCADA applications (utility distribution networks), automated meter reading (AMR), telemetry applications and many more. Since applications usually require high reliability of data transfer and very high uptime, radio performance plays a key role. Factors influencing radio performance are: antenna height and type, the sensitivity of the radio, the output power of the radio and the complete system design.|$|R
2500|$|In 1996, RIM {{introduced}} the Inter@ctive Pager, the first two-way messaging pager, and the RIM 900 OEM <b>radio</b> <b>modem.</b> The company worked with RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson [...] {{to turn the}} Ericsson-developed Mobitex wireless data network into a two-way paging and wireless e-mail network. Pivotal in this development was {{the release of the}} Inter@ctive Pager 950, which started shipping in August 1998. About the size of a bar of soap, this device competed against the Skytel two-way paging network developed by Motorola.|$|E
50|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> transmits data over a {{wireless}} connection to another <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> over a point-to-point or -multipoint link. Radio modems {{are independent of}} mobile and satellite network operators and no cost is thus associated with transferring data. Private <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> networks can use either unlicensed (e.g. ISM band) or licensed frequency bands (UHF, VHF).|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} {{range of}} a <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> varies depending on the transmission power, antenna gain and mast height, and environment. In rural areas a 1 W <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> with a line-of-sight radio link may range over 20 km and even up to 50 km in exceptionally amicable environments. In dense metropolitan areas, a corresponding range may vary from several kilometers to over 10 km. With a 10 W <b>radio</b> <b>modem,</b> a range of up to 80 km can be reached in favorable environments. By using <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> repeaters, much broader areas can be covered.|$|E

50|$|The UHF <b>radio</b> <b>modems</b> worked {{similar to}} walkie-talkies, but sent data, not voice. It could send or receive, but not both at same time, {{which is known}} as half-duplex. The data was communicated in bursts of 2 kilobytes.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{connection}} {{has been made}} the job details are transmitted in the data format defined in the Turbo Dispatch Format Manual, and the call terminated. A dedicated communications computer will usually be employed to constantly monitor the <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> via the RS232 port. This will operate a program TD.EXE, running under Windows. Data received from the <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> will be transferred to an incoming message queue on the other computer, for subsequent automatic processing by the main job taking software (a maximum of 5 seconds delay). An audible sound will also be generated by the communications computer.|$|E
50|$|The SATELLAR Digital System <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> family, {{which was}} {{introduced}} in November 2008, broadened the offering to TCP/IP based applications. It {{is based on a}} Linux operating systems and enables customer specific applications.|$|E
50|$|In practice, RTK systems use {{a single}} base station {{receiver}} {{and a number}} of mobile units. The base station re-broadcasts the phase of the carrier that it observes, and the mobile units compare their own phase measurements with the one received from the base station. There are several ways to transmit a correction signal from base station to mobile station. The most popular way to achieve real-time, low-cost signal transmission is to use a <b>radio</b> <b>modem,</b> typically in the UHF band. In most countries, certain frequencies are allocated specifically for RTK purposes. Most land survey equipment has a built-in UHF band <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> as a standard option.|$|E
50|$|MORSE {{system is}} a unique {{communication}} system developed by RACOM. The system has been primarily designed for narrow band <b>radio</b> <b>modems.</b> However, it has been extended for the next communication channels afterwards: IP (any network using UDP/IP, e.g. Internet) and GPRS, EDGE, UMTS.|$|R
50|$|The Turbo Dispatch {{application}} was initially restricted to employing the MASC protocol of the Transcomm Mobile Data Network. This protocol was adopted because it eliminates {{the complexity of}} retries which would result from employing a session based protocol on the <b>radio</b> <b>modems</b> e.g. Hayes or X.28.|$|R
50|$|Edholm's law, {{named for}} Phil Edholm, says the wireless, nomadic and wired network {{capabilities}} will converge. Soon, even slower communications channels like cellphones and <b>radio</b> <b>modems</b> will eclipse {{the capacity of}} early Ethernet, thanks to upcoming standards known as UMTS and MIMO, which will boost bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage.|$|R
50|$|As {{there is}} no de facto {{standard}} for long range narrow band data communication, cross brand compatibility is an important aspect for <b>radio</b> <b>modem</b> deployers. In 2009, SATEL introduced product variants that are compatible with products from other manufacturers who use the so-called PCC protocol.|$|E
