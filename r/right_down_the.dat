By the time dawn broke he was still two miles from the town. Washington sent 350 men under the command of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer to destroy the bridge over Stony Creek in order to delay Cornwallis's army when he found out that Washington had escaped. Shortly before 8:00 AM, Washington wheeled the rest of the army to the <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> unused road. First in the column went General John Sullivan's division consisting of Arthur St. Clair's and Isaac Sherman's brigades. Following them were John Cadwalader's brigade and then Daniel Hitchcock's.|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin {{received}} the opening kickoff and marched <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field and {{scored on a}} 4-yard touchdown run by quarterback Joel Stave. On the Minutemen's first offensive play, Wisconsin's linebacker Brendan Kelly forced a fumble that was recovered by fellow linebacker Ethan Armstrong. On the very next play, Joel Stave threw an interception. The Badgers managed a 21-yard field goal by Kyle French {{before the end of}} the first quarter for a 10–0 lead. After a UMass punt, Wisconsin missed a 40-yard field goal and then UMass missed a 47-yard field goal.

25|$|Wisconsin {{opened the}} second half with the ball and once again marched <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field and Melvin Gordon scored his third {{touchdown}} of the game on a 15-yard run. Wisconsin put some more points on the board late {{in the third quarter}} with a 27-yard field goal by Kyle French.

With Purdue unable to move the ball and Wisconsin just running the clock down, the game was over by a score of 41–10. Wisconsin stuffed the stats sheet as they out gained Purdue 546 yards to 180 yards. Wisconsin out rushed Purdue by a clip of 388 yards to 45 yards.

25|$|The 2013 Big Ten season {{kicked off}} with the Purdue Boilermakers {{squaring}} {{off with the}} Wisconsin Badgers. Both teams started off a little slow as they exchanged punts on their first possessions. After another Purdue punt the Badgers took over at their own 5-yard line. Just 8 plays and 95 yards later, Wisconsin got on the board first with a RB Melvin Gordon 5-yard touchdown run. After another Boilermakers three-and-out, the Badgers struck again as RB James White scored on 70-yard touchdown run. At {{the end of the}} first quarter the Badgers led 14–0. Purdue then got on the board on a broken play where QB Rob Henry scrambled for a 22-yard touchdown run. On the next Wisconsin drive, QB Joel Stave's pass was intercepted by CB Ricardo Allen and returned to the Wisconsin 10-yard line. The Badgers defense was able to hold the Boilermakers to a field goal to make the score 14–10 Wisconsin. The Badgers then marched <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field and scored on a Milevin Gordon 27-yard touchdown run. After another Purdue three-and-out, the Badgers again moved the ball with ease against the Boilermaker defense but stalled out and settled for a 32-yard field goal by K Kyle French. Wisconsin led 24–10 at the half.|$|E
25|$|The Cougars first {{match of}} the MVC Championships was a rematch of last Saturday's MVC finale versus Loyola. As {{in the first}} meeting, the game was an epic {{struggle}} between the two top defenses in the Valley. In the first half, the Cougars' offense outshot the Ramblers 8–2, while in the second half, Loyola's offense came to the fore, leading 6 shots to 3. Both goalkeepers and their defenders, {{among the best in}} the NCAA, kept clean sheets through regulation time. SIUE seemed to gain an advantage when Loyola went a man down due to a red card in the 86th minute, but the Ramblers continued to force the action, and the Cougars were unable to formulate an effective offensive plan. As in the teams' first meeting, the game went into golden goal extra time tied 0–0, and, after two ten-minute overtimes, the tie still stood, leaving the result to a penalty shoot-out. Both teams made their first three shots count, then both missed the fourth with high shots. Loyola's fifth shot was up to the MVC Player of the Year, who also missed high. The Cougars' team captain Ledbetter then fired a shot <b>right</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> middle, past the Loyola keeper to give the Cougars the win and set them up to defend their tournament championship in the Sunday title game.|$|E

500|$|Three {{hundred and}} two {{aircraft}} from eight different airfields in the Moresby and Dobodura areas, made a rendezvous over Tsili Tsili at 10:07, flying through clouds, {{passes in the}} mountains, and over the top.

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them.

[...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them?
