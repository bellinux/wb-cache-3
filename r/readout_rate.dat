5000|$|A {{positron}} annihilating with {{an electron}} yields {{two or three}} photons. The positron detector, comprising 16 rows each containing 12 scintillating, pure CsI crystals, is designed to detect the two-photon events, consisting of two 511 keV photons which are always emitted back-to-back. The energy resolution of the detector is 18% FWHM at 511 keV, and the photo-peak detection efficiency for single photons is about 20%. The maximum <b>readout</b> <b>rate</b> of the whole detector is about 40 Hz. Ancillary detectors include large scintillator paddles external to the magnet, and a thin, position sensitive, silicon diode through which the incident antiproton beam passes before entering the catching trap. To produce antihydrogen atoms, a positron well in the mixing region is filled with about [...] positrons and allowed to cool to the ambient temperature (15 K). The nested trap is then formed around the positron well. Next, approximately 104 antiprotons are launched into the mixing region by pulsing the trap from one potential configuration (dashed line, Fig. 1b) to another (solid line). The mixing time is 190 s, after which all particles are dumped and the process repeated. Events triggering the imaging silicon detector (three sides hit in the outer layer) initiate readout of both the silicon and the CsI modules.|$|E
