5|$|MD234 curves {{southeast}} {{through the}} hamlet of Budds Creek, where the highway meets {{the southern end}} of MD236 (Thompson Corner Road) and passes three motorsports facilities: Maryland International Raceway, Budds Creek Motocross, and Potomac Speedway. The state highway continues southeast, passing by Wicomico Shores Country Club and its associated residential area separated from the highway by a large tract of forest. MD234 crosses Hayden Run and passes through Chaptico, where the highway intersects MD238 at a roundabout; MD238 heads northeast as Chaptico Road and southwest as Maddox Road. The state highway passes another historic home, Deep Falls, on the way to Clements. At Clements, MD234 intersects MD242 (Colton Point Road), which leads south to the site of Maryland's First Landing at St. Clement's Island. The state highway crosses Clements Creek and heads east through farmland, crossing Nelson <b>Run</b> <b>right</b> before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD5 (Point Lookout Road) on the western edge of Leonardtown.|$|E

25|$|From the 52 deg. S. lat. up to Strait of Magellan, {{the western}} {{slope of the}} Cordillera does not, {{properly}} speaking, exist.

This region is not fully explored, and all that is known of it is that it is principally composed of the same rocks as the Fuegian Andes, and that the greater part of its upper valleys is occupied by glaciers that reach down to the sea amid dense forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama Number 96, a {{nighttime}} series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network Ten, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with {{such topics as}} homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape-within-marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, Number 96 had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of Number 96 prompted the creation of The Box, which rivaled {{it in terms of}} nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered The Box to be a more slickly produced and better written show than Number 96. The Box also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to <b>run</b> <b>right</b> after Number 96. For 1974 Number 96 was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year The Box occupied the number two spot.|$|E

25|$|The Falcons {{started off}} {{the third quarter}} with an 8-play, 71-yard drive, {{including}} Bartkowski's passes to Floyd Hodge and Alfred Jenkins for gains of 25 and 22 yards. Faced with fourth down on the Vikings 17-yard line, Atlanta managed to fool the Minnesota defense with a fake field goal play. Backup quarterback Mike Moroski, the holder on field goal plays, took the snap and started <b>run</b> <b>right,</b> but then pitched the ball to kicker Mick Luckhurst, who raced 17 {{yards for a touchdown}} (the only rush attempt of his career) to give his team a 14-13 lead. The situation got even better for Atlanta just two minutes later when safety Bob Glazebrook intercepted Kramer's pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. However, the Vikings managed to cut their deficit down to one score {{before the end of the}} third quarter with a 70-yard drive that included Kramer's 18-yard completion to tight end Joe Senser. Danmier finished off the series with a 39-yard field goal, making the score 21-16 going into the final quarter.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{released}} his twenty-third single, [...] "Say No More", for Giant in early 2001. It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it {{makes you want to}} <b>run</b> <b>right</b> out and hug the one you love." [...] Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being [...] "full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés." ...|$|E
500|$|By then, {{the rivalry}} between the FW boats and the BC Express boats was quite heated and it soon {{came down to}} a race. The Conveyor had proved itself to be swifter than its sister ship Operator, as had the BX proven swifter than the BC Express, so one day in July, the Conveyor's Captain Shannon {{challenged}} Captain Browne to a race to Quesnel from Soda Creek. The rules were rather odd, as the BX was still obligated to stop and deliver her mail at several different landings whereas the Conveyor had no such obligation and could <b>run</b> <b>right</b> through. As the race progressed, it soon became obvious to all that the BX was the faster boat, as she had stayed ahead {{for most of the}} race, despite having to stop several times. At one landing the BX had more mail to deliver than usual and had fallen behind the Conveyor, but she soon caught up and was passing her opponent [...] when Captain Johnson rammed the BX with the Conveyor. Captain Browne immediately pulled over to inspect his boat for damages and the Conveyor pulled ahead again. Fortunately Browne soon discovered that the Conveyor had hit the BX just where the shear of her guards met {{and that there was no}} serious damage. In fact, when Browne arrived in Quesnel, he had almost caught up with the Conveyor again.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} common types of {{premature}} explosions. [...] In the first, the warhead exploded {{just as it}} armed. [...] These premature explosions were easily discerned by the submarine because the torpedo exploded before it {{had a chance to}} reach its target. [...] In the second, the warhead exploded just before reaching the target ship but far enough away that it did no damage. [...] The skipper, looking through the periscope, could see the torpedo <b>run</b> <b>right</b> to the ship and see the explosion; the crew could hear the high order explosion. [...] Everything would look OK except that the target ship would get away with little or no damage. Sometimes the submarine command would hear about these premature explosions from intercepted enemy communications.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan's second conference {{game was}} a 12 to 5 win over Illinois at Detroit. The {{game was played}} after heavy rains had turned the field at the Detroit Athletic Club into [...] "a veritable sea of mud." [...] Michigan won the game {{in front of a}} crowd of 3,500 spectators. After five minutes of play, [...] "the men were {{plastered}} with mud," [...] and the wet field contributed to poor footing and difficulties handling the ball. [...] The Wolverines won despite what one writer described as [...] "ragged play" [...] that included a number of penalties for offsides and [...] "keeping of hands." [...] Clifford Barabee scored Michigan's first touchdown as he was shoved into the endzone by his teammates. Illinois' only score came in the first half after Michigan's fullback, Alanson Weeks, fumbled, and Illinois player picked it up and ran 50 yards for a touchdown. Michigan completed the scoring in the second half with a touchdown drive that included runs of 10 and 15 yards by John McLean and additional gains by Neil Snow, Charles Widman and Allen Steckle. Widman scored the touchdown on an end <b>run.</b> <b>Right</b> end John Bennett successfully completed both of his point after touchdown kicks for the Wolverines.|$|E
2500|$|Tashbaan: The {{capital city}} of Calormen, an ancient and {{powerful}} empire south across a desert {{from the land of}} Narnia. Tashbaan is a great city built on an island in the delta of a large river {{in the northern part of}} Calormen, just two days' ride south of Archenland (the small country between Narnia and Calormen) but several weeks ride from the southern parts of Calormen. It is described as one of the wonders of the world. The city is a hot and crowded place, though with fine streets, magnificent palaces, and gardens. It is built on a natural slope, rising to the palace of the Tisroc and the great Temple of Tash at the pinnacle of the hill. The palace of the Tisroc is described as magnificent beyond description and opens onto gardens that <b>run</b> <b>right</b> down to the river wall. Tashbaan is surrounded by a strong wall that rises out of the water and is reached by long bridges from both banks, providing the only place where crossing the great river of Calormen is possible for many miles. The banks of the river are lined with gardens and country houses. The Tombs of the Ancient Kings, believed by the Carlomens to be haunted, lie directly across the river from Tashbaan, on the edge of the desert. The city's name is clearly derived from the name of the god Tash; Paul Ford identifies baan with the Arabic for [...] "house of". (HHB) ...|$|E
