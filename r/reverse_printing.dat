40|$|Today, {{printing}} and <b>reverse</b> <b>printing</b> (scanning, OCR, logical labeling etc.) technologies have become quite mature and thus allow {{for an easy}} transition of documents between physical and electronic world. However, there is no technology today which supports the lossless interpretation of paper-based user inter-action with direct effects upon the electronic represen-tation of that document. The HyperPrinting environment tries to fill in this gap and thus accounts for the personal favors of a ma-jority of office workers: Not only managers and know-ledge workers prefer to read longer documents, ar-ticles or news from paper {{in contrast to a}} computer monitor or handheld computer. With the help of HyperPrinting, users can annotate, send notes or in-itiate tasks and it thus offers a completely new para-digm in the usage and treatment of paper documents. As a side-effect, the use of HyperPrinting builds up a document repository which is not only searchable by full text but also by meta-information, which in turn is depending on the selected user scenario...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Branching Instructions, Errors of Commission, Errors of Omission, Self-administered Questionnaire Design {{combine to}} affect respondents' {{perception}} and comprehension of visual information. Verbal language {{refers to the}} words on a questionnaire; numeric refers to the numbers; symbolic refers to symbols on a questionnaire, such as arrows; and the graphic refers to the color, brightness, shape, and location of the information. Branching instructions were used as an initial test of this hypothesis because they yield objective measures of performance. A classroom experiment with college students, in which three of the languages (the verbal, symbolic, and graphic) were altered in two distinct ways (the Prevention and Detection methods) and tested against the Census 2000 method of branching, provided initial {{evidence in support of}} this hypothesis. This report documents an experiment conducted in Census 2000 in which the two branching instructions from the classroom experiment were revised, andtwo additional instructions were developed (<b>reverse</b> <b>printing</b> the instruction and substituting the words "go to" for "skip to") and tested against the Census 2000 version...|$|E
