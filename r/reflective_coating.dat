For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black <b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors are {{manufactured}} by applying a <b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> to a suitable substrate. The most common substrate is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The <b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass {{on one side and}} the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E

25|$|A {{protective}} overcoat {{is usually}} applied before the mirror {{is removed from}} the vacuum, because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air. Front silvered mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are optical mirrors such as mangin mirrors that are second surface mirrors (<b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> on the rear surface) as part of their optical designs, usually to correct optical aberrations.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror {{began in}} 1979, {{starting}} with a blank manufactured by Corning from their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each one inch (25.4mm) thick, sandwiching a honeycomb lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed {{by the end of}} 1981; it was washed using 2,400 gallons (9,100 L) of hot, deionized water and then received a <b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> of [...] 65nm-thick aluminum and a protective coating of 25nm-thick magnesium fluoride.|$|E

The Cup, originally built for Gr.N homologation of the Clio 172 was differentiated from the [...] "non cup" [...] 172 by its lack {{of many of the}} luxuries included in the regular car. Instead of the leather / Alcantara seats instead the same style seat was upholstered in a durable but low-cost fabric, the automatic Xenon headlights were replaced by manually controlled halogen units and the washer jets replaced with blanks. The rain sensing wipers and solar <b>reflective</b> <b>coated</b> windscreen were also omitted from the 172 Cup.|$|R
2500|$|In some applications, {{generally}} {{those that}} are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, mirrors are made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. For technical applications such as laser mirrors, the <b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> is typically applied by vacuum deposition on the front surface of the substrate. This eliminates refraction and double reflections, also called [...] "ghost reflections" [...] (a weak reflection {{from the surface of}} the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal), and reduces absorption of light by the mirror. Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for infrared mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new. A protective transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent oxidation of the reflective layer. Applications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where wide bandwidth is not essential, use dielectric coatings, which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.999% over a narrow range of wavelengths.|$|E
2500|$|Manuel Billeter {{served as}} {{director}} of photography for the series, after doing the same for Jessica Jones. He worked with director Paul McGuigan to establish {{the look of the}} show in the first two episodes, with Coker hiring McGuigan based on his direction of the Sherlock episode [...] "A Scandal in Belgravia". Coker was delighted to learn how little CGI McGuigan used to craft the visuals of that episode, and wanted the same approach for Luke Cage, [...] "just old school camera stuff. He brought a very analogue perspective, analogue feel to the show." [...] McGuigan, Coker explained, directed [...] "every scene [...] long takes, from multiple takes over and over again. We would run an entire eight page scene almost like a play, so when it comes together it’s seamless." [...] McGuigan was inspired by the works of photographers Gordon Parks, Tony Ray-Jones, and Jack Garofalo. Billeter looked to differentiate the look of Luke Cage from Jessica Jones, using modified gels on lights, and saturating and warming colors in color correction to give Harlem [...] "a more glowing look". Coker noted that the series' has a color scheme of yellow, brown, amber, and gold, in contrast to the [...] "violet tint" [...] Billeter gave Jessica Jones to reflect that series' villain, the Purple Man. The series was shot on Netflix's standard 4K cameras, with Billeter pairing them with Panavision Primo lenses that were [...] "custom treated with a <b>reflective</b> <b>coating</b> in between the glass elements in the interior of the lens, causing more flares and bringing down the contrast in addition to very slightly de-focusing them" [...] in order to [...] "add something magic, less controlled and more cinematic". Billeter filmed Colter with a lot of low angles to make him look [...] "even more heroic", and kept the camera close to him with Harlem in the background so that Cage [...] "is always the dominant force in his shots, but he also remains a part of the terrain.

40|$|A new {{optical sensor}} {{technique}} {{based on a}} sensor film with arrays of hair-like flexible micropillars on the surface is presented to measure the temporal and spatial wall shear stress field in boundary layer flows. The sensor principle uses the pillar tip deflection in the viscous sublayer as a direct measure of the wall shear stress. The pillar images are recorded simultaneously as a grid of small bright spots by high-speed imaging of the illuminated sensor film. Two different ways of illumination were tested, one of which uses {{the fact that the}} transparent pillars act as optical microfibres, which guide the light to the pillar tips. The other method uses pillar tips which were <b>reflective</b> <b>coated.</b> The tip displacement field of the pillars is measured by image processing with subpixel accuracy. With a typical displacement resolution on the order of 0. 2 μm, the minimum resolvable wall friction value is τw≈ 20 mPa.

Mirrored sunglasses are one-way mirrors.|$|R
50|$|Each {{concentrator}} uses {{two pounds}} of plastic, and measures 10 {{feet in diameter}} and four feet in depth. The front face of the concentrator is clear to allow the light to pass through: the back half of the concentrator is <b>reflective</b> (<b>coated</b> in a very thin film of aluminum) to form a giant parabolic mirror that concentrates light about 300 to 400 times, while using up to 400 times less solar cell material than traditional flat-panel PV systems.The concentrators, like a magnifying glass, must point directly at the sun to work. The curved reflector serves to concentrate the light from a very large surface area onto a small focal point inside the plastic shell where a solar receiver sits (solar cells). All of the light that is striking the concentrator across the full circular area is reflected to the same spot, {{as long as the}} concentrator is pointed at the sun. The wide hemisphere faces the sun.

40|$|A microlens array (MLA) based see-through, front {{projection}} screen, {{which can be}} used in direct projection head-up displays (HUD), color teleprompters and bidirectional interactive smart windows, is evaluated for various performance metrics in transmission mode. The screen structure consists of a partially <b>reflective</b> <b>coated</b> MLA buried between refractive-index-matched layers of epoxy as reported in Ref [1]. The reflected light is expanded by the MLA to create an eyebox for the user. The brightness gain of the screen can be varied by changing the numerical aperture of the microlenses. Thus, using high gain designs, a low-power projector coupled with the screen can produce high-brightness and even 3 D images as the polarization is maintained at the screen. The impact of the partially reflective coatings on the transmitted light in terms of resolution and modulation transfer function associated with the screen is studied. A condition similar to the Rayleigh criteria for diffraction-limited imaging is discussed for the microlens arrays and the associated coating layers. The optical path difference between the light transmitted from the center and the edges of each microlens caused by the reflective layer coatings should not exceed lambda/ 4.

40|$|Abstract. Traditional mirror manufacturing, {{particularly}} for astronomical purposes, requires substantial lead time, {{due to the}} nature of the materials and the grinding/polishing process. We propose a new technique for rapid, low-cost production of large, lightweight precision optics by fusing several technologies which in combination we call frozen membrane mirror tech-nology (FMMT). FMMT combines well-understood subsystem technolo-gies, including electrostatic control of membrane mirrors, adaptive optics, wavefront sensing and control, and inflatable structures technology to shorten production time. The basic technique is to control the surface of a <b>reflective</b> <b>coated</b> membrane mirror with electrostatic actuation and wave-front sensor feedback and freeze the membrane shape. We discuss the details of the concept and present results of early lab testing. We focus on the optical regime, but this technology has applicability from the micro-wave to x-ray spectral bands. Starting with a flexible membrane mirror, one can envision techniques for deployment of large apertures in space. © The Authors.
