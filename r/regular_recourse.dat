The author speaks of an [...] "invisible monastery", [...] "built of all those souls whom, because of their sincere efforts to open themselves to his fire and his light, the Holy Spirit has enabled to have a deep understanding of the painful division among Christians; an awareness of this in these souls has given rise to continuous suffering and as a result, <b>regular</b> <b>recourse</b> to prayer and penance".|$|E
40|$|I {{report a}} study of the {{internet}} sources that young people (aged 15 - 25) trust, how trust is determined in such sources, and how credibility is moderated by frequent participation in social networking sites. The study confirms the &quot;trustee role &quot; assumed by teachers and educators, while extending this trustee role into the New Digital Media (NDM). The study reveals dependence on the traditional media and suspicion and ambivalence regarding the use of digital media, coupled with inadequate skills to determine credibility of web-based sources. I suggest that determinations of technical sophistication, knowledge, and general complexity of reasoning should be taken into consideration when developing interventions and instruments with respect to literacy in the NDM. The study suggests several avenues for future research. 1 Introduction: I describe a small follow- up research study to an online survey carried out during the summer of 2005 and winter of 2005 - 2006 (Described in Pettingill, 2006). The survey revealed a troubling finding: <b>regular</b> <b>recourse</b> to the internet as a source for information despite dismally low levels of trust in the information found there. As youn...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the density of specialists and of the area-level percentage of highly educated individuals on the odds of consulting a specialist, and examined whether these variables could explain the observed urban/rural contrast in utilization of specialty care. STUDY DESIGN: The study sample, representative of the French population aged 18 - 75 years in 1999, comprised 12, 435 individuals. METHODS: Multilevel logistic models allowed us to investigate predictors of the odds of consulting a specialist occasionally, regularly and frequently over the previous 12 months. RESULTS: We observed a modest but significant clustering within areas of the utilization of specialty care, with higher levels of clustering for behaviours representing heavy consumption of care. After adjustment for individual factors, the odds of consulting a specialist were higher in larger cities compared with rural areas, but most of this effect was attributable to other area-level variables. These area-level effects were different in magnitude and nature among males and females. Among males, the odds of consulting a specialist increased with the area-level density of specialists. Among females, such an effect was not significant, but the odds of consulting a specialist increased with the area-level percentage of highly educated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is required to better understand the processes operating at the area level that were shown to affect healthcare utilization in a different way for males and females. Policies may be needed to address problems of geographical access to specialty care, as well as situations of overuse of specialty care without <b>regular</b> <b>recourse</b> to primary care...|$|E
40|$|This project {{consists}} of an exploratory research pertaining to the issues linked to the future life planning of elderly parents of an adult with Down syndrome. The studies we inventoried mainly focused {{on the amount of}} residential, financial and legal planning undertaken by these elderly parents. In our study, a fourth planning modality emerged, namely affective planning. This fourth modality, which posses a greater relational dimension, is highly significant {{in the eyes of the}} perpetual parents. To apprehend this concept in more depth, it appeared important to us to question ourselves about the reasons that drive a parent to engage or not in future planning. From a life-course perspective, this study had, as its first specific objective, to identify the subjective dimensions of experience that facilitate or act as obstacles to the initiation of a life planning process and, as its second specific objective, to explore the perceived needs for formal or informal support of the elderly parents in regards to planning. Our results demonstrate that many dimensions modulate the engagement of parents in such a process. Amongst the elements acting as barriers, we find, notably, the negative experiences and representations of formal services, the negative representations of alternative long-term care institutions and the religious, family or continuity values of the parents. The favorable aspects notably include the <b>regular</b> <b>recourse</b> to respite services and formal services. We've also demonstrated the importance of siblings in regards to immediate instrumental and affective support, but also their capital role concerning future planning. In terms of the perceived needs of the parents, needs for general information about potential alternatives, for financial support and for respite were frequently expressed by the ageing parents...|$|E
