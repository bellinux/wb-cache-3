40|$|The LVL-concrete {{composite}} (LCC) {{structure is}} a hybrid in system which the LVL member is well {{connected to the}} concrete slab by a connector to produce composite action. Various types of connector with different stiffness and shear capacity {{are available in the}} market currently. The stiffness of the connector is identified through the push-out experiment. The notch connections for LVL concrete composite beams have higher stiffness and strength compared to mechanical fasteners. This paper discusses the experimental results of symmetrical push-out tests on 3 different types of connector, 150 mm <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> with 10 mm diameter screw, 100 mm <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> with 8 mm diameter screw and 100 mm triangular notch with 8 mm diameter screw. The experimental test was shear push out to failure and the type of failure was discussed. The 150 mm <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> was found to be strongest among all and low cost. The 100 mm <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> was found to be slightly stiffer than 100 mm triangular notch but 100 mm triangular notch is easier to construct with only 2 cut.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flowfield of turbulent jet issuing from rectangular nozzle (Aspect Ratio= 12. 5) with a <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> at the midspan, {{has been}} investigated experimentally. Four aspect ratios of <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> (NAR: Notch Aspect Ratio) used in this experiment were 2. 5, 7. 5, 12. 5 and 165. The Reynolds number based on the nozzle width d and the exit mean velocity Ue, was kept constant 30000 (NAR= 2. 5 and 7. 5), 15000 (NAR= 12. 5) and 13000 (NAR= 165), respectively. Longitudinal mean velocity and turbulent intensities were measured using an X-array Hot-Wire Probe (5 µm in diameter, 1 mm effective length) operated by the linearized constant temperature anemometers (DANTEC), and the spanwise and the lateral mean velocities were measured using a yaw meter. The signals from the anemometers were passed through the low-pass filters and sampled using A. D. converter. The processing of the signals was made by a personal computer. Acquisition time of the signals was usually 80 seconds.

40|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} {{is commonly}} used as the surface layer on pavements because of its convenience, low cost, and smooth ride (Wagoner, 2005). However, {{there is a significant}} problem with the cracking and deterioration of asphalt concrete roads. The initiation of cracking in asphalt must be better understood in order to further improve pavement design. Fracture energy is the amount of energy needed to separate two surfaces. The semi circular bend (SCB) test can be used to measure the fracture energy of asphalt concrete. Currently, this method uses a semicircular specimen with a <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> in a three-point bend compression test. Using a mechanically inserted <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> creates a stress concentration {{at the top of the}} notch, causing the crack to initiate from one predetermined place: either on the left or the right of the notch. Therefore, the fracture energy found from the load vs. displacement curve may not representative of the true fracture energy of the specimen. In order to better isolate the fracture energy of asphalt concrete, this research will explore the fracture energy results of using a semicircular notch, a fatigue-cracked notch, and the traditional rectangular, mechanically inserted <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, timber–concrete {{composite}} {{systems have}} become more widely used as a new construction technique for buildings and bridges. The main advantage is that the compressive strength of concrete is exploited {{through the use of}} composite action while timber beams are able to resist the tensile stresses. The level of composite action, which can be achieved by the system, is dependent on the type of shear connector used. There is a lack of knowledge, however, on the performance of these types of connections when subjected to cyclic loading, which is typical for bridges. Testing was performed in the Structures Laboratory of the University of Canterbury to analyse the fatigue behaviour of two types of timber–concrete connections via push-out specimens, and two beam specimens representing strips of composite floor with the same connection types. The two types of connection investigated were: (i) a <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> connection reinforced with a coach screw (also known as lag screw); and (ii) a connection with toothed metal plates punched into laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The stiffness of the connection was monitored throughout the cyclic loading along with the total amount of slip occurring between the concrete and timber. After the application of 2 million cycles, the push-out and beam specimens were loaded to failure in order to quantify their maximum strength. The strength of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>notched</b> connection after cyclic loading was 0. 95 times of the one without cyclic loading, while for the metal plate connection was 0. 60 times. For the metal plate connection, a continuous increase in slip was observed with increased cycles possibly due to accumulated damage from repeated loading. The <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> connection displayed more resistance to changes in slip, strength and stiffness than the metal plate connection. No obvious loss of stiffness was observed in the <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> connected floor beams after 2 million cycles, and when tested to failure the stiffness was very similar to the same floor beam that had not been cyclically loaded. The floor beam with metal plate connections did not perform well and failed after 350, 000 cycles. The loss of strength, stiffness and composite action in this floor beam compared to the one without cyclic loading was significant. In this respect, the <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> connection system is recommended for use in bridge design as opposed to metal plate connections...|$|R
30|$|The {{shape of}} the notch is {{expected}} to have a strong influence on crack initiation for a quasi-brittle material. This question was addressed using the non-local damage model. Simulations were performed with a <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> shape (the shape used for all the numerical simulation presented in this work), a slightly rounded notch (consistent with the real {{shape of the}} notch, where the angles are not exactly 90 ^∘ because of the saw profile) and a triangular notch (Fig.  15), which is intentionally chosen to be far from the real one. The results are compared at the end of step 1 for test no 1 (before the first reorientation). Almost no difference is observed considering the propagation angle, and only the crack obtained with the <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> is slightly longer that the other two. In conclusion, the shape of the notch has a minor influence on crack propagation.|$|R

Furthermore, in order to find a kind of notch that underlines the nucleation outside the maximum stress zone, <b>rectangular</b> lateral <b>notches</b> have been investigated. <b>Rectangular</b> <b>notches</b> could provide an interesting theoretical and experimental benchmark or reference case in order to validate effective stress definitions.

Different variables such as span length (8 and 10 m), connection and concrete type, and design level (well- and under-designed, in terms of connector numbers) were investigated. During the tests, mid-span deflection, connection slips and strains were measured. Connection types investigated include triangular and rectangular (150 mm and 300 mm long) notches cut in the timber and reinforced with a coach screw, and modified toothed metal plates pressed {{on the edge of}} the LVL joists. All of the beam specimens were designed using the effective bending stiffness or γ-method, in accordance with Annex B of Eurocode 5. All well-designed beams provided more than 95 % composite action even though there were relatively few connectors (e. g. six 300 mm long notches on the 8 m span beam). The beams with 300 mm <b>rectangular</b> <b>notched</b> connection exhibited the best performance, with high stiffness and strength beyond the ultimate limit state load level and, requiring fewer connectors along the beam.

40|$|The most {{classic example}} of a {{hydraulic}} structure where gas transfer occurs is a weir. Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a free overfall jet from a weir. A free overfall jet from a weir plunging into down-stream water causes entrainment of air bubbles if the free overfall jet velocity exceeds the critical value where aeration occurs. This paper investigates the free overfall jets from Venturi and <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> weirs and their effect on air entrainment rate. A Venturi weir was placed at the upstream channel end {{in order to increase}} the flow velocity of the free overfall jet and, in turn, to increase air entrainment. It was demonstrated that the air entrainment rate of the Venturi weir is significantly better than the <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> weir, and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the throat width of the Venturi weir is decreased. These results demonstrated that Venturi weirs can be used as highly effective aerators in streams, rivers, constructed channels, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc. Moreover, a regression equation was obtained for the Venturi weirs, relating air entrainment rate to unit discharge, weir crest width, drop height and throat width of Venturi weir.

40|$|<b>Thin-plate</b> <b>weirs</b> are {{commonly}} used as measuring devices in flumes and channels, enabling an accurate discharge measurement with simple instruments. The calibration formulae of such devices rely upon some empirical coefficients {{and there is a}} need to obtain new accurate physical data to complement the existing evidence. In the present study, the discharge calibration of a large 90 degrees V-notch thin plate weir was performed using an unsteady volume per time technique. The V-notch weir was initially closed by a fast-opening gate. The sudden opening induced an initial phase of the water motion dominated by the free-falling motion of a volume of fluid in the vicinity of the weir, followed by a gradually-varied phase, during which some seiche was observed in the tank. The relationship between water discharge and upstream water elevation was derived from the integral form of the continuity equation. The results yielded a dimensionless discharge coefficient C-d = 0. 58 close to previous experiments for 90 degrees V-notch weirs. The findings showed that the unsteady discharge calibration of the V-notch weir yielded similar results to a more traditional calibration approach based upon steady flow experiments, allowing a rapid testing over a broad range of flow rates.

Connection types investigated include triangular and rectangular (150 mm and 300 mm long) notches cut in the timber and reinforced with a coach screw, and modified toothed metal plates pressed {{on the edge of}} the LVL joists. All of the beam specimens were designed using the effective bending stiffness or gamma -method, in accordance with Annex B of Eurocode 5. The same method was used for an analytical-experimental comparison of the beam's performance at ultimate (ULS) and serviceability (SLS) limit state. All well-designed beams provided more than 95 % composite action even though there were relatively few connectors (e. g. six 300 mm long notches on the 8 m span beam). The ULS and SLS live load capacity of the beams was found to be approximately 90 % of that of a fully composite beam. Correction factors providing a 15 % increase for deflection and a 13 % reduction of the effective bending stiffness are proposed for calculations using the transformed section method for all well-designed beams, i. e. beams designed using the gamma -method according to Annex B of Eurocode 5.

The magnetization switching behavior of individual nanowires was measured using the magneto-optical Kerr effect. For symmetrical pinning structures such as the junction between a wider domain wall injection pad and a narrower nanowire, the domain wall depinning field increases as the wire width decreases, with the depinning field increasing rapidly for wires widths below 400 nm. For domain wall pinning at asymmetrical structures such as a notch, {{the magnitude of the}} depinning field appears relatively insensitive to notch geometry for triangular and <b>rectangular</b> <b>notch</b> structures, compared to the influence of the wire width. The domain wall depinning field from triangular notches increases as notch depth increases although this increase levels off at notch depths greater than approximately 60 % wire width. The nature of domain wall pinning at asymmetrical notch structures is also sensitive to domain wallchirality...|$|R
