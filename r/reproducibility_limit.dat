40|$|Some of {{feedstuffs}} used as {{raw materials}} in feed industry contain anti-nutritional factors that negatively influence their quality. One of them is soybean, which is, prior to oil extraction, referred to as full-fat soybean (FFSB). Anti-nutritional factors in raw FFSB can be destroyed by moderate heating, but both over- and under heat processing limits the availability of soybean amino acids. Among laboratory procedures that are available for assessing the degree of FFSB heat treatment, two methods, i. e. Protein dispersibility index (PDI) and protein solubility in potassium hydroxide (PSKOH), are based on protein solubility, which was {{claimed to be the}} most reliable indicator of the degree of FFSB heat treatment. This paper presents the results of an inter-laboratory study conducted to establish precision of the PDI and PSKOH methods by determining their reproducibility limits. Five samples of FFSB were heat-treated at temperatures between 110 and 164 °C and analyzed by six laboratories for PDI and PSKOH. Established <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limit</b> for PDI method of 8. 87 index units found in this study appeared to be too wide, indicating a low precision of this method. PSKOH method produced very good <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limit</b> of 8. 56 % and could be recommended as a preferred method for FFSB quality control in feed laboratories...|$|E
30|$|Surface area {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} both the melt-cast and sol–gel derived bioactive glasses {{in order to determine}} if the surface areas per gram changed {{as a function of the}} manufacturing method.

For the purposes of this experiment it was assumed that devitrification of melt-cast bioglass should not significantly change the surface area of the material, relative to the factor of two change in surface area realized for severe morphological differences that exist between the sol–gel and melt-cast derived materials.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish the repeatability and <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> of several volume-related PET image-derived indices-namely tumor volume (TV), mean standardized uptake value, total glycolytic volume (TGV), and total proliferative volume (TPV) -relative to those of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), commonly used in clinical practice. METHODS: Fixed and adaptive thresholding, fuzzy C-means, and fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian methodology were considered for TV delineation. Double-baseline (18) F-FDG (17 lesions, 14 esophageal cancer patients) and 3 '-deoxy- 3 '-(18) F-fluorothymidine ((18) F-FLT) (12 lesions, 9 breast cancer patients) PET scans, acquired at a mean interval of 4 d and before any treatment, were used for reproducibility evaluation. The repeatability of each method was evaluated for the same datasets and compared with manual delineation. RESULTS: A negligible variability of less than 5 % was measured for all segmentation approaches in comparison to manual delineation (5 %- 35 %). SUV(max) reproducibility levels were similar to others previously reported, with a mean percentage difference of 1. 8 % +/- 16. 7 % and - 0. 9 % +/- 14. 9 % for the (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT lesions, respectively. The best TV, TGV, and TPV <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> ranged from - 21 % to 31 % and - 30 % to 37 % for (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT images, respectively, whereas the worst <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> ranged from - 90 % to 73 % and - 68 % to 52 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of estimating TV, mean standardized uptake value, and derived TGV and TPV was found to vary among segmentation algorithms. Some differences between (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT scans were observed, mainly because of differences in overall image quality. The smaller <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> for volume-derived image indices were similar to those for SUV(max), suggesting that the use of appropriate delineation tools should allow the determination of tumor functional volumes in PET images in a repeatable and reproducible fashion...|$|R

40|$|The octane {{responses}} of gasoline/ethanol mixtures {{are not well}} understood because of the unidentified intermolecular interactions in such blends. In general, when ethanol is blended with gasoline, the Research Octane Number (RON) and the Motor Octane Number (MON) non-linearly increase or decrease, and the non-linearity {{is determined by the}} composition of the base gasoline and the amount of added ethanol. The complexity of commercial gasolines, comprising of hundreds of different components, makes it challenging to understand ethanol-gasoline synergistic/antagonistic blending effects. Understanding ethanol blending effects with simpler gasoline surrogates is critical to acquire knowledge about ethanol blending with complex multi-component gasoline fuels. In this study, the octane numbers (ON) of ethanol blends with five relevant gasoline surrogate molecules were measured. The molecules investigated in this study include: n-pentane, iso-pentane, 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, cyclopentane and 1 -hexene. These new measurements along with the available data of n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, various primary reference fuels (PRF) and toluene primary reference fuels (TPRF) with ethanol are used to develop a blending rule for the octane response (RON and MON) of multi-component blends with ethanol. In addition, new ON data are collected for six Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engine (FACE) with ethanol. The relatively simple volume based model successfully predicts the octane numbers (ON) of the various ethanol/PRF and ethanol/TPRF blends with the majority of predictions being within the ASTM D 2699 (RON) and D 2700 (MON) <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits.</b> The model is also successfully validated against the ON of the FACE gasolines blended with ethanol with the majority of predictions being within the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits.</b> Finally, insights into the possible causes of the synergistic and antagonistic effects of different molecules with ethanol are provided...|$|R

A further objective was to find out the influence of image type, land cover or parcel size on the area measurement variability. In our experiment, five independent operators measured 185 parcels, 3 times, on each image. Next, the buffer width, calculated as the difference between measured and reference parcel area, was derived and was the subject of statistical analysis. Prior to verifying the normality of the buffer widths, a detection of anomalous measurements is recommended. This detection of outliers within each group of observations (i. e. parcels) was made using the Jacknife distance test on each type of imagery (Cartosat Aft, Cartosat Fore). Then, the General Linear Model procedure to identify major significant effects and interactions was followed by analysis of variance to ease the interpretation of the variability observed of the area measurement. Finally, two different parameters, <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limit</b> and critical difference, were calculated to make comparison with other sensors like digital aerial orthophoto in this study possible.

The developed method was used for detection of shelf life of haloperidol in SLNs. Calibration curve of haloperidol was also constructed in rat plasma using loratidine as internal standard. In vivo studies were performed on rats and concentration of haloperidol in brain and blood was measured for the determination of various pharmacokinetic and hence brain targeting parameters. Chromatogram separation was achieved using C 18 column as stationary phase. The mobile phase consisted of 100 mM/L potassium dihydrogen phosphate-acetonitrile-TEA (10 : 90 : 0. 1, v/v/v) and the pH was adjusted with o-phosphoric acid to 3. 5. Flow rate of mobile phase was 2 mL/minute and eluents were monitored at 230 nm using UV/VIS detector. The method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, <b>reproducibility,</b> <b>limit</b> of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ).

The aim {{of the study was}} to extend the scope of application of method 11 of Directive 96 / 73 /EC, based on the selective dissolution of one of the components in binary mixtures. The method foresaw sample treatment with 75 % m/m sulfuric acid at room temperature for a contact time of 1 h. In order to ensure accurate quantification of the blends under investigation, the washing procedure had to be modified with the addition of two rinsings of the residue with the reagent used for the dissolution. Following ISO 5725, a balanced uniform level test was performed on loop twisted carpet samples of three levels of concentration (25, 50 and 75 %, approximately) with the participation of seventeen European laboratories. The trueness was evaluated considering as reference values data obtained from manual separation of samples. The calculated bias varied from 0. 06 to 0. 49 %, rising with the increasing content of polyamide in the binary mixture. Repeatability and reproducibility limits were in the range 0. 69 - 1. 04 % and 0. 97 - 1. 87 %, respectively.

40|$|Objectives. In {{view of the}} {{segmental}} {{occurrence of}} coronary atherosclerosis, we postulated that acetylcholine may cause heterogeneous vasomotion, depending {{on the extent of}} vessel analyzed, criteria for change in vessel caliber and dose of drug administered. Background. Previous studies have reported that acetylcholine causes constriction of atherosclerotic arteries. This dysfunction of endothelium-dependent dilation may be seen without angiographically detectable disease. Methods. We developed algorithms to quantitate the dimensions of a single coronary artery over virtually its entire length during a control state and during graded doses of intracoronary acetylcholine. On the basis of triplicate control angiograms, the limit of detection of a change from control diameter was 0. 31 mm (≥ 2 SD). Results. Analysis of multiple segments (each 5. 6 ± 1. 1 [mean ±SD]mm) along a single coronary artery revealed a heterogeneous response to acetylcholine in 27 of 31 patients at the 10 − 4 mol/liter dose and in 29 of 31 patients when responses at 10 − 6, 10 − 5 and 10 − 4 mol/liter doses were combined; in this latter analysis, constriction and dilation in the same vessel occurred in 45 % of the patients. With acetylcholine, most of 349 segments demonstrated no change, but the greatest frequency of vasoconstriction (24. 6 %) and vasodilation (6. 9 %) was seen at the 10 − 4 mol/liter dose. Inducible vasomotion was observed as far distally as 7. 3 cm from the site of acetylcholine infusion. Conclusions. Response to intracoronary acetylcholine with mild coronary disease is heterogeneous; disparate dimensional responses may occur in different segments of the same vessel. Inclusion of all analyzable regions of a coronary artery and the use of a <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limit</b> for quantitative angiography are optimal for assessment of segmental coronary vasomotion...|$|E

Terbium(III) luminescence is observed when organic compounds that can transfer energy to Tb(III) by an intramolecular process are present. Peak tailing caused by slow dissociation of transferring compounds from the Tb(III) is significantly reduced if potassium acetate {{is added to}} the mobile phase. The solid phases slowly turn a bluish-green color unless triethylenetetraamine {{is added to the}} mobile phase. The color change is believed to be caused by bonding of trace amounts of transition metal ions to the solid phase. Detection of carboxylic acid-containing compounds such as indole- 2 -carboxylic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid, 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid is more sensitive with the Tb-DTPA phase than the Tb-EDTA phase, whereas detection of salicylic acid is more sensitive with Tb-EDTA than with Tb-DTPA. The use of time-resolved detection methods significantly enhances the sensitivity.

40|$|The paper {{compared}} {{the performance of}} two kinds of silver working electrode in electrochemical detector-the disposable and conventional electrode for the determination of iodide using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) hyphenated with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). The comparisons were carried out {{on the time of}} equilibration, long and short-term <b>reproducibility,</b> <b>limits</b> of detection and linearity of calibration. Results showed that disposable working electrode manifested equal or better results than conventional working electrode and could be used for iodide analysis. Besides, the disposable electrode could work for consecutive 2660 min (about 44 h, 10 min needed for each run) with no degradation. Due to its "disposable" property, disposable working electrode could be discarded if the detection sensitivity decreased to 80 % so the time for polishing and reconditioning was spared and good reproducible results could be obtained. At last, the disposable electrode was applied for the determination of iodide in soil and sea water samples with the spiked recovery ranging from 96 - 104 % and the detection limit of 0. 5 mu g/L (10 mu L injection, three times of the baseline noise).

40|$|The study {{presents}} a sensitive and reliable confirmatory method for the extraction, identification, quantification of five fluoroquinolones (FQ) namely enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, sarafloxacin and flumequine, in plasma, liver, kidney, muscle, skin þ fat, lung and intestinal content from turkeys. For the extraction and matrix clean-up of FQ residues from all biological matrices, the Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) methodology was adopted; only for plasma samples acetonitrile was used. The {{analyses were performed}} by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LCeMS). LC separation was performed on a C 18 Kinetex column (100 2. 1 mm, 2. 6 mm, Phenomenex, CA, USA) with gradient elution using ammonium acetate solution (10 mM, pH 2. 5) and methanol containing 0. 1 % formic acid. Mass spectrometric identification was done using an LTQ XL ion trap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), with a heated electrospray ionization probe, in positive ion mode. The method was validated according to the European Legislation (decision 2002 / 657 /EC) and EMA guideline (EMA/CVMP/VICH/ 463202 / 2009); selectivity, linearity response, trueness (in terms of recovery), precision (within-day repeatability and within-laboratory <b>reproducibility),</b> <b>limit</b> of detection, limit of quantification, decision limits, detection capability, absolute recovery and robustness were evaluated using turkey blank matrices. All data were within the required limits established for confirmatory methods except for flumequine which presented a recovery value slightly higher than 110 % in muscle and intestinal content. For all FQs, all the extraction rates were greater than 70 % and limits of quantification ranged from 1. 2 mg/ kg to 118. 8 mg/ kg. This fast and robust method was suitable for the identification and quantification of FQ residues in tissues, plasma and intestinal content as confirmed by data obtained from incurred samples of turkeys treated at farm for therapeutic purposes...|$|E
40|$|From the 20 th to the 25 th of September 2009 in Langen (DE), 4 {{national}} {{reference laboratories}} (NRL) of AQUILA network and 3 laboratories of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Euro-Region met for an interlaboratory comparison exercise (IE) to evaluate their proficiency {{in the analysis of}} inorganic gaseous pollutants covered by European Air Quality Directives (SO 2, NO, NO 2 and O 3). Most of the laboratories participating in the IE used automated CEN reference methods, which are mandatory in the EU, while some laboratories of the WHO Euro-Region performed analysis using manual methods. In this report proficiency evaluation was made at different degrees for each laboratory taking into account the differences in the methodologies and the completeness of the information provided by participants. For the laboratories who expressed their uncertainty, performance was evaluated using two criteria, providing information on their proficiency to the European Commission and supporting the national quality control systems. In terms of criteria imposed by the European Commission (that are not mandatory for WHO laboratories), 71 % of the results reported by National Reference Laboratories (AQUILA network) were good both in terms of measured values and reported uncertainties. Another 23 % of the results had good measured values, but the reported uncertainties were either too high (19 %) or too small (4 %). There were no questionable nor unacceptable values. AQUILA laboratories presented good comparability among participants for NO 2, O 3, and SO 2. The relative <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limit</b> for NO was above the objective deriving from the standard deviation for proficiency assessment. For WHO laboratories using automated techniques, the results are satisfactory for SO 2, NO 2 and NO measurement methods, while one laboratory needs further investigation of their O 3 measurements. The laboratory using manual methods presented results comparable to those of the automated methods for NO and O 3 but there were questionable results for NO 2 and SO 2 and unsatisfactory results for NO 2.

40|$|We compare coincident, in situ, balloon-borne {{measurements}} of temperature (T) and pressure (P) by two radiosondes (Vaisala RS 92, Intermet iMet- 1 -RSB) and similar {{measurements of}} relative humidity (RH) by RS 92 sondes and frost point hygrometers. Data from {{a total of}} 28 balloon flights {{with at least one}} pair of radiosondes are analyzed in 1 -km altitude bins to quantify measurement differences between the sonde sensors and how they vary with altitude. Each comparison (T, P, RH) exposes several profiles of anomalously large measurement differences. Measurement difference statistics, calculated with and without the anomalous profiles, are compared to uncertainties quoted by the radiosonde manufacturers. Excluding seven anomalous profiles, T differences between 19 pairs of RS 92 and iMet sondes exceed their measurement uncertainty limits (2 σ) 31 % of the time and reveal a statistically significant, altitude-independent bias of 0. 5 ± 0. 2 °C. Similarly, RS 92 -iMet P differences in 22 non-anomalous profiles exceed their uncertainty limits 23 % of the time, with a disproportionate 83 % of the excessive P differences at altitudes > 16 km. The RS 92 -iMet pressure differences increase smoothly from − 0. 6 hPa near the surface to 0. 8 hPa above 25 km. Temperature and P differences between all 14 pairs of RS 92 sondes exceed manufacturer-quoted, reproducibility limits (σ) 28 % and 11 % of the time, respectively. About 95 % of the excessive T differences are eliminated when 5 anomalous RS 92 -RS 92 profiles are excluded. Only 5 % of RH measurement differences between 14 pairs of RS 92 sondes exceed the manufacturer's measurement <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limit</b> (σ). RH measurements by RS 92 sondes are also compared to RH values calculated from frost point hygrometer measurements and coincident T measurements by the radiosondes.

40|$|Successful {{simultaneous}} diastereomeric {{separation and}} sensitive determination of {{two pairs of}} triterpenoidal saponins have been achieved by capillary electrophoresis (CE) using b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) as a stereoselective agent to cooperate with borate complex-ation. A usual technique for isolation and group separation of sapo-nins was developed as an appropriate purification step prior to the determination of individual saponins by CE. Soyasaponin I (S 1), azuki-saponin V (S 2), bersimoside I (S 3) and bersimoside II (S 4) could be well separated within 14 min in a fused-silica capillary (60 cm long to the detector with an additional 10 cm to the cathode; 75 mm i. d.). The background electrolyte was borate buffer (80 mM, pH 10), containing 24 mM b-CD. The separation voltage was 14 kV with a detection wavelength of 195 nm.

40|$|The use of full fat {{soybeans}} (FFSB) {{in animal}} feeds has, to date, been limited {{due to the}} presence of anti-nutritional factors (ANF). It is, therefore, increasingly recognized that, if the full potential of full fat soybeans for the use in diets is to be realized, reliable analytical procedures must be available for the quality control of processed FFSB which would enable feed manufactures to determine the degree of soybean processing. Results of currently available analytical techniques vary widely between laboratories, causing uncertainty and confusion among soybean processors, feed manufacturers and end users. A collaborative study was conducted to standardize a number of existing analytical procedures used for determining the effects of heat treatment on FFSB and to generate South African ranges for standardized laboratory procedures. Raw soybeans, in a mixture of cultivars, were processed by dry extrusion at eight different temperatures (110 ºC, 120 ºC, 127 ºC, 136 ºC, 140 ºC, 145 ºC, 151 ºC and 164 ºC). In vivo trials were conducted on broiler chicks which were fed the eight extruded FFBB. Their performance was monitored with regard to average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The Protein Solubility in KOH (PSKOH) and the Protein Dispersibility index (PDI) procedures were used for standardization in an inter-laboratory study with the participation of ten South African analytical laboratories. Statistical analysis of the in vivo trials with broilers showed no significant difference (P> 0. 05) between broilers fed FFSB processed at 136 ºC, 140 ºC and 145 ºC. In addition, samples processed at those temperatures (136 ºC, 140 ºC and 145 ºC) showed the best chick performance with regard to average daily gain (ADG) and the feed conversion ratio (FCR). There was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between broilers fed FFSB processed at 110 ºC, 120 ºC and 120 ºC as well as those fed FFSB processed at 151 ºC and 164 ºC. In vitro results showed that the PSKOH and PDI values corresponding to temperatures which showed the best chicken performance were between 67 - 77 % and 10. 3 - 8. 5 index units respectively. Therefore, the South African ranges for describing the degree of soybean processing using the PSKOH method are 66 - 77 % with repeatability and <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> of 3. 5 and 10. 9 respectively and, when using the PDI method, are 8. 5 - 10. 3 index units with repeatability and <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> of 2. 1 and 7. 7 respectively. A very good correlation was established between the animal production parameters and the PSKOH values, while a poor correlation between animal production parameters (ADWG and FCR) and PDI values was established. The PSKOH method was found to be the most reliable method for FFSB quality control under standardized South African conditions. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Among {{a number}} of {{laboratory}} methods used to estimate the adequacy of heat treatment applied to full-fat soybean (FFSB) protein solubility in potassium hydroxide (PSKOH) is an unofficial method, but it is used by many laboratories due to its simplicity. It {{has been reported that}} the results of PSKOH analysis of the same sample of FFSB on the degree of heat treatment vary widely between laboratories. In this study, the original PSKOH method has been modified and subjected to an inter-laboratory test, with participation of 9 laboratories. Eight FFBS samples were processed by dry extrusion at temperatures ranging from 110 to 164 °C and analysed on PSKOH. Processed FFSB samples were also assessed in a growth trial with broilers. Analysis of FFSB by the PSKOH method generated for adequately-processed FFSB values between 67. 1 and 76. 5 %. The values above 76. 5 % corresponded to under-processed and below 67. 1 % to over-processed FFSB. The PSKOH method generated good precision, i. e. the repeatability and <b>reproducibility</b> <b>limits</b> of 3. 48 and 10. 86 %, respectively. The modified PSKOH method can be recommended as a reliable indicator for quality control of heat processed FFSB for the use in routine laboratory practice.
