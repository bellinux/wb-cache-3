25|$|Société Générale characterizes Kerviel as a <b>rogue</b> <b>trader</b> {{and claims}} Kerviel worked these trades alone and without its authorization. These assertions {{have been met}} with {{skepticism}} by some of Kerviel's former colleagues and acquaintances, {{as well as by}} some members of the news media. Kerviel had told investigators that his trading behavior was widespread at the company and that making a profit made the hierarchy turn a blind eye. Kerviel published a book in May 2010, L'engrenage: Mémoires d’un Trader (The gears: Memoirs of a Trader), in which he alleges that his superiors knew of his trading activities, and that the practice was very common.|$|E
25|$|Rogue Traders is an Australian {{electronic}} {{rock band}} formed in 2002 by mainstay James Ash on keyboards. In 1989, Ash met fellow original member Steve Davis, in London while both were working as DJs. Before forming Rogue Traders, the pair had {{worked together on}} many projects, including the dance music act, Union State which relocated to Melbourne in 1992. The group's name comes from the 1999 drama film, <b>Rogue</b> <b>Trader.</b> They were joined in 2004 by soap opera actress, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, on lead vocals. Cameron McGlinchey on drums and Tim Henwood on guitar. Davis continued as a behind-the-scenes member, contributing to the songwriting process but not making any public appearances with the group.|$|E

50|$|This profile {{has been}} altered {{as the game}} (and Warhammer 40,000 universe) evolved. For example, {{in many of the}} more recent Warhammer 40,000 novels, many <b>Rogue</b> <b>Traders</b> have been {{depicted}} as independent traders who tend to smuggle highly illegal or dangerous contraband by running Imperial blockades. Some of these items include, but are not limited to, narcotics, alien technology, and warp-tainted items. However, some <b>Rogue</b> <b>Traders</b> are more sympathetic to the Imperium, and many Imperial agents such as Inquisitors employ <b>Rogue</b> <b>Traders</b> when they require fast and stealthy transportation.|$|R

2500|$|The first director's duty {{under section}} 171 {{is to follow}} the company's constitution, but also only {{exercise}} powers for implied [...] "proper purposes". Prior proper purpose cases often involved directors plundering the company's assets for personal enrichment, or attempting to install mechanisms to frustrate attempted takeovers by outside bidders, such as a poison pill. Such practices are improper, because they go beyond the reason for which directors were delegated their power. The all-important duty of care is found in section 174. Directors must display the care, skill and competence that is reasonable for somebody carrying out {{the functions of the}} office, and if a director has any special qualifications an even higher standard will be expected. However, under section 1157 courts may, if directors are negligent but found to be honest and ought to be excused, relieve directors from paying compensation. The [...] "objective plus subjective" [...] standard was first introduced in the wrongful trading provision from the Insolvency Act 1986, and applied in Re D'Jan of London Ltd. The liquidator sought to recover compensation from Mr D'Jan, who failing to read an insurance policy form, did not disclose he was previously the director of an insolvent company. The policy was void when the company's warehouse burnt down. Hoffmann LJ held Mr D'Jan's failure was negligent, but exercised discretion to relieve liability on the ground that he owned almost all of his small business and had only put his own money at risk. The courts emphasise that they will not judge business decisions unfavourably with the benefit of hindsight, however simple procedural failures of judgment will be vulnerable. Cases under the Company Director Disqualification Act 1986, such as Re Barings plc (No 5) show that directors will also be liable for failing to adequately supervise employees or have effective risk management systems, as where the London directors ignored a warning report about the currency exchange business in Singapore, where a <b>rogue</b> <b>trader</b> caused losses so massive that it brought the whole bank into insolvency.|$|E
