Second, the <b>researcher</b> <b>must</b> decide whether parameter values (i.e., the elements that will be estimated) will be fixed or random. Fixed parameters are composed of a constant over all the groups, whereas a random parameter has a different value for each of the groups. Additionally, the <b>researcher</b> <b>must</b> decide whether to employ a maximum likelihood estimation or a restricted maximum likelihood estimation type.|$|R

500|$|Tod {{relied heavily}} on {{existing}} Indian texts for his historical information {{and most of these}} are today considered unreliable. Crooke's introduction to Tod's 1920 edition of the Annals recorded that the old Indian texts recorded [...] "the facts, not as they really occurred, but as the writer and his contemporaries supposed that they occurred." [...] Crooke also says that Tod's [...] "knowledge of ethnology was imperfect, and he was unable to reject the local chronicles of the Rajputs." [...] More recently, Robin Donkin, a historian and geographer, has argued that, with one exception, [...] "there are no native literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed much sense of place, before the thirteenth century", and that <b>researchers</b> <b>must</b> rely on the accounts of travellers from outside the country.|$|E

2500|$|Waldeck et al. {{concluded}} that the theory needs to better predict outcomes, rather than merely explaining them. Decision rules support decision-making, which produces a communication pattern that can be directly observable. Research has not yet examined the [...] "rational" [...] function of group communication and decision-making (i.e., how well it achieves goals), nor structural production or constraints. <b>Researchers</b> <b>must</b> empirically demonstrate the recursivity of action and structure, examine how structures stabilize and change over time due to group communication, and may want to integrate argumentation research.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1780 {{letter to}} the Continental Board of Admiralty dealing with the Great Seal, Hopkinson {{mentioned}} patriotic designs he created {{in the past few}} years including [...] "the Flag of the United States of America." [...] He asked for compensation for his designs, but his claim was rejected on the basis that others also contributed to the design. Ross Biographer Marla Miller asserts that the question of Betsy Ross' involvement in the flag should not be one of design, but of production. Even so, history <b>researchers</b> <b>must</b> accept that the United States flag evolved, and did not have one designer. [...] "The flag, like the Revolution it represents, was the work of many hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} of adolescent development {{that are more}} rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. Culture {{has been defined as}} the [...] "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued". [...] Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life. [...] Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. [...] For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, [...] "culture" [...] should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid ethnocentrism, <b>researchers</b> <b>must</b> be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.|$|E
