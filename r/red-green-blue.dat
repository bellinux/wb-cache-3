50|$|RGB is an {{abbreviation}} for <b>red-green-blue.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between August 24, 1997 and February 6, 1998, {{the logo}} was a <b>red-green-blue</b> {{triangle}} that remotely resembled a diagonal one. It {{was on top}} right corner.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} merging {{methods of}} image fusion {{are based on}} <b>Red-Green-Blue</b> (RGB) to Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) transformation. The usual steps involved in satellite image fusion are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|These subpixel layouts are {{specifically}} designed to operate with proprietary algorithms for subpixel rendering embedded in the display driver, allowing plug and play compatibility with conventional RGB (<b>Red-Green-Blue)</b> stripe panels.|$|E
50|$|The {{optically}} indexed tube displayed images by lighting vertical stripes {{of colored}} phosphor {{arranged in a}} <b>red-green-blue</b> pattern. A single electron gun was used to paint the stripes, and the beam strength is modulated {{in order to produce}} different colors.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma {{displays}} were at {{one time}} highly susceptible to burn-in, while LCD-type displays are generally not affected. The wide variation in luminance degradation with RGB-based OLED [...] will cause noticeable color drift on over time (where one of the <b>red-green-blue</b> colors becomes more prominent).|$|E
50|$|Color {{scanners}} typically read RGB (<b>red-green-blue</b> color) {{data from}} the array. This data is then processed with some proprietary algorithm to correct for different exposure conditions, {{and sent to the}} computer via the device's input/output interface (usually USB, previous to which was SCSI or bidirectional parallel port in older units).|$|E
5000|$|The image {{shown above}} using only 0 or the maximal {{value for the}} <b>red-green-blue</b> {{channels}} can be also encoded as:White space including line ends and comment lines is syntactically equivalent to a single space within the PNM headers. For the plain formats P1…P3 this also affects the pixmap lines; in fact lines {{should be limited to}} 70 characters: ...|$|E
50|$|The first LCOS device {{originated}} in 1973, {{followed by a}} development of a liquid-crystal light valve ten years later. It was not until 1993, that a microdisplay with a resolution sufficient {{for use as a}} display was reported by DisplayTech (now Citizen Finedevices). It was capable of full <b>red-green-blue</b> image generation, enabled by the use of a fast-switching ferroelectric liquid crystal.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the figure}} [...] can be {{consistently}} positioned at all {{points of the}} surface without turning into its mirror image, then this will induce an orientation in the above sense {{on each of the}} triangles of the triangulation by selecting the direction of each of the triangles based on the order <b>red-green-blue</b> of colors of any of the figures in the interior of the triangle.|$|E
50|$|Printed CNT {{thin-film}} transistors (TFTs) {{are attractive}} for driving organic light-emitting diode displays, showing higher mobility than amorphous silicon (~1 cm2 V−1 s−1) {{and can be}} deposited by low-temperature, nonvacuum methods. Flexible CNT TFTs with a mobility of 35 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 6 were demonstrated. A vertical CNT FET showed sufficient current output to drive OLEDs at low voltage, enabling <b>red-green-blue</b> emission through a transparent CNT network. CNTs are under consideration for radio-frequency identification tags. Selective retention of semiconducting SWNTs during spin-coating and reduced sensitivity to adsorbates were demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|A field {{emission}} display (FED) is a {{flat panel display}} technology that uses large-area field electron emission sources to provide electrons that strike colored phosphor to produce a color image. In a general sense, an FED consists of a matrix of cathode ray tubes, each tube producing a single sub-pixel, grouped in threes to form <b>red-green-blue</b> (RGB) pixels. FEDs combine the advantages of CRTs, namely their high contrast levels and very fast response times, with the packaging advantages of LCD and other flat panel technologies. They also offer the possibility of requiring less power, about half that of an LCD system.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a protest}} of the DeCSS case, many people created [...] "steganographic" [...] {{versions}} of the illegal information (i.e. hiding them in some form in flags etc.). Dave Touretzky of Carnegie Mellon University created a [...] "Gallery of DeCSS descramblers". In the AACS encryption key controversy, a [...] "free speech flag" [...] was created. Some illegal numbers are so short that a simple flag (pictured to the right) could be created by using triples of components as describing <b>red-green-blue</b> colors. The argument is that if short numbers can be made illegal, then anything based on those numbers also becomes illegal, like simple patterns of colors, etc.|$|E
5000|$|A surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED) is {{a display}} {{technology}} for {{flat panel displays}} developed {{by a number of}} companies. SEDs use nanoscopic-scale electron emitters to energize colored phosphors and produce an image. In a general sense, an SED consists of a matrix of tiny cathode ray tubes, each [...] "tube" [...] forming a single sub-pixel on the screen, grouped in threes to form <b>red-green-blue</b> (RGB) pixels. SEDs combine the advantages of CRTs, namely their high contrast ratios, wide viewing angles and very fast response times, with the packaging advantages of LCD and other flat panel displays. They also use much less power than an LCD television of the same size.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2012 state election, the SSW gained 4.6% of all {{votes and}} three {{seats in the}} state Landtag. A {{coalition}} of the SPD, Greens and SSW was concluded in June 2012, and the former parliamentary leader, Anke Spoorendonk, was appointed Minister for Culture, Justice and European Affairs. This {{was the first time}} in German history that a minority party had participated in a state government. The new coalition government has plenty of nicknames, for instance [...] "Dänen-Ampel" [...] ("Dane-traffic light"), [...] "Schleswig-Holstein-Ampel", [...] "rot-grün-blaue Koaltion" [...] or [...] "rød-grøn-blå koalitionsregering" [...] (<b>red-green-blue</b> alliance), [...] "Küstenampel" [...] (Coastal traffic light) and [...] "Nord-Ampel" [...] (North traffic light).|$|E
5000|$|CBS's field-sequential color {{broadcasting}} {{system was}} an electro-mechanical system. It transmitted black-and-white images electronically and color was then added mechanically {{by placing a}} rapidly spinning (1440 r.p.m.) transparent tricolor disk {{in front of the}} television screen. This spinning <b>Red-Green-Blue</b> disk, when synchronized with a corresponding spinning disk in a color television camera, created the impression of full color. A major downside to the CBS system was that the video images being transmitted were not [...] "compatible" [...] with current black-and-white television sets, meaning that unless these sets were modified they would render these video transmissions as meaningless lines and squiggles (with the very rare exception of some sets which would produce four small black-and-white images, one in each corner of the screen.) ...|$|E
50|$|NeoPixel is Adafruit's {{brand of}} individually-addressable <b>red-green-blue</b> (RGB) LED. They {{are based on}} the WS2812 LED and WS2811 driver, where the WS2811 is {{integrated}} into the LED, for reduced footprint. Adafruit manufactures several products with NeoPixels with form factors such as strips, rings, matrices, Arduino shields, traditional five-millimeter cylinder LED and individual NeoPixel with or without a PCB. The control protocol for NeoPixels is based on only one communication wire. Adafruit provides an Arduino library to help with the programming of NeoPixels. In addition to the traditional RGB technology, Adafruit manufactures a red-green-blue-white (RGBW) variant of NeoPixel for all products except those that feature a NeoPixel Mini 3535. Those integrate an additional white LED in the package for extra possible color mixes and selectable white color temperature (the company sells single NeoPixels with a 6000K, 4500K and 3000K color temperature).|$|E
5000|$|After the U.S. {{adopted the}} NTSC 525-line {{monochrome}} standard for commercial broadcasting in 1941, subsequent {{efforts were made}} to upgrade the standard so that it could also accommodate a [...] "compatible" [...] colour broadcasting system. Eventually these efforts would prove successful, but because repeated attempts had consistently produced unsatisfactory results, in 1950 the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officially approved for commercial broadcast an alternate 405-line broadcasting system which the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) had developed over the past decade. This system was a field-sequential colour system which electronically transmitted a 405-line monochrome picture. Colour was provided mechanically by means of a synchronized rotating transparent <b>Red-Green-Blue</b> disk, which was placed in front of the receiver screen. Regular broadcast channels were used to transmit the 405-line system signals, but the millions of existing NTSC 525-line television receivers could only correctly process the audio portion of these transmissions, so unless these sets were modified they would only display a jumbled picture.|$|E
50|$|Monochromatic violet light {{cannot be}} {{produced}} by the <b>red-green-blue</b> (RGB) color system, the method used to create colors on a television screen or computer display. (In fact, the only monochromatic colors of light that can {{be produced by}} this color system are the red, green, and blue that define it.) However, the system is capable of approximating it {{due to the fact}} that the L-cone (red cone) in the eye is uniquely sensitive to two different discontinuous regions in the visible spectrum - its primary region being the long wavelength light of the yellow-red region of the spectrum, and a secondary smaller region overlapping with the S-cone (blue cone) in the shortest wavelength, violet part. This means that when violet light strikes the eye, the S-cone should be stimulated strongly, and the L-cone stimulated weakly along with it. By lighting the red primary of the display weakly along with the blue primary, a relatively similar pattern of sensitization can be achieved, creating an illusion, the sensation of extremely short wavelength light using what is in fact mixed light of two longer wavelengths. The resulting color has the same hue as pure violet; however, it has a lower saturation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{designers}} of the C128 succeeded in addressing {{most of these}} concerns. A new chip, the VDC, provides the C128 with an 80-column color CGA-compatible display (also called RGBI for <b>red-green-blue</b> plus intensity). The then-new 8502 microprocessor is completely backward-compatible with the C64's 6510, but can run at double the speed if desired. The C64's BASIC 2.0 was replaced with BASIC 7.0, which includes structured programming commands from the Plus/4's BASIC 3.5, as well as keywords designed specifically {{to take advantage of}} the machine's capabilities. A sprite editor and machine language monitor were added. The screen-editor part of the Kernal was further improved to support an insert mode and other features accessed through ESC-key combinations, as well as a rudimentary windowing feature, and was relocated to a separate ROM. The VIC-II chip which controls the 40-column display can only operate at 1 MHz, so the 40-column display appears jumbled in FAST mode. In 80-column mode the editor takes advantage of VDC features to provide blinking and underlined text, activated through escape codes, in addition to the standard Commodore reverse text. The C128's 80-column mode can display lowercase characters along with PETSCII graphics characters; 40-column mode is subject to the same [...] "upper- and lowercase" [...] or [...] "uppercase-plus-graphics" [...] restriction as earlier Commodores. The 40- and 80-column modes are independent and both can be active at the same time. A programmer with both a composite and RGB display can use one of the screens as a [...] "scratchpad" [...] or for rudimentary multiple buffer support. The active display can be switched with ESC-X. A hardware reset button was added to the system. The keyboard, however, was not switched to the Selectric layout as had become standard, instead retaining the same ADM-3A-derived design as on Commodore's prior models.|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} <b>red-green-blue</b> model, {{which is a}} sytem of loops obtained by superimposing three dimer coverings on offset hexagonal lattices. We find that when the boundary conditions are ``flat'', the <b>red-green-blue</b> loops {{are closely related to}} SLE_ 4 and double-dimer loops, which are the loops formed by superimposing two dimer coverings of the cartesian lattice. But we also find that the <b>red-green-blue</b> loops are more tightly nested than the double-dimer loops. We also investigate the 2 D minimum spanning tree, and find that it is not conformally invariant. Comment: 4 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{microscope}} slide {{acting as a}} passive waveguide was coated by three separate poly(vinyl alcohol) films that were doped with Coumarin 460, Disodium Fluorescein, and Rhodamine 640 perchlorate. On collinear pumping by a nitrogen laser, these dyes furnished primary <b>red-green-blue</b> laser emissions that were collected and waveguided by the {{microscope slide}} but exited from both ends. Frosting the waveguide exit introduced light scattering at the glass-air interface and spatially overlaid the <b>red-green-blue</b> laser emissions that emerged as a uniform white-light beam. 0 2002 Optical Society of America...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} remove noise in RGB-color (<b>Red-Green-Blue)</b> images. This method {{is based on a}} total {{variation}} of intensity function of images. We propose to remove a linear combination of Gaussian and Poisson noises. This type of noise can be used to well approximate real noises in raster images...|$|E
30|$|The colour-based methods use the {{following}} {{facts about the}} shadow and background. The <b>red-green-blue</b> (RGB) values, hue and saturation in hue-saturation-value (HSV) colour space and grey level of a shadow are inferior to the background in the corresponding pixel [12, 13]. The variation between those values of shadow and background show a gradual growth between adjacent pixels [14].|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} three-dimensional pose estimation {{model for}} object with complex surface, which primarily absorbs {{the essence of}} scale-invariant feature transform and iterative closest point algorithm, includes two steps, off-line and online. At first, two kinds of feature databases are established in the off-line operations. Then, the online process mainly has three steps. The first one is two-dimensional edge extraction from <b>red–green–blue</b> (RGB) information based on scale-invariant feature transform algorithm. The second one is three-dimensional surface reconstruction from the previous two-dimensional edge and the depth information obtained from depth camera. The last one is three-dimensional pose estimation based on camera calibration and iterative closest point algorithm. The Kinect camera is selected as the information acquisition device which can produce <b>red–green–blue</b> information and depth information. In the experiment, the container twist-lock with complex surface is taken as the object. The result shows that {{the accuracy of the}} proposed model is very high...|$|E

The tuning range is expanded to the RGB (<b>Red-Green-Blue)</b> region using only a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser pumping, and the tuning in each region is achieved by changing the interfering angle of the pump beam.
