40|$|At maturity, {{the spores}} of Dictyostelium are {{suspended}} in a viscous fluid droplet, with each spore {{being surrounded by}} its own spore coat. Certain glycoproteins characteristic of the spore coat are also dissolved in this fluid matrix after the spore coat is formed. To determine whether any proteins of the coat reside in this fluid phase earlier {{during the process of}} spore coat assembly, pairs of strains which differed in a spore coat protein carbohydrate marker were mixed and allowed to form spore coats in each other's presence. We reasoned that proteins belonging to an early, soluble, extracellular pool would be incorporated into the spore coats of both strains. To detect trans- incorporation, spores were labeled with a fluorescent antibody against the carbohydrate marker and each spore's fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. Several proteins of both the outer and inner protein layers of the coat appeared to be faithfully and <b>reciprocally</b> trans- <b>incorporated</b> and hence judged to belong to a soluble, assembly-phase pool. Western blot analysis of sorted spores, and EM localization, confirmed this conclusion. In contrast, one outer-layer protein was not trans-incorporated, and was concluded to be insoluble at the time of secretion. Three classes of spore coat proteins can be described: (a) Insoluble from the time of secretion; (b) present in the early, soluble pool but not the late pool after spore coat formation; and (c) present in the soluble pool throughout spore coat assembly.

All patients were reviewed at 2 -monthly intervals and treatments repeated if required. Cryotherapy produced clearance in 10 of 20 lesions after one treatment, the remaining 10 lesions requiring two or three treatment applications. PDT resulted in clearance of 15 of 20 lesions after one treatment and of the remaining five lesions after a second treatment. The probability that a lesion cleared after one treatment was greater with PDT than cryotherapy (P < 0. 01). Cryotherapy was associated with ulceration (five of 20), infection (two of 20) and recurrent disease (two of 20) : no such complications occured following PDT.

40|$|Abstract This {{application}} note describes designs using IC family UBA 2015, UBA 2015 A and UBA 2016 A for common ballast topologies. The IC is a controller used in electronic ballast for fluorescent <b>lamps</b> <b>incorporating</b> controllers and NMOST drivers for Power Factor Correction (PFC) and the half-bridge circuit. The high-voltage fluorescent lamp ballast controller drives a zero-voltage switching resonant topology. The lamp controller module includes a high-voltage level shift circuit and several protection features. The protection features include hard switching/capacitive mode protection, half-bridge overcurrent (coil saturation) protection, lamp overvoltage (lamp removal) protection and temperature protection. In {{addition to the}} lamp controller, the IC also contains a PFC controller. The quasi-resonant operation guarantees efficient operation of the PFC circuit. Overcurrent protection, overvoltage protection and demagnetization sensing ensure safe operation under all conditions. The brownout protection of the PFC controller reduces the half-bridge frequency to prevent excessive currents. The proprietary high-voltage BCD power logic process enables efficient, direct start-up from the rectified universal mains voltage. The IC can drive half-bridge circuits with a supply voltage up to 600 V (AC). The PFC and lamp controller combination makes the IC suitable for dimmable or fixed current output fluorescent ballasts with a PFC for AC mains voltages up to 390 V.

40|$|Some recent {{measurements}} {{have been}} made on the quantum efficiency of fluorescent lamp phosphors by the method employed by Thayer and Barnes (1). This method consists of comparing the photo-metered luminous efficiency (lpw) of a lamp to its calculated lpw, assuming 100 per cent quantum efficiency for the powder. This method has not been widely used, possibly {{due to lack of}} understanding of its derivation. Most measurements appearing in the literature are made by irradiating a sample of the powder with a known amount of 253. 7 mu radiation and measuring the amount of radiation emitted by the phosphor (2). This measurement is complicated by the difficulty in measuring the absolute quantity of actinic radiation, and recourse is usually made to assumptions as to the efficiency of some powder chosen as a standard (usually magnesium tungstate = 100 %) and the performance of other phosphors compared thereto. The method used in the present measurements obviates the recourse to a reference standard, and direct comparisons can be made between measure-ments separated by considerable periods of time. Also, since the measurements are made on the phos-phor in its final form as <b>incorporated</b> into the <b>lamp,</b> they furnish information of more interest to the lamp manufacturer.

40|$|Proteins are {{essential}} molecules in all living organisms. Their involvement in numerous biological processes {{has led to}} the development of protein-based medicines (biopharmaceuticals). For good understanding of the properties and function of endogenous proteins and biopharmaceuticals, extensive protein characterisation is required. This involves assessment of features such as purity, heterogeneity, stability, activity and conformation of the protein. For instance, an altered protein conformation may influence the protein function and activity, which could have serious health implications. Clearly, there is a demand for suitable analytical methods that allow assessment of protein identity, purity and conformation. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to fluorescence spectroscopy provides high separation efficiency and selective spectroscopic detection that can be very useful for protein characterisation. Protein modifications, like glycosylation and deamidation, may involve changes in the net charge of a protein and, thus, of its electrophoretic mobility. Moreover, protein conformational changes, like unfolding or aggregation, are often accompanied by a change in protein molecular radius, which is reflected in the electrophoretic mobility as well. Fluorescence spectroscopy can provide information on the conformational state of a protein by monitoring changes in local tryptophan environments. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of novel fluorescence (Flu) and wavelength-resolved fluorescence (wrFlu) detection systems in CE for analysis of intact proteins. In order to accomplish effective Flu detection, a detector set-up was selected that <b>incorporated</b> a <b>lamp</b> as excitation source, a dedicated fluorescence detection cell and a photomultiplier detector. The analytical characteristics of the selected CE-Flu set-up and its suitability for native protein detection were tested using tryptophan and some model proteins. Protein detection limits were 7 - 33 nM, which was a factor of 25 better than UV absorbance detection at 280 nm, and comparable to UV detection at low-UV wavelengths. In order to obtain conformational information on separated proteins, employment of wavelength-resolved fluorescence detection was required. Therefore, the photomultiplier detector was replaced by a spectrograph equipped with a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as detector. CE-wrFlu of intact proteins allowed acquisition of protein emission spectra ‘on-the-fly’. Detection limits were 6 - 32 nM, which is comparable to Flu detection. Analysis of model proteins in native (folded) and denatured (unfolded) state showed that protein conformational changes can be monitored via two independent parameters, the position of maximum emission wavelength and the effective electrophoretic mobility. The usefulness of CE-wrFlu for the study of protein unfolding pathways was investigated by measuring non-reduced and reduced β-lactoglobulin B (β-LGB) in several stages of unfolding. Non-reduced β-LGB showed two distinct unfolding pathways, that showed fast and slow interconversion kinetics between folded and unfolded species, respectively. Reduced β-LGB showed only one unfolding pathway, and unfolded at much lower denaturant concentration. These results suggest that disulphide bonds might be a prerequisite for the observed unfolding behaviour of non-reduced β-LGB. The potential applicability of native CE-Flu for the profiling of biopharmaceuticals was evaluated by the analysis of different products of human recombinant erythropoietin. Distinct and repeatable peak profiles were obtained, which allowed discrimination of different products based on the obtained glycoform patterns...|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out on hollow cathode discharges adapted from laser technology for use as a spectroscopic light source and the argon inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as an excitation source for nonmetal emission. High and low voltage aluminum and copper hollow cathode discharges were studied as a source of ionic and resonant atomic metal emission. The high voltage versions achieve strongly positive current-voltage behavior through utilization of the obstructed discharge phenomenon. The current-pressure-intensity-voltage relationships for low and high voltage copper hollow cathode discharges were studied with the inert gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. The intensity for copper resonant atomic emission with the fill gases Ar, Kr, and Xe improved relative to neon in the high voltage lamp when compared to the low voltage lamp. Absorption measurements through the cathode bore show the ground state atom density to increase with the atomic weight of the fill gas at any given level of intensity, at the fill gas pressure yielding highest resonant atomic copper emission. The estimated ion/atom intensity ratio is increased with fill gases which have metastable or ionization energies greater than the excitation energy of the ion transition. A copper hollow cathode <b>lamp</b> <b>incorporating</b> a short positive column discharge in front of the cathode opening was investigated for its lineshape as measured spectroscopically and by its atomic absorption sensitivity. Incorporation of this positive column allowed higher intensities to be obtained at the same line quality as a commercial hollow cathode lamp.

Inductively coupled plasma spectra for the elements C, O, N, Cl, P, S, and Br were obtained in the vacuum ultraviolet utilizing a vacuum polychromator and SWR film. The detection limit for injected O₂ and N₂ detected electronically by the VUV emissions is 1. 3 and 0. 9 micrograms respectively with this system.
