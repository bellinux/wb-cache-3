Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful.

5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this {{was the result of}} improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend. Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium rents. The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories. 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.|$|E

The paper investigates the dynamic relationships between different measures <b>of</b> accounting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> (ARRs) and different approximations for the internal <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> (IRRs). In contrast with the prevailing case-study investigations, one considers a panel for quoted Brazilian firms in the manufacturing industry along the 1988 - 3 / 2003 - 2 period. Granger causality tests are considered {{and even though the}} results are not completely clear cut, some discernible uni-directional patterns emerge. In particular, there seems to be informational content between economic and accounting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> between ROA (Net Profits/Total Assets) and PM (Gross Profits/ Operational Income), and internal <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> This seems to indicate that there is some validity in using accounting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> in certain economic studies. ...|$|R

The main {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the private and social <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> education at the secondary and higher education levels between 2010 and 2014, giving also an outlook based on gender and country. This study is a document research. The data have been taken from the OECD Education at a Glance issued between 2010 and 2014. It is observed that private <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> at higher education level are higher than the secondary education level except for the male context in 2014. The private <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> at secondary education level in Turkey are lower than OECD averages both in 2010 and 2014.
