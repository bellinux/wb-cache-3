5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a <b>relevant</b> <b>fact</b> is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E

40|$|The {{obligation}} {{to justify a}} court decision derives from the rights to a fair trial. The purpose of justification is to preclude the court’s arbitrariness, provide a possibility to check the decision and convince the audience. The court justifies its decision with legal norms and facts. Thereby {{the aim of the}} research is to study how the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> are ascertained and assessed. A <b>fact</b> is <b>relevant</b> if it might be necessary for legal syllogism. As the court receives from the litigants “raw facts” which may include irrelevant and exclude <b>relevant</b> <b>facts,</b> the unimportant facts must be separated and the missing facts – clarified. This task is facilitated by a legal method called the relation technique. Applying the relation technique to ascertaining the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> is targeted and successive. Moreover, the ascertained <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> are laid out in a table promoting the perception of the case. All the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> must be assessed. The court has to verify whether the facts that might be necessary for legal syllogism are available. If the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts</b> collide, then the court must decide which fact is determinant. According to the law, the court must give reasons for accepting or rejecting the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts.</b> For proper assessment of the <b>relevant</b> <b>facts,</b> the court must use a legal method called the dialogical approach. Using this method, the court decision is structured like a dialogue between the court and the litigants. The aim of the dialogical approach is to convince the audience; therefore, the court inter alia analyzes both the accepted and rejected <b>relevant</b> <b>facts...</b>|$|R

2500|$|However, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the status of Occoquan was not a <b>relevant</b> <b>fact</b> to the Moreland case; crimes {{requiring}} time served in a penitentiary had already been deemed to be infamous in the 1885 case Ex Parte Wilson (114 U.S. 417). [...] The focus of the case instead rested upon the sentence of hard labor, and the majority quoted from the Wilson case: “... it was declared that, if imprisonment was in any other place than a penitentiary and was to be at hard labor, the latter ... made it infamous.” [...] The United States’ contention was in direct opposition {{to the findings of}} Wilson, and was rejected.|$|E

This is followed by the Swiss criminal law in general in Art. 264 (Strafgesetzbuch) as [...] ".... marked by their nationality, race, religion or ethnicity group".

Again, men who consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing history and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their contemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the Jews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own agreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a transformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying [...] "civilisation" [...] as a transformed tribal existence of which some lineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native Australians. Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name [...] "Father" [...] should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their view of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of things in which nobody knew his own father? ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{debate on}} the second reading was marked by a little {{brutality}} and much sanctimony. Mr. Gladstone (March 25, 1851) spoke to a House practically almost solid against him. Yet his superb resources as an orator, his transparent depth of conviction, the unmistakeable proofs that his whole heart was in the matter, mastered his audience and made {{the best of them}} in their hearts ashamed. He talked of Boniface VIII. and Honorius IX.; he pursued a long and close historical demonstration of the earnest desire of the lay catholics of this country for diocesan bishops as against vicars apostolic; he moved among bulls and rescripts, briefs and pastorals and canon law, with as much ease {{as if he had been}} arguing about taxes and tariffs. Through it all the House watched and listened in enchantment, as to a magnificent tragedian playing a noble part in a foreign tongue. They did not apprehend every point, nor were they converted, but they felt a man with the orator's quality of taking fire and kindling fire at a moral idea. They felt his command of the whole stock of fact and of principle belonging to his topics, as with the air and the power of a heroic master he cleared the way before him towards his purpose. Along with complete grasp of details, went grasp of some of the most important truths in the policy of a modern state. He clearly perceived the very <b>relevant</b> <b>fact,</b> so often overlooked by advocates of the free church in a free state, that 'there is no religious body in the world where religious offices do not in a certain degree conjoin with temporal incidents.' But this did not affect the power of his stroke, as he insisted on respect for the frontier--no scientific frontier--between temporal and spiritual. 'You speak of the progress of the Roman catholic religion, and you pretend to meet that progress by a measure false in principle as it is ludicrous in extent. You must meet the progress of that spiritual system by the progress of another; you can never do it by penal enactments. Here, once for all, I enter my most solemn, earnest, and deliberate protest against all attempts to meet the spiritual dangers of our church by temporal legislation of a penal character.' The whole speech is in all its elements and aspects one of the great orator's three or four most conspicuous masterpieces, and the reader would not forgive me if I failed to transcribe its resplendent close. He went back to a passage of Lord John Russell's on the Maynooth bill of 1845. 'I never heard,' said Mr. Gladstone, 'a more impressive passage delivered by any statesman at any time in this House.' ...|$|E
