40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} to estimate the unsteady aerodynamic forces caused by flow field turbulence on a wind tunnel turning vane cascade system (vane set). This method approximates dynamic lift and drag by linearly perturbing the appropriate steady state force equations, assuming that the dynamic loads are due only to free stream turbulence and that this turbulence is homogeneous, isotropic, and Gaussian. Correlation and unsteady aerodynamic effects are also incorporated into the analytical model. Using these assumptions, equations relating dynamic lift and drag to flow turbulence, mean velocity, and vane set geometry are derived. From these equations, estimates for the power spectra and <b>rms</b> (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> value, delta) loading of both lift and drag can be determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{simulation of}} the spark plasma sintering/synthesis (SPS) apparatus, which represents an effective tool for sintering/synthesizing advanced materials, is addressed. Because several, concomitant physicochemical phenomena—such as heat transfer and generation, electric current transport, and stress–strain mechanics along with chemical transformation and sintering—take place during SPS processes, a step-by-step heuristic procedure is proposed for successful quantitative modeling purposes. First, {{in this work}} we consider the SPS behavior of specific sample configurations characterized {{by the absence of}} powders. This approach permits detailed analysis of the system from the perspective of electric phenomena. The inductive character is carefully described and properly taken into account when comparing experimental data with model results. The importance of considering <b>rms</b> (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared)</b> electric current for a quantitative determination of the Joule effect is highlighted. Moreover, this approach allows one to determine the electric and thermal resistances experimentally evidenced in the horizontal contacts between stainless steel electrodes and graphite spacers as functions of temperature and applied mechanical load. Horizontal contact resistances between graphite elements are experimentally found to be negligible and, accordingly, they are not modeled. Model reliability is tested by comparing numerical simulations with experimental data obtained at operating conditions far from those adopted during the fitting procedure of unknown parameters. The proposed model can be successfully compared from a quantitative perspective to the measured temperature, voltage, and displacement, once rms current, geometry, and mechanical load are set...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho apresenta resultados de avaliação de juntas soldadas de aço estrutural ASTM A 36 por meio do Ruído Magnético de Barkhausen (RMB). A soldagem foi feita em chapas de 6 mm de espessura com preparação de chanfro em V, com um e dois passes. Foram feitas a caracterização de microestructuras e microdurezas através da junta soldada, e na superfície foram feitas medições de RMB. Os sinais de RMB foram analisados com o valor máximo, uma média de valores acima de 80 % do pico máximo, o rms e o rms do {{envelope}}, dos quais foram obtidas curvas da variação com respeito ao centro do cordão e também foram obtidos mapas superficiais. Na caracterização microestructural obteve-se que as amostras de um e dois passes apresentaram tamanhos da zona afetada pelo calor (ZAC) diferente. As microdurezas mostraram que no limite de fusão tem-se a maior dureza enquanto que no fim da ZAC tem-se a menor dureza. O RMB mostrou que no limite de fusão tem o menor valor, enquanto que no fim da ZAC tem o maior valor. Este estúdio mostrou que as mudanças na microestrutura influenciam em todos os parâmetros analisados, sendo que a junta soldada ficou melhor representada pelo valor rms e rms do envelope do RMB. This paper shows {{results for}} the evaluation of ASTM A 36 carbon steel welded joints by Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN). V-groove shape welded samples were made in a 6 mm thickness plates, with one-pass and two-pass. Microstructural and microhardness characterization were made on a transversal section of welds. In the surface was made measurement of MBN. The signal of MBN were analyzed with the maximum value, threshold of 80 % above of maximum, the <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> (<b>rms),</b> the <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> of the profile, and these parameters were plotted in function of the distance to center bead. Surface maps were obtained, too. The microstructural characterization identified different heat affected zone (HAZ) sizes for one-pass and two-pass. In addition, changes on microhardness showed which higger hardness was happened in the fusion boundary whereas lower microhardness happened in the HAZ end. With MBN monitoring were verified that the lower value happened in the fusion boundary, whereas the MBN higher value happened in the HAZ end. The study showed that changes in the microstructure influence all analyzed parameters.

40|$|The beam {{is often}} {{represented}} only by its position (mean) and the width (<b>rms</b> = <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared)</b> of its distribution. To achieve these beam parameters in a noisy condition with high backgrounds, a Gaussian distribution with offset (4 parameters) is fitted to the measured beam distribution. This gives a very robust answer {{and is not}} very sensitive to background subtraction techniques. To get higher moments of the distribution, like skew or kurtosis, a fitting function {{with one or two}} more parameters is desired which would model the higher moments. h this paper we will concentrate on an Asymmetric Gaussian and a Super Gaussian function that will give something like the skew and the kurtosis of the distribution. — This information is used to quantify special beam distribution. Some are unwanted like beam tails (skew) from transverse wakefields, higher order dispersive aberrations or potential well distortion in a damping ring. A negative kurtosis of a beam distribution describes a more rectangular, compact shape like with an over-compressed beam in z or a closed to double-horned energy distribution, while a positive kurtosis looks more like a “Christmas tree ” and can quantify a beam mismatch after filamentation. Besides the advantages of the quantification, there are some distributions which need a further investigation like long flat tis which create background particles in a detector. h particle simulations on the other hand a simple rms number might grossly overestimate the effective size (e. g. for producing luminosity) due to a few particles which are far away from the core. This can reduce the practical gain of a big theoretical improvement in the beam size. 1...|$|R
40|$|The comfort {{assessment}} for car occupants {{is not an}} easy task to achieve. It is a matter of personal perceiving, thus a solution which may seem comfortable to one could be not to another. Moreover it is a field which requires knowledge both from science and medicine. The vibrational comfort analysis is the topic of this paper. There are different international standards to define the vibrational comfort through computed indices. In particular the British Standard BS 6841 [1] introduces the Vibration Dose Value (VDV). The main idea which lies behind the VDV is to estimate the whole body vibration. In fact the standard suggests the main locations for acceleration measurement (feet, seat and back) and their direction axes. The overall number of acquisitions is twelve. A numerical code for the vibrational comfort analysis of car occupants, estimating the VDV for each of them, has been developed. The code, named DAViD, is based on a multibody approach [2]. It has been validated by means of experimental tests [3, 4]. In this paper the influence of the anthropometric features (height and weight) and the inclination of the backrest on the VDV has been investigated. The code is an useful tool for predicting at the seat design level the vibrational discomfort. NOMENCLATURE a <b>rms</b> [...] .
