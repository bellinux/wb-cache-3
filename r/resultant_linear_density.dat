40|$|First order {{improvements}} to the rigid headform, used in current helmet certification tests, are made by introducing a skull and brain structure. In developing the new headform certain requirements were taken into consideration. The new headform appears to meet all requirements but one. The 200 mm drop test with Hybrid-III skin padding on the anvil resulted in too low <b>resultant</b> <b>linear</b> head accelerations. Using a stiffer, more realistic padding on the anvil resulted in a <b>resultant</b> <b>linear</b> head acceleration which satisfies the requirements (100 - 150 g). The padding {{plays an important role}} in the evaluation process. Because of the deformable skull, a fairly stiff padding has to be used in order to let the <b>resultant</b> <b>linear</b> head acceleration satisfy the requirements. In contrast to the 200 mm drop test experiments, the padding properties of th! e skin are of no importance when an EPS padding is placed between the skin and the anvil...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the relationships among fiber <b>linear</b> <b>density,</b> tenacity, and structure is important to help cotton breeders modify varieties for enhanced fiber end-use qualities. This study employed the Stelometer instrument, which is the traditional fiber tenacity reference method and might still be an option as a rapid screening tool because of its low cost and portable attributes. In addition to flat bundle break force and weight variables from a routine Stelometer test, the number of fibers in the bundle were counted manually and the fiber crystallinity (CIIR) was characterized by the previously proposed attenuated total reflection-sampling device based Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) protocol. Based on the plots of either tenacity vs. <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> or fiber count vs. mass, the fibers were subjectively divided into fine or coarse sets, respectively. Relative to the distinctive increase in fiber tenacity with <b>linear</b> <b>density,</b> there was an unclear trend between the <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> and CIIR for these fibers. Samples with similar <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> were found to increase in tenacity with fiber CIIR.

30|$|An {{increase}} in polyester fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> from 1.1 dtex to 3.3 dtex resulted in corresponding {{increase in}} air permeability of carded (RC 1.1  < RC 1.3  < RC 1.5  < RC 2.2  < RC 3.3) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 1.1  < RM 1.3  < RM 1.5  < RM 2.2  < RM 3.3) (Fig.  3). The increase in air permeability with fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> {{can be attributed}} to increasing yarn diameter with increase in fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density.</b> This in turn results in reduced specific surface area. Lower the specific surface area, lesser the drag resistance to passage of air through fabric and hence the observed increase in air permeability with the increase in fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density.</b> High porosity of plated fabrics knitted with fibres of higher <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> may also account for the increased air permeability. Other researchers (Raj and Sreenivasan 2009; Varshney et al. 2010) have also reported similar results in their studies.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> in {{cells of the}} mononuclear phagocyte system was investigated in pulmonary biopsies from 33 patients with fibrotic lung disorders. Subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities,</b> consisting of {{a thin layer of}} electron-dense material immediately subjacent to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, were found in 30 of the 33 patients, including each of 6 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 18 of 19 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 4 of 5 patients with collagen-vascular diseases, 1 patient with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and 1 patient with marked interstitial pulmonary fibrosis associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> were found in epithelioid cells, macrophages, and giant cells in granulomas in the 6 patients with sarcoidosis and in alveolar macrophages in 4 of these patients. In patients with other fibrotic lung disorders, subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> were limited in distribution to interstitial and alveolar macrophages. In all patients with sarcoidosis some of the subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> of adjacent mononuclear phagocytes, particularly of those in granulomas, were paired and formed specialized intercellular junctions. Such junctions also were observed in macrophages in 10 of the patients with other fibrotic lung disorders. The junctions formed by subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> differed from other types of junctional structures. Subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> appear to function in 1) the binding of action filalar junctions, which may contribute to the immobilization of mononuclear phagocytes in granulomas and alveolar lumens...|$|R
50|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>density</b> of {{fibers and}} yarns can be {{measured}} by many methods. The simplest one is to measure a length of material and weigh it. However, this requires a large sample and masks the variability of <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> along the thread, and is difficult to apply if the fibers are crimped or otherwise cannot lay flat relaxed. If {{the density of the}} material is known, the fibers are measured individually and have a simple shape, a more accurate method is direct imaging of the fiber with SEM to measure the diameter and calculation of the <b>linear</b> <b>density.</b> Finally, <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> is directly measured with a vibroscope.

A study on the changes of <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> in combed yarn due to different shade percentages of reactive dye has been conducted and the results are statistically analyzed. Remazol Red RR, Remazol Yellow RR and Remazol Blue RR were used for this experiment. The study reveals that dye shade percentage effects on the <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> negatively. Before 2. 5 % shade the yarn loss is greater and after 3. 5 % shade <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> also decreases. 2. 5 % to 3. 5 % shade percentage can be taken as the range where loss of <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> is much less than the other percentages.

30|$|The {{effect of}} fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same yarn fineness, as the fibre fineness decreases, the number of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in fibre <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher decitex and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|R

The non monotonic behavior of the <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> and its dependence on the mainshock magnitude can be interpreted in terms of diffusion of static stress.
