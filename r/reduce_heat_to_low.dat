40|$|AbstractGlobal energy {{problems}} {{should be}} solved quickly, and superconducting applications are highly demanded as energy saving technologies. Among them, long-distance superconducting transmission {{seems to be}} one of the most promising for energy saving by energy sharing. On the other hand, such large systems can be constructed from smaller network systems that can be enhanced by scaling up to the superconducting grid. <b>Reducing</b> <b>heat</b> leak <b>to</b> the <b>low</b> temperature end is the most important aspect of technology for practical superconducting applications, and heat leak reduction at the terminal is a key goal especially for small-length applications. At Chubu University, we have developed a 200 m-class superconducting direct current transmission and distribution system (CASER- 2), in which we also used a Peltier current lead (PCL) as heat insulation at the terminal. PCL is composed of a thermoelectric material and a copper lead. In actual transmission and distribution applications, the cables are also cooled by the coolant. After the circulation, the coolant could also be used to cool the current lead. We will discuss the performance of such gas-cooled systems as the total performance of applied superconducting systems using the experimental parameters obtained in CASER- 2...|$|R

40|$|Wrinkling {{patterns}} in shape memory polymer (SMP) sputter deposited {{with a thin}} layer (10 s nm in thickness) of gold atop are systematically investigated under various conditions. Depending on the surface condition, heating temperature and pre-straining, different patterns of micro/nano-scaled wrinkles are produced. Although elastic buckling of the gold layer is the mechanism behind all types of wrinkles, the shape memory effect (SME) and thermal expansion mismatch (TEM) are the driving force for different patterns after <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> different temperatures, i. e. the evolution of wrinkle pattern {{is due to the}} SME after <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> temperatures and the TEM after <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> high temperatures.

This is especially applicable to germanium parts.

50|$|Chrome plating is a {{relatively}} common variation on surface finish for commercial griddles. The finish is aesthetically pleasing, but offers additional benefits to griddle operators. In its plated form chrome is non-porous, impermeable and non-reactive (inert) with food products, which limits food sticking during the cooking process and facilitates cleaning, as well as reduced flavor transfer between foods. The mirror finish of a chrome finish <b>reduces</b> <b>heat</b> transmission <b>to</b> the environment due <b>to</b> the <b>low</b> surface emissivity, a characteristic common to most highly polished surfaces.|$|R

These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls.
