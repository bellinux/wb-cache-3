The finite element <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> model consists of axisymmetric triangular and/or quadrilateral ring elements for soil and cylindrical shell elements for the steel cell. To formulate and derive the governing equations for such elements, the Ritz displacement functions and the theorem of minimum potential energy are used. The loadings of the bulkhead system and corresponding displacements are expanded in Fourier series. The soil fill and foundation are assumed to be elastic, isotropic and non-homogeneous materials. It is assumed that there is no slippage in the soil-steel shell interface. The element matrices and the Fourier harmonic analysis are verified by comparing results for several structures for which classical solutions are available.

The tobacco TA 56 gene promoter is active within the <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster, stomium, and connective regions of the anther at different developmental stages. We introduced a cytotoxic TA 56 /barnase gene into tobacco plants together with three different anticytotoxic barstar genes. The anticytotoxic barstar genes were used to protect subsets of anther cell types from the cytotoxic effects of the TA 56 /barnase gene. The chimeric barstar genes were fused with (1) the tobacco TP 12 gene promoter that is active at high levels in most anther cell types; (2) the soybean lectin gene promoter that is active earlier in the connective, and at lower levels in the <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster and stomium, than is the TA 56 promoter; and (3) the tobacco TA 20 gene promoter that is active at high levels in most anther cell types but has a different developmental profile than does the TP 12 promoter. Normal anther development and dehiscence occurred in plants containing the TA 56 /barnase and TP 12 /barstar genes, indicating that barstar protects diverse anther cell types from the cytotoxic effects of barnase. Anthers containing the TA 56 /barnase and lectin/barstar genes also developed normally but failed to dehisce because of extensive ablation of the <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster, stomium, and contiguous connective regions. Anthers containing the TA 56 /barnase and TA 20 /barstar genes failed to dehisce as well. However, only the stomium region was ablated in these anthers. The connective, <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster, and adjacent wall regions were protected from ablation by the formation of barnase/barstar complexes. We conclude that anther dehiscence at flower opening depends {{on the presence of}} a functional stomium region and that chimeric barnase and barstar genes containing promoters that are active in several overlapping cell types can be used for targeted cell ablation experiments...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the removal}} of all single <b>circular</b> <b>cells</b> in self-orthogonalizing {{processors}} and redundant single <b>circular</b> <b>cells</b> in referential-orthogonalizing processors of a SPMLS in combining multiple lattice filters, the complexity of a SPMLS reduces from (12 M 2 + 7 M) to (12 M 2 +M). Therefore, the total complexity for the R-CMLF scheme is (12 NM 2 + 2 MN+ 3 M+ 1), whereas it is (12 NM 2 + 5 MN+N) for the D-CMLF scheme. If the convergence of the slower component filters is required to be sped up by transferring {{a part of the}} equivalent reflection coefficients to the reflection coefficients of the component filters, the complexities of the proposed schemes increase due to the transfer term in Eq. (34), and momentum terms in Eqs. (33) and (52), which together amount to an additional complexity of (2 MN+ 5 M−N+ 3). Accordingly, the total complexities for the R-CMLF and D-CMLF schemes with transfer and momentum (t/m) terms become (12 NM 2 + 4 MN+ 8 M−N+ 4) and (12 NM 2 + 7 MN+ 5 M+ 3) respectively.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work {{deals with the}} {{simulation}} of fractal growth patterns in electrodeposition (Diffusion limited aggregation) using concept of off lattice random walk. The simulation of electrodeposition under different electric field conditions is implemented to simulate the growth of dendritic patterns in <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> geometry. The DLA growth in <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> geometry is {{under the influence of}} two main driving forces, namely, the random Brownian motion of the ions and the radial ionic motion due to the applied electric field. In the simulation, the effect of radial movement of ions is superimposed over the zigzag random motion of the ions in the electrolyte. The relative influence of the random motion and radial motion is controlled by introducing a biasing parameter. It is observed that the growth patterns with lower values of bias (corresponding to lower electric field) are less crowded with limited branching and more closely resemble true DLA. As the electric field is increased (higher value of B), the growth tends to be dense and with more crowding of branches. The box counting technique was implemented to calculate the fractal dimensions of the patterns developed. The results are compared with the experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} both theoretically and experimentally how {{stress is}} propagated through the actin cytoskeleton of adherent cells and consequentially distributed at sites of focal adhesions (FAs). The actin cytoskeleton is modeled as a two-dimensional cable network with different lattice geometries. Both prestrain, resulting from actomyosin contractility, and central application of external force, lead to finite forces at the FAs that are largely {{independent of the}} lattice geometry, but strongly depend on the exact spatial distribution of the FAs. The simulation results compare favorably with experiments with adherent fibroblasts onto which lateral force is exerted using a microfabricated pillar. For elliptical cells, central application of external force along the long axis leads to two large stress regions located obliquely opposite to the pulling direction. For elliptical cells pulled along the short axis {{as well as for}} <b>circular</b> <b>cells,</b> there is only one region of large stress opposite to the direction of pull. If in the computer simulations FAs are allowed to rupture under force for elliptically elongated and <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> shapes, then morphologies arise which are typical for migrating fibroblasts and keratocytes, respectively.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cell size on the {{out of plane}} {{compressive}} crushing response of <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> polycarbonate honeycomb is presented. The results are a continuation of a study originally done by Mellquist and Waas, 2002. Experiments were conducted on hexagonal cell honeycombs {{ranging in size from}} 1 to 14 cells. The results show that no scaling factor can be determined for the crushing load based on sample size, but that stability appears to be a driving property. Specimen cross-section shapes that have an arrangement of cells with higher orders of symmetry provide greater stability and are less imperfection sensitive and therefore have higher crushing loads. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to better understand the behavior of the honeycombs during crushing and to validate experimental results. An FEA model developed during the previous work (a 7 cell model) has been expanded to multiple sizes. The results are presented and show that the model can accurately predict how different size honeycombs will perform under crushing loads.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Large-scale {{experiments}} on <b>circular</b> model <b>cell</b> bulkheads {{were conducted to}} define the distribution of hoop stresses, deflections of the cells, distortion of the cell fill, ultimate overturning resistance, and the critical mode of failure. The embedment depth of the model cells was varied to investigate the effect of embedment {{on the behavior of}} <b>circular</b> <b>cells.</b> The model cells were subjected to typical service loading conditions, including backfilling and backfill surcharging and were failed by application of a large lateral load. Hoop tension during initial cell filling was found to be the critical design consideration for sheetpiles along the back of the cell. Maximum interlock tension occurred within the lower third of the exposed height of the sheetpiles. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 6 times the active Rankine value is recommended for design of isolated cells. Maximum hoop tension and radial bulging should be assumed to occur at an elevation of one-fourth of the distance from the point of sheetpile fixity {{to the top of the}} sheetpile. The depth to fixity may be estimated by theory of elasticity and depends on the quality of the soil in which the cells are embedded. Backfilling and surcharging increased hoop tension by about 25 and 10 percent, respectively. Crest deflections vary linearly with the magnitude of backfill surcharge. Distortion of the model cells at failure indicates that <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> bulkheads fail as flexible structures. The critical mode of failure for embedded cells was found to be that of tilting about a point of fixity. A plastic hinge forms in the front sheetpiles at the point of fixity. Failure of the cell fill occurs along roughly vertical planes which extend vertically only to the point of tilting. It is shown that the method of analysis by vertical shear using the Rankine or Krynine coefficient significantly underestimates cell overturning resistance. The method of horizontal shear overestimates the overturning resistance for embedded cells by about 35 percent. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure to be used with the proposed failure model is recommended. It is shown that this coefficient depends on sheetpile embedment and fill characteristics, and is significantly larger than previously suggested values. Available field data on <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> bulkheads, specifically hoop tension and deflection data, is presented and discussed. In general, the trends in field data compare favorably with the results from the model study...|$|R
