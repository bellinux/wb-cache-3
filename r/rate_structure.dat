In 1872, he filed quo warranto proceedings against the Chicago and Alton Railroad, demanding their charter be revoked because they were charging rates which seemed unfair. The Chicago and Alton Railroad's <b>rate</b> <b>structure</b> charged US$5.65 to haul 1000 ft (304.8 m) of lumber from Chicago to Lexington but charged 65 cents less for a longer trip from Chicago to Bloomington. As a result, lower courts ruled that the state could regulate the rate structures of railroads, later the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the ruling {{on the grounds that}} some rate discrimination may prove justifiable. During the process of their decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that states did indeed have the right to regulate the rates of railroads and, by implication, the right to regulate other companies.|$|E

40|$|Within Europe {{differentiated}} <b>rates</b> <b>structures</b> {{date back}} to the introduction of VAT itself. Evidence as regards the negative consequences of applying multiple rates has been apparent for some decades. In this context, since the late 1980 s, there have been several attempts to amend European <b>rates</b> <b>structures</b> under the political guidance of the European Commission. However, the most recent agreed upon amendments to the <b>rates</b> <b>structure</b> have increased the level of differentiation, rather than decreased it, with more goods and services being subject to reduced rates in Europe today than even as recently as ten years ago. This reality seems to be changing in the last few years. Since 2008 a staggering twenty-two of the twenty-eight EU Member State countries have increased their VAT rates, resulting in a broad convergence of VAT standard rates across the EU around the 21 % mark. Furthermore, there has also been a decrease in levels of differentiation with a reduction in number of VAT rates applicable in many Member States, as well as various base broadening measures. The latest developments seem to indicate that conditions may be present which allow the reversal of the status quo bias, creating the opportunity for base broadening tax reform. This raises the possibility that European countries might engage in an involuntary process of convergence of VAT bases, fuelled by domestic necessities. A politically achievable blueprint for reform of VAT <b>rate</b> <b>structures</b> in European is presented, which would result in a broader-based, and thus more efficient and neutral, VAT.
