40|$|A {{dispersion-strengthened}} {{copper alloy}} with 1  wt% TiC for commercial electrical-contact wires was prepared by in-situ <b>reaction</b> <b>casting,</b> grain-ultrafining by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and subsequent annealing with aim to obtain excellent comprehensive performance. The {{results showed that}} fine TiC particles were in-situ synthesized in the as-cast Cu matrix and aggregated in clusters, and thus mechanical properties of the as-cast alloy deemed insufficient. Continued ECAP at 473  K significantly refined the grains of the as-cast alloy and improved the distribution of TiC particles. Due to multiple strengthening mechanisms, the ECAP-processed alloys maintained good conductivity with obviously enhanced tensile strength and hardness values. After post-ECAP annealing, the elongation and conductivity of the fine-grained copper alloy increased with the adequate tensile strength. The novel combined process endows the alloy appropriate performance to serve current high-frequency electrification railway systems...|$|E

Besides the process itself, materials had to be characterized to achieve thick layers. An epoxide resin, a bis cycloaliphatic epoxide BCE and a divinylether of triethylene glycol DVE TEG were used as monomers and triaryl sulfonium salt TAS was used as the photoinitiator. The materials were characterized relative to their rheological properties, the degree of polymerization and their hardness. The test structure consists of columns with an aspect ratio of 10. The results reveal that the materials used show excellent behavior for the replication of high aspect ratio structures. The replication of a nanostructured area of 10 10 cm 2 could also be realized with the presented process.

Kinetic analysis based on the Marcus density-of-states theory affords standard heterogeneous rate constants, k degrees, for the ferrocene/ferricinium electron-transfer <b>reaction.</b> <b>Casting</b> these data in Arrhenius form yields a value of k degrees (273 K) = 357 s- 1, which is 10 -fold lower than that previously reported for the same reaction at a metal electrode in a similar electrolyte, while the reorganizational energy of 0. 92 eV for the superconductor interface {{is very close to}} that for the related metal interface of 0. 95 eV.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{modeling}} of phase diagrams provides fundamental information for {{applications such as}} solidification, crystal growth, joining, solid-state <b>reaction,</b> <b>casting,</b> phase transformations and oxidations. CALPHAD method has been widely used to predict phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties. However, for systems with no or few experimental phase equilibrium data and/or thermodynamic properties, CALPHAD method cannot be applied. For these systems, predicting thermodynamic properties using theoretical and/or empirical formulae is of great interest. Engel-Brewer and Miedema tried to predict enthalpy of mixing based on electronic properties. Whereas, Faber, Guggenheim, Sommer and Wituciewicz formulated excess entropy of mixing. In this study, Engel-Brewer method {{is used to calculate}} thermodynamic properties and phase relations for 5 binary systems and the results are compared with the experimental data from the literature. Then, Engel-Brewer method and Miedema model are applied to calculate enthalpy of mixing of 50 liquid and solid solutions and the results are compared with the experimental data from the literature. Analysis of the results indicates that the Engel-Brewer method is not robust, while Miedema model with some modifications is evaluated as an appropriate model to predict enthalpy of mixing of liquid and solid solutions. Moreover, the models of Faber, Guggenheim, Sommer and Wituciewicz are used to predict entropy of mixing of 50 liquid alloys and the results are then compared with the experimental data from the literature. A critical review of each of these entropy relations is presented and it is concluded that the Wituciewicz relation is the most appropriate model to predict entropy of mixing of liquid alloys. Finally, based on the current work, a combined Miedema-Wituciewicz model is suggested to parameterize Gibbs free energy of mixing for liquid solutions. This model can be used to predict thermodynamic properties and consequently, binary phase diagrams without relying on the experimental thermochemical data. ...|$|E

This material is presented as an alternative to current commercial ion exchange membranes that have been primarily designed for fuel cell applications. To increase the hydrophilicity and ion transport of the PEEK material, charged groups are introduced through sulfonation. The effect of sulfonation and casting conditions on membrane performance has been systematically determined by producing a series of membranes synthesized over an array of <b>reaction</b> and <b>casting</b> conditions. Optimal <b>reaction</b> and <b>casting</b> conditions for producing SPEEK ion exchange membranes with appropriate performance characteristics have been established by this uniquely systematic experimental series. Membrane materials were characterized by ion exchange capacity, water uptake, swelling, potential difference and NMR analysis. Testing this extensive membranes series established that the most appropriate sulfonation conditions were 60 °C for 6 h. For mechanical stability and ease of handling, SPEEK membranes cast from solvent casting concentrations of 15 %– 25 % with a resulting thickness of 30 – 50 µm were also found to be most suitable from the series of tested casting conditions.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The demands made of materials {{have resulted in the}} formation of complex composite structures; one such example of these is nanocomposites. This study is primarily devoted to the preparation and characterisation of nanocomposites. Reactively cast and reactively extruded nanocomposite strategies for the preparation of polyamide- 6 composites were compared. The catalyst and activator system selected was based on an industrially successful combination. The extruder screw and barrel configuration used had previously been proven effective for the reactive polymerisation of polyamide- 6. The principal objectives were the investigation of the influence of layered-silicates on both the microstructure and the physical properties of the composites. As well as the analysis of the mechanisms that influence the physical performance of the materials produced. The characterisation of the filler-matrix microstructure and its effect on physical properties of the composites were investigated using a range of chromatographic, microscopic, thermal and X-ray analytical techniques. Selected mechanical properties were measured using standard test procedures. Therefore results obtained and subsequent trends observed in <b>reaction</b> <b>cast</b> and <b>reaction</b> extruded nanocomposites could be compared and contrasted. The influence of the polymerisation conditions, residual monomer content {{and the nature of the}} composite structure produced were considered. It was observed that the nature of the matrix crystalline structure could be greatly influenced by the material composition, method of preparation and processing technique. The crystal form of the spherulites present appeared to be the key factor in influencing mechanical strength. The treatment of the silicate-layered clay successfully increased the inter-layer spacings, which was further increased by the presence of high shear forces...|$|R
