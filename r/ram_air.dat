5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{version of}} the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated {{electrics}} with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) (Auxiliary power unit) and <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> Turbine (RAT). ECM similar to B.1A. Terrain-Following Radar (TFR) in nose thimble radome fitted to most aircraft in mid-60s. New Radar warning receiver aerials on tail fin giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E

50|$|The {{smaller the}} {{cross-sectional}} {{area of the}} runner, the higher the pressure changes on resonance for a given airflow. This aspect of Helmholtz resonance reproduces one result of the Venturi effect. When the piston accelerates downwards, the pressure at {{the output of the}} intake runner is reduced. This low pressure pulse runs to the input end, where it is converted into an over-pressure pulse. This pulse travels back through the runner and <b>rams</b> <b>air</b> through the valve. The valve then closes.|$|R
5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E
5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5000|$|Aerial <b>ramming</b> or <b>air</b> <b>ramming</b> is the ramming of one {{aircraft}} with another. It is {{a last-ditch}} tactic in air combat, sometimes used {{when all else}} has failed. Long before the invention of aircraft, ramming tactics in naval warfare and ground warfare were common. The first aerial ramming was performed by Pyotr Nesterov in 1914 during the First World War. In {{the early stages of}} World War II the tactic was employed by Soviet pilots who called it taran, the Russian word for [...] "battering ram".|$|R
500|$|The climatic {{scene where}} Olivia {{encounters}} Nick {{and the group}} {{of people at the}} top of the building was shot at 902 Broadway in Manhattan. Though the actors appeared to be on the edge of a very tall building, there was in fact a hidden roof extending out that they would have fallen on instead. The visual and special effects departments worked in conjunction to simulate the woman jumping off the building. While the actress simply jumped onto a tarp several feet below her, the crew rigged the car with pneumatic <b>rams,</b> <b>air</b> cannons, and cables to implode under the [...] "weight" [...] of her body, and then CGI was used to make the woman appear to fall on the car.|$|R

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
25|$|The {{base engine}} was {{unchanged}} for 1970, but the low-compression economy engine was deleted and the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> III and <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> IV remained available, although {{the latter was}} now a special-order option.|$|E

25|$|The Judge {{remained}} {{available as}} an option on GTOs. The Judge came standard with the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> III, while the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> IV was optional. Though the 455CID was available {{as an option}} on the standard GTO throughout the entire model year, the 455 was not offered on the Judge {{until late in the}} year. Orbit Orange (actually a bright canary yellow) became the new feature color for the 1970 Judge, but any GTO color was available. Striping was relocated to the upper wheelwell brows.|$|E
25|$|A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced {{induction}} {{device that}} increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra {{air into the}} combustion chamber. This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output {{is due to the}} fact that the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> intakes) alone.|$|E
25|$|The main {{generating}} plant {{was inside the}} hull and consisted of two fuel-burning generators. Two small <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbines attached to the main gondola on swinging arms supplemented electrical power for the radio room, internal lighting, the galley, and acted as a reserve. Batteries stored the electrical energy so that radio operation was independent of airspeed. The gondola also had a gasoline generator for emergency power.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, modern stunt {{technology}} was developed, including <b>air</b> <b>rams,</b> <b>air</b> bags, and bullet squibs. Dar Robinson invented the decelerator during this period, which used dragline cables rather than airbags for stunts {{that called for}} a jump from high places. The co-development of this technology and professional performance training continues to evolve to the present, brought about through the need to not only create more visual impact on screen in the modern action movie era. It also provides a safe platform to {{a new breed of}} trained professional stunt performers, including Bill Hickman, Terry Richards, and motorcycle greats Bud Ekins and Evel Knievel. These new professionals were not only driven to create visual impact, but also perform seemingly impossible feats in a safe and repeatable manner. Latterly came the fast action Martial arts movies as a distinct genre, originating for western consumption mainly from Hong Kong from the 1940s, choreographed and later acted in by stunt performers turned stars including Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba from the 1960s, Kent Norman [...] "Superkentman" [...] Elofson, and latterly Jackie Chan.|$|R

25|$|The P-1 is {{equipped}} with many newly developed technology and features, particularly {{in terms of its}} avionics and missions systems. One such key feature is the use of a fly-by-light flight control system. This has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to the sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system. Various onboard systems are provided by Honeywell, who is the largest non-Japanese supplier to the project, such as the auxiliary power unit, environmental and pressurization control systems, <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine, sonobuoy dispensers and elements of the avionics.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk was {{designed}} to be manoeuvrable and can reach Mach0.88 in level flight and Mach1.15 in a dive, thus allowing trainees to experience transonic flight before advancing to a supersonic trainer. The airframe is very durable and strong, stressed for +9g, the normal limit in RAF service is +7.5/-4g. A dual hydraulic system supplies power to operate systems such as the aircraft's flaps, airbrakes and landing gear, together with the flight controls. A <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> turbine is fitted in front of the single tail fin to provide backup hydraulic power for the flight controls {{in the event of an}} engine failure, additionally a gas turbine auxiliary power unit is housed directly above the engine.|$|E

25|$|The engine line-up {{remained}} {{almost identical}} to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a drop in power ratings. High insurance rates for muscle cars, and increasing concerns for emission controls were likely the reason for Ford's changes to its engines. Other manufactures were following suit, including Torino's main competitor Chevrolet's Chevelle, which featured lower compression on all of its 1971 engines, while SS models had the 350 CID 2-barrel as its standard engine. <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> induction remained an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Airborne Package – Extremely {{important}} to Force Recon for inserting Marines behind enemy lines. In this three-week period, Marines will transition from conventional Low Level Static Line (LLSL) insertions into the hallmark HAHO techniques.

While wearing a VR headset device, the Marines hang suspended from the Paraloft ceiling that resembles the MC-5 <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> parachute. Many simulations are factored in this Virtual Reality Parachute Simulation; it allows the Marine to jump at high altitudes and visually check his main canopy for proper deployment, alleviate malfunctions, to cutaway and deploy a reserve parachute, then employ guidance and control to an unmarked drop zone (DZ).|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of a patrol mission all four engines would {{normally}} be running, but, as the aircraft's weight was reduced by the consumption of onboard fuel, up to two engines could be intentionally shut down, allowing the remaining engines to be operated in a more efficient manner. Instead of relying on <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> to restart an inactive engine, compressor air could be crossfed from a live engine to a starter turbine; the crossfeed duct was later discovered to be a potential fire hazard. Similarly, the two hydraulic systems on board were designed to be powered by the two inner engines that would always be running. Electrical generation was designed to far exceed the consumption of existing equipment to accommodate additional systems installed over the Nimrod's operational service.|$|E
