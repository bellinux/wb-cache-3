50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>overhang</b> {{may present}} {{a problem in}} large {{vehicles}} such as buses. Long <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> would require the driver {{to pay attention to}} nearby vehicles when turning at 90 degrees. Since the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> is outside the wheelbase, it may hit a vehicle in the adjacent lane, especially when turning 90 degrees right (in a right-hand drive country).|$|R
50|$|The Bertone-designed {{exterior}} featured short {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs,</b> rode on 22-inch aluminum wheels, and was painted in Canyon Mist metallic tricoat.|$|R
5000|$|Bogdan T701.20 (12,0 meter low-floor, 2 doors, {{situated}} {{in front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> Made for Crimea intercity trolleybus system). Launched in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{angle of}} the front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> varies {{depending}} on {{the position of the}} suspension from 45 to 55 degrees. The minimum turn radius is 7 m.|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{researches}} about vehicle {{ride comfort}} {{and effects of}} the car body vibration on vehicle occupant {{had little or no}} focus on the structural modal characteristics of the vehicle body while these characteristics can have large effects on the transmission of the vibration to the vehicle occupant. One of the issues of the automotive ride comfort is related to the transmission of the vibration from the rear suspension to the rear seat mounting and therefore the seat and the vehicle occupant. Since such vibration are mainly caused by the rear body structure torsion mode, more care is required to predict the characteristics of this torsion mode in early design phase of the car. When the predecessor platform is resized for using a new car, it is sometimes necessary to extend the <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> of the car. This research shows that the length of <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> may have a large effect on the torsion mode of the body and therefore on the transmission of the vibration from the road or rear suspension (shock absorbers) to the rear seat mountings. When a same platform is used for two similar models with different lengths of <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs,</b> the <b>rear</b> seat vibration level can considerably be different for these two similar models. An automotive CAE concept beam model, here, is used to investigate the effects of <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> on the <b>rear</b> seat vibration and comfort level. CAE beam concept models for the car body are important tools are used to predict and optimize the structural dynamics, in early design phase where there is no enough detailed design data. Here, the results show that by extending the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> the dynamic stiffness of the rear/overhang bending decreases and this may considerably aggravates the transmission of the vibration to the seat...|$|R
25|$|The station wagon, {{added to}} the range in November 1960, lacked the American version's {{extended}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> due to concern that {{the back of the}} car might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains.|$|R
5000|$|Optima Mid (all of the Optima models {{below are}} belt drive models. The {{location}} of the motor was changed from the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> to an RMR layout. The frame was made of duralumin and fibre-reinforced plastic) ...|$|R
50|$|The Enviro350H has its {{powertrain}} {{located at}} the nearside of the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> similar with the full-low-floor buses in Europe. It can be equipped with BAE Systems' HybriDrive series-hybrid system with a Cummins ISBe engine as generator.|$|R
50|$|Like its competitor, the Volvo B7L, {{the engine}} is mounted at {{the left side of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> (thus the <b>rear</b> door can be located as {{rearward}} as possible), but the radiator is mounted on the roof.|$|R
50|$|Payload is 2 300 kg in {{terrain and}} 4 000 kg on road. The front {{overhang}} is 1 300 mm and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> 1 000 mm. The turning radius is 7.6 metres and top speed 90 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Put into {{production}} to integrate hull improvements {{brought by the}} M5 into the M3 series. Turret with <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> to house SCR-508 radio. Welded hull with sloped armor, 20° in from the vertical, on front and sides.|$|R
50|$|Overhangs are {{the lengths}} {{of a car}} which extend beyond the {{wheelbase}} at the front and rear. They are normally described as front <b>overhang</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b> Practicality, style, and performance {{are affected by the}} size and weight of overhangs.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of the Mégane II, an all-new Scénic was launched. There is also a seven-seater Compact MPV Grand Scénic, with a longer {{wheelbase}} and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> which has two small child-sized seats in the enlarged luggage area.|$|R
50|$|The regular length five-seater {{model with}} a shorter <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> is just called Livina or Livina XR, or in Taiwan as Livina Urban or Livina Sport. While the longer 7-seater is a station wagon-style MPV, the 5-seater may be {{considered}} as a roomy hatchback.|$|R
50|$|The {{wheel base}} was also {{moderately}} lengthened from 2700 mm to 2760 mm. The overall length of this interim 1932 car, which was offered {{only as a}} soft-topped four seater “cabrio-limousine”, increased from 3680 mm to 4000 mm, apparently reflecting an increased <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
50|$|Though {{based on}} the Polo and Ibiza, its {{extended}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> meant its length was close to a Golf but still smaller than the Jetta. It featured a boot space of 455 L which could be extended up to 762 L by folding rear seats.|$|R
50|$|Large {{overhangs}} {{contribute to}} large vehicle dimensions, {{and the associated}} advantages of size. On front-engined saloon/sedans, measuring <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> is helpful in predicting {{the size of the}} trunk. For these same vehicles, large front overhangs can accommodate larger engines. The Porsche 911, produced since 1964, has always contained its entire flat-6 engine within its <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> with the center of mass of the engine outside of the wheelbase. Large overhangs also contribute to safety due to increased bulk, as well as space for crumple zones that provide defense for passengers in frontal and rear collisions. In the case of the 911, the rear-mounted engine allows for increased practicality {{in the form of a}} small rear row of seats that would be impossible with a mid-engined sports car.|$|R
50|$|The Ford Orion {{was based}} on the Ford Escort, but instead of the Ford Escort's hatchback, the Ford Orion had a {{separate}} boot, making it a four-door saloon. Visually the Ford Orion's notchback rear end and greater <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> make it readily distinguishable from the Escort.|$|R
50|$|The Trident 3 chassis was {{developed}} from Dennis Lance/Arrow. It had a longitudinally-mounted rear engine, with a radiator {{mounted on the}} right hand side of the engine. An auxiliary axle was mounted behind the second axle {{to cope with the}} weight at the rear and reduce the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
50|$|The company {{maintained}} its activities by manufacturing bus bodies on different chassis supplied by Mercedes, MAN, Renault, which were with engines installed on <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> At that time, such buses were manufactured {{for the needs}} of different state-owned organizations and private companies, as well as the armed forces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{delivered}} {{in five or}} seven seat versions. It can be considered an extended version of the Golf Plus, since their front ends are similar in size, while the Touran's <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> is 200 mm longer (and therefore a seven seater, while the Golf Plus is a five seater).|$|R
50|$|The Mark VII chassis {{came from}} the Jaguar Mark V and the {{wheelbase}} remained the same at 10 ft. The new model's body looked more streamlined, with integrated headlights and mudguards, a two-piece windscreen, and longer <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b> As on the Mark V, the rear wheels were partially covered by removable spats.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 5 units called the Type E were {{produced}} in Japan for homologation requirements {{to compete in}} the Super GT series. It had a longer nose and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> as well as several add-ons for aerodynamic purposes. The Type-E engine is rated at [...] @ 6200 rpm, [...] @ 4800 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|... "The key to {{the look}} of the Trailhawk," [...] said Nick Vardis, Principal Exterior Designer, [...] "is the vehicle's {{distinctive}} proportions, due in part to its 116 in wheelbase. The dash-to-front-axle dimension is dramatically long, giving the vehicle a sense of forward motion, while the front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> are tight and abbreviated." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1991 : Front wing narrowed from 150 cm to 140 cm. <b>Rear</b> <b>overhang</b> {{reduced from}} 60 cm to 50 cm. More {{stringent}} testing of survival cell by FIA including seat belts, fuel tanks and rollbar. Points scoring system overhauled, win now secures 10 points and all results to count instead of best 11 scores.|$|R
5000|$|Built from February 1952. All upper grilles {{vertical}} [...] "Farr-Air" [...] type. Center {{car body}} louvres became vertical-slotted. Sand filler {{now with a}} horizontal, rectangular pull handle. From June 1952, 48 in dynamic brake fans began to be introduced; from October 1952, all dynamic-brake equipped locomotives had them. At that latter date, locomotives {{no longer had a}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Volvo B7L was a fully low floor single-decker bus, {{double-decker}} bus and articulated bus chassis with a rear engine mounted vertically {{on the left}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> it was built as a replacement for the Volvo B10L. It was used as both a single-decker bus and a {{double-decker bus}} chassis largely in Continental Europe.|$|R
50|$|When Chrysler {{discontinued}} the Eagle brand after 1998, the Chrysler 300M {{was introduced}} {{as a replacement}} for the Vision. All models again shared a wheelbase of 113 in. The 300M was several inches shorter than Concorde, Intrepid, & LHS, due to shorter front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> in order to bring the car's length under 5 meters.|$|R
5000|$|From March - May 1984 trolleybuses were {{produced}} without the low -level rear accumulation area, which {{was due to}} the need to strengthen the base structure of the body in the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> [...] In 1985, the nameplate trolley was partially aligned with the standards forming the VIN code, which led to a change in marking HTI682V00 [...]|$|R
50|$|The Caddy Maxi {{family is}} 470 mm longer {{version of the}} Caddy with 4.2 m3 loading space, {{this is due to}} {{extensions}} of the wheelbase which measures 3002 mm an extended, <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> now 151 mm, plus the growth between the sliding doors and the rear axle now at 319 mm and payload is up to 800 kg to 810 kg on commercial versions.|$|R
50|$|The Volvo B7TL was a low-floor {{double-decker}} bus which {{was launched in}} 1999 and replaced the 2-axle version of Volvo Olympian (its 3-axle version was replaced by Volvo Super Olympian). It was built as the British bus operators seemed hesitant to purchase the B7L double decker with a long <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> (although some have since entered service in Glasgow, Scotland as 12m long double deckers).|$|R
50|$|The Livina Geniss in China, or Grand Livina {{in other}} {{countries}} is a 7-seater model with longer <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b> The Grand Livina was launched in Indonesia in 2007 with 1.5 SV, 1.5 XV, 1.8 XV, and 1.8 Ultimate trim levels. Later the 1.5 S, 1.5 Ultimate, {{as well as the}} sporty 1.5 & 1.8 Highway Star with body kit were added into the line up.|$|R
50|$|Long {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> {{on the body}} were to assist with {{crossing}} crevasses up to 15 ft wide. The front wheels were to be retracted so the front could be pushed across the crevasse. The front wheels were then to be extended (and the rear wheels retracted) to pull the vehicle {{the rest of the}} way across. This process required a complicated, 20-step procedure.|$|R
50|$|The iQ {{features}} a transmissions differential housing located ahead of, rather than behind, the engine; a starter motor {{incorporated in the}} engine's flywheel, a high-mounted steering rack and a compact, high-located air conditioning unit behind the dashboard central area. The arrangement allows the front passenger to sit forward of the driver, giving increased rear passenger legroom. A shallow under-floor fuel tank reduces <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Three {{almost entirely}} {{different}} coupé utility bodies {{were available for}} this generation of Falcon: the Australian Falcon Ute differed in having a shorter <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> than North American models, a cargo box that extended farther forward than the rear window, and shorter doors, while the Argentinian version also shared the sedan's overall length and short [...] "four-door" [...] doors, adding higher and more squared-off cargo box sides.|$|R
50|$|Built from February 1949. Upper grille with {{horizontal}} openings. Four horizontal louvred openings {{on center}} body panel. 36 in dynamic brake fan, if dynamic brakes fitted. Flush windshield gasket changed to raised in July 1949. Square cab door corners with kick plates {{on the steps}} beneath. Wing window short with square corners. Single drip strip over cab windows and door. Square end door window. Round sand filler cover. <b>Rear</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
