[...] Very wide flat laces are often called [...] "fat laces". Leather shoelaces with a square cross-section, which are very common on boat shoes, are notoriously prone to coming undone.|$|E
2500|$|Produced by Beistegui Hermanos in Eibar, Spain, {{this was}} the first pseudo-Mauser on the market, a {{relatively}} crude semi-auto appearing in 1926 and full-auto variants appearing in 1927. Mechanically, it was laid out approximately like the Mauser original, but without the removable lock frame. Internal parts (trigger, hammer, safety lever, etc.) pivoted on pins and screws extending through the frame. The screws also held the frame together. The bolt was of <b>round</b> <b>cross-section,</b> unlike the square Mauser bolt. The weapon was stamped with either [...] "Royal" [...] or [...] "ETAI".|$|E

25|$|Based on the PA-47 PiperJet prototype, the Altaire {{featured}} a slightly larger fuselage with a <b>rounded</b> <b>cross-section,</b> and included a conventional control yoke for flight control, {{as opposed to}} the original PiperJet's side-stick.|$|R
25|$|While <b>round</b> <b>cross-sections</b> {{dominate}} most drawing processes, non-circular cross-sections are drawn. They {{are usually}} drawn when the cross-section {{is small and}} quantities are too low to justify rolling. In these processes, a block or Turk's-head machine are used.|$|R
50|$|Allium bidentatum {{produces}} {{very narrow}} cylindrical bulbs rarely more than 4 mm across. Scape is <b>round</b> in <b>cross-section,</b> up to 30 cm tall.

50|$|Each {{exponent}} can be varied independently {{to obtain}} combined shapes. For example, if r=s=2, and t=4, one obtains a {{solid of revolution}} which resembles an ellipsoid with <b>round</b> <b>cross-section</b> but flattened ends. This formula is a special case of the superellipsoid's formula if (and only if) r = s.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{diameter}} magnet wire {{usually has}} a <b>round</b> <b>cross-section.</b> This kind of wire {{is used for}} things such as electric guitar pickups. Thicker magnet wire is often square, rectangular or hexagonal (with rounded corners) in cross section, packing more efficiently and having greater structural stability and thermal conductivity across adjacent turns.|$|E
50|$|Allium atrosanguineum {{produces}} cylindrical bulbs up to 10 mm in diameter. Scapes are <b>round</b> in <b>cross-section,</b> up to 60 cm tall.

Tepals are pink, yellow, copper-colored, brass-colored or purple, sometimes with small dark spots.|$|R
5000|$|Orthothecids {{fall into}} two groups: one, the orthothecida sensu stricto, is kidney or heart shaped in {{cross-section}} due to a longitudinal groove on its ventral surface, and its opercula bear cardinal processes; the other has a <b>rounded</b> <b>cross-section</b> and often lacks cardinal processes, making them difficult to distinguish from other cornet-shaped calcareous organisms. [...] All were sessile and benthic; some may have been filter feeders.|$|R

50|$|An O-ring, {{also known}} as a packing, or a toric joint, is a {{mechanical}} gasket {{in the shape of a}} torus; it is a loop of elastomer with a <b>round</b> <b>cross-section,</b> designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts, creating a seal at the interface.|$|E
50|$|Cylindrical {{coordinates}} {{are useful}} in connection with objects and phenomena that have some rotational symmetry about the longitudinal axis, such as water flow in a straight pipe with <b>round</b> <b>cross-section,</b> heat distribution in a metal cylinder, electromagnetic fields produced by an electric current in a long, straight wire, accretion disks in astronomy, and so on.|$|E
50|$|While most light pipes are {{produced}} with a <b>round</b> <b>cross-section,</b> light pipes {{are not limited}} to this geometry. Square and hexagonal cross-sections are used in special applications. Hexagonal pipes tend to produce the most homogenized type of IR Light. The pipes {{do not need to be}} straight. Bends in the pipe have little effect on efficiency.|$|E

5000|$|The Nagyka, nagaika, or nagayka (нага́йка; [...] ) is a short, thick whip with <b>round</b> <b>cross-section</b> used by Cossacks, {{borrowed}} from Nogai people, hence the original name [...] "nogaika", or [...] "Nogai's whip". It is also called камча, kamcha from the Turkic word [...] "kamci" [...] for [...] "whip". The latter word {{is also used}} for short whips of Central Asian origin.|$|E
50|$|A file {{is a tool}} used {{to remove}} fine amounts of {{material}} from a workpiece. It is common in woodworking, metalworking, and other similar trade and hobby tasks. Most are hand tools, made of a case hardened steel bar of rectangular, square, triangular, or <b>round</b> <b>cross-section,</b> {{with one or more}} surfaces cut with sharp, generally parallel teeth. A narrow, pointed tang is common at one end, to which a handle may be fitted.|$|E

5000|$|VANTAs can be {{processed}} through volatile solutions or twisted to condense into spun CNT yarns or ropes. Jiang et al demonstrated a spinning and twisting method that forms a CNT yarn from a VANTA that {{gives rise to}} both a <b>round</b> <b>cross-section</b> and a tensile strength of around 1 GPa. [...] The tensile strengths of CNT yarns spun from ultra-long CNT arrays of 1 mm height can range from 1.35 to 3.3 GPa.|$|E
50|$|Devin {{asked for}} some {{changes for the}} final car. For the main chassis members, 3 in <b>round</b> <b>cross-section</b> tubing {{replaced}} the 4 in diameter tubing in the prototype. The 92 in production wheelbase was a compromise between the 90 in of the prototype and the 94 in that Devin had originally asked for. The battery and generator were relocated {{to the rear of}} the car, with the generator being driven off a pulley at the differential.|$|E
50|$|The Remington 700 {{action is}} {{designed}} for mass production. It is a manually operated bolt action with two forward dual-opposed lugs. The bolt face is recessed, fully enclosing {{the base of the}} cartridge, The extractor is a C-clip sitting within the bolt face. The ejector is a plunger on the bolt face actuated by a coil spring. The bolt is of 3-piece construction, brazed together (head, body and bolt handle). The receiver is milled from <b>round</b> <b>cross-section</b> steel.|$|E

5000|$|The MS.138 was {{the major}} {{production}} version of a family that also included the MS.137 and MS.139. The design {{was derived from the}} MS.35, first flown during World War I, modernised to feature a wing that now included slight sweepback, and a redesigned fuselage of <b>rounder</b> <b>cross-section.</b> [...] The basic layout remained the same, being a wire-braced, parasol-wing monoplane with open cockpits in tandem and fixed tailskid undercarriage. Construction was mostly of wood, {{with the exception of the}} metal wing spars, and all control surfaces were covered in fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Since entoprocts {{are small}} and soft-bodied, fossils have been {{extremely}} rare. In 1977, Simon Conway Morris provided the first description of Dinomischus, a sessile animal with calyx, stalk and holdfast, found in Canada's Burgess Shale, which was formed about [...] Morris regarded this animal as the earliest known entoproct, since its mouth and anus lay inside a ring of structures above the calyx, but noted that these structures were flat and rather stiff, while the tentacles of modern entoprocts are flexible and have a <b>round</b> <b>cross-section.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the HP-18's heyday, Schreder also {{spent a great}} deal of time attempting to develop a lightweight jet engine for small aircraft. Schreder envisioned such a powerplant as being ideal for self-launcing sailplanes. His first attempts featured pulsejet engines with their bodies contained within the blades of a propeller, and exhausting through nozzles deflected 90 degrees so as to cause the propeller to spin. Though some success was attained, Schreder found difficulty in containing the internal pressures so as to prevent the engine bodies from reverting to <b>round</b> <b>cross-section.</b> Also, these engines were quite loud and not very fuel-efficient.|$|E
