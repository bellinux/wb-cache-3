40|$|Most of the {{anthropogenic}} {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide result from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production. Photosynthesis has long been recognized as a means, at least in theory, to sequester anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Aquatic microalgae have been identified as fast growing species whose carbon fixing rates are higher than those of land-based plants by one order of magnitude. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), Aquasearch, and the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at the University of Hawaii are jointly developing technologies for recovery and sequestration of CO{sub 2 } from stationary combustion systems by photosynthesis of microalgae. The research is aimed primarily at demonstrating the ability of selected species of microalgae to effectively fix carbon from typical power plant exhaust gases. This report covers the <b>reporting</b> <b>period</b> <b>from</b> 1 October to 31 December 2000. During this period planning of chemostat experiments at Aquasearch was initiated. These experiments will be used to select microalgae for the photobioreactor demonstrations. An initial survey of techniques for removing CO{sub 2 } from coal-fired flue gas was begun.

We find that lobbying networks are remarkably stable over time, though we identify a few notable outliers that indicate that events outside the lobbying networks can affect their basic structure. Further, for each issue area, we calculate lobbyists ’ specialization and the proportion of for-hire contract lobbyists, and find that both specialization and contract lobbying are highly correlated to lobbying network centrality...|$|E
