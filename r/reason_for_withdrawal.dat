Quifel-ASM Team also entered the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans, but retired after 48 laps.

The refusal to allow Pe'er to participate drew immense criticism from top seed players. WTA chief executive Larry Scott said the women's tour was [...] "deeply disappointed" [...] by the decision. [...] "Ms. Pe'er has earned the right to play in the tournament and it's regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right", he said. [...] "Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally." [...] Scott said the WTA would [...] "review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament". In reaction to the move, the Tennis Channel decided not to televise the event, and The Wall Street Journal dropped its sponsorship. [...] In response to the move by the UAE, the Dubai Tennis Championship was fined a record US$ 300,000. Pe'er was awarded US$ 44,250, an amount equal to the average prize money she earned per tournament in 2008. A number of highly ranked tennis players, including 2008 winner Andy Roddick, pulled out of the men's ATP tournament in Dubai in protest. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal also pulled out of the tournament, although they both cited injury as their <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> not the incident involving Pe'er. The WTA Tour Board also demanded that Dubai organizers confirm that qualifying Israeli players will get visas at least eight weeks in advance for the 2010 event.http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212395267&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) affects 0. 5 - 1 % {{of population}} {{all over the}} world. As the duration of treatment is more in RA, patient′s adherence to treatment is less. Controlling {{the number of patients}} lost to follow-up is essential for the successful completion of randomized clinical trials. Also, patient adherence is critical in clinical trial setting as it has impact on validity of clinical data and also it remains an issue of utmost importance to pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as scientific and regulatory community. The studies which show reasons for withdrawal from clinical trials are done for diseases like tuberculosis (TB). None of the study is available to find reasons for withdrawal from clinical trials in RA. Hence, this study is planned. Aims and Objectives: Find reasons and effect of age, sex, duration of therapy, and distance from home on withdrawal from clinical trial. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective observational data analysis. Primary outcome are to find reasons for withdrawal from trial. Results: Withdrawal from clinical trial in patients of RA is more in female. In this study, reasons for withdrawal from study are change in location, loss to follow-up, failure of therapy, concomitant illness, patient withdrew consent, and adverse effects is the common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trial in both patient and investigator-related <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} two ultra-low doses of oral continuous combined hormone therapy and placebo on metabolic parameters, and to assess safety endpoints and overall tolerability in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: In a subpopulation of the Clinical study on Hormone dose Optimisation In Climacteric symptoms Evaluation (CHOICE) trial, lipids and parameters of glucose metabolism and hemostasis were analyzed in Nordic women (n = 158) at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with 0. 5 mg 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) + 0. 25 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA), 0. 5 mg E 2 + 0. 1 mg NETA or placebo. Adverse events occurring from the first trial-related activity, whether related or {{not related to the}} study medication, were recorded for the entire population (n = 575) of the trial. The seriousness, relationship to treatment and the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> were reported. RESULTS: Both ultra-low-dose combinations were neutral to changes in lipid and lipoprotein, hemostasis parameters and carbohydrate metabolism during the trial. The incidence of serious adverse events was only 1 % in respective treatment groups. Adverse events were the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in only 2 % and 6 % of women in the 0. 5 mg E 2 + 0. 25 mg and 0. 1 mg NETA groups, and in 8 % in the placebo group.

40|$|Withdrawing antihypertensives on {{the basis}} of orthostatic {{hypotension}} SIR—The recent British Women’s Heart and Health Study regarding orthostatic hypotension (OH) andmedications sug-gests that clinicians should be cautious in the context of older adults taking antihypertensives and that OH is a ‘major <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of antihypertensives ’ [1]. The corresponding editorial queries whether our treating BP in the elderly can ‘re-sult in OH that could be potentially detrimental ’ and proposes a large study to determine the prevalence of OH.
