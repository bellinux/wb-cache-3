40|$|Effects of once-daily extended-release {{quetiapine}} fumarate (quetiapine XR) monotherapy on sleep {{quality and}} disturbance {{in patients with}} major depressive disorder (MDD) were evaluated. Pooled data from four 6 - or 8 -wk placebo-controlled quetiapine XR (50 - 300  mg/d) monotherapy studies (D 1448 C 00001; D 1448 C 00002; D 1448 C 00003; D 1448 C 00004) were analysed. Primary efficacy end-point was change from randomization in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Post hoc analyses of secondary end-points were conducted for change from randomization in: MADRS <b>item</b> <b>4</b> (reduced sleep); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) <b>items</b> <b>4</b> (insomnia-early), 5 (insomnia-middle), 6 (insomnia-late) and sleep disturbance factor (<b>items</b> <b>4</b>  +  5 + 6) scores; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global scores. MADRS total score change was also evaluated in patients experiencing high and low baseline sleep disturbance (HAMD sleep disturbance factor scores ⩾ 4 and <  4, respectively). In total, 1808 patients were randomized to quetiapine XR or placebo across four studies. At last assessment, quetiapine XR reduced MADRS <b>item</b> <b>4,</b> HAMD <b>items</b> <b>4,</b> 5 and 6, HAMD sleep disturbance factor score and PSQI global scores from baseline vs. placebo (p <  0. 001). For those experiencing high sleep disturbance (n =  865, quetiapine XR; n =  514, placebo), quetiapine XR improved MADRS total score vs. placebo at all visits (p <  0. 001). For those with low sleep disturbance (n =  252, quetiapine XR; n =  121, placebo), quetiapine XR improved MADRS total score vs. placebo at weeks 2 (p <  0. 001), 4 and 6 (both p <  0. 05). In conclusion, quetiapine XR (50 - 300  mg/d) monotherapy improved symptoms of sleep disturbance vs. placebo in patients with MDD, including those with either high or low baseline sleep disturbance levels. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: HIV/AIDS {{disease has}} {{remained}} highly stigmatized {{all over the}} world even though the increasing accessibility of its treatment. This study was designed to adapt the HIV/AIDS Stigma Instrument (HASI) to the Iranian People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Methods: Translation –back translation of the scale into Persian was done. Then, the validity and reliability of the instrument were evaluated. The validity of the translated scale was assessed in three ways: evaluating its linguistic validity, assessing its content validity by a panel of nine experts, and exploring its construct validity by factor analysis. The internal consistency of the translated scale was evaluated by Cronbach’s Alpha. Results: HASI showed a good Content Validity Index (CVI value > 0. 75) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR > 0. 78). The internal consistency of the instrument regarding the total score was 4 = 0. 89. The three stigma subscales that were distancing and blaming (8 <b>items,</b> <b>4</b> = 0. 87), fear (3 <b>items,</b> <b>4</b> = 0. 82), and discrimination (5 <b>items,</b> <b>4</b> = 0. 83).
