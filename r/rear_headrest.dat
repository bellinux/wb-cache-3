50|$|The Tuholer is a tandem two-seat, strut-braced, low-wing, open cockpit {{aircraft}} {{with conventional}} landing gear. The dual control aircraft can be flown solo rear cockpit only.

50|$|From {{a design}} standpoint, the LMP-1 Roadster-S shares {{much with the}} Esperante GTR-1. Both cars have nearly {{identical}} front ends, with narrow fenders surrounding deep valleys with a rounded nose which housed the engine. A NACA duct would feed the air intake for the engine, while the deep valleys on the side that shrouded the front suspension would lead directly to the radiators which were situated {{in front of the}} cockpit. The sides of the car would be carved at various angles, giving an indented look in comparison to the fenders, assisting in allowing air to exit from various areas on the car. The cockpit situated behind the engine and just ahead of the rear axle would be small, with a single rollhoop immediately behind the driver with only the driver's side protection and <b>rear</b> <b>headrest</b> appearing from the mostly flat top of the car. The rear overhang would be short, leaving the rear wing struts actually attached to the rear diffuser behind the bodywork.|$|E
