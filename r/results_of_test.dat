2500|$|The ICC Women's Rankings were {{launched}} on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket. The ranking system gives equal weight to <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>Test,</b> ODI, and T20 matches. It {{was designed by}} statistician and ICC Cricket Committee member David Kendix and utilizes the same methodology as men's cricket rankings. Each team scores points {{based on the results}} of their matches over the last 34 years [...] all matches played in the 12-24 months since the first of October before last, plus all the matches played in the 24 months before that, for which the matches played and points earned both count half. On 1 October of every year, the matches and points earned between 3 and 4 years ago are removed, and the matches and points earned between 1 and 2 years ago switch from 100% weighting to 50% weighting. For example, on 1 October 2014, the matches played between October 2010 and October 2011 were removed, and the matches played between October 2012 and October 2013 switched to 50% weighting. This happens overnight, so can result in teams changing positions in the ranking table despite no one playing.|$|E
2500|$|Natural mode is characterised by {{subjective}} {{effect of}} balance of different frequency sounds, regardless of level of distortion, {{appearing in the}} reproduction device. It is also regardless of personal user's ability to perceive specific sound frequencies (excluding obvious hearing loss). The natural effect is obtained due to special sound processing algorithm (i.e. [...] "formula of subjective equalisation of frequency-response function"). Its principle is to assess frequency response function (FRF) of mediaplayer or any other sound reproduction device, in accordance with audibility threshold in silence (subjective for each person), and to apply gain modifying factor. The factor is determined {{with the help of}} integrated function to test audibility threshold: the program generates tone signals (with divergent oscillations – from minimum volume 30–45Hz to maximum volume appr. 16kHz), and user assess their subjective audibility. The principle is similar to in situ audiometry, used in medicine to prescribe a hearing aid. However, the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> may be used to a limited extent as far as FRF of sound devices depends on reproduction volume. It means correction coefficient should be determined several times – for various signal strengths, which is not a particular problem from a practical standpoint.|$|E
30|$|To {{compare the}} <b>results</b> <b>of</b> several <b>testing</b> fuzzy {{hypotheses}} {{based on the}} proposed approach, five different tests are considered in this example by changing the fuzzy hypotheses (see Fig. 4).

Comparing the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 1 with the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 2 shows {{the sensitivity of the}} proposed approach to the location of the alternative fuzzy hypothesis (compare the first graph with the second one in Fig. 4). Also, comparing the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 1 with the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 3 shows the sensitivity of the proposed approach to the fuzziness of H̃_ 1. Instead of the current fuzzy p-value methods, the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> 1 – 5 show that the proposed decision rule in this paper is a function of both fuzzy hypotheses H̃_ 0 and H̃_ 1 (see the first advantage from Subsection “Advantages of the Proposed Method”).|$|R
