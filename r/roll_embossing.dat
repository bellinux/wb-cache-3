40|$|The {{results of}} the {{development}} of novel manufacturing techniques for microstructured reactors in the framework of the European project CoPIRIDE are reported. The work was aimed at promoting the application of microstructured chemical reactors in the chemical industry. This can be achieved by completely new ways of production of microstructured plates, as manufactured by the <b>roll</b> <b>embossing</b> technique. This opens the door to mass manufacturing capability, which is a common enabler for cost reduction and resource efficiency. <b>Roll</b> <b>embossing</b> is especially suited for automated mass production, particularly on the larger scale. A modular reactor concept and a novel microreactor design for such microstructured plates were developed. The stacked plate reactors are joined either by laser welding or vacuum brazing. In this way, microstructured reactors can be manufactured {{for a wide range of}} throughputs, pressures, temperatures, for single and multi-phase reactions as well as for non-catalytic, homogeneously or heterogeneously catalyzed reactions. Within the project, the suitability of the novel techniques for the manufacture of microreactors with a reaction volume of up to 2 l, which is already the lower production scale of the fine chemical industry, was demonstrated. Three different reactor types could be successfully applied in pilot plants...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microfluidic device addressing {{the field of}} ambulant diagnostics. The basis of the device is a hybrid system combining the advantages of conventional channel-based fluidics with those of digitally controlled droplet-based fluidics. This hybrid concept uses a micro-channel based delivery partition with a disposable reaction partition predicated on electrowetting-on-dielectric. It promises to realize a low cost approach for a Point-of-Care system with easy deployability. Implementation was done by <b>roll</b> <b>embossing</b> for the microchannels and direct structuring of the electrode elements for the EWOD substrate. The latter was laminated with a PTFE-film or coated with a nanoparticle loaded lacquer for hydrophobization. A variety of reagents were handled using a two- phase containment on the EWOD substrate, overcoming the issues associated with low surface energy fluids...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microfluidic device addressing {{the field of}} ambulant diagnostics in rural areas. Often, the diagnostic approach of micro-channel based point of care devices (PoCD) will target a certain marker - if e. g. on site another marker is to be checked against, the visiting doctor needs to use another test device. With the number of markers growing on a steady basis this will incur the need to transport {{a large number of}} individual test strips/cartridges, making the PoCD concept useless for this specific setting. The basis of the proposed novel device is a hybrid system combining the advantages of conventional channel-based fluidics with those of digitally controlled droplet-based fluidics. This hybrid concept uses a micro-channel based delivery partition for stored reagents with a disposable reaction partition based on electrowetting-on-dielectric to run the actual test protocol.

40|$|The {{application}} of the extrusion embossing process is a fast and cost-effective way to produce large-scale fi lms with structured surfaces. In principle, microscopic and macroscopic surface structures can be manufactured this way. Particularly for the fabrication of microscopic structures, the reproduction accuracy can be remarkably improved by applying variothermal heating concepts for the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll.</b> In this article, two possible heating concepts are investigated: one laser-based and another using an inductor. The generated temperature profi le along the circumference of the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll</b> is studied, taking the material of the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll</b> as well as different processing parameters into account. Both external heating systems (laser vs. inductor) are tested and compared. Furthermore, {{the improvement of the}} accuracy of the replicated microstructures is examined...|$|R
40|$|The nanoimprinting is a {{potential}} method for submicron scale patterning for various applications, for example, electric, photonic and optical devices. The patterns are created by mechanical deformation of imprint resist using a patterned imprinting mold called also a stamp. The bottle-neck for imprint lithography is availability of the stamps with nanometer-scale features, which are typically fabricated by electron beam lithography. Therefore, patterning of a large stamp is time consuming and expensive. Nanoimprint lithography can offer a low cost and a high through-put method to replicate these imprinting molds. In this work, stamp replication process was developed and demonstrated for three different types of imprint molds. Replication relies on sequential patterning method called step and stamp nanoimprint lithography (SSIL). In this method a small master mold is used to pattern large areas sequentially. The fabricated stamps are hard stamps for thermal imprinting, bendable metal stamps for <b>roll</b> <b>embossing</b> and transparent stamps for UV-imprinting. Silicon is a material often used for fabrication of hard stamps for thermal imprinting. Fabrication process of silicon stamps was demonstrated using both the imprinted resist and lift-off process for pattern transfer into silicon. Bendable metal stamp for roll-to-roll application was fabricated using sequential imprinting to fabricate a polymer mold. The polymer mold was used for fabrication of a nickel copy in subsequent electroplating process. Thus fabricated metal stamp was used in a roll-to-roll imprinting process to transfer the patterns onto a CA film successfully. Polymer stamp for UV-imprinting was fabricated by patterning fluorinated polymer templates using sequential imprinting and a silicon stamp. The imprinted polymer stamp was used succesfully for UV-NIL. In the stamp fabrication process {{the features of the}} silicon stamp were replicated with good fidelity, retaining the original dimensions in all of three stamp types. The results shows, that the sequential imprinting is as {{a potential}} stamp replication method for various applications...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for embossing polymer foil substrates (1) for production of components {{in the areas of}} micro fluidics, biotechnology, medicine and chemistry, comprises an <b>embossing</b> <b>roll</b> (3), heat conducting bodies (9, 10) and homogeneous temperable surfaces (11). The foil substrates exhibit the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll</b> and a unit for supplying the foil substrate to the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll.</b> The heat conducting material of the body is metal and/or graphite. Distance of overlapping surfaces of both bodies is five times less than the foil substrate thickness. An embossing or overlapping region of the foil substrate is conductible between the surfaces by the supplying unit. The heat conducting bodies in conveying direction of the foil substrates are directly arranged before the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll.</b> Each of the heat conducting bodies exhibits a heat capacity, which is larger than the heat capacity of the overlapping surface of the embedded foil substrate. The temperable surfaces of both bodies are spaced apart from each other and overlap within a coherent lap region. The overlapping region exhibits a shape and size, which correspond to the shape and size of the embossing regions of the embossing die or the embossing regions of the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll.</b> The temperable surfaces are rectangular and exhibit a counter contour three-dimensional surface contour. The bodies exhibit a metal plate shape with a width, a length and a thickness. The plate thickness is more than 5 mm. A first overlapping surface corresponds to a part of a cylinder outer cover inner surface of a first cylinder with a cylinder diameter D 1. A second overlapping surface corresponds to a part of a cylinder cover inner surface of a second cylinder with a cylinder diameter D 2. The diameter D 1 is less than the diameter D 2. The device is intended a negative pressure system connected with one of the body and the foil substrate is suctionable at the surface of this body by means of negative pressure. Means is provided for the adjustment of predefinable distances between the overlapping surfaces of the body. A tempering system provided with the surfaces is formed {{in such a way that}} the surfaces are temperable at 0 - 250 degreesC with an accuracy of plus minus 0. 1 degreesK respectively. The tempering system is formed in such a way that one of the surfaces is temperable at temperature T 1 greater than Tg and the other surfaces at temperature T 2 less than Tg. The thermal energy of the bodies is supplyable in the form infrared radiation by means of inductive heating, electrical resistive heating or heat exchanger. The foil substrate is a foil laminate composed of two single foils, which exhibit different glass transitions. The device is operated cyclically and/or continuously. USE - Useful for embossing foil substrates for production of components in the field of micro fluidics, biotechnology, medicine and chemistry. ADVANTAGE - The device avoids a small temperature difference between an upper and lower side of foil substrates, thus preventing the default of the foil substrate during the cooling-off of the foil substrate. The device enables an economical production of embossed foil substrates in high quality and in flexible numbers of pieces...|$|R
40|$|With {{ultrasonic}} hot embossing microstructures can be embossed from a metal tool into semi-finished {{plastic products}} such as films, sheets or filaments. Because usually no vacuum or long heating and cooling processes are necessary, short cycle times of a few seconds can be realized. Significantly more time must be spent on the manually alignment and fixing of the semi-finished products, {{as well as the}} demoulding of the embossed structures by hand. These manual steps have now been replaced by an automated roll-to-roll production process. Both films and filaments with ultrasonic hot embossed microstructures can be produced from roll-to-roll. Up to six films are handled automatically from feed rollers, led to the fixing unit, are ultrasonic hot embossed, demolded and rewound onto another roll. Various microfluidic structures such as channels, heat exchangers or mixers were embossed. Since the embossing result is dependent on the temperature, the temperature curve and its influence on the ultrasonic hot embossing process especially at the short cycle times of the automated production were determined. The temperature of the embossing tool was monitored during the entire process. Because of the faster temperature rise very short cycle times {{could not be reached for}} larger structures without affecting the embossing result. Minimum cycle times of 3 - 6 seconds for the tested structures were reached. Plastic filaments can also be micro structured with the automated system. The raw filament, 400 micron in thickness, is unwound from a supply <b>roll,</b> <b>embossed</b> and then wound again onto another <b>roll.</b> The <b>embossed</b> microstructures function as predetermined breaking points. Displaying different load levels the filaments can be used as overload sensors in synthetic fiber ropes. Because in this case the process of ultrasonic hot embossing takes less than one second, the cycle time is mainly affected by the distance between the predetermined breaking points. With a distance of 300 mm between the predetermined breaking points, the manufacturing time for one kilometer sensor is about four hours. In addition to the development of the sensors with predetermined breaking points, the produced sensors were integrated and tested in different synthetic fiber ropes...|$|R
40|$|Micro-structured {{and thus}} {{functionalized}} surfaces offer high potentials for new approaches in processing techniques and product design. However, for mass production purposes {{quite a few}} challenges regarding the manufacturing of these surfaces have to be overcome. For the fast and economic production of large quantities of structured polymer films the extrusion embossing process is suitable. For embossing microstructures there are special requirements on temperature control because of the double function of the <b>embossing</b> <b>roll.</b> On the one hand the roll {{is used as a}}n <b>embossing</b> <b>roll</b> with a high surface temperature to improve the embossing accuracy. On the other hand it is used as a cooling roll with a low surface temperature. Only by using variothermal heating systems these contradictory demands on the temperature control can be met. In order to achieve a high quality of the produced micro-structured films an integrative analysis and optimization of the entire process chain is required. This includes the manufacturing of suitable <b>embossing</b> <b>rolls,</b> the development of coating systems and the adaption of the extrusion process. This paper deals with the entire process chain for functionalized, super hydrophobic plastic parts with contact angles up to 165 °. Therefore, conelike surface structures, mimicking the structure of lotus leaves, are replicated. Functionalized parts are produced in the injection molding {{as well as in the}} extrusion process; however, this paper focuses on the process chain of the extrusion process...|$|R

40|$|This {{summarizing}} report {{discusses the}} materials and application prospects for higher purity in steels, which will make possible further advances in materials behaviour and workability. Improvements in purity and homogeneity permit in particular more rational production of thin foils and wire, one-piece shaping of complicated bodywork components and the drawing, wall-ironing and flanging of two-piece beverage cans. Welded designs in plant and mechanical engineering can be fabricated with less effort and less weight. Difficult component geometries and shaping processes can be more easily mastered. Steels with optimized fracture toughness can be exposed to more extreme loads at even lower temperatures : applications worthy of mention include offshore engineering and large-diameter linepipes for use in arctic regions and at great underwater depths. Liquefied-gas transport vessels can be made more resistant to brittle rupture. The bending fatigue strength and service-life of valve-spring and rolling-bearing steels can be significantly increased. High-purity surfaces on piston rods and cylinders guarantee reliability in hydraulic systems, and high-purity calendering <b>rolls</b> permit defect-free <b>embossing</b> of paper surfaces...|$|R
