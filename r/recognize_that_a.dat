25|$|In {{psychological}} {{research on}} altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial {{behaviors such as}} helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people {{are most likely to}} help if they <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness {{with a high level of}} empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders. A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.|$|E
25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E
25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the impact on}} landowners who lost the right to build on their property due to the view shed restrictions, the county adopted an unusual transfer of development rights ordinance. It allows {{the owner of a}} property that cannot be developed to transfer that right to another piece of land where building is permitted. To take advantage of the transfer, the owner must dedicate a permanent, irrevocable scenic easement to the county that prohibits residential and commercial use of the property. To encourage adoption of the land use policy, the county offered landowners a two-for-one transfer ratio. Planners <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> view of the ocean is worth twice an inland view. For each buildable parcel given up by an owner, they receive the right to transfer their credit to two locations, as long as the usage meets the land use policy restrictions such as density. , eight impacted parcels have been leveraged into 16 transfer rights, and nine of those have been used since the program was implemented in 1988.|$|E

During the conference, MacArthur learned about the situation on the Eighth Army's right flank and judged that the Eighth Army was in great danger. He instructed Walker to withdraw from the battle before the Chinese could surround the Eighth Army. After the conference at November 29, Walker ordered all Eighth Army units to retreat to a new line around Sunchon, [...] south of Kunu-ri.|$|E

500|$|Investigators {{identified}} {{evidence of}} arcing in wiring of the {{in-flight entertainment system}} network, but this did not trip the circuit breakers. [...] The investigation was unable to confirm if this arc was the [...] "lead event" [...] that ignited the flammable covering on MPET insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials. The crew did not <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they {{became aware of the}} fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew were soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; intentionally or not, the plane swerved off course and headed back out into the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt. The recovered standby attitude indicator and airspeed indicators showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 knots (560km/h, 348mph) in a 20 degrees nose down and 110-degree bank attitude, or almost inverted; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was later calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity ("g"s). Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{argues that}} non-permanent {{relationships}} involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain {{and that one}} should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists {{a large number of}} marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service {{is an important part of}} marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question [...] "How will I know when a relationship is from God?" [...] and her response is that people are likelier to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> relationship is from God when they have a [...] "team... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective." [...] She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.|$|E
