Maximum parasitism was observed 95. 7 and 84. 3 % at 28 C degree, while minimum parasitism was 61. 3 and 39. 6 % at 32 C degree on S. cereallela and C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. The most favorable temperature was 28 oC on which maximum parasitism and adult emergence were obtained from S. cereallela eggs. Maximum parasitism was observed 97. 4 and 79. 4 % in 2 h old, while minimum parasitism was 24. 6 and 17. 3 % in 72 h old eggs of S. cereallela and C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. Parasitism by T. chilonis decreased with increasing host eggs age. Maximum adult T. chilonis emergence was 98. 2 % in 2 h old eggs, while minimum emergence was 21. 5 % on 72 h old eggs of S. cereallela. Adult T. chilonis longevity on the host eggs of different ages of female wasp was non-significantly different to each other except the 2 and 12 h old eggs which were significantly different from rest of the treatments in both hosts' eggs of different ages. Maximum female longevity was 4. 0 d on 2 h fresh eggs C. cephalonica, while minimum was 3. 0 d on 24 - 48 h old S. cereallela eggs.

40|$|Among {{the insect}} pests that attack stored groundnut, <b>rice</b> <b>moth</b> Corcyra ephalonica Stainton is most important- It is {{polyphagous}} {{in nature and}} cosmopolitan in distribution.. Its ability to develop at low humidities (< 20 "/, RH) may account for its prevalence in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) over other stored product lep. idopterous pests (Dick, 1987) - The irifestation in groundnut results in both qualitative and quantitative losses. C. cephalonica is the most co. mrnon insect pest, often encountered during the visual examination of seed samples meant for export.

40|$|Dry {{formulations}} of three insecticides (chlorpyriphos, fenvalerate and carbaryl) were compared for their efficacy against <b>rice</b> <b>moth,</b> Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton) and groundnut bruchid Caryedon serratus Oliver, {{in the context}} of identifying a suitable alternative to aldrin. Fenvalerate 4 g/kg seed showed quick action and killed all the Corcyra eggs, and Caryedon grubs and adults, within 48 h. Chlorpyriphos and carbaryl were less effective, although the former showed high persistency. Fenvalerate and carbaryl were significantly superior to a range of rates of chlorpyriphos up to 180 DAT, and were on par with aldrin. For seed exports that require storage of 60 days or more, chlorpyriphos could be used as an effective replacement for aldrin.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} different rearing media for mass production of <b>rice</b> <b>moth</b> Corcyra cephalonica Stainton (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) an important host of several bio-control agents. The development and reproductive performance of Corcyra was evaluated to twelve (12) {{different combinations of}} food containing maize, wheat, Italian millet and scented rice-alone and fortified with 3 % dextrose and yeast. Results showed that the net reproductive rate; innate capacity for increase; number of hypothetical females; daily finite rate of increase; weekly multiplication; and potential fecundity were highest and true generation time and doubling time were shortest in Italian millet (alone/fortified). The performance was better in wheat alone (second to Italian millet) than its fortification with dextrose and yeast and also superior to maize and scented rice. Hence, Italian millet alone or fortified with 3 % dextrose and yeast was the most suitable rearing media for mass production of Corcyra...|$|E
30|$|Our {{results showed}} that the {{parasitic}} ability of different species under a certain parasitoid density condition was enhanced along with the whitefly density increasing. These results are similar to parasitic behavior observed by Huang et al. (1996) and Zhang et al. (2005) for other parasitoid species like Trichogramma sp. and the Aphidius gifuensis. Zhang et al. (2005) observed highest parasitic ability of two different Trichogramma species when the parasitoid to host ratio was 1 : 3. Wang and Li (1996) observed an increase A. gifuensis fecundity with increase in host density until the host density reached 40 individuals/female. The fecundity of parasitoid ranged between 493.3 and 587.5 eggs when host density was higher than 40 individuals/female. In another experiment, Huang et al. (1996) observed a similar increase in the rate of parasitism when single Trichogramma females were reared on different densities of <b>rice</b> <b>moth</b> egg. Furthermore, the parasitism rate was also increased with increasing host density.|$|E
40|$|Entomologists at ICRISAT, India have {{identified}} 11 arthropod groupings or taxa as major field pests of groundnuts. Their research is concentrated on 8 of these groupings and covers all relevant {{aspects of the}} contemporary pest control options. A common theme is rationalizing insecticide usage. A long-term, but achievable goal is the incorporation of multiple pest resistance into all cultivars released by ICRISAT. Termites, the thrips Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom) (a virus vector), the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura (F.), and the groundnut leafminer Aproaerema modicella (Deventer) have been selected as subjects of indepth studies. The bruchid, Caryedon serratus (Olivier), {{has been identified as}} a potential pest of stored groundnuts in India. Kernels of groundnut genotypes are being tested for resistance to three other postharvest pests, the rust-red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum Hbst., the <b>rice</b> <b>moth</b> Corcyra cephalonica (Stnt.), and the warehouse moth Ephestia cautella (Walker) by means of techniques specially developed at ICRISAT Center...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the <b>rice</b> <b>moth,</b> Corcyra cephalonica Stainton (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) {{was determined}} as a circular molecular of 15, 273 bp in size. The mitogenome composition (37 genes) and gene order {{are the same}} as the other lepidopterans. Nucleotide composition of the C. cephalonica mitogenome is highly A+T biased (80. 43 %) like other insects. Twelve protein–coding genes start with a typical ATN codon, with the exception of cox 1 gene, which uses CGA as the initial codon. Nine protein–coding genes have the common stop codon TAA, and the nad 2, cox 1, cox 2, and nad 4 have single T as the incomplete stop codon. 22 tRNA genes demonstrated cloverleaf secondary structure. The mitogenome has several large intergenic spacer regions, the spacer 1 between trnQ gene and nad 2 gene, which is common in Lepidoptera. The spacer 3 between trnE and trnF includes microsatellite–like repeat regions (AT) 18 and (TTAT) 3. The spacer 4 (16 bp) between trnS 2 gene and nad 1 gene has a motif ATACTAT; another species, Sesamia inferens encodes ATCATAT at the same position, while other lepidopteran insects encode a similar ATACTAA motif. The spacer 6 is A+T rich region...|$|E
30|$|Density of {{parasitoid}} {{can also}} influence {{the rate of}} parasitism. Under a certain host density, density of Opius caricivorae Fischer was high, its parasitic rate and number of eggs laid were reduced gradually showing a good fitting effect of Hassell-Varley model (Gao 2002). In this experiment, in the certain density whitefly situation, parasitic ability of three different parasite species increased with increase in wasp density increasing, but when wasp density achieved a certain degree, the rate of parasitism started to decrease. The variation in number of eggs laid and parasitism rate proved {{the existence of an}} interference effect of Eretmocerus sp. nr. furuhashii, Encarsia bimaculata, and Encarsia sophia. These results are similar to the findings of Saljoqi and He (2004) who studied the influence of wasp density on parasitism of corn borer by Trichogramma sp. when wasp was introduced into the <b>rice</b> <b>moth</b> eggs (density was 400) at four different densities (density was 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively). When the density was 8, the total parasitism rate observed for host density of 8 was higher than other parasitoid densities. The average rate of parasitism per female reduced with increasing wasp densities. When the wasp density increased from 1 to 8, the average parasitism rate of each female wasp was reduced to nearly one half. Simultaneously, the reproduction of each female also reduced with increasing wasp density which shows that the increasing wasp density reduced the parasitic potency of Trichogramma.|$|E
40|$|Pearl millet is the {{principal}} staple food crop in large portions of Western Sub-Sahelian Africa and the millet head miner (Heliocheilus albipunctella) {{is one of its}} most devastating insect pests. Since 2006, augmentative mass releases of the larval ectoparasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor, have been conducted in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger as part of minimizing pearl millet grain losses imposed by millet head miners. These ongoing mass releases are based on low-cost mass-rearing of both host larvae and parasitoids. A release of parasitoids consists of placing jute bags containing pearl millet grain and flour and parasitized host larvae near pearl millet fields. The total production costs of a single jute bag with parasitized <b>rice</b> <b>moth</b> larvae are US$ 3 - 4. Based on a study of 6634 individual pearl millet heads collected at harvest in 12 farmers' fields in southern Niger in 2010, we demonstrated (i) a strong negative correlation between pearl millet head damage (mining) and grain yield and (ii) that parasitism by H. hebetor reduced grain losses by, on average, 34 % (comparison of infested millet heads with/without parasitism) within the given growing season. Additional benefits may include reduction in millet head miners in subsequent generations. Data from 900 pearl millet heads collected in nine farmers' fields in 2011 were used to confirm data trends observed in the 2010 data and to characterize the dispersal of parasitoids in upwind and downwind directions from a release site. This study provided a quantitative description of the negative impact of millet head miner infestations on pearl millet grain yields and of benefits on grain yield of parasitism by H. hebetor. Our findings strongly support (i) intensification of mass-rearing of H. hebetor, (ii) expansion of educational activities to increase local empowerment and understanding of the potential of augmentative biological control and (iii) optimization of H. hebetor mass release programmes among smallholders in Sub-Sahelian Africa. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|E
40|$|Habrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious ecto-parasitoid that attacks larvae {{of several}} species of Lepidoptera, mainly pyralid moths infesting stored products. Host quality {{strongly}} influences the reproductive success of the parasitoid. In this study, we assessed the reproductive performance of the parasitoid, H. hebetor {{in a series of}} laboratory experiments using six different pyralid host species: Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller), almond moth, Ephestia cautella (Walker), <b>rice</b> <b>moth,</b> Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton), navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker), and greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella L. Experiments were conducted using petri dishes (100 by 15 mm) as experimental arenas at 29 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5 % relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14 : 10 (L:D) h. Two-day-old H. hebetor females were introduced singly into experimental arenas and given a single host larva every day throughout their lifetime. The numbers of hosts paralyzed and parasitized, numbers of eggs laid each day on each host, egg-to-adult survivorship, and progeny sex ratio were used as parameters for assessing host suitability. Paralysis of hosts by H. hebetor females was significantly affected by host species. H. hebetor paralyzed > 95 % of the preferred host larvae that were offered and also used ≈ 90 % of those for oviposition. Daily fecundity was highest on G. mellonella (22. 1 ± 0. 4) and C. cephalonica (21. 6 ± 0. 3), and lowest on E. cautella (13. 4 ± 0. 2). The egg-to-adult survivorship and progeny sex ratio were also significantly affected by the host species. The highest percentage of parasitoid survival was on A. transitella (75. 7 ± 2. 0) and C. cephalonica (75. 4 ± 2. 5), and lowest on G. mellonella (49. 7 ± 4. 8). Our studies clearly showed that H. hebetor females can paralyze and lay eggs on several pyralid species, but it cannot necessarily develop and reproduce optimally on all host species that it can paralyze and parasitize...|$|E
40|$|Spinosad is a reduced-risk {{insecticide}} {{derived by}} fermentation {{from the soil}} actinomycete, Saccharopolyspora spinosa Mertz & Yao. Spinosad is currently registered in several countries as a grain protectant at a maximum labeled use rate of 1 ppm (1 mg a. i. /kg of grain) and with the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) or tolerance on grains set at 1 or 1. 5 ppm. Global launch of spinosad as a grain protectant is expected in the near future, pending final acceptance of international residue tolerances for spinosad by major grain importing and exporting countries. Spinosad effectively controls economically important beetle and moth pests associated with stored grain and is also effective against certain psocid species. Spinosad provides grain protection through control of adult and/or immature life stages of pest insects. The pest spectrum of spinosad under commercial grain storage conditions is still being defined, {{but it is clear}} from available laboratory and field evaluations on various grains that the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn); rusty grain beetle. Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); flat grain beetle, Cry ptolestes pusillus (Schonherr); red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); confused flour beetle. Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val; Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner); <b>rice</b> <b>moth,</b> Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton); Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier); almond moth. Cadra cautella Walker; and the psocid species Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein and Liposcelis entomophila (Enderlein) are susceptible to spinosad and complete control is to be expected. Other pest species such as the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motchulsky; rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L); and sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L) are susceptible to spinosad to varying degrees, but their overall level of control remains to be verified under commercial grain storage conditions. Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with a length of protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Numerous factors have been shown to impact the overall performance of spinosad, including insect pest species, pest life stage, grain type, grain variety, and formulation type. Spinosad possesses a unique mode of action in insects and controls insect strains resistant to other grain protectants. When launched globally, spinosad will represent a valuable new addition to the limited arsenal of grain protectants and can positively impact global food security. Its combination of high efficacy, broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and sound environmental profile is unique among existing products currently used for stored-grain protection.
