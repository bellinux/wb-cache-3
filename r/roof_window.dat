25|$|This large rain-wrapped tornado {{touched down}} at 7:50p.m. CDT (0050 UTC) on May 31, {{southwest}} of Weldon Spring in St. Charles County, Missouri. It first produced EF1 damage as it downed trees, blew over empty trailers, and caused minor damage to construction equipment. It moved generally east-northeast into Weldon Spring Heights (on {{the south side}} of Weldon Spring) and caused <b>roof,</b> <b>window,</b> and solar panel damage to a few structures as well as downing more trees before crossing Interstate 64. The tornado continued moving east-northeast through densely populated residential areas of southern St. Charles County. Roofing was torn off of a middle school and blown , many houses suffered varying degrees of roof (from minor damage to removal of entire roof), wall (from minor damage to total collapse), and overall structural damage, and hundreds of trees were downed. Damage in this area ranged from EF1 to EF2. A shed was destroyed, a garage door was compromised and the roof was removed and blown away, another garage had a wall collapsed, and two more garages were completely destroyed. The tornado reached its maximum intensity to the east-northeast of Weldon Spring, west-southwest of St. Charles and Harvester, and south of St. Peters. Three adjacent frame homes at this location sustained total loss of their roofs and exterior walls, and this small pocket of damage was rated EF3. The tornado continued causing damage in residential areas further to the east and northeast, snapping many trees and causing roof and wall damage to many homes. A few homes had their roofs entirely ripped off, and damage along this portion of the path was rated EF1 to EF2. Crossing the Missouri River, the tornado moved into St. Louis County and Earth City, Bridgeton, and the northern side of Maryland Heights as it moved along Interstate 70 near its intersection with Interstate 270.|$|E

Around this axial mandapa are (clockwise from east); the Garuda shrine, the Kalyana mandapa (wedding ceremonies), the 100-columned mandapa, the Amman shrine and the Utsav mandapa (festival hall).

2500|$|The seating {{is under}} {{the leading edge of}} the wing with a cabin <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> in the wing center section. [...] Access is through side transparencies. [...] Engine options include several Rotax or Jabiru units in the 37-89kW (50-120hp) range, driving two- or three-blade {{propellers}} and enclosed in a composite cowling. Both undercarriage versions have the main wheels on faired-in V-form struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons, with rubber-sprung half axles fixed to a compression frame. The conventional tailwheel is steerable but the alternative nose wheel [...] castors freely, though a steerable version is planned.|$|E

2500|$|Musterles wing {{was mounted}} over the {{fuselage}} on a low, ply covered pylon which blended into the fuselage and extended well behind the wing trailing edge, gradually decreasing in height. The fuselage was ply covered and ovoid in cross section, formed by ply covering over three longerons held in transverse frames; it was distinctly [...] pointed on its underside and tapered aft. [...] The cockpit was {{just ahead of}} the wing under a removable, largely ply cover; the only transparencies were the windscreen and a small rectangular <b>roof</b> <b>window,</b> though there were open circular portholes on either side. All tail surfaces were built in a similar way to the wing. [...] Both the tall rudder and elevators were all-moving and balanced, with straight edges and rounded tips. The elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage and the rudder extended down to the keel, so a generous cut-out in the elevators was provided for its movement. Musterle had a landing skid under the forward fuselage, reaching back almost to the wing trailing edge, and a spring type tailskid.|$|E
60|$|A {{lapis-lazuli}} coloured locomotive which, by accident, had a {{mixed train}} {{attached to it}} happened to loaf up to the platform just then, and we entered a first-class English compartment. There was no stupid double <b>roof,</b> <b>window</b> shade, or abortive thermantidote. It was a London and South-Western carriage. Osaka is about eighteen miles from Kobé, and stands {{at the head of}} the bay of Osaka. The train is allowed to go as fast as fifteen miles an hour and to play at the stations all along the line. You must know that the line runs between the hills and the shore, and the drainage-fall is a great deal steeper than anything we have between Saharunpur and Umballa. The rivers and the hill torrents come down straight from the hills on raised beds of their own formation, which beds again have to be bunded and spanned with girder bridges or--here, perhaps, I may be wrong--tunnelled.|$|E
60|$|Quest was {{conscious}} of an enormous feeling of relief and yet an almost maddening sense of helplessness. She was imprisoned by the Hands. She was in their power, and up till now they had shown themselves ruthless enough. A room with a <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> only! How could she define her whereabouts! His first impulse was to rush madly {{out into the street}} and search for her. Then his common sense intervened. His one hope was through Craig. Again he took up his vigil in front of the window. Once more his eyes swept the narrow street with its constant stream of passers-by. Each time a man stopped and entered the building, he leaned a little further forward, and at each disappointment he seemed to realise a little more completely the slenderness of the chance upon which he was staking so much. Then suddenly he found himself gripping the window-sill in a momentary thrill of rare excitement. His vigil was rewarded at last. The man for whom he was waiting was there! Quest watched him cross the street, glance furtively to the right and to the left, then enter the club. He turned back to the little wireless and his fingers worked as though inspired.|$|E

50|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> is an outward {{opening window}} that is {{incorporated}} {{as part of}} the design of a roof.

A <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> is often a good option when there is a desire to allow both light and fresh air into the space.|$|E

50|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> is also {{different}} from a tubular skylight, in that the light is not directed through any type of channel or tube {{in order to provide}} lighting for the interior of a building. This type of light tube design is often employed with buildings where the installation of a skylight or <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> is not practical.|$|E

50|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>window</b> {{tends to}} be larger than a skylight, making it {{possible}} to enjoy a wider view of the sky overhead.

40|$|Greenhouses are a well-accepted {{containment}} {{strategy to}} grow and study genetically modified plants (GM) before release into the environment. Various containment levels are requested by national regulations to minimize GM pollen escape. We tested the amount of pollen escaping from a standard greenhouse, {{which can be used}} for EU containment classes 1 and 2. More specifically, we investigated the hypothesis whether pollen escape could be minimized by insect-proof netting in front of the <b>roof</b> <b>windows,</b> since the turbulent airflow around the mesh wiring could avoid pollen from escaping. We studied the pollen flow out of greenhouses with and without insect netting of two non-transgenic crops, Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and Corn (Zea Mays). Pollen flow was assessed with Rotorod® pollen samplers positioned inside and outside the greenhouse’ <b>roof</b> <b>windows.</b> A significant proportion of airborne pollen inside the greenhouse leaves through <b>roof</b> <b>windows.</b> Moreover, the lighter pollen of Lolium escaped more readily than the heavier pollen of Maize. In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify any reduction in pollen flow with insect netting in front of open windows, even under induced airflow conditions. We conclude that insect netting, often present by default in greenhouses, is not effective in preventing pollen escape from greenhouses of wind-pollinated plants for containment classes 1 or 2. Further research would be needed to investigate whether other alternative strategies, including biotic ones, are more effective. ...|$|R
