These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum <b>running</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Races over short distances, or sprints, {{are among}} the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games {{featured}} only one event, the stadion race, which was a race {{from one end of}} the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible <b>running</b> <b>speed.</b> Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{research}} team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades {{which was published}} in Biology Letters. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in <b>running</b> <b>speed,</b> the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.|$|E
40|$|Humans {{are known}} to have energetically optimal walking and <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> at which the cost to travel a given {{distance}} is minimized. We hypothesized that “optimal” walking and <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> would also exist at the level of individual locomotor muscles. Additionally, because humans are 60 – 70 % more economical when they walk than when they run, we predicted that the different muscles would exhibit a greater degree of tuning to the energetically optimal speed during walking than during running. To test these hypotheses, we used electromyography to measure the activity of 13 muscles of the back and legs over a range of walking and <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> in human subjects and calculated the cumulative activity required from each muscle to traverse a kilometer. We found that activity of each of these muscles was minimized at specific walking and <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> but the different muscles were not tuned to a particular speed in either gait. Although humans are clearly highly specialized for terrestrial locomotion compared with other great apes, {{the results of this study}} indicate that our locomotor muscles are not tuned to specific walking or <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> and, therefore, do not maximize the economy of locomotion. This pattern may have evolved in response to selection to broaden the range of sustainable <b>running</b> <b>speeds,</b> to improve performance in motor behaviors not related to endurance locomotion, or in response to selection for both...|$|R

40|$|With 6 {{figures in}} the text) Marsupials are often {{considered}} inferior to placental mammals {{in a number of}} physiological characters. Because locomotor performance is presumed to be an important component of fitness, we compared marsupials and placentals with regard to both maximal <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> and maximal aerobic speeds (=speed at which the maximal rate of oxygen consumption,, is attained). Maximal aerobic speed is related to an animal's maximal sustainable speed, and hence is a useful comparative index of stamina. Maximal <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> of 1 I species of Australian marsupials, eight species of Australian murid rodents, two species of American didelphid marsupials, and two species of American rodents were measured in the laboratory and compared with data compiled from the literature.

Marsupials and placentals do not differ in maximal <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> (nor do Australian rodents differ from non-Australian rodents). Within these groups, however, species and families may differ considerably.

30|$|This study {{examined}} the sex differences in <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> in ultra-marathons held worldwide from 50  km to 1, 000  km and {{it was hypothesized that}} the sex differences would decrease across years and with increasing length of a race. The main findings were for both women and men that (i) the fastest finishers improved their <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> across years in 50  km and 100  km, but not in 200  km and 1, 000  km, (ii) the sex differences in <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> decreased non-linearly in 50  km and 100  km, but not in 200  km and 1, 000  km and (iii) the sex differences showed no changes with increasing length of the race distance.

25|$|Like {{many other}} reptiles, {{chameleons}} are poikilotherms meaning their body temperature is completely dependent on environmental temperature. A {{large amount of}} lizards {{are expected to be}} affected by climate change in the near future, especially in Southern Africa where this species is found. If temperatures rise by 1-3 degrees Celsius, then it is expected that Cape Dwarf Chameleon <b>running</b> <b>speed</b> will increase as well. Although speed would be better, bite and grip force would become worse. Chameleons are adapted to current habitat temperatures and conditions, but shifting to a higher temperature would actually benefit some of their traits and abilities.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the analysis of}} slope-parametric hybrid automata: finding conditions {{on the slopes of}} the automaton variables, for some safety property to be verified. The problem is shown decidable in some practical situations (e. g. finding the <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> of tasks in a real time application, for all tasks to respect their deadlines).

25|$|Catchers {{also are}} prone to knee ailments {{stemming}} from the awkward crouching stance they assume. Because of this, catchers have a reputation of being slow baserunners; {{even if they have}} speed {{at the beginning of their}} careers, the eventual toll taken on their knees slows them down, although there are some exceptions, such as Manny Sanguillén and Alex Avila. Some players who begin their career as catchers are moved to other positions in order to preserve their <b>running</b> <b>speed,</b> increase their availability for games, and take advantage of their prowess with the bat. Prominent examples of catchers switching position in mid-career include Mike Napoli, Craig Biggio, B. J. Surhoff, Joe Mauer, Brandon Inge, and Dale Murphy (although Murphy was also known as a poor thrower to the pitcher and to second base, nearly hitting pitchers in the process).|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis has hindleg {{proportions}} {{more like}} those of more primitive theropod dinosaurs than avialans, with long legs indicating a fast-running lifestyle. However, while long legs normally indicate a fast runner, the legs and even feet and toes of Anchiornis were covered in feathers, including long feathers on the legs, {{similar to those in}} the hindwings of Microraptor. Long leg feathers on the lower legs may have slowed the <b>running</b> <b>speed</b> of Anchiornis. In modern birds, especially those that live on the ground, the lower legs tend to show reduction or even loss of feathers. The hind wings of Anchiornis were smaller and made of more curved, symmetrical feathers than those of Microraptor, suggesting that they were used mainly for display rather than flight. However, they might still have granted the animal some kind of aerodynamic advantage, even if their primary purpose was for display or some other function.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis {{is notable}} for its {{proportionally}} long forelimbs, which measured 80% {{of the total}} length of the hindlimbs. This {{is similar to the}} condition in early avians such as Archaeopteryx, and the authors pointed out that long forelimbs are necessary for flight. Anchiornis also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors initially speculated {{that it would have been}} possible for Anchiornis to fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of Anchiornis, while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like Microraptor, with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of Microraptor. A 2016 study of potential flight performance in early paravians concluded that while juvenile Anchiornis specimens may have been able to use their wings to assist running up an incline, and could possibly have achieved flapping flight if a very high angle flapping wing stroke was used, the larger adult specimens would not have gained any aerodynamic benefit from their wings - they were simply too heavy compared to their total wing area. The same study found that flapping the wings while running would have resulted in a small (10%) increase to its <b>running</b> <b>speed.</b> Similarly, use of the wings during leaping would have resulted in a 15-20% increase in height and distance. Notably, Anchiornis seems to have lacked a breastbone (sternum), which may have been made of cartilage rather than bone, as in more primitive theropods.|$|E

30|$|As a way {{to train}} at faster <b>running</b> <b>speeds,</b> add {{training}} volume, prevent injury, or rehabilitate after an injury, lower-body positive pressure treadmills (LBPPT) have become increasingly commonplace among athletes.

Furthermore, data is lacking regarding female runners’ responses to LBPPT running.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of animal locomotion has fascinated man for centuries. In particular, we {{have sought to}} understand why certain species are able to reach such prodigious <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> (perhaps due to our woeful inadequacy in this area (Bramble & Lieberman, 2004)). Such investigations {{have focused on the}} role that functional anatomy and morphology play in facilitating the attainment of high <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> (Williams, Payne & Wilson, 2007; Hudson et al., 2011). Canis lupus familiaris, or the domestic dog, serves as an excellent model for such investigations due to the great variation in <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> exhibited across breeds, and there is a dense body of literature that has considered how the anatomy of certain canines has been adapted to the task of high <b>speed</b> <b>running.</b> Similarly, a great deal is known about the dog genome, and thus adaptations that are thought to be advantageous in the context of sprinting can be linked to their genetic basis (Mosher et al., 2007). Aerodynamics is one aspect of morphology that is known to be important for high <b>speed</b> <b>running</b> (Lull, 1904), yet despite this, the association between a dog’s coat phenotype and the ability to run fast has not been determined. This omission is surprising given the influence of the surface properties of a body on its aerodynamics. Here I use the breed definitions of the American Kennel Club (American Kennel Club, 1998), to show, graphically, statistically and in prose, by reference to previous literature (Cadieu et al., 2009), and by using the mass/height ratio to indicate morphological adaptations for high <b>speed</b> <b>running,</b> that within the larger dog breeds (and in particular within breeds that are known for their running ability (Fischer & Lilje, 2011)), there is no association between coat phenotype and other morphological adaptations that are known to be conducive to high <b>speed</b> <b>running</b> (τB = - 0. 23, p = 0. 04) ...|$|R
