5|$|Square Enix {{has stated}} that the trade of items for <b>real</b> <b>currency</b> is officially a {{violation}} of the Terms of Service for Final Fantasy XI. In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for <b>real</b> <b>currency,</b> which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300billion gil was removed from circulation. In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.|$|E

5|$|The Bloodbath of B-R5RB or the Battle of B-R5RB was a massive-scale virtual battle {{fought in}} the MMORPG space game Eve Online, and was {{possibly}} the largest player versus player battle in history. Pitting the Clusterfuck Coalition and Russian alliances (CFC/Rus) against N3 and Pandemic Legion (N3/PL), the 21-hour-long conflict involved over 7,548 player characters overall and a maximum of 2,670 players in the B-R5RB system at one time. The in-game cost of the losses totalled over 11 trillion InterStellar Kredit (ISK), an estimated theoretical real-world value of $300,000 to $330,000 USD. This theoretical value is derived from PLEX, an item purchasable with <b>real</b> <b>currency</b> that can be redeemed either for subscription time or traded for in-game currency.|$|E
40|$|To {{examine whether}} the recent price {{patterns}} and transaction costs of Bitcoin represent a general characteristic of decentralized virtual currencies, we analyze virtual currencies in online games {{that have been}} voluntarily managed by individuals since 1990 s.

25|$|Black {{light is}} {{commonly}} used to authenticate oil paintings, antiques and banknotes. Black lights {{can be used to}} differentiate <b>real</b> <b>currency</b> from counterfeit notes because, in many countries, legal banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under a black light. In addition, the paper used for printing money does not contain any of the brightening agents which cause commercially available papers to fluoresce under black light. Both of these features make illegal notes easier to detect and more difficult to successfully counterfeit. The same security features can be applied to identification cards.|$|E

Items were paid for with <b>real</b> <b>currency</b> using funds from the user's PlayStation Network Wallet. Alongside content designed by Sony Computer Entertainment, other companies were also able to sell virtual goods through their own stores in Home.

40|$|A virtual {{currency}} {{can be defined}} as a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community. The recent developments in widely spread internet and data mining activities, highlighted the issue of accepting and using virtual currencies for different purposes, including, buying commodities or services, saving, as well as converting into <b>real</b> <b>currencies,</b> such as US dollars, euro or other currencies. One of the most controversial and the most advanced {{virtual currency}} scheme to date is the one so-called Bitcoin, designed and implemented by the Japanese programmer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.

500|$|In early February, ECB {{president}} Mario Draghi {{agreed that}} {{expansionary monetary policy}} like QE have not been undertaken to deliberately cause devaluation. Draghi's statement did however hint that the ECB may take action if the Euro continues to appreciate, and this saw {{the value of the}} European currency fall considerably. A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. [...] However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests {{of the rest of the}} world; just as he did for the 2010–11 incident, economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion.

500|$|Over 7,548 unique {{characters}} {{participated in}} the overall battle, of which 6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in system at the same time. These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances. Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date. The 21-hour-long conflict resulted {{in the loss of}} 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 Dreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones. N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans, while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16. An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Onlines history, estimating that the battle cost $300,000–$330,000 in real-world money. This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games, which the report based off a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While direct conversion of <b>real</b> <b>currency</b> into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can be purchased for $20 USD, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn. However, this does not mean this amount of real-world money was expended, as many ships were purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets. Dr. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Onlines economy, stated that [...] "To me, as an economist, that doesn’t really matter. In both cases this is economical value that is created by people’s work, either in real life or in virtual life. They put their blood, sweat and tears into making stuff so they can have an advantage in a battle, because in this battle like in any other battle in meat worlds, in real life, it is the resources you have available." ...|$|E

2500|$|These intersections {{with real}} economies remain controversial. Markets that {{capitalize}} in gaming are not widely {{accepted by the}} gaming industry.
