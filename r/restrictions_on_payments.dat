However, for this to happen, electronic commerce must become effectively a better way of selling goods and services than the traditional channels. This requires a suitable infrastructure for developing electronic commerce applications that meet the needs of both customers and providers; for instance, multiparty negotiations should be supported, while <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment</b> methods should as much as possible be banned. The current capabilities for developing electronic commerce software fall short of such requirements. To contribute to the solution of this problem, we introduce here Xpect, a generic framework for the development of electronic commerce applications that provides powerful agent-based capabilities for the coordination of multiple services and the intermediation and the negotiation among multiple parties...|$|R

40|$|For decades, the {{dominant}} view among biomedical ethicists, transplantation professionals, {{and the public}} at large has been that altruism, not financial considerations, should motivate organ donors. Proposals to compensate sources of transplantable organs or their survivors, although endorsed by a number of economists and legal scholars, have been denounced as unethical and impracticable. Organ transplantation is said to belong to the world of gift, as distinct from the market realm. Paying for organs would inject commerce into a sphere where market values have no place and would transform a system based on generosity and civic spirit into one of antiseptic, bargained-for exchanges. Here, Mahoney discusses a brief history of the <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>payments</b> to sources of transplantable organs. She then turn to the arguments commonly advanced against compensating organ sources and explain how they are grounded in beliefs that range from the highly contestable to the demonstrably wrong. Furthermore, she examines the most popular compensation proposals, and offering preliminary assessments of their promise and feasibility. She also concludes with some thoughts about the relationship between altruism and self-interest...|$|R

40|$|Most {{analyses}} of the earnings of thoroughbred racehorses indicate that the average return to ownership of a racehorse is negative. In a world of fully informed market participants this implies that ownership of a racehorse is motivated in part by non-financial attributes, perhaps a taste for sport. It has been argued elsewhere that tastes of this nature motivate owners of professional sports teams, and are used to justify restrictions on the prices paid for athletic talent. This paper presents simple models of the utility derived from sporting competition. These models differ in their implications for the rate of return to racehorse ownership and its variation {{with the level of}} talent. Evidence from thoroughbred auctions and racing earnings are used to test between the models. The evidence is inconsistent with models which have been used to justify <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>payments</b> to athletes. We thank Kim Craft and Casey Mulligan for helpful comments...|$|E
40|$|In July 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, {{delegates from}} 44 nations agreed upon an {{international}} monetary system to be established following World War II.

The article discusses the means and methods the IMF has employed to achieve its goals and the degree of success it has attained. One conclusion is that the IMF's goals should be expanded to include the abolition of <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>payments</b> for international capital, as well as current transactions.

This paper investigates whether legal <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> international capital flows are associated with greater currency stability. We employ a comprehensive panel data set of 69 developing economies over the 1975 – 1997 period, identifying 160 currency crises. We control for macroeconomic, political, and institutional characteristics that influence {{the probability of a}} currency crisis, employ alternative measures of <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> international <b>payments,</b> and account for possible joint causality between the likelihood of a currency attack and the imposition of capital controls.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Asian financial crisis, the mainstream view that dominates policy circles, indeed the prevalent myth, is that despite the striking evidence of the inherently crisis-prone nature of freer capital movements, a world of full capital mobility continues to be inevitable and immensely desirable. Instead of maintaining careful restrictions, we are told, the only sensible course is to continue working toward unfettered capital flows; the favored solution is to turn the IMF even more firmly into an international lender of last resort that dispenses bailout funds to crisis-afflicted countries. The IMF took an important step in this direction at its annual meeting in Hong Kong last September, when the Interim Committee issued a statement virtually endorsing an eventual move to capital account convertibility, which means that you and I, nationals or foreigners, could take capital in and out freely, in any volume and at any time for IMF members. The obligations originally listed in 1944 in the Articles of Agreement, on the other hand, included only "avoidance of <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>payments</b> for current transactions" and did not embrace capital account convertibility as an obligation or even a goal...|$|E
40|$|Our {{discussion}} so far {{has assumed}} that each agent has quasi-linear utility, meaning that it acts to maximize its valuation vi(ω) for the chosen outcome ω minus the payment pi {{that it has to}} make. Thus, a bidder’s utility is a linear function of the payment made. We have placed no <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>payments,</b> other than the minimal conditions that they are nonnegative and no more than the bid bi(ω) agent i made for the chosen outcome. In some important applications, payments are constrained. We first focus on budget constraints, which limit {{the amount of money that}} an agent can pay. Sometimes, there is little need to incorporate budget constraints. In a single-item auction, where we interpret the valuation of an agent as its maximum willingness-to-pay, its valuation is presumably bounded above by its budget. In other applications, especially where an agent might wind up buying a large number of items, budgets are crucial. For example, every keyword auction used in practice asks a bidder for its bid-per-click (e. g., $. 25) and its daily budget (e. g., $ 100). Per-item values and overall budgets model well how many people made decisions in auctions with lots of items, especially when the items are identical. The simplest way to incorporate budgets into our existing utility model is to redefine the utility of player i with budget Bi for outcome ω and payment pi as vi(ω) − pi if pi ≤ Bi − ∞ if pi> Bi. One can of course study smoothed version of this utility function, where there is a cost that is an increasing function of the budget violation. ∗ c© 2013, Tim Roughgarden...|$|E

50|$|Regulation by the Banking Department {{begins with}} chartering, {{in the case}} of banks, trust {{companies}} and thrifts, licensing {{in the case of}} most other entities, and registration in the case of mortgage brokers. For all entities, it involves an evaluation of the character and fitness of incorporators (for chartered entities), directors and officers. For banking entities, it also involves requirements as to corporate governance and limitations on corporate powers. For most entities, it also involves financial requirements, such as a requirement as to minimum net capital. Banking organizations are also subject to <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>payment</b> of dividends as well as <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> transactions with affiliates and loans to any one borrower. For all entities, it involves the requirement to maintain accurate books and records of its financial condition and transactions, as well as regular examination by the Department’s examination staff, which ranges from continuous on-site examination for the largest entities, to discrete examinations at appropriate intervals. Under the Banking Law, the Superintendent may require a regulated entity to appear and explain any apparent violation of law, issue an order directing a regulated entity to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices or to make good an impairment of capital or, {{in the case of a}} banking organization, required reserves, or to improve its recordkeeping. The Superintendent may take possession of and liquidate a banking organization and may suspend or revoke a certificate or license to do business or certain activities of a regulated non-banking entity.
