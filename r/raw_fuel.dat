40|$|The {{gasification}} {{reactivity of}} the chars from both raw and torrefied wood, grape marc, and macroalgae {{has been investigated}} in this paper. The variations in char gasification reactivity were explained using further investigation of the physicochemical characteristics of the char that can influence the gasification reactivity, i. e., specific surface area, uniformity of the carbonaceous structure, and concentration of alkali metals (Na and K). It {{was found that the}} influence of the torrefaction process on the char gasification reactivity strongly depends upon the solid fuel properties and pyrolysis conditions. For a pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, the gasification reactivity of the chars from both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae was lower than that of the chars from their corresponding <b>raw</b> <b>fuels.</b> This is mainly due to a lower specific surface area and a lower content of alkali metals (Na and/or K) in the chars produced from both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae than for those chars produced from their corresponding <b>raw</b> <b>fuels.</b> However, the opposite influence of torrefaction was found for the macroalgae char when the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 1000 °C. This is attributed mostly to the higher Na content and the more amorphous carbonaceous structure for the torrefied macroalgae char than for the raw macroalgae char. Peijun Guo, Woei L.

In 1956 the city of Los Angeles conducted emissions tests to determine whether cars were to blame for the smog of Los Angeles. Determining the effects of automobiles required the development of a mobile instrument capable of measuring smog and automobile emissions. The Liston-Becker Model 28 could be put {{in the back of a}} car and powered by batteries in the trunk. The city tested 1000 cars, owned by local businesses, at the Los Angeles riverbed. Seven Liston analyzers were used in the tests. The emissions tests revealed that many of the test cars had poorly maintained V8 engines. The engines' cylinders fired poorly and in some cases <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> escaped. The experimenters also discovered that the smog in L.A. caused varnish to form in the automobiles’ carburetors, changing the fuel-to-air ratio.

In this paper, partial oxidation reforming of biomass <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas with addition of 3 - 8 mol % O 2 were investigated over nickel based monolith catalysts prepared by wet impregnation of NiO {{on the surface of}} cordierite. The composition of producer syngas was analyzed by gas chromatogram (GC) and gas chromatogram- mass spectrum (GC-MS).

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} {{to obtain a}} syngas provides a competitive means for clean energy from renewable resources. The feasibility of the process depends {{on the performance of}} catalyst for upgrading of the <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas from gasifier. The highly stable NiO-MgO catalyst (Ni/(Ni +Mg) = 15, atomic ratio) was prepared by co-precipitation method for the reforming of <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas. Its performance was investigated under practical conditions of biomass gasification. The Ni(0. 03) Mg(0. 97) O and Ni/MgO catalysts (Ni/(Ni+Mg) = 15, atomic ratio) were also prepared for comparison. The NiO-MgO catalyst exhibited excellent reducibility and highly stable activity for the reforming of <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas without prereduction. No deactivation and very little carbon deposition were observed during 100 h lifetime test. The results of characterization (H(2) -TPR, TGA, XRD, XPS) indicated that the formation of nickel-magnesium solid solution inhibited the sintering of nickel particles for high temperature reaction. Due to Ni(2 +) ions diffusion, the Ni/Mg atomic ratio decreased gradually with increasing depth. The highly stable activity was attributed to the small nickel particles size, high dispersion of nickel particles in the solid solution structure, and the promotion by catalyst reducibility.
