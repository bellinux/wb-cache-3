50|$|A building's HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) {{system can}} {{make use of}} an air-side {{economizer}} to save energy in buildings by using cool outside air {{as a means of}} cooling the indoor space. When the temperature of the outside air is less than the temperature of the <b>recirculated</b> <b>air,</b> conditioning with the outside air is more energy efficient than conditioning with <b>recirculated</b> <b>air.</b> When the outside air is both sufficiently cool and sufficiently dry (depending on the climate) the amount of enthalpy in the air is acceptable and no additional conditioning of it is needed; this portion of the air-side economizer control scheme is called free cooling.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for an air-mixing plenum is {{the mixing of}} return air (or extract air) with fresh air to provide a supply air mixture for onward distribution to the building or area which the ventilation system is serving. The air transferred from the return air stream to the supply air stream is termed <b>recirculated</b> <b>air.</b> All air not mixed is rejected to the atmosphere as exhaust air. Air streams are mixed to save energy and improve energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|FFUs {{can be used}} {{in place}} of a more {{conventional}} <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> unit such as a ducted or plenum air system. FFUs are often used because of height restrictions in the space; they are the only systems that work in setups with smaller internal floor dimensions. Additionally when less than 20 filters are involved, a fan powered HEPA, FFU design is generally considered to be less expensive than a more conventional ducted supply system.|$|E

50|$|A {{fan filter}} unit (FFU) {{is a type of}} {{motorized}} air filtering equipment. It is used to supply purified air to cleanrooms, laboratories, medical facilities or microenvironments by removing harmful airborne particles from <b>recirculating</b> <b>air.</b> The units are installed within the system's ceiling or floor grid. Large cleanrooms require a proportionally large number of FFUs, which in some cases may range from several hundred to several thousand. Units often contain their own pre-filter, HEPA filter and internally controllable fan air distribution.|$|E

Fan noise is so loud that hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools <b>recirculated</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|Small air handlers, {{for local}} use, are called {{terminal}} units, and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called blower coils or fan coil units. A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside <b>air,</b> and no <b>recirculated</b> <b>air,</b> {{is known as}} a makeup air unit (MAU). An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, {{is known as a}} packaged unit (PU) or rooftop unit (RTU).|$|R

40|$|A 14 -months field {{monitoring}} {{study is}} described, documenting {{the technical and}} economic viability of integrating desiccant dehumidification units into a retail store's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to condition all outside ventilation air {{to the requirements of}} ASHRAE Standard 62 - 1989 which substantially increased the ventilation requirements for commercial buildings including retail establishments. This report summarizes HVAC equipment and building performance criteria for two nearly identical Wal-Mart Supercenters located in Norfolk and Fremont, Nebraska. At the test-site Norfolk facility, two Munters DryCool desiccant units treated all outside air while standard gas-electric rooftop units conditioned <b>recirculated</b> <b>air</b> only. The standard-design Fremont location served as the control store, where rooftop units treated outside and <b>recirculated</b> <b>air.</b> Comparative measurements included total, latent, and sensible cooling loads, consistency and comfort of store conditions, ventilation air conditions and quantities, gas and electric energy consumption, and a variety of HVAC equipment performance measurements. Data analysis confirmed that integration of desiccant air handlers into store HVAC design improves store conditions, provides greater flexibility to match equipment to loads, lowers operating costs, and presents the potential for first-cost savings. ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} air door for containing conditioned air inside a building {{with an open}} door will have a high face velocity at the opening, generated by top-down flow, and air recovery by a <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> plenum and duct return to the source fans. This configuration is feasible for new construction, but difficult to implement in existing buildings. The air door is {{most effective}} with low exterior wind velocity; at higher wind velocities, the rate of air mixing increases and the outside air portion of the total face flow increases. Under ideal conditions of zero wind, {{the effectiveness of the}} air door is at its maximum, but in windy locations air doors cannot create a perfect seal, but are often used {{to reduce the amount of}} infiltration from an opening.|$|E
5000|$|... 4' x 2' or 2' x 2' FFUS are {{designed}} to be placed in ceiling grid bays with similar dimensions. [...] Ceiling grids with standard size bays that match FFU dimensions are used to construct cleanrooms. Depending on the cleanliness requirements of the controlled space, more fan filter units can be added to the grid in order to meet ISO standards for airflow velocity and air changes per hour. [...] FFUs can be used in place of a more conventional <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> unit such as a ducted or plenum air system. As FFUs require space above the ceiling grid (13" [...] for the FFU module plus another 1-2 feet of [...] "empty" [...] air-filled space), plenums are commonly used for clean rooms with height restrictions; they are the only air systems that work in layouts with smaller internal floor dimensions. Additionally, when less than 20 filters are installed in a room, a fan- powered HEPA, FFU is generally considered to be less expensive than a more conventional ducted supply system. When a microenvironment of clean air is required, FFUs can be used to construct enclosed work spaces, or laminar flow cabinets. Applying the same principle as the larger cleanroom grid, FFUs can be placed directly in a free- standing grid above the space that requires clean air. In fact, this approach is also used for silicon wafer etching in the semiconductor industry.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Airborne {{nanoparticles}} from vehicle emissions {{have been}} associated with adverse effects in people with pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, and toxicologic studies have shown that nanoparticles can be more hazardous than their larger-scale counterparts. <b>Recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration in automobiles and houses may provide a low-cost solution to reducing exposures in many cases, thus reducing possible health risks. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effectiveness of <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration on reducing exposure to incidental and intentionally produced airborne nanoparticles under two scenarios: while driving in traffic, and while generating nanomaterials using gas-phase synthesis. METHODS: We tested the <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration in two commercial vehicles when driving in traffic, as well as in a nonventilation room with a nanoparticle generator, simulating a nanomaterial production facility. We also measured the time-resolved aerosol size distribution during the incar recirculation to investigate how <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> filtration affects particles of different sizes. We developed a recirculation model to describe the aerosol concentration change during recirculation. RESULTS: The use of inexpensive, low-efficiency filters in recirculation systems is shown to reduce nanoparticle concentrations to below levels found in a typical office within 3 min while driving through heavy traffic, and within 20 min in a simulated nanomaterial production facility. CONCLUSIONS: Development and application of this technology could lead to significant reductions in airborne nanoparticle exposure, reducing possible risks to health and providing solutions for generating nanomaterials safely...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>recirculated</b> <b>air</b> in mechanically ventilated buildings causes symptoms {{commonly referred to as}} the sick building syndrome and perceptions of poor indoor air quality. METHODS. A blinded, four-period crossover trial was carried out in two identical buildings, contrasting 70 % return air (index phase) with 0 % of return air (reference phase). Each period lasted 1 work-week. The study population comprised 75 workers who had reported symptoms related to the work environment or perceptions of poor indoor air quality. Participants reported their ratings of symptoms, their perceptions, and related information in a daily diary. The outcome criteria included aggregative symptom scores for mucosal irritation, skin reaction, allergic reaction, and general symptoms formed of ratings of component symptoms. Perceptions of unpleasant odor, stuffiness, or dustiness were additional outcome criteria. RESULTS. All 75 participants returned their diaries. For no symptoms did the scores differ between the two phases more than could be expected by chance. Mean rating of unpleasant odor was significantly smaller during the index phase, but mean ratings of dustiness and stuffiness did not differ materially between the two phases. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that 70 % <b>recirculated</b> <b>air,</b> when accompanied by an adequate intake of outdoor air, can be used without causing adverse effects...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} tests was {{undertaken}} on a recirculation scheme in a deep level gold mine to establish the effect of controlled recirculation of the mine ventilation air on blast contaminant dissipation. Clarification was needed {{as to whether the}} existing re-entry interval of three hours would have to be extended with the introduction of controlled recirculation. The re-entry interval is a time interval, after blasting, stipulated by the Inspector of Mines during which the workings are being cleared of blast contaminants and during which time no persons are permitted tc enter the workings. The fresh and <b>recirculated</b> <b>air</b> flow rates were varied and their effects on blast contaminant dissipation measured. Gas concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen (N 0 X) and carbon monoxide were monitored continuously in the return air. Dust levels were monitored in the return air from two hours before the blast to four hours after the blast. Two gas models (mixed-volume and plug-flow) and residence time analysis were used to analyse the data. In all the tests, the critical blast contaminant for determining the re-entry interval was found to be NO*. In addition, the following parameters affected the re-entry interval; the amount of explosives ignited daily, the volume of the workings into which the NO* is dissipated by the ventilating air, the time taken for air to complete one circuit (the cycle time), leakage and short circuiting of air, and the fresh air flow rate.

40|$|Tunnels {{serve as}} {{enclosed}} particle loaded environments where mostly stagnant and stable abiotic conditions prevail throughout the year. In-vehicle exposure to ultra-fine particles (UFP) is therefore significant while driving through long tunnels. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess exposure to UFP while driving a car through a 3. 4 km long highway tunnel system in Austria and to calculate the associated lung deposition. On board a mobile Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS, Grimm model 5403) was used to monitor the particle number concentration in the size range of 5. 5 nm to 350 nm. The influence of various air ventilation settings inside the passenger cabin of the car was investigated in terms of UFP concentrations. These ventilation settings and hence the associated particle concentrations inside the cabin were used in the lung deposition model IDEAL to determine their fate in the lung. To examine a real life situation, this heavily frequented highway tunnel system was chosen to serve as a particle laden environment. The data were obtained over several days throughout the year to analyze the effect of traffic mix on the resulting particle regime. Our study revealed a decrease of in-cabin air pollution by up to 88 % while using <b>recirculating</b> <b>air</b> (RA) settings in combination with the air-conditioning system. This mode of operation in comparison to plain tunnel air (TA) reduced the corresponding lung deposition by up to 95 %.
