Infrared emission Fourier transform spectroscopy was chosen as the primary method of analysis because it was sensitive enough to be used in-situ on tiny patches of monolayers or of only a few molecular layers of deposits which generally proved completely insoluble in any nondestructive solvents. Deposits of four base fuels were compared; dodecane, a dodecane/tetralin blend, commercial Jet A fuel, and a broadened-properties jet fuel particularly rich in polynuclear aromatics.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to phase out global {{petroleum}} subsidies, due to the severe strain they impose on government expenditures and on the environment. However, reform efforts are often stymied by popular resistance to subsidy reform. This article examines {{the role played by}} local governments in shaping resistance to reforming fiscally and environmentally disastrous fuel subsidies. Shifting from universalaccess social programs, such as fuel subsidies, to targeted programs requires vesting authority with local politicians and bureaucrats, whom the state relies on to identify poor households and to deliver benefits. Where local governments are corrupt, citizens find promises to replace fuel subsidies with targeted spending less credible, and resistance to reform is higher. Using household survey data from Indonesia, this paper finds that corruption in the implementation of targeted transfer programs increases <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidy reform among the poor citizens who consume the least fuel and who stand to benefit the most from targeted programs. Matching methods are employed to reduce endogeneity concerns. The findings suggest that improving capacity within subnational governments to deliver social programs is important in developing public support for reform.

40|$|There is {{a debate}} among policy analysts about whether fuel taxes alone are the most {{effective}} policy to reduce fuel use by motorists, or whether to also use mandatory standards for fuel efficiency. A problem with a policy mandating fuel economy standards is the"rebound effect,"whereby owners with more efficient vehicles increase vehicle usage. If {{an important part of}} negative externalities from transport are associated with vehicle kilometers (accidents, congestion, road wear) rather than fuel consumption, the rebound effect increases negative externalities. Taxes and standards should be mutually supportive because fuel taxes often meet political resistance. Over time, fuel efficiency standards can reduce political <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes. Thus, by raising fuel efficiency standards now, politicians may be able to pursue higher fuel tax paths in the future. Another argument in support of fuel efficiency standards and similar policies is that standards {{to a greater extent than}} taxes can be announced in advance and still be credible and change the behavior of inventors, firms, and other agents in society. A further argument is that standards can be used with greater force and commitment through international coordination.

5000|$|Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN): {{a common}} {{material}} for o-rings {{because of its}} good mechanical properties, its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> lubricants and greases, and its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials {{are determined by the}} acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> oils and <b>fuels.</b> As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> oils and <b>fuels</b> improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based lubricants and greases, many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils and greases and water to about 80 °C. NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high aromatic content, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD).

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this research project, the requirements {{to be made of}} a sealing system with a plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER as the sealing element when used as sealing material in roads in water procurement areas were studied. The chemical stresses on plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINERS for this application are much less than in waste dump construction. Normally, it is only necessary <b>to</b> demonstrate long-term <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> oils, <b>fuels</b> and salt solutions as, on account of the good opportunities for sanitation, the plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER is only polluted for a short time by liquids dispersed {{in the event of an}} accident. When installing the sealing system in the embankment it must be demonstrated that the covering layer cannot slide off the sealing system. Diagrams for three limiting embankment geometries were produced with which proof of this can be produced with a known natural angle of incline of the covering material and limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system. Furthermore, it was shown how a reinforcing element can be used to increase the stability and how the necessary reinforcement tensile force is calculated. In order to determine the limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system, shear tests were carried out in a shear device with dimensions 30 x 30 cm. The following structure was tested: covering layer/reinforcing element/geotextile support layer/plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER/geotextile protective layer. Tests were carried out with 3 soils, 2 reinforcing elements and plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINERS with various surface structures. In order to protect the plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER against mechanical damage, mechanically bonded fabrics can be used.

40|$|To help {{overcome}} the world's dependence upon fossil fuels, suitable biofuels are promising alternatives {{that can be}} used in the transportation sector. Recent research on internal combustion engines shows that short alcoholic fuels (e. g., ethanol or n-butanol) have reduced pollutant emissions and increased knock <b>resistance</b> compared <b>to</b> fossil <b>fuels.</b> Although higher molecular weight alcohols (e. g., n-pentanol and n-hexanol) exhibit higher reactivity that lowers their knock resistance, they are suitable for diesel engines or advanced engine concepts, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), where higher reactivity at lower temperatures is necessary for engine operation. The present study presents a detailed kinetic model for n-pentanol based on modeling rules previously presented for n-butanol. This approach was initially validated using quantum chemistry calculations to verify the most stable n-pentanol conformation and to obtain C-H and C-C bond dissociation energies. The proposed model has been validated against ignition delay time data, speciation data from a jet-stirred reactor, and laminar flame velocity measurements.

40|$|The current ship speed {{prediction}} {{at a given}} {{fuel consumption}} shows large differences with the actual operational values for the Happy Star. This can result in schedule fines, unexpected fuel expenditures and difficulties in bunker schedules. The first goal {{of this research is}} to improve these predictions for the expected range of weather conditions and expand it for cargo or no-cargo condition in good or bad weather. A second goal of this research is to gain insight in the uncertainty of predicting fuel consumption. A prediction model is built which takes into account the calm water, added <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> wind- and swell waves and added <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> wind. The total resistance follows from the sum of these separate components. The total <b>resistance</b> is translated <b>to</b> a value for daily fuel consumption. Using hind-casting a validation is performed with daily fuel consumption from noon reports. The uncertainties accompanied with these calculations are reported as well as the uncertainty propagation in the translation of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> consumed <b>fuel.</b> From the results of the simulations it seems justified to conclude that; 1. The separation of cargo/no-cargo conditions and good/bad weather gives an improved estimation the relation between vessel speed and daily fuel consumption, as expressed by the prediction error; a. For no-cargo condition from 79 % to 60 %/ 55 % in good/bad weather respectively b. For cargo condition from 79 % to 56 %/ 60 % in good/bad weather respectively 2. The goodness of the fit for no-cargo conditions is 63 % while this is 32 % for cargo conditions. This difference results from overhanging and high deck cargoes. 3. Wind resistance is the dominant resistance component after calm water resistance in all sailing conditions. In cargo condition during bad weather this contribution gets up to 32 % of the total <b>resistance</b> comparing <b>to</b> 9 % for wave resistance. 4. Following from the previous statement, the most important calculation parameters including highest uncertainty are the true wind angle, the wind load coefficient and true wind speed. Recommendations 1. In case of a long voyage with a large deck-cargo, BigLift should consider to perform a more extensive research on the wind resistance. 2.

The aim of this work is to revise this complex scenario. Starting from proliferating cancer cells located in well-oxygenated regions, they may express the so-called “Warburg effect ” or aerobic glycolysis, meaning that although a plenty of oxygen is available, cancer cells choose glycolysis, the sole pathway that allows a biomass formation and DNA duplication, needed for cell division. Although oxygen does not represent the primary font of energy, diffusion rate reduces oxygen tension and the emerging hypoxia promotes “anaerobic glycolysis ” through the hypoxia inducible factor- 1 α-dependent up-regulation. The acquired hypoxic phenotype is endowed with high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> cell death and high migration capacities, although these cells are less proliferating. Cells using aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis survive only in case they extrude acidic metabolites acidifying the extracellular space.
