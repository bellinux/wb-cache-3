50|$|The park {{is divided}} into the {{following}} areas: the restricted use zone (with pristine forests and native communities, access is granted to reasearchers only); the reserved zone (for recreation and research); the <b>recuperation</b> <b>zone</b> (for the recovery of disturbed areas) and the cultural zone (for human settlement).|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{following}} {{the construction of}} three regional training facilities under Project l, the second project submitted by the All Nepal Football Association consisted of a national technical centre offering accommodation for players and ofﬁcials, a gymnasium, a <b>recuperation</b> <b>zone,</b> meeting rooms and classrooms, a medical centre, a kitchen and dining rooms, and a training pitch. Situated in the west of Kathmandu (Lalitpur), the complex was planned to be primarily made available to football novices and emerging young talent. The association intended to hold regular, long-term training programmes there.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} zones have {{guidelines}} as to status {{and type of}} ecosystem {{and what kinds of}} activities may take place within that zone. Intangible and Primitive zones have little to no human interaction, although some allowances are made for scientific research and education purposes. Extensive zones act as separation between other zones and infrastructure such as major road ways. Intensive and Special Use zones have experienced the heaviest recreation traffic and supporting infrastructure. These can include service and recreation facilities, as well as administration buildings. <b>Recuperation</b> <b>zone</b> is an interim designation, assigned to areas that have experienced a major disturbance and {{are in the process of}} recovering vegetation.|$|E
50|$|The park is in {{the north}} east of the Federal {{district}} in the northeastern region of Brazil. Its boundaries have been fixed and also fenced. The park is divided into Intangible, Primitive, Extensive, Intensive, Special and <b>Recuperation</b> <b>zones</b> from the development perspective.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{results of}} long-term stack testing {{completed in the}} new high-temperature steam electrolysis multi-kW test facility recently developed at INL. The report includes detailed descriptions of the piping layout, steam generation and delivery system, test fixture, heat <b>recuperation</b> system, hot <b>zone,</b> instrumentation, and operating conditions. This facility has provided a demonstration of high-temperature steam electrolysis operation at the 4 kW scale with advanced cell and stack technology. This successful large-scale demonstration of high-temperature steam electrolysis will help to advance the technology toward near-term commercialization...|$|R
40|$|A 15 kW high {{temperature}} electrolysis test facility {{has been developed}} at the Idaho National Laboratory under the United States Department of Energy Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative. This facility is intended to study the technology readiness of using {{high temperature}} solid oxide cells for large scale nuclear powered hydrogen production. It is designed to address larger-scale issues such as thermal management (feed-stock heating, high temperature gas handling, heat <b>recuperation),</b> multiple-stack hot <b>zone</b> design, multiple-stack electrical configurations, etc. Heat recuperation and hydrogen recycle are incorporated into the design. The facility was operated for 1080 hours and successfully demonstrated the largest scale high temperature solid-oxide-based production of hydrogen to date...|$|R
5000|$|Lucas di Grassi, Audi Sport ABT: [...] "The Beijing {{track is}} an amazing facility. For the drivers, {{it will be a}} {{tremendous}} challenge to learn the limits of this track quickly, as well as to understand the best overtaking opportunities. The most obvious places are likely to be Turns 1, 2, 6, 19 and 20. The circuit will also require lots of traction and braking stability, while the energy <b>recuperation</b> at braking <b>zones</b> will help to stabilise the car. Also, it will be our first ever race, so all the drivers will be raring to go! The pit lane is also unique and requires some special practice to get right, also because drivers have to switch cars in their pit box." ...|$|R
40|$|Positron {{lifetime}} spectroscopy and Vickers microhardness {{measurements were}} used for studying the decomposition sequence of Al-Zn-Mg systems. Various microstructural changes (formation, dissolution and <b>recuperation</b> of GPII <b>zones,</b> formation of η′-particles) were induced by using isochronal annealing and multiple-step ageing thermal treatments. The experimental results give the following information: (a) changing the quenching temperature used for the initial homogenization treatment over the interval from - 15 to + 55 °C has no apparent effect on the subsequent behaviour of the alloy; (b) the hardening effect of natural ageing is positively correlated with the density of small and uniformly distributed GPII zones existing in the alloy {{at the end of}} the treatment; (c) the interruption in the reversion stage of artificial ageing at 150 °C is followed, at room temperature and at 70 °C, by a recovery that takes place with the same characteristic time constant tC as governs GPII formation after the homogenization treatment; (d) the dependence of tC on the temperature agrees with activation energies for the migration of the solute that depend on the concentrations of Mg and of the quaternary additions (Cu, Mn) ...|$|R
