5000|$|<b>Rimfire</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{are limited}} to low {{pressures}} because they require a thin case so that the firing pin can crush the rim and ignite the primer. <b>Rimfire</b> <b>cartridges</b> of [...]44 caliber (actually [...]45 caliber) up to [...]56 caliber were once common when black powder {{was used as a}} propellant. However, modern <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridges</b> use smokeless powder which generates much higher pressures and tend to be of [...]22 caliber (5.5 mm) or smaller. The low pressures necessitated by the rimfire design mean that rimfire firearms can be very light and inexpensive, which has helped lead to the continuing popularity of these small-caliber cartridges.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Rimfire</b> <b>cartridges</b> (e.g. 22 Long Rifle) are not {{generally}} hand-loaded in modern times, {{although there are}} some shooters that unload commercial <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and use the primed case to make their own loads, or to generate special <b>rimfire</b> wildcat <b>cartridges.</b> These cartridges are highly labor-intensive to produce. [...] Historically, liquid priming material was available for reloading rimfire ammunition, but the extreme explosive hazard of bulk primer compound and complexity of the process (including [...] "ironing out" [...] the firing pin strike) caused the practice to decline.|$|R

50|$|Centerfire {{cartridges}} {{are more}} reliable {{for military purposes}} because the thicker metal cartridge cases can withstand rougher handling without damage, and safer to handle because explosive priming compound in a protruding rim {{is more likely to}} be triggered by impact if a <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge</b> is dropped or pinched. The stronger base of a centerfire cartridge is able to withstand higher pressures which in turn give a bullet greater velocity and energy. While centerfire cartridge cases require a complex and expensive manufacturing process, explosive handling is simplified by avoiding the spinning process required to uniformly distribute priming explosive into the rim because of uncertainty about which angular segment of a <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge</b> rim will be struck by the firing pin. Larger caliber rimfire cartridges require greater volumes of priming explosive than centerfire cartridges, and the required volume may cause an undesirably high pressure during ignition. Reducing the amount of priming explosive would reduce the reliability of <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge</b> ignition, and increase the probability of misfire or dud cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{many of the}} rifles {{that are}} {{chambered}} for the [...]22 WMR have tubular magazines, the bullet noses generally are flat or at least blunt to allow smooth feeding and reduce damage to the bullet. Although a pointed bullet in a <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge</b> will not contact the primer of the round {{in front of it}} (which is a hazard with centerfire cartridges in a tubular magazine), the manufacturer's stamp {{is in the middle of}} the base of a <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and this may interfere with pointed metal bullets in a tube. However, Remington, CCI, and Hornady now produce bullet designs with 30 or [...] polymer plastic ballistic tips that reduce the hazards of pointed ammunition in tubular magazines.|$|E

50|$|Some {{types of}} rimmed <b>cartridges,</b> such as <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridges,</b> {{also use the}} rim to contain the priming {{compound}} used to ignite the cartridge instead of a centrally-mounted primer such as used in centerfire cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The early 21st {{century has}} seen a revival in {{interest}} in <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridges,</b> with two new rimfires introduced, both in [...]17 caliber (4.5 mm) and the re-introduction of the 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]41 <b>Rimfire</b> <b>Cartridge</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the National Arms Company in 1863 and was {{also known as the}} [...]41 Short and the [...]41-100.

5000|$|Supplemental {{chambers}} in [...]22 caliber, {{and potentially}} [...]17 caliber as well, pose a special problem {{not shared by}} larger calibers. Rimfire cartridges, with their low cost, noise, and recoil, are ideal {{for use in a}} supplemental chamber, {{except for the fact that}} the firearm in question is almost certainly a centerfire design. This means that supplemental chambers that use a <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge</b> must also provide a special offset firing pin. This is a metal insert that fits behind the <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and has an appropriate projection to act as a firing pin. When this insert is hit by the firearm's firing pin, it is pushed forwards, which causes it to crush the rim of the <b>rimfire</b> <b>cartridge,</b> igniting it. Use of the centerfire to rimfire conversion requires a longer case, and so is not suitable for short cartridges such as [...]22 Hornet. A notable exception to this is the Thompson Center Arms Contender, which has both centerfire and rimfire firing pins which can be selected with the turn of a switch, and does not require a centerfire to rimfire converter. The Hammond Game Getter works around this problem in its sleeves for [...]22 rimfire by creating an eccentric chamber that places the rim of the [...]22 cartridge in the center of the original chamber, thus allowing the firing pin to strike it directly.|$|E
