The widespread use of artificial insemination makes it even more important to determine the hereditary {{influence of}} the sire on <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milking.</b> Since <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> seems to be a rather constant characteristic of the individual cow, if it can be shown to be an inherited characteristic, it would be an easy task to add <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> to the other criteria used in selection of dairy animals. The time required to produce five pounds of milk at the maximum rate of flow was determined for 99 cows in the Experiment Station herds at Lincoln, Scottsbluff, and North Platte.

40|$|The timing <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> {{production}} in Antarctic fur seals was studied at Bird Island, South Georgia. Like all lactating otariid seals (Pinnipedia: Otariidae), Antarctic fur seal females alternate between short nursing periods ashore and regular foraging trips to sea. Females {{do not necessarily}} return to the colony with full mammae, which indicates that mammary volume capacity is unlikely to limit foraging trip duration. Upon arrival at the colony, milk fat (r 2 = 0. 33, P < 0. 04) and protein (r 2 = 0. 60, P < 0. 002) content were positively correlated to the time spent at sea. A similar trend was observed in the milk produced on land. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> energy production was much lower at sea (5. 02 ± 0. 05 MJ day- 1) than on land (23. 66 ± 4. 4 MJ- 1 day- 1). The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> energy production during the foraging trip was negatively correlated to the time spent at sea (r 2 = 0. 29, P < 0. 05), whereas the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> energy production on land was positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 61, P < 0. 001) to {{the duration of the}} preceding foraging trip. The total amount <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> energy delivered to the pup during each twoday nursing period was positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 60, P < 0. 002) to the duration of the previous foraging trip. The overall <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> energy delivery, however, was independent of foraging trip duration. This accords with previous observations that the growth <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> Antarctic fur seal pups are unaffected by maternal foraging trip duration patterns. ...|$|R

40|$|Data were {{collected}} from the Iowa State University Research Farm at Ankeny, Iowa. The objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the correlated responses in milk flow, udder and teat measurements to selecting sires for high and average milk production, (2) to find estimates of heritability and repeatability of these measurements, (3) to examine their relationship with udder health and milk production, and (4) to investigate the relationship of teat-end classification with udder health, lactation milk yield, and milk flow.

40|$|Milk {{production}} is largely {{dependent on the}} shape of the lactation curve. Relevant elements of the lactation pattern are the peak yield, which represents the maximum milk yield during the lactation, and the lactation persistency, which expresses the ability of animals to maintain a reasonably constant milk yield after the lactation peak. Thus, persistent animals are those that show flatter lactation curves. Several measurements of persistency have been proposed (Broster and Broster, 1984; Gengler, 1996) : the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> yield per week or per month; combinations of parameters of mathematical functions used to model the lactation curve; the variation of test day yields throughout the whole lactation or part of it; the proportion <b>of</b> total <b>milk</b> yield achieved in a certain period (e. g. second half of lactation). However, none of the above mentioned measurements seems to be able to become the reference method (Grossman et al., 1999). For example, the definition of persistency as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> yield per unit of time can be misleading if the absolute level of {{production is}} not considered. Usually curves with high peak yield show low persistency because the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> yield declines faster in animals that have a fast milk yield increase after calving. Thus in this review, we will consider persistency in a broad sense, and we will analyze the nutritional and nonnutritional factors that affect and limit milk production in mid-late lactation in sheep...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{continuous}} debate regarding the best bottle nipple {{to be used}} to enhance the bottle-feeding performance of a preterm infant. Aim: To verify that feeding performance can be improved by using the bottle nipple with the physical characteristics that enhance infants 2 ̆ 7 sucking skills. METHODS: Ten 2 ̆ 2 healthy 2 ̆ 2 VLBW infants (941 +/- 273 g) were recruited. Feeding performance was monitored at two time periods, when taking 1 - 2 and 6 - 8 oral feedings/d. At each time and within 24 h, performance was monitored using three different bottle nipples offered in a randomized order. <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> transfer (ml/min) was the primary outcome measure. The sucking skills monitored comprised stage of sucking, suction amplitude, and duration of the generated negative intraoral suction pressure. RESULTS: At both times, infants demonstrated a similar <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> transfer among all three nipples. However, the stage of sucking, suction amplitude, and duration of the generated suction were significantly different between nipples at 1 - 2, but not 6 - 8 oral feedings/d. CONCLUSION: We did not identify a particular bottle nipple that enhanced bottle feeding in healthy VLBW infants. Based on the notion that afferent sensory feedback may allow infants to adapt to changing conditions, we speculate that infants can modify their sucking skills in order to maintain a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> transfer that is appropriate with the level of suck-swallow-breathe coordination achieved at a particular time. Therefore, it is proposed that caretakers should be more concerned over monitoring the coordination of suck-swallow-breathe than over the selection of bottle nipples...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. The effect <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> {{interval}} on secretion <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> {{and milk}} constituents was studied in four milking camels during late lactation. An interval of 4 h produced the highest milk secretion rate compared with 8, 12 and 16 h intervals, and rates tended to decline with increasing <b>milking</b> intervals. Secretion <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> organic (lactose, SNF, fat and protein) and inorganic milk constituents (sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium) generally followed similar patterns of decreasing secretion with increasing <b>milking</b> intervals. Many <b>of</b> the values for different intervals were significantly different. Previous studies with cows {{have suggested that}} the secretion <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and some milk constituents are adversely affected by prolonged <b>milking</b> intervals <b>of</b> > 12 h, perhaps as a result of increased intramammary pressure (Schmidt, 1960; Tucker et al. 1961). On the other hand, increases in <b>milk</b> secretion <b>of</b> up to 40 % as a result <b>of</b> thrice daily <b>milking</b> in cows were reported more than 30 years ago (Elliott, 1959). More recently, less dramatic effects <b>of</b> shortening the <b>milking</b> intervals have been reported in both cows (Pearson et al. 1979; Rao & Ludri, 1984; Amos et al. 1985; Van der lest & Hillerton, 1989; Hillerton et al. 1990; Alshaikh, 1991) and goats (Linzell & Peaker, 1971; Henderson et al. 1983, 1985; Knight et al. 1990; Alshaikh, 1991). Camel milk is {{an important component of the}} human diet in many countries and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) possesses practical and unique attributes for high milk production (Knoess, 1980; Yagil & Etzion, 1980). Under intensive management, these animals can produce relatively large amounts <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> with average yields of 10 - 15 kg/ d (Rao et al. 1970; Knoess, 1980). With good feeding their milk production can even exceed 2000 I per lactation (Knoess, 1980; Yagil, 1982). In most camel breeding countries, the length of the lactation period is reported to be in the range 9 - 18 months, with considerably higher yields during the second than the first lactation (Yagil, 1982). In Saudi Arabia, the camel population is ~ 400000 (Ministry of Agriculture and Water, 1990), and they are regarded as an important source <b>of</b> meat and <b>milk.</b> Several modern farms have recently been established for commercial milk production. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> interval on secretory <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and its organic and inorganic components in milking camels...|$|R

We compared maternal energy expenditures and pup growth and energy deposition over the course of lactation between primiparous and fully-grown, multiparous grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) females to test whether reproductive experience has a significant influence on lactation performance. Although there was no difference between primiparous females in milk composition and, thus, milk energy content at either early or peak lactation primiparous females had a significantly lower daily milk energy output than multiparous females indicating a reduced physiological capacity for milk secretion. Primiparous females appeared to effectively compensate for lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> production through an increased nursing effort and, thus, achieved the same relative <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> energy transfer to pups as multiparous females.

40|$|Mini-cheese rounds were {{manufactured}} {{from four}} types <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> differing in milk coagulation properties (MCP) {{to investigate the}} effect of variation in MCP on unadjusted cheese yield (UCY), cheese yield adjusted for milk fat and protein content (ACY), recovery <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> constituents in cheese and cheese composition. A {{randomised complete block design}} with four treatment groups was replicated five times in each of two trials. In Trial 1, optimal curd cutting time was determined on the basis of vat curd firmness, whereas in Trial 2 curd cutting occurred at a fixed time, irrespective of vat curd firmness. In Trial 1, no significant across-groups difference was detected in UCY and ACY from 7 to 90 d and from 20 min to 90 d of ripening, respectively. In Trial 2 we observed relevant differences in UCY across groups, but such differences were not linearly associated with MCP...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} performance and relationships between several management factors and {{financial performance}} are examined in {{a panel of}} 107 New York dairy farms. A panel regression model with fixed effects is estimated {{in an effort to}} identify management factors that influence profitability. The model is estimated with two-stage least squares to account for endogenous farm size and debt use variables. Production management factors such as farm size, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> production, and milking system had a positive impact on farm profitability. Financial management variables for the type of accounting system used and the debt use were also significantly related to profitability. Unlike the findings of many other studies, measures of human capital did not have a statistically significant impact on profitability. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|Measurement <b>of</b> gastric {{emptying}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solids {{in children}} {{is difficult because}} the available methods are either invasive or induce a substantial radiation burden. In this study the newly developed 13 C octanoic acid breath {{test was used to}} examine the gastric emptying <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solids and <b>milk</b> in healthy children and to compare gastric emptying in children and adults. Fifteen healthy children and three groups of nine healthy adults were studied, using three different test meals labelled with 50 mg of 13 C octanoic acid: a low caloric pancake (150 kcal), a high caloric pancake (250 kcal), and 210 ml <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> (134 kcal). Breath samples were taken before and at regular intervals after ingestion of the test meal, and analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The gastric emptying parameters were derived from the 13 CO 2 excretion curves by non-linear regression analysis. No significant difference was found between children and adults in the emptying <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the low caloric solid test meal. In children as well as in adults, increasing the energy content of the solid meal resulted in a significantly slower emptying rate. The milk test meal, however, was emptied at a faster rate in adults and at slower rate in children compared with the low caloric solid test meal. Moreover, the emptying <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> in children was significantly slower than in adults. In conclusion, a similar gastric emptying <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solids but a slower emptying <b>of</b> full cream <b>milk</b> was shown in children of school age compared with adults, using the non-radioactive 13 C octanoic acid breath test...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{production}} is largely {{related to the}} shape of the lactation curve. Key elements of the lactation pattern are peak yield, which is the maximum daily yield reached during lactation, and lactation persistency, which is the medium <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> yield decrease after the lactation peak. The ideal lactation curve should have a reasonably high peak and a flat trend afterwards. A more persistent lactation is desirable because it is related to better animal health and reduction of feeding costs. Effective strategies to improve lactation persistency require a deep understanding of the main factors that affect this trait, including genetics, hormonal status and administration, udder morphology, seasonal changes, management, animal health (e. g. mastitis), stress and nutrition. This review covers the effects of non-nutritional factors on lactation persistency in dairy sheep...|$|R
40|$|In {{operating}} conditions there was evaluated the animal production (dairycow breeding) {{by means of}} selected economic indicators. In Agrodružstvo Načeradec there were monitored {{the basic principles of}} dairycows nutrition and feeding and their milk production as well. The attention was paid to expense items and their modifications with respect to the production. I aimed at monitoring costs (feeding cost, labour cost, services cost etc.), yields, profit or loss in 2005 { [...] } 2006. During the monitoring period there was found that dairycows are profitable. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> production profitability was 12 % in 2005 (the ČR average is 3, 8 %). In 2006 the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> profitability dropped to 3, 02 %. This drop was caused by the price policy of dairy industry by milk purchase. Simply we can say that milk production in Načeradec is profitable thanks to high efficiency of dairycows...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{described the}} variability among cows {{with the aim}} of studying the ability of dairy cows to tolerate once-daily milking (ODM) in terms <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> losses and milk recoveries observed when cows are switched from twice- to once-daily milking and then back to twice-daily milking (TDM). It also aimed to investigate whether or not lactose in blood plasma, which indicates the mammary epithelium permeability, is correlated with milk losses and recoveries and, consequently, a potential candidate assessor of dairy cow tolerance to ODM. The study used 86 crossbred dairy cows (Holstein × Normande) split into 5 groups over 2 yr. The trial consisted of 3 successive periods: a 1 -wk control period of TDM, then 3 wk of ODM, followed by 2 wk of TDM. Blood samples were collected 1 to 1. 5 h before the morning milking and 5 to 6 h after milking on d − 3, 0, 1, 3, 7, 21, 23, and 28, where d 0 is the last d of the control period. Milk losses measured as kilograms per day were higher in cows with highest control-period milk yields (r = − 0. 66). When expressed in relative terms (%), milk losses were weakly correlated with the control-period milk yield (r = − 0. 22). When switched back to TDM, cows recovered only 47 % <b>of</b> the <b>milk</b> lost. Milk recovery (kg/d) was weakly correlated with control milk yield (r = 0. 34) and not correlated with ODM milk yield. Milk recovery was correlated with milk yield losses: the higher the milk yield losses (kg/d or %), the higher the milk recovery (kg/d; r = − 0. 59 and − 0. 52, respectively). <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recovery expressed as the quantity <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recovered per kilogram <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> lost, was not correlated with milk loss expressed as a percentage. This means that to be considered well-adapted to ODM scheduling, a cow must be well adapted to milk loss, and be well adapted to milk recovery. Blood plasma lactose concentration (log 10 -transformed data) was not correlated with milk production levels in either control, ODM, or back-to-TDM periods. It was poorly correlated with milk loss but was positively correlated with milk recovery (kg/d) and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recovery. We conclude that blood plasma lactose needs to be coupled with other indicators for evaluating dairy cow tolerance to ODM...|$|R

The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> removal differed be-tween patterns at both the beginning (1 minute) and end (1. 5 minutes) of the expression period (P <. 05).
