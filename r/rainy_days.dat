5|$|Rwanda has a {{temperate}} tropical highland climate, {{with lower}} temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries {{because of its}} high elevation. Kigali, in {{the centre of the}} country, has a typical daily temperature range between , with little variation through the year. There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east. There are two rainy seasons in the year; the first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February. Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast. Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of <b>rainy</b> <b>days</b> experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains. Both changes have caused difficulty for farmers, decreasing their productivity. Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a fast warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7°C to 0.9°C over fifty years.|$|E

Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the <b>rainy</b> <b>days</b> they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims.

5|$|On November 19, 2008, {{the police}} {{investigation}} was completed using 13,600 pages, which took 16 months {{of research to}} be produced, during which 336 people were heard. For federal prosecutors, {{the former director of}} ANAC Denise Abreu and then flight safety officer of the company, Marco Aurelio dos Santos de Miranda, should be convicted of attempt on air transport security in willful mode. In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the accident with the Airbus TAM, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on <b>rainy</b> <b>days,</b> received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, security in landing operations at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that takeoffs and landings were forbidden in Congonhas case the track was with a water depth greater than 3mm. After the accident with the plane of TAM in July 2007 it revealed that the study was not a standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for takeoffs and landings of all equipment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds on state savings behavior. We find that states with <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds have higher total balances than states without such funds and also have higher balances after adoption than before adoption. Furthermore, <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> fund deposits increase total balances dollar-for-dollar. While we cannot rule out that states planning future savings may adopt <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds, our findings are robust to the inclusion of measures of savings preferences. In sum, these funds appear {{to belong to the}} growing set of fiscal institutions with real fiscal and economic consequences. 1 Introduction During the last two decades, virtually all of the U. S. states have adopted budget stabilization funds, often called "rainy day funds, " that allow them to save for unexpected revenue shortfalls. Prior to 1981, few states had such funds (Gold, 1981). By 1984, 18 states had enacted <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds, and by 1994, 45 states had them (ACIR, 1995). These accounts are designed to help state governments stabilize public spending over time by saving during booms and using the balances to cover revenue shortfalls during recessions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides {{three distinct}} perspectives on state <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds. The first empirical chapter explores {{the factors that}} influence a state to access their <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> fund, and a variety of economic, institutional, and political factors to be important. The influence and effects of these factors, however, are contextual, and vary depending on the economic environment and political control. The most important influences on accessing the <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> fund, however, are economic indicators that are in line with the purpose of state <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds. The second empirical chapter investigates the influence of state <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> fund deposit and withdrawal rules on where lawmakers place savings. The findings reveal that when states have strict rule configurations that limit legislative discretion, lawmakers avoid placing savings in the formal <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> funds and opt for informal savings that allow for easier access. The final empirical chapter examines if states save enough to handle their unique economic environments. This chapter replicates Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) study with longitudinal data {{to gain a better understanding}} of state savings behavior and economic environments. Additionally, this chapter posits that informal and formal <b>rainy</b> <b>day</b> fund savings are closely linked, and, therefore, scholars need to consider both accounts when determining if states save enough their unique economic environment. Results indicate that under a broader view of state savings behavior and volatility, states are in a much better position than Joyce originally reported. What is more, when we consider both formal and informal savings, states are in a very good position to handle average volatility...|$|R

It roughly goes along the coastal plain from La Vila Joiosa through the southernmost border (cities included here are, amongst others, Alicante, Elche, Orihuela and Torrevieja). Summers are very long, hot to very hot and very dry, winters are cool to mild and its most prominent feature is very scarce precipitation, typically below 300mm. per year and most likely to happen during spring and autumn. The reasons for this lack of precipitation is mostly the marked rain shadow effect caused by hills {{to the west of}} the Alicante province (and, to a lesser degree, those in the northern part of {{the province}} which, in turn, enhance the inverse Orographic lift effect around Cap de la Nau). Most of its few <b>rainy</b> <b>days</b> happen during Autumn and Spring.|$|E
