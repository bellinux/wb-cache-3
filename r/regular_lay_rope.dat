40|$|The {{behaviour}} of wire ropes used in mine hoisting is {{not well}} understood. In an effort to improve this understanding, the structure of round-strand wire ropes was analysed. This report provides a generalised mathematical model that completely describes the geometry of the wires. It consists of two sets of vector equations and is valid for any round-strand wire rope. One set of equations is used to trace the paths of wires that have {{the form of a}} single helix. The other is used for the paths of double helical wires. The specific model for a 33 -mm 6 x 1 9 Seale, IWRC, right <b>regular</b> <b>lay</b> wire <b>rope</b> was presented as an example. The paths and the geometric properties of the wires which include the path length per lay of strand, the curvature, and the torsion were determined from this model. In future work, the model could be used to conduct stress analysis for the wires in the deformed rope at a given rope strain and also to study the effect of wear and breaking of wires on strength loss for the various round-strand wire ropes used in mine hoisting...|$|R

50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called ordinary <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> if the <b>lay</b> direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same <b>lay</b> direction, the <b>rope</b> is called a lang <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> (formerly Albert’s <b>lay</b> or Lang’s <b>lay).</b> <b>Regular</b> <b>lay</b> means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|R

5000|$|The Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{designed}} by Hungarian engineer Samuel Diescher, who had also designed the Duquesne, Castle Shannon and Fort Pitt Inclines in Pittsburgh. The funicular consists of a parallel set of [...] broad gauge railroad tracks with a 70.9 percent grade or an angle of 35 degrees and 28 minutes from the horizontal. The incline is 896.5 ft long and ascends 502.2 ft vertically {{to the top of}} Yoder Hill and the borough of Westmont, the station of which is at an elevation of 1693.5 ft above sea level. The rails are supported by 720 14 ft railroad ties made from Southern Yellow Pine. The incline is lit at night by 114 high-pressure sodium-vapor lamps mounted along the sides of tracks. There used to be a stairway between the two tracks with 966 steps, but these were removed circa 1963.Two cars traverse the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and acts as a counterweight. The cars are 15 ft wide, 15 ft tall, and 34 ft long, and are large enough to carry either 65 people, 6 motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars are open to the elements, an enclosed seating area containing a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline. The cables connecting the cars are 2 in, 6&times;36 right <b>regular</b> <b>lay,</b> steel wire <b>rope.</b> They are wound around a 3 ST, 16 ft drum that connects the cars together. The cable on the north track is 1075 ft long, while the south cable is 7 ft shorter. Each car weighs 22 ST, but they, and consequently the cables, can carry an additional load of 15 ST. A [...] electric motor turns the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to power the incline.

Vern Tejas set the new record for the same, in 134 days. Tejas began with summiting Vinson on 18 January 2010 and ended with summiting Denali on May 31.

5000|$|One origin story {{holds that}} when the Chinese {{emperors}} forbid the wearing of robes, defrocked all the Buddhist monks, and bestowed imperial favor on the Confucian and Taoist priests, then Buddhist monks created a miniature version of their robe to be worn secretly around the neck underneath their <b>regular</b> <b>lay</b> clothing. Another suggests that the rakusu developed as Zen monks became involved in manual labor because a full robe {{would have been too}} unwieldy. Additionally, some Japanese scholars believe it was developed in Japan during the Edo or Tokugawa Era, as the result of regulations specifying the size and fabric type of monks clothing.|$|R

50|$|Twisted ropes {{are built}} up in three steps. First, fibres are {{gathered}} and spun into yarns. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to <b>lay</b> the <b>rope.</b> The twist of the yarn is opposite {{to that of the}} strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope. It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} plan {{had been for}} one team to <b>lay</b> fixed <b>rope</b> above Camp 6 {{at the top of}} the Rock Band and for a second team to go for the summit. Bonington now decided it would be unreasonable to expect the first team to turn back so near the summit and so one team would do all the work even though this meant a very long summit climb after a heavy day <b>laying</b> <b>ropes</b> and a second night at Camp 6. However, progress had been so good that two further summit teams might be possible and, with careful planning, these might comprise four climbers each rather than two. Bonington had promised a place for a Sherpa in any subsequent attempt. He selected (1) Haston and Scott, (2) Boardman, Boysen, Burke and Pertemba (who, to Bonington's satisfaction, nominated himself) and (3) Ang Phurba, Bonington, Braithwaite and Estcourt. Estcourt and Braithwaite were to return temporarily to ABC, losing their second place in the [...] "queue" [...] for the summit, and contrary to what they had been promised earlier. Burke had been climbing slowly but Bonington considered that this could have been due to the weight of camera equipment and he realised the value of having filming high up on the mountain. Regarding his own place, Bonington himself had been at 25500 ft and above for nearly a fortnight so as team doctor Clarke privately advised him not to continue higher. Bonington accepted this opinion and gave his place to Richards though he still cherished the hope he himself might be in a fourth summit bid. MacInnes had moved to Camp 1 because of reports that the platform of ice it was on was starting to slip down the Icefall. When he heard he was to be left out of the summit parties he left the expedition because there was nothing further for him to do but he assured Bonington he would tell the press he was leaving because of his injured lungs.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A low-sodium diet (. 08 % Na) {{was used}} to force molt 409 hens. Another 421 hens were force molted by {{conventional}} water and feed restrictions.

The low-sodium diet and water were provided ad libitum to the first group for the entire period of molt (42 days). The second group received no water for 3 days, and no feed for 4 days, after which incremental amounts of whole oats were provided as the only feed until Day 18.
