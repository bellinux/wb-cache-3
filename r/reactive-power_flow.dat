40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} ride-through capability {{of a large}} induction-generator based wind park with different reactive power support solutions. Three different solutions have been compared {{and it has been}} shown that conventional switching of capacitors is able to help the wind park meet the Nordel gird code requirements on low voltage ride-through. The requirements on rating are shown to be the same for an SVC and for a Statcom. Two aggregation methods for large wind parks have been studied and an error estimation has been made. It is shown that a two-machine model is the smallest one that gives an acceptable error in <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flow.</b> A single-machine model is not appropriate to assess fault-ride-through...|$|E

The dynamic model of the UPFC has been developed using the space-vector representation of the instantaneous three-phase variables. The Park´s transformation and the reference frame selected reduce {{the control of the}} real and reactive-power flows to the control of the d- and q-axis currents, respectively. The proposed control scheme produces fast and decoupled response of the real and the <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flow</b> through a transmission line. It also achieves tight control of the d. c. -link capacitor voltage, thanks to the careful coordination between the control of the series and shunt compensators of the UPFX. A 15 kVA prototype with 750 Hz switching frequency has been built to illustrate the main contributions. Experiemental results agree closely with the theoretical analysis. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

A 15 kVA prototype with 750 Hz switching frequency has been built to illustrate the main contributions. Experimental results agree with the theoretical analysis and the simulation results. Finally, the bandwidth of the UPFC has been characterized. The theoretical closed-loop transfer function agrees with the experimental one. It is shown that the bandwidth of the UPFC is high enough to damp the main perturbations of a power system. Under fault conditions in a typical scenario, power system oscillations can be damped quickly with the UPFC. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives {{analytical}} closed-form expressions that {{uncover the}} contributions of nodal active- and reactive-power injections to the active- and <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flows</b> on transmission lines in an AC electrical network. Paying due homage to current- and voltage-divider laws that are similar in spirit, we baptize these as the power divider laws. Derived from a circuit-theoretic examination of AC power-flow expressions, {{the constitution of the}} power divider laws reflects the topology and voltage profile of the network. We demonstrate the utility of the power divider laws to the analysis of power networks by highlighting applications to transmission-network allocation, transmission-loss allocation, and identifying feasible injections while respecting line active-power flow set points...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{observability}} analysis and measurement placement in generalized state estimation, where substations are modeled at the physical-level (bus-section/switching-device model) by explicit representation of circuit breakers. The conventional state estimator is extended by incorporating the active- and <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flows</b> through circuit breakers as state variables. The generalized measurement model is transformed to a conventional node frame of reference formulation. Any circuit breaker (flow measured or not) is substituted by two fictitious nodes and branches, the two pairs of the corresponding voltage angles and magnitudes, and additional pseudo measurements. A very efficient numerical method is proposed for observability testing and identification of observable islands. When the network is unobservable multiple measurement placement is accomplished in a noniterative manner. Results from a test system are presented...|$|R
40|$|An AC-linked {{large scale}} wind/photovoltaic (PV) /energy storage (ES) hybrid energy {{conversion}} system for grid-connected application was proposed in this paper. Wind {{energy conversion system}} (WECS) and PV generation system are the primary power sources of the hybrid system. The ES system, including battery and fuel cell (FC), is used as a backup and a power regulation unit to ensure continuous power supply and {{to take care of the}} intermittent nature of wind and photovoltaic resources. Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is employed to support the AC-linked bus voltage and improve low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of the proposed system. An overall power coordinated control strategy is designed to manage real-power and <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flows</b> among the different energy sources, the storage unit, and the STATCOM system in the hybrid system. A simulation case study carried out on Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 3 -machine 9 -bus test system for the large scale {{hybrid energy conversion system}} has been developed using the DIgSILENT/Power Factory software platform. The hybrid system performance under different scenarios has been verified by simulation studies using practical load demand profiles and real weather data...|$|R
40|$|This project {{deals with}} {{the design of the}} {{collector}} system for large wind parks and the study of reactive power compensation techniques to help the wind park meet grid code requirements, especially concerning fault ride-through. In this study, the wind turbine generators are selected to be fixed-speed induction generators without reactive power controllability. The studied wind park is made of one hundred and thirty 3 MW wind turbine generators connected to a 20 kV collector system. This collector system is then connected to a 400 kV on-shore transmission grid through two 130 kV cables and transformers. In {{the first part of the}} project, the main design of the collector system was performed by first studying the system load flows using PowerWorld Simulator. From the results of load flows study, ratings and dimensionings of system components are then selected. Reactive power production and consumption of components are calculated and reactive power compensation has been applied in such a way that in steady-state, the reactive power exchange between the wind park and the transmission grid is kept as close to zero as possible. The second part of the project focuses on simulations of the wind park in PSCAD/EMTDC to study dynamic behavior of the wind park during disturbances (i. e., severe faults) in the connected grid. A study of the fault ride-through capability (FRT) of an induction generator has been conducted using the torque-speed curve approach. The influences of different parameters such as rotor inertia constant, short circuit ratio, and pre-fault operating point on the FRT have been investigated. Two aggregation methods for large wind farms have been studied and an error estimation has been made. It is shown that a two-machine model is the smallest one that gives an acceptable error in <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flow.</b> A single-machine model is not appropriate to assess fault-ride-through. FTR and grid code compliance of the wind park with and without additional reactive power support have been compared. The reactive power sources considered are: normal switched shunt capacitors (CAP), static var compensator (SVC), and static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). The simulation results have shown that either CAP, or SVC, or STATCOM would be a possible solution for the wind park meeting the Nordel grid code requirements on FTR. The needed reactive power support for the wind part is calculated to be 1. 6 pu (on a 455 MVA base) for all supporting devices if they are installed at the 130 kV bus closest to the grid. If installed at the main 20 kV bus, the needed sizes could be reduced by 21 % and by 38 % for CAP/SVC and STATCOM, respectively. If the zero-voltage fault ride-through is not required, the needed size could be reduced significantly. In this case, the required reactive power support from CAP/SVC and STATCOM are found to be 1. 00 pu and 0. 56 pu, respectively to ride through 0. 25 pu voltage dip for 250 ms...|$|E
40|$|A {{low-cost}} power router (PR), {{capable of}} dynamic, independent control of active- and <b>reactive-power</b> <b>flows</b> on meshed grids is presented. The operating principle, detailed schematics, and various possible implementations {{of the proposed}} power router are discussed. Various operating modes are identified and a control algorithm has been proposed and verified through simulations. Small-signal and frequency-domain models of the power router from basic time-domain equations are developed. A three-tier protection system based on the fail-normal switch to avoid single point-of-failure is presented. The operation of proposed protection system in isolating the converter and the grid {{in the event of}} faults is verified through simulation. An analytical method to evaluate the stability of a system with multiple power routers is proposed. Necessary conditions for the PR-controller design to ensure stable operation of a system with multiple power routers is proposed. These necessary conditions are verified through simulation studies. Potential applications of proposed power router in distribution system and the associated challenges in implementation are presented. The functionality and advantages of the proposed power router are experimentally demonstrated at 13 kV, 1 MVA. The proposed power router can result in a low cost power routing solution that can reduce electric grid congestion and efficient implementation of RPS mandates. Ph. D...|$|R
