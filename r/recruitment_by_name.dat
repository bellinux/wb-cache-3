40|$|The Polycomb-repressive {{complexes}} PRC 1 and PRC 2 play a {{key role}} in chromosome silencing induced by the non-coding RNA Xist. Polycomb <b>recruitment</b> is initiated <b>by</b> the PCGF 3 / 5 -PRC 1 complex, which catalyzes chromosome-wide H 2 A lysine 119 ubiquitylation, signaling recruitment of other PRC 1 complexes, and PRC 2. However, the molecular mechanism for PCGF 3 / 5 -PRC 1 <b>recruitment</b> <b>by</b> Xist RNA is not understood. Here we define the Xist RNA Polycomb Interaction Domain (XR-PID), a 600 nt sequence encompassing the Xist B-repeat element. Deletion of XR-PID abolishes Xist-dependent Polycomb recruitment, in turn abrogating Xist-mediated gene silencing and reversing Xist-induced chromatin inaccessibility. We identify the RNA-binding protein hnRNPK as the principal XR-PID binding factor required to recruit PCGF 3 / 5 -PRC 1. Accordingly, synthetically tethering hnRNPK to Xist RNA lacking XR-PID is sufficient for Xist-dependent Polycomb recruitment. Our findings define a key pathway for Polycomb <b>recruitment</b> <b>by</b> Xist RNA, providing important insights into mechanisms of chromatin modification by non-coding RNA...|$|R

40|$|Regional-scale {{variation}} of <b>recruitment</b> <b>by</b> marine organisms may reflect geographic patterns in adult stock sizes or fecundities, large-scale hydrodynamic features {{that influence the}} transport of larvae (e. g., currents, upwelling), and patterns of early mortality. In turn, recruitment may {{play a vital role}} in determining patterns of adult abundance and community structure, from local to biogeographic scales. We examined spatial variation in <b>recruitment</b> <b>by</b> corals at a regional scale, along 3300 km of the tropical and subtropical coast of eastern Australia (10 °– 31 ° S). We used two complementary approaches: (1) a metaanalysis of 21 different studies undertaken over a 16 -yr period, each of which was generally conducted at a single reef, and (2) a large-scale sampling effort in which recruitment was measured in two years on 33 reefs arrayed along the length of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our goal is to compare the emergent large-scale picture derived from many small-scale studies with patterns revealed by shorter-term regional sampling. The two approaches show very similar large-scale patterns. <b>Recruitment</b> <b>by</b> spawning corals (mainly acroporids) was highest in the central GBR and declined steadily with increasing latitude by up to more than 20 -fold. A smaller decline occurred on the northern GBR between Australian and Papua New Guinea. <b>Recruitment</b> <b>by</b> brooding corals (mostly pocilloporids) was greatest in the northern GBR and also declined to the south. The latitudinal decline in brooders was three-to fivefold, i. e., not as great as for spawners. Consequently, the proportion of brooded recruits increased to the south, and they generally exceeded spawners on the southern GBR and on isolated subtropical reefs at higher latitudes. Our meta-analysis shows that fully half of the variation in the ratio of spawners to brooders is attributable to one of 11 variables that we extracted from the published studies: the month when the recruitment panels were deployed. This result suggests that the intensity and timing of spawning have a crucial impact on large-scale patterns of recruitment. Elsewhere, we tested this hypothesis in the field, and confirmed that regional variation in <b>recruitment</b> <b>by</b> spawning acroporid corals was driven by spatial and temporal variation in the extent of mass spawning. Together, large-scale sampling and meta-analyses provide a powerful, combined approach for investigating large-scale patterns and the mechanisms underlying them...|$|R
