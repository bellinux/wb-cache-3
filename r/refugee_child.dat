50|$|Schools in North America {{lack the}} {{resources}} necessary to support <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> in negotiating their academic experience and the diverse learning needs of <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> often go unnoticed. Complex schooling policies that vary by classroom, building and district, and procedures that require written communication or parent involvement intimidate the parents of <b>refugee</b> <b>children.</b> Educators in North America typically guess the grade in which <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> should be placed because {{there is not a}} standard test or formal interview process required of <b>refugee</b> <b>children.</b>|$|R

50|$|Refugees {{are at risk}} of stigmatization due {{to their}} race, ethnicity, and/or religion. Refugees can also be stigmatized if they {{encounter}} mental health deficiencies prior to and during their resettlement into a new society.

40|$|In {{a context}} of mass {{displacement}} and flows of asylum-seeking and refugee peoples across national borders, the need to respond and attend {{to the education of}} asylum-seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> is urgent and pressing, though it is not without its challenges. This literature review focuses on the educational experiences of asylum seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children,</b> including those who are unaccompanied, with a particular focus on inclusion. It seeks to respond to the following three interconnected questions: 1. What does current educational literature tell us about the educational needs and experiences of asylumseeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> as they relate to inclusion? 2. What does current educational literature tell us about the educational needs and experiences of unaccompanied asylum-seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> as they relate to inclusion? 3. What implications and recommendations can be drawn from existing literature? The review has a particular interest in the needs and experiences of unaccompanied asylum-seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children,</b> but recognises that though there is a developing literature specifically on unaccompanied asylum seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> (see, for example, Stanley, 2001; Derluyn and Broekaert, 2008; Pastoor, 2015) such needs must be understood and positioned in relation to the wider educational needs and experiences of asylum seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> more generally. While other literature reviews on asylum-seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> are available (see, for example, Hek, 2005; McBrien, 2005), the present review adds to existing work by: • including an explicit focus on the educational needs and experiences of asylum-seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> who are unaccompanied; • providing an up-to-date review of literature which analyses and reports the educational needs and experiences of asylum-seeking and <b>refugee</b> <b>children.</b> The review focuses in particular on post-migration experiences within school settings as they relate to asylum seeking and refugee children’s social inclusion...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent that}} the dual burden of {{undernutrition}} and overnutrition affects <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> before resettlement in the US is not well described. To describe the prevalence of wasting, stunting, overweight, and obesity among <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> ages 0 - 10 years at their overseas medical screening examination prior to resettlement in Washington State (WA), and to compare the nutritional status of <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> with that of low-income children in WA. We analyzed anthropometric measurements of 1047 <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> ages 0 - 10 years old to assess their nutritional status at the overseas medical screening examination prior to resettlement in WA from July 2012 [...] June 2014. The prevalence estimates of the nutritional status categories were compared by country of origin. In addition, the nutritional status of <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> age 0 - 5 years old were {{compared to that of}} low-income children in WA from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System. A total of 982 children were eligible for the study, with the majority (65 %) from Somalia, Iraq and Burma. Overall, nearly one-half of all <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> had at least one form of malnutrition (44. 9 %). <b>Refugee</b> <b>children</b> ages 0 - 10 years were affected by wasting (17. 3 %), stunting (20. 1 %), overweight (7. 6 %) and obesity (5. 9 %). Among children 0 - 5 years old, <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> had a significantly higher prevalence of wasting (14. 3 % versus 1. 9 %, p< 0. 001) and stunting (21. 3 % versus 5. 5 %, p< 0. 001), and a lower prevalence of obesity (6. 2 % versus 12. 9 %, p< 0. 001) than low-income children in WA. The dual burden of under- and over-nutrition among incoming <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> as well as their overall difference in prevalence of nutritional status categories compared to low-income children in WA provides evidence for the importance of tailored interventions to address the nutritional needs of <b>refugee</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Refugee</b> <b>children</b> without caretakers have {{a greater}} risk of exhibiting {{psychiatric}} symptoms of mental illnesses following traumatic stress. Unaccompanied <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> display more behaviour problems and emotional distress than <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> with caretakers.

The family managed to emigrate to the U.S. in 1939, just before the {{outbreak}} of World War II. On the way to the U.S. they stayed in England for several months, and while in Liverpool, she had fallen asleep on a suitcase and was photographed by John Albok and the photo of a <b>refugee</b> <b>child</b> asleep on her luggage was printed in local newspapers as well as Jewish Newspapers in the U.S. After graduating from Brooklyn College and NYU she was a Kindergarten Teacher at several Jewish institutions, the last of which was the East Side Hebrew Institute. Her numerous academic degrees were in the fields of Education, Judaism, History, Art and Psychology. In 1957, she married Rabbi Max D. Raiskin, and then began teaching history in High Schools, while still maintaining the position of supervisor at the Kindergarten of the East Side Hebrew Institute. After taking several years off to raise her 8 children and complete her doctorate, Elefant-Raiskin emigrated to Israel in the 1970s, where she began teaching at Tel Aviv University, maintaining the position of lecturer for nearly 25 years.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{activity}} loss in unaccompanied <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> is common. During the asylum process, inactivity, uncertainty and anxiety disorders, which may occur after trauma, can result in passivity. Unaccompanied <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> are, according to the UN, children and young people under 18 years of age who have fled from their home country without an accompanying parent or guardian. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe different activities and their significance for unaccompanied <b>refugee</b> <b>children.</b> The method used was a literature review. Data collection was done through literature searches in different databases PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Google Scholar and a manual search through reference lists. The search resulted in 18 relevant scientific articles, and was limited to articles that were no more than 11 years old and written in English or Swedish. The result from the analysis gave three main categories which are: 'Structure in everyday life gives a good feeling', 'Activities for pleasure can increase participation', 'School as support for finding new roles'. The result showed the importance of activities for unaccompanied <b>refugee</b> <b>children,</b> as they were perceived to have a positive impact on health and to give more energy and recovery. It also emerged that activities contributed to participation, balance and better health. The results showed the importance of activity for unaccompanied <b>refugee</b> <b>children.</b> Conclusions to be drawn from this study is to make the needed support visible for the <b>refugee</b> <b>children</b> in terms of activity training and that the creation of meaningful activities and that these may prevent or reduce loss of activity.
