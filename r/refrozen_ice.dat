For a brief five minutes the Rockies, seen very far off across the levels, flushed crimson against the sky.

But the trail grew plainer to the sergeant's practiced eyes, and, when we had crossed the Bitter Lakes on rotten and but partially <b>refrozen</b> <b>ice,</b> he predicted that we should come up with the fugitive by nightfall if our horses held out. Mine was the best in the party, and, though not equal to the stolen mare, the latter had already traveled fast and far. It was a depressing journey.

Hands and feet lost sense of feeling, the cold numbed one's very brain; but the wardens of the prairie, used alike to sleep in a snow trench or swim an icy ford, care little for adverse weather, and Mackay held on with a slow tenacity that boded ill for the man he was pursuing.|$|E

The Vostok site is a likely place for water freezing at the lake-ice interface, because this interface occurs at a higher level here than anywhere else above the lake. Isotopic data suggest that subglacial Lake Vostok is an open system with an efficient circulation of water that was formed during periods that were slightly warmer than those of the past 420, 000 years. Lake ice recovered by deep drilling is of interest for preliminary investigations of lake chemistry and bedrock properties and for the search for indigenous lake microorganisms.

40|$|Stable isotope {{exchange}} processes between {{solid and}} liquid phases of a natural melting snowpack are investigated in detail by separating the liquid water from snow grains at different depths of the snowpack and collecting the bottom discharge using a lysimeter. In the meltingâ€“freezing mass exchange process between the two phases, the theoretical slope of the Ï…Dâ€“Ï… 18 O line for newly <b>refrozen</b> <b>ice</b> is calculated to be nearly that of pore water. However, based on observations of the isotopic evolution and snow grain coarsening of the snowpack, it is demonstrated that {{the slope of the}} Ï…Dâ€“Ï… 18 O line for newly <b>refrozen</b> <b>ice</b> is equal to that of the original ice. This is proved to be due to preferential water flow in the snowpack, which leads to relatively more deuterium and less oxygen- 18 in the mobile water than the immobile water because of the kinetic effect. Higher mass exchange rate in the mobile water region results in excess deuterium in the bulk <b>refrozen</b> <b>ice,</b> compared with the fractionation of uniform fractionation factors and exchange rate.

5000|$|Ice {{climbing}} is {{the activity}} of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with <b>ice</b> <b>refrozen</b> from flows of water. For the purposes of climbing, ice can be broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water ice. Alpine ice is found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed {{in an attempt to}} summit a mountain. Water ice is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine ice is frozen precipitation whereas water ice is a frozen liquid flow of water. Most alpine ice is generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in common with standard glacier travel, while water ice is selected largely for its technical challenge. Technical grade is, however, independent of ice type and both types of ice vary greatly in consistency according to weather conditions. Ice can be soft, hard, brittle or tough. Mixed climbing is ascent involving both ice climbing and rock climbing.|$|R
40|$|Following a southward {{progression}} of ice-shelf disintegration along the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS) {{has become the}} focus of ongoing investigation regarding its future stability. The ice shelf experiences surface melt and commonly features surface meltwater ponds. Here, we use a flow-line model and a firn density model (FDM) to date and interpret observations of melt-affected ice layers found within five 90 â€¯m boreholes distributed across the ice shelf. We find that units of ice within the boreholes, which have densities exceeding those expected under normal dry compaction metamorphism, correspond to two climatic warm periods within the last 300 Â years on the Antarctic Peninsula. The more recent warm period, from the 1960 s onwards, has generated distinct sections of dense ice measured in two boreholes in Cabinet Inlet, which is close to the Antarctic Peninsula mountains â€“ a region affected by fÃ¶hn winds. Previous work has classified these layers as <b>refrozen</b> pond <b>ice,</b> requiring large quantities of mobile liquid water to form. Our flow-line model shows that, whilst preconditioning of the snow began in the late 1960 s, it was probably not until the early 1990 s that the modern period of ponding began. The earlier warm period occurred during the 18 th century and resulted in two additional sections of anomalously dense ice deep within the boreholes. The first, at 61 â€¯m in one of our Cabinet Inlet boreholes, consists of <b>ice</b> characteristic of <b>refrozen</b> ponds and must have formed in an area currently featuring ponding. The second, at 69 â€¯m in a mid-shelf borehole, formed at the same time {{on the edge of the}} pond area.

40|$|A new meltpond {{parameterization}} {{has been}} developed for the CICE sea ice model, {{taking advantage of the}} level ice tracer available in the model. The ponds evolve according to physically based process descriptions, assuming a depth-area ratio for changes in pond volume. A novel aspect of the new scheme is that the ponds are carried as tracers on the level ice area of each thickness category, thus limiting their spatial extent based on the simulated sea ice topography. This limiting is meant to approximate the horizontal drainage of melt water into depressions in ice floes. Simulated melt pond processes include collection of liquid melt water and rain into ponds, drainage through permeable sea ice or over the edges of floes, infiltration of snow by pond water, and refreezing of ponds. Furthermore, snow that falls on top of ponds whose top surface has refrozen blocks radiation from penetrating into the ponds and sea ice below. Along with a control simulation, we present a range of sensitivity tests to parameters related to each subprocess described by the parameterization. With the exception of one parameter that alters the albedo of snow-covered pond ice, results are not highly sensitive to these parameters unless an entire process is removed. The snow simulation itself is critical, because the volume of snow deposition and rate of snow melt largely determine the timing and extent of the simulated melt ponds. Nevertheless, compensating effects moderate the model's sensitivity to precipitation changes. For instance, infiltration of the snow by melt water postpones the appearance of ponds and the subsequent acceleration of melting through albedo feedback, while snow on top of <b>refrozen</b> pond <b>ice</b> also reduces the ponds' effect on the radiation budget. By construction, the model simulation of level and ridged ice is also important for this parameterization. We find that as sea ice thins, either through time or when comparing sensitivity tests, the area of level ice increases. This leads to an enhanced thinning feedback in the model, because a greater ice area may be exposed to ponding and further thinning due to lowered albedo. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

REE were determined in various sections of the Vostok ice core in order to geochemically characterize its impurities. Samples were obtained from accreted ice and, for comparison, from the upper glacier ice of atmospheric origin (undisturbed, disturbed and glacial flour ice). REE concentrations ranged between 0. 8 â€“ 56 pg gâˆ’ 1 for Ce and 0. 0035 â€“ 0. 24 pg gâˆ’ 1 for Lu in glacier ice, and between < 0. 1 â€“ 24 pg gâˆ’ 1 for Ce and < 0. 0004 â€“ 0. 02 pg gâˆ’ 1 for Lu in accreted ice. Interestingly, the REE concentrations in the upper accreted ice (AC 1; characterized by visible aggregates containing a mixture of very fine terrigenous particles) and in the deeper accreted ice (AC 2; characterized by transparent ice) are lower than those in fresh water and seawater, respectively. We suggest that such ultra-low concentrations {{are unlikely to be}} representative of the real REE content in Lake Vostok, but instead may reflect phase exclusion processes occurring at the ice/water interface during refreezing. In particular, the uneven spatial distribution (on the order of a few cm) and the large range of REE concentrations observed in AC 1 are consistent with the occurrence/absence of the aggregates in adjacent ice, and point to the presence of solid-phase concentration/exclusion processes occurring within separate pockets of frazil ice during AC 1 formation. Interestingly, if the LREE enrichment found in AC 1 was not produced by chemical fractionation occurring in Lake Vostok water, this may reflect a contribution of bedrock material, possibly in combination with aeolian dust released into the lake by melting of the glacier ice. Collectively, this valuable information provides new insight into the accreted ice formation processes, the bedrock geology of East Antarctica as well as the water chemistry and circulation of Lake Vostok...|$|R

40|$|In {{the polar}} region, {{during the process}} of snow-firn-ice transition, the air in the snow is {{isolated}} from the atmosphere and enclosed in the ice as bubbles. The trapped air is expected to contain trace gases which represent the atmospheric concentrations at the time of ice formation. In order to study the change of the chemical state of the atmosphere and the climate in the past, we have initiated the analysis of trace gases in Antarctic deep ice core samples. An ice core sample was cut into several pieces after the removal of surface layer (1 cm) in the cold room at - 20 â„ƒ in NIPR. About 100 g of ice was placed in a greaseless glass flask which was sealed with a Viton O-ring and equipped with a glass-Teflon valve. The flask was first evacuated with the ice kept at dry ice temperature, then the valve was closed and the ice was thawed. After shaking the flask, the thawed water was refrozen quickly at liquid nitrogen temperature, leaving the dissolved air and trace gases (at equilibria at 0 â„ƒ) trapped in the ice. The released air was dried by passing through a cold trap at - 100 â„ƒ and transferred into a preevacuated stainless steel sample loop or small flask by using an all-stainless steel bellows pump. The extracted gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector for methane and a mass spectrometer for other gases.
