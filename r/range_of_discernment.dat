In {{this paper}} we extend a {{methodology}} for constructing a frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> from belief functions for one problem, into a methodology for constructing multiple frames <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> for several different subproblems. The most appropriate frames <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> {{are those that}} let our evidence interact in an interesting way without exhibit too much internal conflict. A function measuring overall frame appropriateness is mapped onto a Potts spin neural network {{in order to find}} the partition of all belief functions that yields the most appropriate frames.

40|$|Abstract⎯We {{construct}} alternative frames <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> from input belief functions. We {{assume that}} the core of each belief function is a subset of a so far unconstructed frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> The alternative frames are constructed as different cross products of unions of different cores. With the frames constructed the belief functions are combined for each alternative frame. The appropriateness of each frame is evaluated in two ways: (i) we measure the aggregated uncertainty (an entropy measure) of the combined belief functions for that frame to find if the belief functions are interacting in interesting ways, (ii) we measure the conflict in Dempster’s rule when combining the belief functions {{to make sure they}} do not exhibit too much internal conflict. A small frame typically yields a small aggregated uncertainty but a large conflict, and vice versa. The most appropriate frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> is that which minimizes a probabilistic sum of the conflict and a normalized aggregated uncertainty of all combined belief functions for that frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> Keywords: Dempster-Shafer theory, belief function, representation, frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment,</b> induction.

40|$|Many {{practical}} theologians {{have acknowledged}} the central place of practical wisdom (phronesis) within their hermeneutics. This acknowledgment has {{attributed to a}} flourishing dialogue between practical theology and ethics, philosophy, systematic theology, and the social sciences. Fewer approaches to practical theology, however, have engaged Christian spirituality, and particularly the practice <b>of</b> <b>discernment,</b> in shaping their hermeneutical frameworks. This dissertation contributes {{to the study of}} practical theology and practical theological hermeneutics first through a critical-confessional examination {{of the relationship between the}} practice <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> in Christian spirituality and practical wisdom, and second through the formation of a practical theological hermeneutic <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> The dissertation argues that practical wisdom is tradition-constituted, and within Christian tradition, practical wisdom is characterized by the practice <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> To this end, the dissertation examines two different approaches to practical theology common in the American context (a critical-correlational approach and a critical-confessional approach) and the different ways in which practical wisdom is conceived in these approaches. The dissertation then argues that if practical wisdom is central to practical theological hermeneutics, and wisdom within Christian tradition is characterized by attending to and discerning the action of the Holy Spirit, then practical theology within the Christian tradition should practice <b>discernment</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Spirit in its hermeneutics. In light of this, the dissertation examines discernment as a practice, virtue, and method of inquiry within the Christian spiritual traditions of the fourth century desert elders of Egypt, Benedict of Nursia, and Ignatius of Loyola. The practices <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> found among these figures then play an important role in the development of a hermeneutic <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> in the remainder of the dissertation. Practical theological hermeneutics and practical wisdom are more than a method of inquiry, but a virtue and practice embodied by Christian communities and constituted by Christian tradition. Following this understanding of wisdom and practical theological reflection, the dissertation identifies the contributions a hermeneutic <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> can make for theological scholarship, including education, through its attention to context, to the movement of the Holy Spirit, and to affective dimensions of knowing, with particular reference to the formation of wisdom...|$|R

Results related to Bayesian and quasi Bayesian BFs from the first part are also briefly recalled. Further substructures related to another subsets of general BFs are described and analyzed (including idempotents, simple complementary BFs, generalizations of subsemigroups of simple BFs) and subalgebras isomorphic to Dempster's semigroup on 2 -element frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> Ideas and open problems for future research are presented...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} Dempster-Shafer (DS) {{theory in}} terms of its utility for sensor fusion for autonomous mobile robots. It exploits two little used components of DS theory: the weight of conflict metric and the enlargement of the frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> The weight <b>of</b> conflict is used to measure the amount of consensus between different sensors. A lack of consensus leads the robot to either compensate within certain limits or investigate the problem further, adding robustness to the robot's operation. Enlarging the frame <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> allows a modular decomposition of evidence. This decomposition offers the advantages of perceptual abstraction, and permits expert knowledge about the domain to be embedded in the frames <b>of</b> <b>discernment,</b> simplifying the construction and maintenance of the knowledge base. Six experiments using this Dempster-Shafer framework are presented. Data from four types of sensor data were collected by a mobile robot and fused with the Sensor Fusion Effect [...] ...|$|R

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Pentecostal Movement in 1906, Pentecostal meetings were plagued by what they labeled “counterfeit manifestations. ” These manifestations were creating negative consequences for the movement and Pentecostals needed a strategy that would identify and eradicate them from their meetings. Because Pentecostalism was in its infancy, it did not have a clear procedure to assist in identifying counterfeit manifestations, to determine how they operated, and/or who or what produced them. Over time they began to form assumptions regarding the operation of counterfeit manifestations and developed several strategies that they hoped would counteract their presence in meetings, one of which was the employment of the gift <b>of</b> <b>discernment.</b> This study identifies the negative consequences counterfeit manifestations brought to the Pentecostal Movement from 1906 to 1941, the strategies Pentecostals employed in conjunction with the gift <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> in order to counteract the negative effects caused by counterfeit manifestations, and their attempts to articulate a theological understanding of the gift <b>of</b> <b>discernment</b> for early Pentecostalism...|$|R
