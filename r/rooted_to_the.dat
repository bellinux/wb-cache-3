5|$|A {{persistent}} thigh injury restricted Whalley's first-team involvement at {{the start}} of the following season, which also coincided with a change in management at the club, after a poor start to the season left Shrewsbury <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the League One table. Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul Hurst in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under Hurst, and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E
5|$|Ipswich {{were finally}} {{relegated to the}} Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1985–86 season. Terry Butcher, their last {{remaining}} key player from the successful 1981 team, was sold to Rangers that summer. Ferguson, who had remained in charge despite the relegation, resigned in May 1987 after reaching the promotion play-offs but failing to return the club to the first division. Ipswich Town were then managed by John Duncan for three years until he was replaced by former West Ham boss John Lyall in May 1990, with Ipswich still in the Second Division. Lyall guided Ipswich to the Second Division title and promotion to the new FA Premier League, ready for the 1992–93 season. Suffering only two league defeats before the New Year, Ipswich started the season well and were fourth in the Premier League in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw Ipswich finish in a disappointing 16th place. Poor form continued into the following season and Ipswich only avoided relegation that year when Sheffield United suffered a last-gasp 3–2 defeat at Chelsea on the final day of the season. Six months later, fortunes on the pitch had not improved, and Lyall was sacked as Ipswich manager in December 1994 with the club <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Premiership.|$|E

However, the SRU's extreme financial difficulties (they were over £20M in debt) forced yet another re-think (especially when the Border Reivers were <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Celtic League season after season) – at the end of season 2005–06, Edinburgh Gunners were sold to a private consortium led by Alex Carruthers, and renamed Edinburgh Rugby.|$|E
25|$|The Motithang Takin Preserve in Thimphu is a {{wildlife}} reserve area for takin, the National Animal of Bhutan. Originally a mini-zoo, it was {{converted into a}} preserve when {{it was discovered that}} the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring the takin as a National Animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (Budorcas taxicolor) is attributed to a legend of the animal's creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama Drukpa Kunley. The King of Bhutan believed that it was improper for a Buddhist country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons, so he ordered the closure of the mini-zoo and the release of the animals into the forest. However, the Takin remained <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town and were seen straying in the streets of Thimphu in search of fodder. Hence, an exclusive preserve was created for them to live freely.|$|E

25|$|American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) is an American Muslim {{think tank}} formed in 2003 {{by a small}} group of Muslim {{professionals}} in Phoenix, Arizona. The group's founder is Zuhdi Jasser who is also the group’s president and chief spokesman. AIFD advocates for the separation of religion and state and confronts the ideologies of political Islam and openly counters the belief that the Muslim faith is inextricably <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concept of the Islamic state. Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the group with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values. The AIFD supports separation of religion and state, religious pluralism, equality of the sexes, the unconditional recognition of Israel, and the creation of an independent Palestine “on the current ‘occupied territories.’” The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it. Zuhdi Jasser has been the center of various controversies and has been criticized by several muslims and non muslims alike.|$|E
25|$|In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, {{written for}} the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is {{recorded}} about how, one day, when King Wamba (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and Nîmes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) Wamba shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed in for the kill. But when Wamba arrived he found his dogs miraculously <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness and tried to make amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land upon which to build a monastery. But Giles refused.|$|E
25|$|The fourth-place {{finishes}} of the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons {{proved to}} be the high points of Wigan Athletic's first stint in Division 3. For the next five years, they finished mid-table, flirting with relegation in 1988–89 (at which time Mathias was sacked and previous manager Bryan Hamilton returned) and 1989–90, until they were relegated {{for the first time in}} the club's league history in 1992–93. Wigan Athletic finished in 23rd place, amid tumbling attendances which had fallen from averages of 3,000–4,000 in Wigan Athletic's Division 3 years to just 2,593 in 1992–93. Hamilton resigned shortly before the club were relegated, and was replaced by Kenny Swain. A year later, with the club back in the fourth tier of the English League, the Latics finished fourth from bottom, in 19th place. While there was no relegation that season due to the lack of a promotable club in the Football Conference, this remains the club's lowest-ever finish. The following season would prove to be arguably even worse, as Swain was sacked early in the campaign following a horrific start, and former player Graham Barrow took over as manager. Despite the club being <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the table until the start of December, the second half of the campaign saw a major upturn in form, and they finished well clear of the relegation zone in 15th place. Attendances fell to a lowest-ever Wigan Athletic League average of 1,845 by 1995.|$|E

25|$|In 2001–02 season, {{the club}} reached the FA Trophy final {{for the first}} time, but lost 2–0 to Yeovil Town at Villa Park. The {{following}} season, Stevenage started poorly and were <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Conference National in January, seven points from safety. However, the club's fortunes changed following the appointment of Graham Westley as manager. Westley guided the club to a respectable 12th position, winning 8 games {{out of a possible}} 12 in the league. The 2003–04 season witnessed Boro' consolidate their position in the league, making steady progression, finishing in eighth position. During the 2004–05 season, Boro' managed to make the play–offs after finishing fifth under the guidance of Westley. After beating second–placed Hereford United over two–legs in the semi–final, the side lost 1–0 to Carlisle United at the Britannia Stadium in the final. The following year, however, Boro' failed to reach the play-offs after finishing sixth, and Westley's contract was not renewed, ending his three-and-a-half-year reign as manager. Shortly after Westley's departure, Boro' announced the appointment of former–Grays Athletic boss, Mark Stimson as their new manager. Despite finishing in a disappointing eighth position in Stimson's first season as manager, the 2006–07 campaign saw the club reach the FA Trophy final again, where they came back from 2–0 down to beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 in front of a record FA Trophy crowd of 53,262. The victory meant that Stevenage were the first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E

She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring...

500|$|Many reviewers {{felt that}} the chronological running order put more {{emphasis}} on the band's well-regarded earlier periods.

[...] Johnny Dee of Classic Rock expressed, [...] "The later material here sounds formulaic, however, new song [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] adds strings to the dynamic and sits well alongside their peerless early material". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that despite ignoring 2000s singles such as [...] "Run Baby Run", [...] "it already seems that the comp has lingered far longer than necessary on the last stage of Garbage's career", {{in contrast to the}} debut album singles [...] "still sounding sleek and alluring." [...] Kerrang! magazine's Tom Byrant also felt that Garbage's work had dated, expounding, [...] "Something that was once {{so much a part of}} the Zeitgeist has remained <b>rooted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era it marked, untranslatable across the millennial divide. Still, songs like 'Stupid Girl' and 'Only Happy When It Rains' [...] maintain an urgency and spite that sees their intent remain intact." [...] Billboard writer Kerri Mason praised the choice of remixes on the special edition: [...] "the band continually brought the best of dance's best producers, not one of the thirteen tracks is a throwaway." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called the compilation a [...] "deserved retrospective", further noting that [...] "the best way to get to know Garbage is through their albums, which demonstrate their strength in depth. In particular the self-titled debut and Version 2.0 withstand a heavy hammering on any stereo." ...|$|E
