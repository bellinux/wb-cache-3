Accordingly, itsnumerical technique is very efficient using implicit timestepping andoperator splitting methods. The model is driven at the surfaceby wind-stress and by <b>restoring</b> <b>temperature</b> and salinityto the observed annual cycle. The models cyclo-stationary solution dependson the initial conditions even after many thousand years of integration. Four different solutions are briefly reported in this note.

We find that an external magnetic field promotes chiral symmetry breaking, consistent with the "magnetic catalysis" observed in the field theory literature, and seen in other studies using holographic duals. The external field increases the separation between the deconfinement temperature and the chiral symmetry <b>restoring</b> <b>temperature.</b> In the deconfined phase we investigate the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram and observe, for example, there exists a maximum critical temperature (at which symmetry is restored) for very large magnetic field. We find that this and certain other phenomena persist for the Sakai-Sugimoto type models with probe branes of diverse dimensions.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} experiments are conducted using the Bryan-Cox Ocean General Circulation Model {{to investigate the}} potential existence of low-frequency variability of the thermohaline circulation under seasonal forcing. Experiments are performed with different combinations of a seasonal cycle being present or not on the <b>restoring</b> <b>temperature,</b> the surface freshwater flux fields (mixed boundary conditions) and the surface wind forcing. Despite {{the presence of the}} forcing on the dominant seasonal timescale, it is found that the system may oscillate at the decadal period or longer. The decadal variability is excited by changes in the net surface density flux which are due to the advection of temperature and salinity anomalies in the model domain. The magnitude of the seasonal cycle also {{plays an important role in}} determining the timescale of variability. Violent overturning events may occur on the century timescale under seasonal forcing. The magnitudes of the flushes are reduced compared to those found in similar experiments without the presence of a seasonal cycle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{identify}} new {{components of}} the Drosophila circadian clock, we screened chemically mutagenized flies for suppressors or enhancers of the long periods characteristic of the period (per) mutant allele per L. We isolated a novel mutant that maps to the rhythm gene timeless (tim). This novel alleletimSL, alters the temporal pattern of per L protein nuclear localization and <b>restores</b> <b>temperature</b> compensation to perL flies. timSL more generally manifests specific interactions with different per alleles. The identification of this first period-altering tim allele provides further evidence that TIM is {{a major component of}} the clock, and the allele-specific interactions with PER provide evidence that the PER/TIM heterodimer is a unit of circadian function. Although timSL fails to <b>restore</b> PER-L/TIM <b>temperature</b> insensitivity in yeast, it alters the TIM phosphorylation pattern during the late night. The effects on phosphorylation suggest that timSL functions as a partial bypass suppressor of per L and provide evidence that the TIM phosphorylation program contributes to the circadian timekeeping mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{risks and}} {{benefits}} of solar geoengineering, or solar radiation management (SRM), depend on assumptions about its implementation. Claims that SRM will reduce precipitation, increase ocean acidification or deplete stratospheric ozone, or that it must be continued forever once started, are not inherent features of SRM; rather, they are features of common scenarios for its implementation. Most analyses assume, for example, that SRM would be used to stop the increase in global <b>temperature</b> or <b>restore</b> <b>temperature</b> to pre-industrial values. We argue that these are poor scenario choices on which to base policy-relevant judgements about SRM. As a basis for further analysis, we provide a scenario that is temporary in that its end point is zero SRM, is moderate in that it offsets only half of the growth in anthropogenic climate forcing and is responsive in that it recognizes that the amount of SRM will be adjusted in light of new information...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid an}} {{explicit}} simulation of the overflows across the Greenland-Scotland ridge, many {{models of the}} large-scale ocean circulation seek to include {{the net effect of}} the inflowing dense water masses by <b>restoring</b> <b>temperature</b> and salinity near the ridge to observed conditions. In this paper the authors examine the effect of different datasets for the northern restoring condition in two versions, eddy resolving and non-eddy resolving, of the model of the North and equatorial Atlantic that has been developed in recent years as a Community Modeling Effort for WOCE. It is shown that the use of smoothed climatological fields o f temperature and salinity south of the Denmark Strait leads to strong deficiencies in the simulation of the deep flow field in the basin. A switch to actual hydrographic data from the Denmark Strait ignites a rapid dynamic response throughout the North Atlantic, affecting the transport and vertical structure of the deep western boundary current and, by virtue of the JEBAR effect, the transport of the horizontal gyres. Meridional overturning and northward heat transport, too weak in the cases with climatological boundary conditions, increase to more realistic levels in the subtropical North Atlantic. The initial response to switches in the high-latitude thermohaline forcing is mediated by fast waves along the western boundary, leading to changes in the deep western boundary current in low latitudes after about tw...|$|E
40|$|Myocardial damage {{incurred}} by ischaemia appears during {{and seems to}} be accelerated by reperfusion, which restores recoverable cells and disrupts badly damaged ones. Vicious cycles of oedema, calcium accumulation, acidosis, oxygen toxicity, fibrillation and air and platelet emboli contribute to the reperfusion injury. The philosophy of cool low-pressure reperfusion gradually <b>restoring</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure to normal is here contrasted experimentally with that of immediate normothermic, normotensive perfusion after 90 minutes of ischaemic cool, cardioplegic arrest. The preparation was a canine heart which was treated according to the usual clinical protocol except that one group was reperfused at normal temperature and pressure, and the other group started reperfusion cool and at a low pressure and over the next 10 minutes pressure and temperature were restored to normal. Isovolumic ventricular function studies were done before ischaemia and after recovery and showed statistically significant differences between the groups in favour of the immediate restoration of normal temperature and pressure of perfusion. Contractile velocity and systolic pressure showed very highly significant (p = less than 0. 005) differences, wall stress significant (p = less than 0. 025) and compliance not significant differences between the groups. Reperfusion with optimal conditions may prevent "vicious cycle" changes in ischaemically damaged but recoverable myocardium. We have shown that a step in this direction is reperfusion with blood at normal temperature and pressure rather than initially at lowered temperature and pressure...|$|E

In three dimensions the initially broken charge conjugation symmetry is not <b>restored</b> at high <b>temperature,</b> irrespective {{of the value of}} the disorder strength. In two dimensions and at zero temperature the charge conjugation symmetry undergoes a quantum phase transition from a symmetric state (for weak disorder) to a broken state (for strong disorder) as the disorder strength is varied. For any given value of disorder strength, the high-temperature behavior of the charge conjugation symmetry is the same as its zero-temperature behavior. Therefore, in two dimensions and for strong disorder strength the charge conjugation symmetry is not <b>restored</b> at high <b>temperature...</b>|$|R
40|$|Centennial {{oscillations}} of {{the ocean}} thermohaline circulation are studied in a 2 -D latitude-depth model under mixed boundary conditions (i. e. <b>restoring</b> surface <b>temperature</b> and prescribed freshwater flux). The oscillations are revealed through linear stability analysis of a steady state obtained in a single hemisphere configuration. A density variance budget is performed and helps determine the physical processes sustaining these oscillations: the <b>restoring</b> surface <b>temperature</b> appears {{as a source of}} density variance – this is a consequence of positively-correlated temperature and salinity anomalies. A minimal model, the Howard-Malkus loop oscillator, enables us to understand physically the oscillatory and growth mechanisms. The centennial oscillation is connected to the advection of salinity anomaly around the loop; it is also related to the salinity feedback on the overturning which reinforces anomalies through a change of residence time in the freshwater flux regions. Analytical solutions of this loop model show that these centennial oscillations exist in a specific parameter regime in terms of the freshwater flux amplitude F 0 : oscillations are damped if F 0 is too weak, but if F 0 is too large, the instability grows exponentially without oscillating – the latter regime is known as the positive salinity feedback. The robustness of these oscillations is then analyzed in more realistic bihemispheric configurations, some including a highly idealized Antarctic Circumpolar Current: oscillations are then always damped. These results are rationalized with the loop model, and compared to the oscillations found in general circulation models...|$|R

40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleOcean {{heat uptake}} is {{explored}} with non-eddying (28), eddy-permitting (0. 258), and eddy-resolving (0. 1258) ocean circulation models in a domain representing the Atlantic basin {{connected to a}} southern circumpolar channel with a flat bottom. The model is forced with a wind stress and a restoring condition for surface buoyancy that is linearly dependent on temperature, both being constant in time in the control climate. When the <b>restore</b> <b>temperature</b> is instantly enhanced regionally, two distinct processes are found relevant for the ensuing heat uptake: heat uptake into the ventilated thermocline forced by Ekman pumping and heat absorption in the deep ocean through meridional overturning circulation (MOC). Temperature increases in the thermocline occur on the decadal time scale whereas, {{over most of the}} abyss, it is the millennial time scale that is relevant, and the strength of MOC in the channel matters for the intensity of heat uptake. Under global, uniform warming, the rate of increase of total heat content increases with both diapycnal diffusivity and strengthening Southern Ocean westerlies. In models with different resolutions, ocean responses to uniform warming share similar patterns with important differences. The transfer by mesoscale eddies is insufficiently resolved in the eddy-permitting model, resulting in steep isopycnals in the channel and weak lower MOC, and this in turn leads to weaker heat uptake in the abyssal ocean. Also, the reduction of the Northern Hemisphere meridional heat flux that occurs in a warmer world because of a weakening MOC increases with resolution. Consequently, the cooling tendency near the polar edge of the subtropical gyre is most significant in the eddyresolving model. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.
