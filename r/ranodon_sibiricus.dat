5000|$|The Central Asian {{salamander}} (<b>Ranodon</b> <b>sibiricus)</b> is {{a species}} of salamander in the monotypic genus Ranodon of the Hynobiidae family. In Kazakhstan and Russia, {{it is called the}} Semirechensk salamander (Жетісу аяқтыбалығы; Семиреченский лягушкозуб), while in China, it is called the Xinjiang salamander ( [...] ; ug=شىنجاڭ سالاماندراسى).|$|E
40|$|Background: The Siberian {{salamander}} (<b>Ranodon</b> <b>sibiricus),</b> {{distributed in}} geographically isolated areas of Central Asia, {{is an ideal}} alpine species for studies of conservation and phylogeography. However, there are few data regarding the genetic diversity in R. sibiricus populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used two genetic markers (mtDNA and microsatellites) to survey all six populations of R. sibiricus in China. Both of the markers revealed extreme genetic uniformity among these populations. There were only three haplotypes in the mtDNA, and the overall nucleotide diversity in the mtDNA was 0. 00064, ranging from 0. 00000 to 0. 00091 for the six populations. Although we recovered 70 sequences containing microsatellite repeats, {{there were only two}} loci that displayed polymorphism. We used the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method to study the demographic history of the populations. This analysis suggested that the extant populations diverged from the ancestral population approximately 120 years ago and that the historical population size was much larger than the present population size; i. e., R. sibiricus has experienced dramatic population declines. Conclusion/Significance: Our findings suggest that the genetic diversity in the R. sibiricus populations is the lowest among all investigated amphibians. We conclude that the isolation of R. sibiricus populations occurred recently and was a result of recent human activity and/or climatic changes. The Pleistocene glaciation oscillations may have facilitated intraspecie...|$|E
30|$|The low phylogeographic {{structure}} {{observed in}} R. arunco {{is a pattern}} which {{has been reported in}} few amphibian species in the world. Burns et al. (2007) studied 26 localities (n = 263) of Litoria aurea (Anura: Hylidae) located in the coastal zone of southwestern Australia. Using mitochondrial markers (cytochrome oxidase subunit I and ND 4), they found a no marked phylogeographic structure; they attributed this pattern to the greater dispersion capacity of individuals, with movements recorded more than 10 km from the reproductive ponds. Similarly, Makowsky et al. (2009) investigated the phylogeographic patterns of Gastrophryne carolinensis (Anura: Microhylidae) in 29 localities (n = 100) in the southwestern US. Surprisingly, an analysis of two parts of the genome (the mitochondrial 12 S gene and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs)) showed low genetic and phylogeographic structures, which is incongruent with respect to co-distributed species and studies of amphibians with similar distribution ranges. Those authors suggested that the populations had experienced strong bottlenecks with subsequent range expansions. Finally, Chen et al. (2012) studied six localities (n = 123) of the Siberian salamander <b>Ranodon</b> <b>sibiricus</b> (Caudata: Hynobiidae) from isolated geographic areas of central Asia. Using two genetic markers (D-loop and microsatellites), they reported genetic homogeneity among populations, suggesting that Pleistocene climatic changes may have facilitated gene flow or that the observed pattern may have been due to a low rate of evolution of the markers used.|$|E
