40|$|Abstract. <b>Rye</b> <b>ergot</b> (Claviceps purpurea) {{occasionally}} causes toxicity (chiefly {{expressed as}} hyperthermia) in Australian livestock, {{either as a}} result of grazing infected annual (Lolium rigidum) and perennial (L. perenne) rye grasses, or if the ergot sclerotia produced in rye grasses contaminate grain crops used as stockfood. Alkaloids in 30 samples of Australian <b>rye</b> <b>ergot</b> sclerotia taken from rye grasses and grain screenings, and some feed samples contaminated with rye grass ergot sclerotia, were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Samples originated from across southern Australia. Ergotamine was the dominant alkaloid in all samples, followed by a-ergocryptine, ergocornine, ergosine and their respective-imine epimers. Ergotamine concentrations in sclerotia ranged up to 2257 mg/kg (as received basis). Ergocristine was a very minor component (< 50 mg/kg) in all samples. Total alkaloids in freshly collected sclerotia ranged from 1003 to 3321 mg/kg (0. 10 to 0. 33 %), and up to 3766 mg/kg with epimers included, although lower concentrations were found in samples stored for some time. Alkaloid profiles in sclerotia were all very similar, and concentrations {{did not appear to be}} related to size of sclerotia, source region, nor to the rye grass or grain from which they were taken. Previous cases of toxicity in livestock are reviewed and several new cases are reported. The implications of variable alkaloid contents of <b>rye</b> <b>ergot</b> sclerotia are discussed in terms of Australian food and stockfeed regulations...|$|E
40|$|Ergot is {{a disease}} of cereals and grasses caused by fungi in the genus Claviceps. Of {{particular}} concern are Claviceps purpurea in temperate regions, C. africana in sorghum (worldwide), and C. fusiformis in pearl millet (Africa, Asia). The fungi infect young, usually unfertilized ovaries, replacing the seeds by dark mycelial masses known as sclerotia. The percentage of sclerotia in marketable grain is strictly regulated in many countries. In winter <b>rye,</b> <b>ergot</b> has been known in Europe since the early Middle Ages. The alkaloids produced by the fungus severely affect the health of humans and warm-blooded animals. In sorghum and pearl millet, ergot became a problem when growers adopted hybrid technology, which increased host susceptibility. Plant traits reducing ergot infection include immediate pollination of receptive stigmas, closed flowering (cleistogamy), and physiological resistance. Genetic, nonpollen-mediated variation in ergot susceptibility could be demonstrated in all three affected cereals. Fungicides have limited efficacy and application is weather dependent. Sorting out the sclerotia from the harvest by photocells is expensive and time consuming. In conclusion, molecular-based hybrid rye breeding could improve pollen fertility by introgressing effective restorer genes thus bringing down the ergot infection level to that of conventional population cultivars. A further reduction might be feasible in the future by selecting more resistant germplasm...|$|E

It was known to cause convulsion symptoms and hallucinations. British academic John Cornwell has suggested that Saint Joseph had consumed <b>rye</b> bread (see <b>ergot</b> poisoning) [...] According to Cornwell [...] "Here, perhaps, lay {{the key to his}} levitations.

40|$|Breeding is an {{important}} tool to develop varieties with an optimal adaptation to organic farming. Several important traits {{are not covered by}} conventional research and breeding. At the State Plant Breeding Institute we are presently working on (1) resistance of <b>rye</b> to <b>ergot</b> (Claviceps purpurea), (2) nitrogen(N) -use efficiency in triticale, and (3) protein content of sunflower. The inheritance of these complex traits is quantitative. They are analysed in replicated field experiments at two locations in three years at several organic farms in Germany. For testing <b>ergot</b> resistance in <b>rye,</b> 68 populations, 250 full-sib families, 64 lines, and their 90 testcrosses were inoculated at mid-flowering by a spore suspension. All four material groups displayed significant (P< 0. 01) genotypic variation, indicating that a resistance selection should be feasible. N-use efficiency of 64 triticale genotypes was evaluated at two different N-levels. Significant genotypic variation was found, which is a prerequisite for breeding for improved N-use efficiency. To increase protein content, the 230 sunflower inbred lines investigated showed a high variation for protein and oil content. Only a small negative correlation between both traits was found. Thus, {{it should be possible to}} breed lines with high protein and high oil contents...|$|R
40|$|Rye as an outcrossing crop {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to ergot infection caused by Claviceps purpurea. It is ecologically {{the best solution}} to avoid the infection already in the field by growing resistant varieties. Aim of our study is the analysis of inheritance of self-fertile <b>rye</b> material for <b>ergot</b> resistance and alcaloid content. Sixty CMS inbred lines and their 90 CMS crosses were tested in pollen-isolated fields in three environ-ments under the conditions of Ecological Farming by artificial inoculation. The sclerotia weight per head was evaluated as resistance trait. Both, CMS lines and testcrosses showed significant genotypic differences at the individual environments. Correlation between both groups was significant (r= 0, 6 - 0, 7; P= 0, 01). The alcaloid contents and the alcaloid spectra of 25 CMS lines revealed no genotypic difference. Breeding of self-fertile rye for a higher resistance to ergot should be successful on the long run...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{establish}} the aetiology and define the main clinical {{features of a}} syndrome characterised by severe feed refusal, death of piglets and reduced milk production in pigs and dairy cattle. Design Clinical, pathological, toxicological and epidemiological examination of clinical cases in 10 piggeries and 4 dairies, located between 50 and 150 km southwest of Rockhampton. Results All cases {{were associated with the}} feeding of sorghum grain infected with sorghum ergot (Claviceps africana). There was mild to severe feed refusal when the sorghum was first offered. Sows fed ergot before farrowing had shrunken udders, produced no colostrum, and displayed signs of oestrus. All of their piglets died, apparently from starvation: necropsy of a few piglets showed that they were born alive and walked, but had ingested no milk. Sows fed the grain after farrowing had severe reductions in milk production despite aggressive sucking by piglets, leading to very poor growth of piglets. There were no signs of infectious disease. Ergot in sorghum samples ranged from 1 to 31 % ergot sclerotes by weight. Total alkaloid concentrations in mixed feeds ranged from 5 to 40 mg/kg, with dihydroergosine accounting for approximately 90 %. At the same time, in the same districts, there were reports of feed refusal and reduced milk production from 4 dairy farms. Grain samples from these farms contained up to 17 % C africana ergot sclerotia. Conclusion Agalactia and feed refusal are classical signs of poisoning by <b>rye</b> <b>ergot</b> (C purpurea), {{but this is the first}} time that sorghum ergot has been associated with a similar syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The {{negative}} impacts of ergot contamination of grain {{on the health}} of humans and animals were first documented during the 5 th century AD. Although ergotism is now rare in humans, cleaning contaminated grain concentrates ergot bodies in screenings which are used as livestock feed. Ergot is found worldwide, with even low concentrations of alkaloids in the diet (< 100 ppb total) reducing the growth efficiency of livestock. Extended periods of increased moisture and cold during flowering promote the development of ergot in cereal crops. Furthermore, the unpredictability of climate change may have detrimental impacts to important cereal crops such as wheat, barley and <b>rye,</b> favouring <b>ergot</b> production. Allowable limits for ergot in livestock feed are confusing as they may be determined by proportions of ergot bodies or by total levels of alkaloids, measurements which may differ widely in their estimation of toxicity. The proportion of individual alkaloids including ergotamine, ergocristine, ergosine, ergocornine and ergocryptine is extremely variable within ergot bodies and the relative toxicity of these alkaloids has yet to be determined. This raises concerns that current recommendations on safe levels of ergot in feeds may be unreliable. Furthermore, the total ergot alkaloid content is greatly dependent on the geographic region, harvest year, cereal species, variety and genotype. Considerable animal to animal variation in the ability of the liver to detoxify ergot alkaloids also exists and the impacts of factors such as pelleting of feeds or use of binders to reduce bioavailability of alkaloids require study. Accordingly, unknowns greatly outnumber the knowns for cereal ergot and further study to help better define allowable limits for livestock would be welcome...|$|R
50|$|Ergot {{is a type}} of fungus {{that tends}} to grow on cereals and grasses, {{including}} rye. The fungus Claviceps spp. infects the flowering head and replaces grain of the <b>rye</b> with an <b>ergot</b> that’s a hard and compact fungal mycelium, deep purple in color. In addition, sweet ergot honeydew oozes from these flowering heads. Insects often feed on this exudate and serve as vectors that carry it from source to source. Examination of Polistes dorsalis during their foraging behavior found presence of fungal conidia on various parts of their body including antennae, mouthparts, and in their gut. Therefore, this species of wasp has been identified as one of these insects, potentially transmitting this causal ergot fungus. This is part of the wasp’s foraging behavior, as it is focused on exclusively locating fungal infected grasses and collecting this ergot honeydew. P. dorsalis carries the droplets in their mouthparts from infected grass like Paspalum dilatatum Pior, then crawls or moves through hopping flights towards other florets in the area. Polistes can also differentiate infected grass heads from uninfected ones, and usually land on uninfected grasses for grooming purposes only. Stopping on these grooming sites increase the likelihood of them serving as vectors for the spread of fungal infection, in addition to visiting various grass species during foraging.|$|R
40|$|Mycotoxins are fungal {{metabolites}} which, when ingested, inhaled or absorbed {{through the}} skin, cause lowered performance, sickness or death in man or animals, including birds" (Pitt, 1996). They are poisonous substances, which occur naturally and {{are perhaps the}} most prevalent source of food related health risk in field crops. However, they are almost unrecognized publicly. Consumption of food with high levels can be fatal. Long-term exposure can, amongst other things, increase cancer risk and suppress the immune system. An invaluable web site [URL] is available as "a means of rapid access to internationally peer reviewed information on chemicals commonly used throughout the world, which may also occur as contaminants in the environment and food". Mycotoxins are a significant component of the site and should be consulted for further information. Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in nature and responsible for producing mycotoxins in agricultural crops. The fungi and mycotoxins are considered generally as being natural and unavoidable. It is accepted that St Anthony's fire (Holy fire), a disease that affected many parts of Europe in the tenth century, was caused by the consumption of <b>rye</b> contaminated with <b>ergot</b> alkaloids, a known mycotoxin of Claviceps purpurea (CAST, 2003). Mycotoxins have plagued mankind before and since the beginning of organized crop production, i. e. always. They attract worldwide scientific, political and economic attention because of the significant economic losses associated with impacts on human health, animal productivity and international trade. Unfortunately, they are also considered as potential weapons and so could enter the food chain by this route. A recent report (CAST, 2003) has a wealth of information regarding mycotoxins, and has been referred to liberally in this overview. It is also available on the World Wide Web. Food contamination with mycotoxins has only been fully appreciated since the 1960 's, when an unknown disease of animals occurred in England (CAST, 200...|$|R
