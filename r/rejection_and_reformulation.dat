40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on masculinities and rurality, and masculinities and disability through interviews about fatherhood with 16 rural men with an acquired disability. In the context of shifting notions of fatherhood in broader society, and dominant discourses of rural and disabled masculinity, we explore interviewees' understandings and enactments of being a parent. We address the question of how rural fathers with a disability define fatherhood through reference to Gerschick and Miller's (1995) typology of reliance, <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> <b>reformulation.</b> The majority {{of the men in the}} sample understood fatherhood via discourses of breadwinning, physicality, and the outdoors. We argue that these strategies of reliance on traditional discourses of masculinity have particularly negative implications for men with a disability living in rural areas, due to the nature of the rural economy, poor service provision and limited accessibility to facilities. In the final section of the paper, we turn to constructions of fatherhood articulated by four participants. These men adopt strategies of both reliance and reformulation. They incorporate dimensions of hegemonic masculinity into their definition of parenthood, while simultaneously encompassing more normatively feminised practices and spaces.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} {{a preliminary report}} from a larger project examining the role of adult reformulations of children's utterances. Adult reformulations appear to serve two roles simultaneously in adult-child conversations: they provide a means whereby adult speakers can check up on what a child meant by what he said, and they offer a conventional way of expressing what the child appeared to have meant on each occasion. Analysis of two corpora, one French and one English, showed that adults {{are more likely to}} reformulate erroneous child utterances than conventional, grammatical ones, and that they produce many more reformulations when the children are younger and in fact producing a higher proportion of errors. Evidence that children attend to and make use of adult reformulations can be adduced from their acceptances <b>and</b> <b>rejections</b> of <b>reformulations.</b> While children tacitly accept most adult reformulations as next turns in the conversation, they also offer explicit acceptances, with overt uptake in their own next turns, <b>and</b> explicit <b>rejections,</b> where the adult has misunderstood what the child was trying to say. This suggests that adult reformulations provide an essential ingredient in the process of acquisition. The contrast between child and adult forms offers children data relevant to changing their own internal representations in memory, and so moving the forms of their emerging language ever closer to the patterns of adult usage in the community around them.
