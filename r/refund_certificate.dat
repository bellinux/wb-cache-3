50|$|Only a few 1879 <b>Refunding</b> <b>Certificates</b> were {{imprinted}} {{with the}} inscription, Payable to Order. Only two {{are known to}} still exist. Most were inscribed Payable to Bearer and even these are rare—only a few dozen are in numismatic collections.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Refunding</b> <b>Certificate</b> was {{a type of}} {{interest-bearing}} banknote {{that the}} United States Treasury issued in 1879. They issued it only in the $10 denomination, depicting Benjamin Franklin. Their issuance reflects {{the end of a}} coin-hoarding period that began during the American Civil War, and represented a return to public confidence in paper money.|$|R
50|$|<b>Refunding</b> <b>Certificates,</b> issued only in 1879 {{and only}} in the $10 denomination, were special in that their {{interest}} (4% per annum) did accrue indefinitely, which was meant {{as a way to}} persuade people into buying them. However, as very few of these notes were redeemed, in 1907 Congress passed an act stopping the accrual of interest, fixing the value of the notes at $21.30.|$|R
5000|$|When the Treasury {{issued the}} bonds, silver coins were in wide {{circulation}} and gold coins {{were just beginning}} to appear at banks nationwide. The Treasury paid out $40,012,750 in notes, the majority—$39,398,110 (or 98.5%)—in the fourth quarter of 1879, as long lines of people gathered at Post Office branches and Treasury offices. The <b>Refunding</b> <b>Certificate</b> originally promised to pay 4% annual interest in perpetuity. The obligation on these notes reads: ...|$|R
50|$|From {{almost the}} very {{beginning}} of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency. As early as 1864, the offices which would later become the BEP made passports for the State Department and money orders for the Post Office Department. Passports are now produced by the Government Publishing Office. Other early items produced by the BEP included various government debt instruments, such as interest-bearing notes, <b>refunding</b> <b>certificates,</b> compound interest Treasury notes, and bonds. The production of postage stamps began in 1894, and for almost the next century the BEP was the sole producer of postage stamps in the country.|$|R
5000|$|Interest bearing notes {{refers to}} a {{grouping}} of Civil War era paper money-related emissions of the US Treasury. The grouping includes the one- and two-year notes authorized by the Act of March 3, 1863, which bore interest at five percent per annum, were a legal tender at face value, and were issued in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. [...] The grouping also frequently includes the early civil war treasury notes which matured in either sixty days or two years and bore interest at six percent and the seven-thirties which matured in three years and bore interest at 7.3 percent—though both of these latter issues lacked legal tender status. [...] Reference texts used by currency collectors will also sometimes include compound interest treasury notes and <b>Refunding</b> <b>Certificates</b> in this grouping as well.|$|R

40|$|Se evaluó mediante estudio descriptivo, características y costos directos de infecciones respiratorias en 140 niños que asisten a sala cuna y jardín infantil. Se consignó diagnóstico, exámenes, fármacos, kinesioterapia, ausentismo, licencias médicas y hospitalización. Se analizan 202 eventos respiratorios en 90 niños: 75 (37, 1 %) en 30 lactantes y 127 (62, 8 %) en 60 pre-escolares. Hubo 61, 3 % de infecciones respiratorias bajas en lactantes versus 39, 4 % en pre-escolares (p The {{clinical}} {{profile of}} respiratory infections in 140 children who attend {{a day care}} center was described in a prospective study and direct costs were estimated. The costs estimation included diagnostic procedures, laboratory exams, drugs, kinesitherapy, parents' absenteeism, medical certificates and hospitalization. Two hundred and two respiratory episodes in 90 (64. 2 %) children, 75 (37. 1 %) in 30 infants and 127 (62. 8 %) in 60 toddlers were analyzed. There were 61. 3 % lower respiratory infections in infants versus 39. 4 % in toddlers (p < 0. 002). Antimicrobials were prescribed in 42. 6 % of the medical attendance. Infants represent major costs regarding medical consultations, kinesitherapy, laboratory tests and <b>refunds</b> for medical <b>certificates</b> or leave of absence (p < 0. 001). The mean global cost of a respiratory infection was US $ 129, 3 for infants and US $ 53, 0 for toddlers (p < 0. 001). This situation needs the development of an intervention progra...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we tried}} to {{evaluate}} the relative importance and find out the differences in consumer perceptions regarding service recovery strategies and the service provider in the distribution industry by using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) analysis method. Therefore in this study, {{we tried to}} systematize various recovery strategies which were considered very important during service failure process in the distribution industry and analyze the relative importance for each recovery strategy. We set hierarchy composed of four items of monetary, action-oriented, psychological, and assured level as primary selection criteria {{and a total of}} 16 items(indemnity, <b>refund,</b> gift, gift <b>certificate,</b> prompt resolution, exchange, manager support, explanation, apology, empathy, acknowledge, kindness, assortment, after service, manage subcontractor, manage employee) as secondary selection criteria. We tried to take one step further from the service sector and study service recovery strategies specialized in distributor services. This study suggests various implications about service recovery strategies of distributors. First, this study can provide practical implications – e. g. service recovery efforts should be applied differently depending on service channels. There is a perceptual difference with respect to the importance of the types of service recovery strategies between service provider and final customer. Second, we can find theoretical implications in terms of identifying the priorities through hierarchy design of new recovery strategies and comparison of each element from the classifications of the current fractional recovery strategies. We hope to help service providers to build more efficient recovery strategy system {{based on the results of}} this study...|$|R
