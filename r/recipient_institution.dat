40|$|Development aid is characterised by an {{inherently}} asymmetry between donor and <b>recipient</b> <b>institution.</b> Despite regular aid reforms and bold ambitions {{to change this}} relation, the asymmetry seems to persist. Inspired by post-development theory, and drawing on both a review of development theory and ethnographic fieldwork within the World Bank, this article argues that the lopsided aid-relations are continuously being reproduced through the formation of development expert knowledge within authoritative donor communities. Here, contemporary knowledge/power formations shape and are shaped by historically embedded structures and epistemic communities that benefit the donor's need for legible and operational knowledge, being knowledge of a particular kind. Hence, top-down approaches to development planning are reproduced {{at the cost of}} participatory, bottom-up ones, as per the official order and rhetoric...|$|E
40|$|Environmental policy {{emerged as}} a new European and global policy field within a very brief period of time during the early 1970 s.

This article argues that inter-organizational connections were crucial in this context: the exchange and transfer of policy ideas facilitated the rise of environmental policy across different international organizations. Focusing on the co-evolution of the polluter-pays principle enshrined almost simultaneously both at the OECD and the European Communities, the article assesses the multiple routes along which policy ideas travelled, the role inter-organizational competition played and the selective nature of transfers. While expertise played a key role in determining which policy concepts were selected, institutional conditions and the politics of the <b>recipient</b> <b>institution</b> determined how they were adapted to the respective new context...|$|E

40|$|Background: Every year, {{research}} specimens {{are shipped}} from one institution to another {{as well as}} across national boundaries. A significant proportion of specimens move from poor to rich countries. Concerns are always raised on the future usage of the stored specimens shipped to research insitutions from developing countries. Creating awareness of the processes is required in all sectors involved in biomedical research. To maintain fairness and respect in sharing biomedical specimens and reserch products requires safeguarding by Ethics Review Committees in both provider and recepient institutions. Training in basic ethical principles in research is required to all sectors involved in biomedical research so as to level up the research playing field. Discussion: By agreeing to provide specimens, individuals and communities from whom samples are collected would have placed their trust and all ensuing up-keep of the specimens to the researchers. In most collaborative set-up, laid down material transfer agreements are negotiated and signed before the shipment of specimens. Researchers, research ethics committees (RECs) and institutions in the countries of origin are supposed to serve as overseers of the specimens. There is need to advocate for honesty in sample handling and sharing, and also need to oversee any written commitments by researchers, RECs and institutions at source {{as well as in}} <b>recipient</b> <b>institution.</b> Commitments from source RECs and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and in the receiving institutio...|$|E

The VGN Proteomics Outreach project initiated {{in the fall of}} 2009 exposes undergraduates in the state of Vermont to proteomics technology using hands on laboratory experiences. We provide all teaching materials, laboratory materials and if necessary equipment for colleges within the state to run the module. All materials become the property of the <b>recipient</b> <b>institution</b> upon completion of the laboratory module. The undergraduate students learn about this cutting edge technology and gain new skills that we believe will help them with their future scientific careers. In this transferable module, students learn how protein expression in yeast is changed after exposure to oxidative stress or an environmental toxin. Total protein is then harvested and prepared for 2 D gel analysis. Proteins with differential expression are isolated from the 2 D gel and prepared for Mass Spectrometry at the UVM Proteomics Core Facility. The data is processed and students examine their results and use bioinformatics tools to further understand the biological implications of the results. The students than present their findings, describe specific proteins that showed differential expression. A hypothesis is presented explaining the biological relevance of the protein expression change along with a plan for testing this hypothesis.

40|$|Policies {{aimed at}} the {{mobility}} of researchers are an increasingly important element of science, technology and innovation policies. Perhaps the most visible indicator {{of this is the}} fact that ";Training and mobility of researchers"; is the most rapidly growing programme in the European Commission's FRAMEWORK Programme, with a 1994 - 98 budget of nearly 800 million ecu; this emphasis is also reflected in some national programmes. Interest in researcher mobility should be understood within the context of policies aimed at strengthening the effects of research-based knowledge. Mobility is considered important as a consequence of a growing recognition by policy makers that the use of research-based knowledge requires not only access to documented or codified knowledge, but also to tacit knowledges and skills. These tacit skills - uncodified, historically developed and usually localised - are in part a matter of knowing how to interpret, evaluate and transform codified knowledge to forms and contexts facilitating use. Thus the movement of researchers between institutions - and in particular from publicly-supported research insititutions to companies - is a way of enhancing scientific or technological competence which goes considerably further than simply ensuring that companies have access to formal and codified scientific knowledge. However mobility has a dual aspect. If it enhances the capabilities of recipient institutions, then presumably it has also some inhibiting impact on the 'delivering' institution. This might be particularly the case if research-based knowledge is produced not by individuals but by teams in which interactive learning and collective knowledge-creation is taking place: mobility will disrupt team activities, and thus the effects of mobility will {{take the form of a}} more or less complex trade-off between positive benefits accruing to a <b>recipient</b> <b>institution,</b> and negative impacts on the team from which the mobile researcher comes. This paper is in large part an exploration of this trade-off. ...|$|E

40|$|The natural {{resources}} of developing countries, {{particularly in a}} post-conflict situation, {{are the key to}} creating wealth, getting people back to work, and to improving security. However, public sector institutions like geological surveys, and government departments such as mines, energy and water ministries often need help in their vision to promote and sustainably develop their natural capital, as well as to protect the lives and livelihoods of people affected by development. Some have few physical resources, and a poorly trained and motivated workforce; others may be housed in buildings that have borne the brunt of prolonged fighting and a long period of neglect. In many developing countries, such institutions have a rather inward-facing colonial-style civil service culture that lacks the ability to liaise and engage with modern multinational investors. Unfortunately, donor organizations that seek to build the capacities of institutions do not build sufficient ‘project ownership’ and fail to incorporate into their plans the culture of the organization, or fail to integrate parts of multidisciplinary projects. Development projects supported are often perceived to reflect donor agendas rather than the needs of the <b>recipient</b> <b>institution.</b> Using experience in a number of developing country and post-conflict contexts, a methodology to plan and integrate capacity building has been developed, to help employees and management, and donor organizations, deal with these difficulties. Through training tuned to business need, institutions will develop appropriate IT and communication skills, {{while at the same time}} developing corporate understanding of the private sector, which is needed to interact successfully with it. Stakeholder analysis gauges the organization’s strengths and weaknesses and ensures coordination of aid, which takes account of the local social, political and business context. The methodology will also establish a system allowing regular cyclical business/training review, so that the institutions can adapt to further change. ...|$|E

It analyzes the efficacy and constitutionality of the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Congress 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to use its powers of the purse to control objectionable online content in the very institutions it has used to promote equality of Internet access, particularly for children. The article looks first at Congress 2 ̆ 7 s early attempts to directly control categories of online speech through {{the passage of the}} Communications Decency Act (CDA) and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), two statutes that proved to be so insensitive to classic First Amendment principles that they were essentially dead on arrival at the courthouse. The article then focuses on Congress 2 ̆ 7 s strategic shift away from direct proscriptions of online content and toward control of Internet speech indirectly through the use of its spending power. CIPA attempts to regulate online content by making the distribution of Universal Service Fund (E-Rate) and related federal school and library technology funds contingent upon the <b>recipient</b> <b>institution</b> 2 ̆ 7 s agreement to place filtering software on all Internet-accessible computers. The {{article examines the}} history of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s use of its spending power as a regulatory tool, and takes issue with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s description of CIPA 2 ̆ 7 s funding conditions as a routine use of that power immune from First Amendment constraints. Arguing that public libraries are limited public forums subsidized by the government {{for the express purpose of}} facilitating broad private expression, the article recommends judicial review of CIPA based on the same strict scrutiny principles used by the Supreme Court in Rosenberger and Velazquez to invalidate similar government funding decisions that forced viewpoint and content-based regulation of private speech. The article contends that Congress has not met its burden under strict scrutiny of showing that Internet filtering in public libraries is constitutionally necessary to achieve the government 2 ̆ 7 s interests in protecting children, and argues that software filters cannot possibly be applied without compromising a great deal of library patrons 2 ̆ 7 constitutionally protected online speech. The article concludes that, stripped of the facade of an innocent use of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s spending power, the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Internet Protection Act is merely the Computer Decency Act and the Child Online Protection Act in disguise - yet another clumsy congressional attempt to censor Internet content without sufficient concern for the damage it will do to the First Amendment rights of library patrons, many of whom use libraries as the only place where they can gain access to the incredible wealth of diverse information available on the Internet...|$|E

Given the need to select cases where the type of interaction, which was the object of study, were taking place, we took as basis the Notice of Financial Assistance released by the Visiting Scholar Foundation Araucaria Support Scientific and Technological Development of Paraná.
