25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for first test flights in 2011, the independent {{analysis by the}} Augustine Commission found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an unconstrained budget. The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated <b>recurring</b> <b>cost</b> of almost $1 billion per flight. However, later financial analysis in March 2010 showed that the Ares I would have cost $1 billion or more to operate per flight had the Ares I flown just once a year. If the Ares I system were flown multiple times a year the marginal costs could have fallen to as low as $138 million per launch. In December 2011, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden testified to congress that the Ares I would cost $4–4.5 billion a year, and $1.6 billion per flight. The Ares I marginal cost was predicted {{to have been a}} fraction of the Shuttle's marginal costs even had it flown multiple times per year. By comparison, the cost of launching three astronauts on a manned Russian Soyuz is $153 million.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of consumer-level digital cameras is the low <b>recurring</b> <b>cost,</b> as users need not purchase photographic film. Processing costs {{may be reduced}} or even eliminated. Digicams tend also to be easier to carry and to use, than comparable film cameras. They more easily adapt to modern use of pictures. Some, particularly those that are smartphones, can send their pictures directly to e-mail or web pages or other electronic distribution.|$|E
30|$|<b>Recurring</b> <b>costs</b> {{that are}} not part of the IGS system include the cost of the rigid {{external}} distraction (RED) system (KLS Martin, Jacksonville, FL) and the stereolithographic model (SLM), which totaled $ 14, 500. The hospital stay accrued to $ 33, 144 in the pediatric intensive care unit and $ 8, 384 on the pediatric floor. The sum of these expenditures ($ 56, 028) far exceeds the <b>recurring</b> <b>costs</b> of the IGS. The financial benefit of improved clinical outcomes or decreased complications is unknown at this point—ideally randomized case controlled studies would help in answering such questions although it would be impossible to blind such studies.|$|R

40|$|Until the 1970 s, it was commonplace for {{institutions}} and governments to purchase equipment based on lowest initial (first) <b>costs.</b> <b>Recurring</b> <b>costs</b> such as operational, maintenance, and energy costs often {{were not considered}} in the purchase decision. If an agency wanted to buy something, it published specifications and requested bids from several manufacturers. Often, the lowest bidder who met the specifications won the job, with no consideration given to the economic life of the equipment or yearly <b>recurring</b> <b>costs</b> such as energy and maintenance costs. The practice of purchasing based on lowest initial costs probably did not make good economic sense prior to 1970, and it certainly does not make good sense now. The wise person will consider all costs and benefits associated with a purchase, both initial and post-purchase, {{in order to make}} procurement decisions that are valid {{for the life of the}} equipment. This describes a method of financial analysis that considers all pertinent costs: life cycle costing (LCC) ...|$|R

50|$|American heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle. The Advanced Launch System (ALS), was a US Air Force funded {{effort in}} 1987-1989 {{to develop a}} flexible, modular, heavy-lift, high rate space launch vehicle that could deliver {{payloads}} to earth orbit at a tenth the cost of existing boosters. Such a vehicle was seen as essential to supporting {{the launch of the}} huge numbers of satellites required for deployment of the ‘Star Wars' ballistic missile defense system. With the end of the Cold War, Star Wars was abandoned. The projected launch rate without the Star Wars requirement could never pay back the $15 billion non <b>recurring</b> <b>cost,</b> and the program was ended.|$|E

50|$|Launch {{costs for}} low Earth orbit (LEO) range from $4500 to $8500 per pound of payload ($10,000-$19,000 / kg). Reusable SSTO {{vehicles}} offer {{the promise of}} reduced launch expenses by eliminating <b>recurring</b> <b>costs</b> associated with hardware replacement inherent in expendable launch systems.

5000|$|Power is {{the largest}} <b>recurring</b> <b>cost</b> to the user of a data center. [...] A power and cooling analysis, also {{referred}} to as a thermal assessment, measures the relative temperatures in specific areas as well as the capacity of the cooling systems to handle specific ambient temperatures. A power and cooling analysis can help to identify hot spots, over-cooled areas that can handle greater power use density, the breakpoint of equipment loading, the effectiveness of a raised-floor strategy, and optimal equipment positioning (such as AC units) to balance temperatures across the data center. Power cooling density is a measure of how much square footage the center can cool at maximum capacity.|$|E
50|$|The major {{drawback}} to this service was {{the reliance on}} the phone company or vendor partner to manage (in most cases) the PBX or key telephone system. This resulted in a residual, <b>recurring</b> <b>cost</b> to customers. Over time, the PBX became more privatized, and internal staff members were hired to manage these systems. This was typically done by companies that could afford to bring this skill in-house and thereby reduce the requirement to notify the phone company or their local PBX vendor each time a change was required in the system. This increasing privatization triggered {{the development of more}} powerful software that increased the usability and manageability of the system.|$|E

The $10 million prize purse was promised to the first team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a <b>recurring</b> <b>cost</b> of no more than $1,000 per genome.|$|E
