5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nomination</b> {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which {{proved to be a}} major critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support of national unity. Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E

5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nomination.</b> Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nomination.</b> The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>nomination</b> on May 18, 1860, {{awaiting}} {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeds to win the presidency.|$|E
