40|$|The tensors {{considered}} {{in this paper}} are the linear relationships between certain pairs of physical vector quantities which may be described by 3 x 3 symmetric matrices. Such a linear relationship may well vary from point to point in a non-homogeneous medium. From measurements at a given point in the medium, the least squares estimates of the com-ponents of the tensor at that point are obtained; from these the tensor's principal axes may be estimated. On {{the assumption that the}} errors of measurement are small and normally distributed, confidence intervals for the lengths of the principal axes are derived, together with confidence regions on the unit sphere for the directions of these axes. Tests for equality of pairs of principal axes, for isotropy, and for comparing the tensors at two or more points are given. In certain common experimental situations, a design for this work may be represented by a set of points on the unit sphere. If such a <b>design</b> is <b>rotatable</b> (Box & Hunter, 1957), the estimates have optimum properties, and the confidence intervals and regions take on particularly simple forms.

Angular distortion {{is a major problem}} and most pronounced among different types of distortion in butt welded plates. The extent of distortion depends on the welding process control parameters. The important process control parameters chosen for study are gun angle (θ), welding speed (V), plate length (L), welding current (I) and gas flow rate (Q). The experiments are conducted based on five factor five level central composite <b>rotatable</b> <b>designs</b> with full replication technique. A mathematical model was developed correlating the process parameters and the angular distortion. The developed model is checked for the adequacy based on ANOVA analysis and accuracy of prediction by confirmatory test. The optimization of process parameters was done using genetic algorithms (GA).

Experiments were carried out following central composite <b>rotatable</b> <b>designs</b> (CCRD), {{as a function of}} the initial water activity of the biocatalyst (a,), initial butyric acid concentration (A) and ethanol:acid molar ratio (MR) in the organic medium. Ester production increased with increasing a, of the biocatalysts, probably due to the hydrophilicity of both substrates in contrast with the hydrophobicity of the product, which is released to the bulk medium. Thus, for each biocatalyst (a(w) = 0. 98) another CCRD was performed as a function of A and MR. With both preparations, higher conversions (> 95 %) were observed for low A values. For the "FHP 2002 (TM) " system, a maximum ester production of 0. 23 M is expected, after 18 -h reaction, at initial 0. 35 M A and 1. 51 MR, corresponding to a(w) of 0. 95 and 0. 84 M A and 1. 65 M ethanol in lipase microenvironment.
