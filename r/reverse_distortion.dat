40|$|Picornavirus RNAs are {{translated}} by an unusual mechanism of internal ribosome entry {{that requires a}} substantial segment of the viral 5 '-untranslated region, generally known as the internal ribosome entry segment (IRES), and in some circumstances may require cellular trans-acting proteins, particularly polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). It is shown here that for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), the PTB dependence of IRES function in vitro is determined partly {{by the nature of}} the reporter cistron, and more especially by the size of an A-rich bulge in the IRES. With a wild-type EMCV IRES (which has a bulge of 6 As), translation is effectively independent of PTB provided the IRES is driving the synthesis of EMCV viral polyprotein. With an enlarged (7 A) bulge and heterologous reporters, translation is highly dependent on PTB. Intermediate levels of PTB dependence are seen with a 7 A bulge IRES driving viral polyprotein synthesis or a wild-type (6 A) bulge IRES linked to a heterologous reporter. None of these parameters influenced the binding of PTB to the high-affinity site in the IRES. These results argue that PTB is not an essential and universal internal initiation factor, but, rather, that when it is required, its binding to the IRES helps to maintain the appropriate higher-order structure and to <b>reverse</b> <b>distortions</b> caused, for example, by an enlarged A-rich bulge...|$|R

40|$|Diffusion-weighted {{magnetic}} resonance imaging is a key investigation technique in modern neuroscience. In clinical settings, diffusion-weighted imaging and its extension to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are usually performed applying the technique of echo-planar imaging (EPI). EPI is the commonly available ultrafast acquisition technique for single-shot acquisition with spatial encoding in a Cartesian system. A drawback of these sequences is their high sensitivity against small perturbations of the magnetic field, caused, e. g., by differences in magnetic susceptibility of soft tissue, bone and air. The resulting magnetic field inhomogeneities thus cause geometrical distortions and intensity modulations in diffusion-weighted images. This complicates the fusion with anatomical T 1 - or T 2 -weighted MR images obtained with conventional spin- or gradient-echo images and negligible distortion. In order to limit the degradation of diffusion-weighted MR data, we present here a variational approach based on a reference scan pair with reversed polarity of the phase- and frequency-encoding gradients and hence <b>reversed</b> <b>distortion.</b> The key novelty is a tailored nonlinear regularization functional to obtain smooth and diffeomorphic transformations. We incorporate the physical distortion model into a variational image registration framework and derive an accurate and fast correction algorithm. We evaluate the applicability of our approach to distorted DTI brain scans of six healthy volunteers. For all datasets, the automatic correction algorithm considerably reduced the image degradation. We show that, after correction, fusion with T 1 - or T 2 -eighted images {{can be obtained by}} a simple rigid registration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improvement due to the novel regularization scheme. Most importantly, we show that it provides meaningful, i. e. diffeomorphic, geometric transformations, independent of the actual choice of the regularization parameters...|$|R
40|$|For most {{watermarking}} methods, {{preserving the}} synchronization between the watermark {{embedded in a}} digital data (image, audio or video) and the watermark detector {{is critical to the}} success of the watermark detection process. Many digital watermarking attacks exploit this fact by disturbing the synchronization of the watermark and the watermark detector, and thus disabling proper watermark detection without having to actually remove the watermark from the data. Some techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal with this problem. Most of these techniques employ methods to <b>reverse</b> the <b>distortion</b> caused by the attack and then try to detect the watermark from the repaired data. In this paper, we propose a watermarking technique that is not sensitive to synchronization. This technique uses a structured noise pattern and embeds the watermark payload into the geometrical structure of the embedded pattern...|$|R
40|$|Distortions are {{ubiquitous}} in nature. Under perturbations such as stresses, fields or other changes, a physical system reconfigures by following a path from one state to another; this path, often {{a collection of}} atomic trajectories, describes a distortion. Here we introduce an antisymmetry operation called <b>distortion</b> reversal that <b>reverses</b> a <b>distortion</b> pathway. The symmetry of a distortion pathway is then uniquely defined by a distortion group; {{it has the same}} form as a magnetic group that involves time reversal. Given its isomorphism to magnetic groups, distortion groups could have a commensurate impact in the study of distortions, as the magnetic groups have had in the study of magnetic structures. Distortion symmetry has important implications for a range of phenomena such as structural and electronic phase transitions, diffusion, molecular conformational changes, vibrations, reaction pathways and interface dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fast method of correcting for optical distortion in head-mounted displays (HMDs). Since the distorted display surface in an HMD is not rectilinear, {{the shape and}} location of the graphics window used with the display must be chosen carefully, and some corrections made to the predistortion model. A distortion correction might be performed with optics that <b>reverse</b> the <b>distortion</b> caused by HMD lenses, but such optics can be expensive and offer a correction for only one specific HMD. Integer incremental methods or a lookup table {{might be used to}} calculate the correction, but an I/O bottleneck makes this impractical in software. Instead, a texture map may be defined that approximates the required optical correction. Recent equipment advances allow undistorted images to be input into texture mapping hardware at interactive rates. Built in filtering handles predistortion aliasing artifacts...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to calculating the inverse of radial distortions. The method presented here provides a model of <b>reverse</b> radial <b>distortion,</b> currently modeled by a polynomial expression, that proposes another polynomial expression where the new coefficients are a function of the original ones. After describing the state of the art, the proposed method is developed. It is based on a formal calculus involving a power series used to deduce a recursive formula for the new coefficients. We present several implementations of this method and describe the experiments conducted to assess the validity of the new approach. Such an approach, non-iterative, using another polynomial expression, able to be deduced from the first one, can actually be interesting in terms of performance, reuse of existing software, or bridging between different existing software tools that do not consider distortion from the same point of view...|$|R

It is usually done in the digital domain by a software algorithm, as part of a suite of microscope image processing techniques.

Early Hubble Space Telescope images were distorted by a flawed mirror and could be sharpened by deconvolution.|$|R
40|$|Modern CCD {{cameras are}} usually {{capable of a}} spatial {{accuracy}} greater than 1 / 50 of the pixel size. However, such accuracy is not easily attained due to various error sources that can affect the image formation process. Current calibration methods typically assume that the observa-tions are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean independent and identically distributed ran-dom noise in the observed image coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the mapping between the 3 -D coordinates and the image coordinates. In general, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results to be less accurate than expected. In this paper, a cal-ibration procedure for precise 3 -D computer vision applications is described. It introduces bias correction for circular control points and a non-recursive method for <b>reversing</b> the <b>distortion</b> model. The accuracy analysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the theoretical accuracy are discussed.

A spiral pre-stressed concrete box girder bridge in Chongqing is analyzed by using nonlinear finite element program ANSYS. The five different curved bridge models under weight and prestressing were created and the sameness and difference among them are gained and compared by numerical simulation. The results showed: 1. In five different situations, the box girder all occurs the vertical, radial and longitudinal deformation, among which vertical deformation is the main. At the same time, the box section occurred <b>reverse</b> and <b>distortion,</b> and the whole body of the beam rolls out. 2. The value of vertical displacement of mid-span of continuous curved box girder bridges relates with the horizontal radius.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{implement}} a thorough method for quantifying the errors introduced to frame-based neurosurgical stereotactic procedures {{by the use of}} MRI. Chang & Fitzpatrick's <b>reversed</b> gradient <b>distortion</b> correction method was used, in combination with a phantom, to measure these errors. Spatial distortion in MR images of between 1 mm and 2 mm was measured. Further analysis showed that this typically introduced an additional error in the coordinate of the actual treatment point of 0. 7 mm. The implications of this are discussed. The main source of distortion in the MR images used for stereotaxis was found to be the head ring. A comparison between imaging sequences and MR scanners revealed that the spatial distortion depends mainly on the bandwidth per pixel of the sequence rather than other differences in the imaging sequences. By comparison with a phase map distortion correction technique, the imaging parameters required to allow successful distortion correction with the reversed gradient method were identified. The most important was the use of full Fourier spin echo acquisitions. The reversed gradient correction method was applied to two contemporary EPI techniques. Considerable improvement was seen in the production of ADC maps after the images had been corrected for distortion. The method also was shown to be valid in application to BOLD fMRI data...|$|R
40|$|In some {{applications}} such as real-time video applications, watermark detection needs to be performed in real time. To address image watermark robustness against geometric transformations such as the combination of rotation, scaling, translation and/or cropping (RST), many prior works choose exhaustive search method or template matching method to find the RST <b>distortion</b> parameters, then <b>reverse</b> the <b>distortion</b> to resynchronize the watermark. These methods typically impose huge computation burden because the search space is typically a multiple dimensional space. Some other prior works choose to embed watermarks in an RST invariant domain to meet the real time requirement. But it might be difficult to construct such an RST invariant domain. Zernike moments are useful tools in pattern recognition and image watermarking due to their orthogonality and rotation invariance property. In this paper, we propose a fast watermark resynchronization method based on Zernike moments, which requires only search over scaling factor to combat RST geometric distortion, thus significantly reducing the computation load. We apply the proposed method to circularly symmetric watermarking. According to Plancherel's Theorem and the rotation invariance property of Zernike moments, the rotation estimation only requires performing DFT on Zernike moments correlation value once. Thus for RST attack, we can estimate both rotation angle and scaling factor by searching for the scaling factor to find the overall maximum DFT magnitude mentioned above. With the estimated rotation angle and scaling factor parameters, the watermark can b...|$|R
40|$|Retirement {{planning}} {{has attracted}} considerable attentions from retirees, finance {{industry and the}} government. Its significance lies in the protection against individual longevity risk. As a result, optimal portfolio selection problem in a market with an-nuities has been extensively studied.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} the distribution of ryanodine receptors, L-type Ca 2 + channels, calsequestrin, Na+/Ca 2 + exchangers, and voltage-gated Na+ channels in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Enzymatically dissociated cells were fixed and dual-labeled with specific antibodies using standard immunocytochemistry protocols. Images were deconvolved to <b>reverse</b> the optical <b>distortion</b> produced by wide-field microscopes equipped with high numerical aperture objectives. Every image showed a well-ordered array of fluorescent spots, indicating {{that all of the}} proteins examined were distributed in discrete clusters throughout the cell. Mathematical analysis of the images revealed that dyads contained only ryanodine receptors, L-type Ca 2 + channels, and calsequestrin, and excluded Na+/Ca 2 + exchangers and voltage-gated Na+ channels. The Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger and voltage-gated Na+ channels were distributed largely within the t-tubules, on both transverse and axial elements, but were not co-localized. The t-tubule can therefore be subdivided into at least three structural domains; one of coupling (dyads), one containing the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger, and one containing voltage-gated Na+ channels. We conclude that if either the slip mode conductance of the Na+ channel or the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger are to contribute to the contractile force, the fuzzy space must extend outside of the dyad...|$|R

Overall forward mode fan performance is presented at each rotor pitch angle setting with conventional flow pressure ratio efficiency fan maps, distinguishing the performance characteristics of the fan bypass and fan core regions.

40|$|Single-shot {{femtosecond}} spectroscopy {{has been}} developed and employed {{for the study of}} phase transitions of solid-state materials. Using two crossed echelons, a two dimensional spatial delay gradient was generated across a single probe pulse profile. This novel scheme enables us to monitor irreversible change in solids by acquiring many time-resolved data points with a single laser pulse. With the integration with a non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) and a conventional pump-probe instrument, ultrafast dynamics of coherent lattice vibrations and photo-induced phase transitions were examined in two different systems. Ultrafast dynamics such as coherent lattice vibrations and bond softening were investigated for Bi thin films and bulk single crystals. Depending on the thickness, transient reflectivity was changed significantly. The variations are ascribed to different electronic structures possibly originating from quantum confinement. Bond softening exhibits a strong thickness dependence due to hot carrier dynamics {{as well as to the}} different electronic structures. At high pump fluences, no phonon oscillations were observed suggesting a phase transition to liquid or to a higher symmetry crystalline phase (<b>reverse</b> Peierls <b>distortion).</b> Together with thermal modeling, double pump measurements reveal nonthermal melting occurring in bulk and thin Bi films. A higher threshold fluence for nonthermal melting is observed in bulk bismuth as compared to thin films, suggesting ultrafast carrier dynamics such as ballistic transport. In addition to nonthermal effects, thermal effects such as inelastic electron-phonon scattering and nonradiative recombination play a crucial role in melting and cooling at later times after nonthermal melting takes place. A quasi one-dimensional platinum iodide complex showed strong oscillations in reflectivity which are attributed to oscillatory motions of wave packets on a selftrapped exciton (STE) potential surface., As optical excitation increased, electron transfer from Pt 2 + to an adjacent Pt 4 + occurred over a wider range of lattice sites and weakened the oscillations. Above a certain pump fluence, oscillations disappeared completely indicating that the mixed valence, charge density wave state changed to monovalent, Mott-Hubbard phase. The reverse phase transition, i. e., from the MottHubbard phase to the charge density wave state began within 3 ps of the optical pump. by Taeho Shin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In actual mobile radio systems, {{multipath}} conditions pose a problem, as {{the channel}} becomes frequency dependent. This point is especially critical {{in case of}} high frequency transmissions with very high data rate and high error performance, such as defined in the IEEE 802. 15. 3 c which is an emerging 60 -GHz standard supporting data rates of multi-giga bits per second (multi-Gbps) for short-range indoor applications. The deployment of such high speed wireless transmission has been very difficult throughout history mainly by two critical factors: {{the first one was}} the lack of wide enough spectrum and the second one is the high cost of high frequency circuits and devices. However, this trend is changing to the point that not too long ago, the substantial unlicensed spectrum became available at the millimeter-wave band of 60 -GHz. Also, the advancement in technology drives the cost of 60 -GHz circuits and devices much lower than in the past making possible its use for high definition audio and video wireless transmissions. In order to overcome the transmission channel issues, it is necessary to include a channel equalizer in the receiver, which must estimate the channel impulse response and make some operations to transform the frequency dependent channel to a flat channel. Nevertheless, the equalizer technology will depend on three different factors: first one the physical layer (PHY) technique under consideration for multi-Gbps Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) which basically could be orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE); second, the channel impulse response estimation carried out {{in order to determine the}} channel transfer function H(f), existing several methods to obtain an estimation; and third, the used equalization method and structure in order to <b>reverse</b> all <b>distortions</b> produced by the channel. This Master thesis has been carry out during an Erasmus program in the Technische Universitat of Braunchweig, Germany, and it is the first part of a whole European project for the study, analysis and deployment of the IEEE 802. 15. 3 c standard for wireless communications with very high data rate and high error performance in the 60 -GHz band. According to the instructions and requirements defined by professor Thomas Kürner which was in charge of this project, this thesis include: first, a theoretical study of all the different propagation effects which could affect a wireless communication channel in order to run not only the simulations presented in this thesis but also the future simulations; second, the development of a model in Matlab/Simulink that will be useful to carry out all the project simulations (taken into account the specifications collected in IEEE 802. 15. 3 c standard); third, the results of the carried simulations for Single Carrier Channel estimation and equalization by using two different equalization methods in the frequency domain: Zero Forcing and Minimum Mean Square Error equalization. Taking this into account, the thesis is organized as follows. Section I is dedicated to the study of all the different propagation effects and problems which affects a wireless communication transmissions; In Section II, technologies and Physical Layer Modes are described attending the IEEE 802. 15. 3 c in order to learn its different characteristics for the subsequent channel estimation; Section III is devoted to channel estimation and equalization methods description; estimation and equalization methods are selected in order to carry out the simulations in Section IV; finally, in Section V the developed system simulator as well as the obtained simulation results are presented after implementation of Zero Forcing and Minimum Mean Square Error equalization methods in Matlab/Simulink...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} policy, and the statutory and regulatory impact of spatial planning on the land reform programme with emphasis on the land reform settlement plan (LSRP) of the Amathole District Municipality (ADM). There is a brief historical overview {{of the effect of}} the policy of spatial segregation in both rural and urban areas of the ADM. This study demonstrates, inter alia, the challenges faced by the ADM in both consolidating and physically integrating communities that were hitherto divided across racial lines. The critical question is whether the ADM has the ability to produce a Spatial Development Framework (SDF), which will be responsive {{to the needs of the}} region and serve as a catalyst in <b>reversing</b> the physical <b>distortions</b> caused by the land-planning legislation of the apartheid past. The greatest challenge lies in meeting the developmental aspirations of the Development Facilitation Act, 1995, the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, 2000 and the National Spatial Development Perspective, 2003. Chapter 1 deals with the purpose, research problem and the method of research, as well as the definition of terms used in this research and literature review. Chapter 2 deals with the evolution of central themes of spatial planning and land reform, spatial development plans and integrated development plans (IDPs), the alignment of Amathole SDF and Eastern Cape Spatial Development Plan and the co-ordination of spatial frameworks. Chapter 3 deals with the composition of the ADM and the evolution of the LRSP, as well as land-tenure reform programmes impacting on the Amathole Municipality region. This chapter analyses the settlement plan against spatial planning legislation, the issue of institutional arrangements and mechanisms of consolidated local planning processes. Chapter 5 deals with the thorny issue of participation of traditional leaders in municipal planning and the government’s land-reform programme. Despite the existence of legislation in this regard, implementation seems to pose some difficulties. This chapter also deals with the co-operative governance framework. Chapter 6 is a concluding chapter dealing with the gaps discovered in the Amathole Municipality in the light of existing legislation. Reference to cases is made to demonstrate the challenges confronting the ADM. One notable aspect is the issue of urban-rural dichotomy and how the two worlds are positioned in their competition for the use of space. It is evident from this research that the post- 1994 policy and legislative framework and implementation machinery lacks capacity to change the current form of the apartheid city-planning paradigm, something which impacts immensely on the sustainability of the current human-settlement development programmes. Population dynamics in terms of migration are hugely driven by search for employment opportunities and better services.
