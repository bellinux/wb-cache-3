5000|$|Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP) is a British Military {{capability}} {{introduced in}} early 2015. [...] The capability was developed {{as part of}} a UK specific requirement to deliver a highly mobile local fused <b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> capability to land component and formation headquarters. It's development was led by Lockheed Martin (UK) along with a number of other defence contractors, including SAAB.|$|E
50|$|Linesman and L1 as {{originally}} conceived never became operational. It went operational {{in the early}} 1970s but only in producing and disseminating the overall <b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture,</b> the General Situation Display and the Higher Formation display until 1984. The interception side was only ever used in the training role of the School of Fighter Control. The L1 also got 3 more computers (Elliott Argus 500s) as the <b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> Dissemination System (RAPiDS) and these disseminated the RAP out from the L1 in a more advanced format. Though the concepts remained very valid, the technology used to route the radar signals was out of date long before the system was completed. Having the control of aircraft centralised in one place also put it at high risk. A change of plan moved the interception roles out {{to two of the}} main radar stations where the RAP from the L1 was used to monitor the airspace while the Fighter Controllers then used the Standby Local Early Warning and Control Systems (SLEWC based on Elliott 920C computers) to control Interceptions.|$|E
50|$|By {{integrating}} the Low Level <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> (LLAP) with both VSHORAD-missiles systems into the wireless GBADS-network, which is JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) capable, {{they can bring}} the Recognized <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> (RAP) to the SWPs.

5000|$|The {{original}} central {{computer system}} for Linesman consisted of 21 Plessey XL4 and XL6 germanium computers all integrated together as the Radar Data Processing System (RDPS). These computers all worked together using random highways {{that were a}} very early version of a Local Area Network. The 21 RDPS computers then worked to assemble the <b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> (RAP) which covered an area 1024 by 1024 nautical miles over the British Isles. 3 more Ferranti Argus 500 computers were added to this as the <b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> Dissemination System (RAPIDS) which also extended the RAP to 1900 by 1900 nautical miles. Long range early warning data was also fed through data links to and from NATO and French radars sites. There were {{many parts of the}} system that were there but had never been commissioned. There were 3 more computers that would have integrated the processing of filed civilian flight plans. There were Data links that would have been used to integrate the Bloodhound missile's computer systems as well as a link to Fylingdales.|$|E
50|$|CIMACT is a EUROCONTROL software, that is {{combining}} and merging {{civil and}} military data sources (mainly surveillance and flight plan data) into a correlated Air Situation Display (also known as <b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture</b> (RAP) to enhance situational awareness and civil-military coordination.

50|$|The {{core system}} {{principle}} {{was to take}} the input from all sensors and enable 'The Hub Concept' where the system resources were reorganized to provide an air data processing system. This produced an RAP, (<b>Recognised</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Picture)</b> whereby all aircraft and air movements could identified and tracked within the UK air space. Intercepts etc. were undertaken at other sites using the information feeds from L1. It continued in operation until the late 1970s, early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{is equipped}} with the Rapier Field Standard C SHORAD missile system providing local area air defence to land formations and airfields.
