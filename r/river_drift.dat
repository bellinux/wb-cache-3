As life was ruled by the idea of death; so was fact conquered by dream, and all realities hastened to lose themselves in symbols; all gods rushed to merge their identity in the sun, as moths fly towards the flame of a candle. This spectacle of a race obedient to the dead and bowing down before the beasts, this procession of gods that were their own fathers and members together in Ra, wakened the interest of the Greeks, who were even more excited by the mystery of extreme age that hid the beginnings of Egypt. Full of their own memories and legends of tribal movements, of migrations, of invasions, the Greeks acknowledged themselves children of yesterday in face of a secular empire with an origin so remote that it was scarcely guessed at in the conjectures of fable. Egypt presented to them, as to us, the spectacle of antique civilisation without a known beginning. The spade of to-day reveals no more than the traditions of two thousand years ago.

After a Voortrekker retaliation at the Battle of Blood River, Dingane was deposed and his place taken by Mpande. Panda seceded the land south of the Tugela River to the settlers which included the area that was to become Estcourt. The Voortrekkers set up the Natalia Republic, but after the Battle of Congella in 1842, they abandoned their settlements and moved into the interior, leaving Natalia to the British who established the Colony of Natal. Thus Natal acquired an English-speaking rather than an Afrikaans-speaking settler community and Estcourt, being so close to the Tugela River become a frontier outpost.

Although confirmed colonized areas are all located in the state of Sao Paulo, the invasive risk analysis showed that P. clarkii is a potential highly invasive species for Brazil.

40|$|Amphidromy is a {{diadromous}} {{life history}} pattern, common in tropical and subtropical freshwater caridean shrimps, in which adults live, breed and spawn small-sized embryos in freshwater but have extended larval development (ELD) in marine waters. Most completely freshwater species spawn large embryos with either direct or abbreviated larval development (ALD). An important benefit of amphidromy is dispersal among river systems via marine larvae, which increases {{their access to}} alternative habitats. Thus, amphidromous species have much broader geographic distributions than closely related completely freshwater ones with ALD. ALD and freshwater ELD species appear to have evolved from amphidromous species with marine ancestors. Delivery of larvae to the sea in many amphidromous species is accomplished by upstream hatching and <b>river</b> <b>drift</b> of larvae to the sea. In other species, the females themselves apparently migrate down to marine waters to spawn. After development, the postlarvae must find a river mouth and migrate upstream to the adult habitat. Migrations occur at night, with juveniles swimming or crawling along the river or stream bank. Larvae are released during the wet or flood season of the year, while juvenile migrations take place during the dry or low-flow season. Both larval downstream and juvenile upstream movements are disrupted by human impacts such as dams {{and other forms of}} river control. Although much {{progress has been made in}} understanding the evolution and ecology of amphidromy, research is still needed on all aspects of shrimp amphidromy, especially in Latin America with its diverse freshwater shrimp fauna...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Almost {{sixty years}} after the initial mapping of {{extensive}} Quaternary sediments {{along the coast of}} St. George’s Bay, Newfoundland, a revised stratigraphic section is presented which identifies five main sediment types (diamicton, mud, sand, gravelly sand, gravel) and their stratigraphical position along 39 km of coastline from High-lands to Flat Bay. Most of the sediments overlying a basal till (St. George’s <b>River</b> <b>Drift)</b> are interpreted to have been deposited in an ice-proximal to ice-distal glaciomarine environment by debris flow, underflow, current flow, or suspen-sion settling, and capped by glaciofluvial outwash (Bay St. George Delta). For the most part, sections display a rela-tively simple deglacial sequence in a shallowing marine to fluvial environment. Where hummocky ridges intersect the coast, however, the sedimentary sequences are more complex and the variability in depositional style is typical of grounding line fans at a tidewater glacier margin. The occurrence of an upper diamicton or coarse gravels (Robinsons Head Drift) was generally observed only in grounding-line fan sequences and is interpreted here in the context of mar-ginal fluctuations of a quasi-stable tidewater glacier, and not necessarily a climatically-induced readvance of a land-based ice margin (Robinsons Head readvance). Radiocarbon dates on marine shells from varied stratigraphic positions and sedimentary units suggest rapid deposition occurred in a glaciomarine environment between 14 and 13 ka BP.

In the lower Chikugo River, Coilia nasus, which ascends to the river from the sea for spawning has been caught in large quantities with drift nets, {{and is one of the}} important fishes for the fisheries in this <b>river.</b> <b>Drift</b> net samplings, environmental observations and analysis of the daily catch by a fisherman were made at the lower Chikugo River in 1977 and 1978 in order to clarify {{the ecology of the}} ascending population of this species. The results obtained are as follows: 1) The ascending activity of Coilia nasus is influenced by increases of the water level from the neap tide to the spring tide and the amount of flowing water in the tidal compartment. 2) The amount of the ascending fishes increases in the afternoon and in ebb tide of daytime. 3) This fish in the lower reaches swims mainly in the surface layer. Ascending to the upper reaches, the swimming layer of the fish changes to the bottom layer. 4) Coilia nasus ascended for the spawning to the upper reaches in a May-August period is 160 - 410 mm in total length. 5) According to the age determination based on the otolith reading, this species attains 182 mm TL in a year, 260 mm TL in two years and 324 mm TL in three years. The spawning population consists of two and three year old males and over two year old female. 6) Gonadosomatic index (GSI) of the female collected in the spawning area is of a high value from May to mid-June. Main spawning period is deduced to be in mid-June. 7) The female in the spawning area occupies 10 - 35 % in sex ratio. It seems that one female spawns with 2 - 20 males in a group. 有明海及び筑後川の重要種であるエツの保護と増殖をはかる目的で本種の生活史を通した分布,移動,回遊,成長を明らかにするとともに成熟,産卵,卵内発生及び資源量の推定の研究を行っている. 本報では 1977 及び 1978 年に筑後川の感潮域において行った流し網,投網の試験操業と漁業者の漁獲仕切台帳によって遡上群の生態の一部を明らかにした. 1) エツの遡上には潮汐と河川流量が関連し,小潮から大潮にかけての流況や流量の増加などの水位の増加変動を伴う要因が大きく影響する. 2) 遡上量は経時的には昼間の午後に,とくにその内,下げ潮時に多い. 3) 河川内におけるエツの遡上分布は下流部で表層に,上流の産卵場に遡上するに従って底層となる. 4) 遡上魚の大きさは全長 160 ～ 410 mmで,産卵場となる感潮域の上流部には産卵期の 5 ～ 7 月に多く出現するが, 8 月以後は全長 200 mm以上のものは減少し,当歳魚を含む全長 200 mm未満のものが出現する. 耳右による年齢査定の結果,エツは 1 歳で全長 182 mm, 2 歳で全島 260 mm, 3 歳で全長 324 mmに達し,産卵親魚は雄で 2 ～ 3 歳,雌で 2 歳以上である. 5) 産卵域で採集した雌の生殖腺指数(GSl) は 5 ～ 6 月中旬に高く,以後に急減する傾向を示し,産卵の盛期は 6 月中旬と考えられる. また,性比に偏りがあり,雌 1 尾に対し,雄 2 ～ 20 尾の群による産卵が推察された...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} drift of grayling fry in two large Norwegian inland rivers. Previous studies of migrations and area use of grayling in the Otta-Gudbrandsdalslågen river system made the area well suited for further studies. There is little knowledge about the migrations of year-of-young grayling in such systems, and how these migrations influence the distribution of adult fish. To investigate and compare the drift between Otta and Gudbrandsdalslågen <b>rivers,</b> <b>drift</b> traps were made, and distributed over four stations at different depths in both rivers in 2014. The traps was checked and the contents sorted every 24 hour period, with 12 hour sampling periods at selected stations to explore potential diel patterns in the drift. The captures of drifting larvae were modelled to investigate the influence of different environmental factors and the results were compared between <b>rivers.</b> <b>Drift</b> of grayling larvae was observed over a short time period of 12 - 13 days. The larvae mainly drifted at night, deep in the water column. The sum of degree days (°D > 5 ° C) was the environmental factor best explaining the drift of grayling larvae. There were between-river differences in both the spatial distribution of the drift and observed growth in larvae during the study period. Grayling larvae drifted through the whole study area in Otta, while drift only was observed at the uppermost and lowest station in Lågen. The length of trapped grayling larvae in Otta stayed the same during the study period, while growth was recorded in Lågen, possibly due to the differences in distribution of nursery areas between the rivers. The observations of drift made in this study are related to the early life history strategies of the grayling in the river system. The grayling is adapted to ensure drift dispersal of larvae from high velocity spawning sites to slow flowing nursery habitat. This can be hypothesized to be an underlying factor in the motivation behind the potamodromous migration cycle of the grayling in the river system. Hydropower development and loss of connectivity will arguably influence the drift of larvae and the motivation behind migration of grayling, possibly changing the selection from favoring migration towards stationary behavior.
