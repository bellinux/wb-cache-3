At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each <b>relief</b> <b>recipient</b> in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E
40|$|The study quantifies factors {{affecting}} use of relief maize seed and implications on productivity in Zimbabwe. It uses Tobit and multiple regression models to analyze {{data collected from}} <b>relief</b> <b>recipient</b> households in 2010. Regression analysis showed that time of seed receipt, land area, rainfall and hybrid seed had strong influence on relief seed utilization rates. This underscores the need for timely input distribution {{before the onset of}} the rainy season. Rainfall, basal fertilizers, use of hybrid seed and conservation agriculture were significant in increasing relief maize yield. These results are consistent with the current thrust on the green revolution for Africa, centered on promoting increased fertiliser use, conservation of soil and water and modern varieties as interventions for increasing agricultural productivity in Africa. Increased policy efforts should be placed on increasing access to hybrid maize seed and fertilizers as well as promoting conservation agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is "Urban Relief in Saskatchewan During the Years of Depression, 1930 - 39. " It is {{composed}} of five main chapters, bounded by an Introduction and a Conclusion. The Introduction attempts to justify the delimitation of subject matter to urban relief and to define {{the various types of}} relief and classes of <b>relief</b> <b>recipient</b> to be found in an urban municipality of the Province in the 1930 s. The first two chapters set the background to the three local studies which form the core of the thesis. Chapter one describes the response of the Federal Government to the problems of unemployment and relief, and discusses its failure to implement national policies to cope with the situation. The consequences of this lack of central direction for Saskatchewan are considered in some detail. The second chapter analyses the position of the Provincial Government during the depression decade from three major perspectives; political, financial and administrative. The third, fourth and fifth chapters consist of a description and analysis {{of the impact of the}} depression and the federal and provincial policies pursued as they affected the cities of Prince Albert and Saskatoon and the town of Shaunavon. These places were selected for special study because they are geographically representative. Shaunavon is situated in the south-western corner of the Province, approximately thirty miles from the border with the United States and one hundred and thirty miles from the Albertan border. Saskatoon is situated in the central part of the settled area of the Province and Prince Albert is in the northern part of the settled area, approximately one hundred miles north of Saskatoon. Each local study consists of a consideration of the relief policies adopted and the administrative framework in which they operated. The financial and demographic consequences of the depression for each urban centre are described and the problems which were encountered are analysed. The Conclusion seeks to assess the relative gravity of the impact of the depression in the three centres studied, and to relate the degree of suffering to political events in the individual municipality and the Province...|$|E

My comparison of weekly data on the number of <b>relief</b> <b>recipients</b> in 23 distressed poor law unions with estimates of weekly cotton consumption for the period November 1861 to December 1862 suggests that the average length of time between becoming unemployed and receiving poor relief was less than 2 months.

40|$|The {{economic}} benefits of debt <b>relief</b> for <b>recipient</b> countries {{have been the subject}} of arduous debate, at least partly motivated by the difficulty of identifying the causal effect of debt relief on economic performance given that performance itself may drive the decision to grant relief. This paper conducts an event study to assess the economic consequences of multilateral debt <b>relief</b> for <b>recipient</b> countries that is robust to these reverse causality issues. It estimates the response of the stock prices of South African multinationals with subsidiaries in those countries to the announcement of debt relief initiatives, and shows that stock prices exhibit a significant increase above those of other rms, especially around the launching of the recent Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. The improvement in nancial markets' assessment of the value of these multinationals is consistent with lower expected levels of future taxation in the recipient countries. Overall, the results are in line with the debt overhang argument for debt relief...|$|R
40|$|The Great Depression of the 1930 s led contemporaries {{to worry}} that people hit by hard times would turn to crime {{in their efforts to}} survive. Franklin Roosevelt argued that the {{unprecedented}} and massive expansion in relief efforts “struck at the roots of crime” by providing subsistence income to needy families. After constructing a panel data set for 81 large American cities for the years 1930 through 1940, we estimate the impact of relief spending by all levels of government on crime rates. The analysis suggests that a ten percent increase in relief spending during the 1930 s lowered property crime by roughly 1. 5 percent. By limiting the amount of free time for <b>relief</b> <b>recipients,</b> work <b>relief</b> was more effective than direct relief in reducing crime. More generally, our results indicate that social insurance, which tends to be understudied in economic analyses of crime, should be more explicitly and more carefully incorporated into the analysis of temporal and spatial variations in criminal activity. ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1932, Democratic {{presidential nominee}} Franklin D. Roosevelt promised [...] "a New Deal for the American people", coining the {{enduring}} label for his domestic policies. The desperate economic situation, {{along with the}} substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 elections, gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the [...] "First Hundred Days" [...] of his administration. He used his leverage to win rapid passage {{of a series of}} measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system, stock market, industry, and agriculture, along with many other government efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy. The New Deal regulated much of the economy, especially the financial sector. It provided relief to the unemployed through numerous programs, such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and for young men, the Civilian Conservation Corps that undertook jobs such as forest fire fighting and creating public works. Large scale spending projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the Public Works Administration. Roosevelt turned left in 1935–36, building up labor unions through the Wagner Act. Unions became a powerful element of the merging New Deal Coalition, which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, <b>relief</b> <b>recipients,</b> big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote).

40|$|Poverty Encounters: Unitarians, the Poor, and Poor Relief in Antebellum Boston and Philadelphia," {{examines}} Unitarian poor relief {{programs in}} Boston and Philadelphia between 1820 and 1860 {{and the role}} of encounters with the poor in shaping such programs. The dissertation argues that Unitarian theopolitical beliefs struck a balance between individual self-culture and the common good, and that Unitarian poor relief programs reflected attempts to achieve this equilibrium. Nevertheless, internal dissent among Unitarians over theology, shifting economic conditions, and the actions of the poor and working classes upset the Unitarian social vision and led to the decline of Unitarianism as it had existed {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century. Using diaries of poor relief workers, organizational reports, correspondence from poor <b>relief</b> <b>recipients,</b> and fictional literature, the dissertation explores the influence of poor relief encounters on the Boston Unitarian ministry-at-large, Philadelphia lay Unitarians' poor relief efforts, the Boston Asylum and Farm School for Indigent Boys, the Boston Benevolent Fraternity of Churches, and Transcendentalist experiments in economic reform. "Poverty Encounters" explains not only how poor relief programs were shaped by interactions between elites and the poor, but also how such encounters led to changes in social, political, and theological ideologies. It challenges traditional understandings of the antebellum United States as bifurcated into a liberal individualist North and a communal, "organic" South, arguing that elements of organic thought played an important role in Northerners' ideas about poverty in the antebellum period. Paying particular attention to the language and discourse of politics and theology, "Poverty Encounters" is what Mark Noll has called a "social history of ideas. " It clarifies the elements that came to hold together the age's burgeoning democracy and capitalism. and reveals the role of religion in shifting political ideologies and the relationship of both to changing ideas about poverty...|$|R

40|$|Workers' education, a form {{of adult}} education, {{emphasized}} the study {{of economic and social}} problems from the workers' perspective. When the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) created its adult education program in 1933, workers' education classes were included. Between 1933 and 1943 thirty-six states participated in the federal experiment in workers' education. Seventeen of these states, including Indiana, were involved throughout the entire ten years of the program. With as many as two thousand teachers employed at one time, officials conservatively estimated that the program reached at least one million workers nation-wide. Three distinct phases of a federal workers' education program existed: FERA (1933 - 1935), Works Progress Administration (WPA [...] prior to separation from the other adult education programs, 1935 - 1939), and WPA Workers' Service Program (1939 - 1943). In separate chapters these phases of federal workers' education are examined from both the federal and state perspectives. FERA and WPA workers' education stimulated educational activities within the labor movement. For example, in Indiana this program was particularly popular among the new Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) unions. Federal workers' education activities also encouraged union-university cooperation and laid the foundation for labor education at Indiana University. In addition, the WPA Workers'' Service Program served as the model for a Federal Labor Extension Service, similar to the existing federal agricultural extension program, that, for reasons {{beyond the scope of this}} study, was never implemented. If nothing else, the FERA and WPA workers' education projects put thousands of unemployed people to work and helped the morale of both the <b>relief</b> <b>recipients</b> and the adults who attended classes. Never supported at levels necessary to reach a majority of the population, federal aid to workers' education was, at the very least, a sincere attempt by liberal relief administrators,educators, and labor leaders to serve the educational needs of American workers.

This dissertation investigates the consequences of England 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of 2 ̆ 2 indiscriminate almsgiving 2 ̆ 2 in favor of politically expedient provisions for the poor. What the poor deserved within the construct of the powerful British empire is revealed by tracing legal developments legislated by the New Poor Laws, by analyzing social values illustrated in private institutional mission statements and policies, and by comparing social attitudes towards the poor within the larger society with those of Roman Catholic religious women. While Roman Catholic women provided childcare services without questioning the respectability of the needy mother, poor law administrators and private charities categorized <b>relief</b> <b>recipients</b> by birthplace, legitimacy at birth, and religion to determine eligibility. Although the poor, particularly women, had significant constraints, they acted rationally to meet their needs, frequently transcending spatial barriers, appearing in the wrong places and times, confronting or complying with requirements set for assistance. This study relies on space, gender, and agency as analytical tools to demonstrate how and why poor women and children, were excluded, included, or detained by those providing social services. It contributes to the larger debate on the question of historical agency as conceived by E. P. Thompson because it seeks to uncover the values of the working poor by observing and analyzing their public and private actions {{over an extended period of}} time in a particular social space, Victorian London. This study departs from earlier social histories of Victorian London because it maps and measures the actions and pathways taken by destitute women through quantitative analyses of primary sources including the London Foundling Hospital petitions, Roman Catholic orphanage registers, London dock company, poor law, maternity and medical registers. Articles from the press and testimonies from the parliamentary papers supplement the quantitative findings. In sum, this study integrates analyses of social welfare policies and the actions of the poor to determine how society decided what social benefits the poor deserved in Victorian London...|$|R

Apesar dessa importância, pouco se sabe sobre seus efeitos em ambientes de trabalho para esses indivíduos. O presente estudo analisou o comportamento de escolha de indivíduos deficientes mentais sob duas condições de trabalho e avaliou a influência da situação de escolha e de não escolha sobre parâmetros de desempenho nessas condições. Quatro indivíduos deficientes mentais adultos aprenderam uma tarefa de trabalho com e sem arranjo instrucional. A tarefa consistia em montar capas de blocos de anotações por meio da colagem de pedaços de papel dobradura sobre papel cartão. O arranjo, desenvolvido para a tarefa de trabalho, continha dispositivos para colocação de papel, fundo de capas de bloco de anotações e cola. Seu objetivo foi prover assistência imediata, aumentar ou manter a freqüência do comportamento e prevenir erros na rotina da tarefa. Em seguida, os participantes realizaram a tarefa alternadamente, sob esquemas múltiplos de reforçamento, ou sob esquemas concorrentes com encadeamento, organizados em um delineamento experimental de múltiplos elementos. Nos esquemas múltiplos, os componentes se alternavam de forma quase randômica e diferiam com relação à presença ou ausência do arranjo instrucional. Nos esquemas concorrentes com encadeamento, o participante pôde escolher, no primeiro elo, sob esquemas de razão fixa (FR 1), a alternativa, com ou sem arranjo instrucional, com a qual trabalharia no segundo elo. O desempenho sob esquemas múltiplos, sem escolha do componente, foi comparado com o desempenho sob esquemas concorrentes com encadeamento, em que os participantes puderam escolher a alternativa com que iriam trabalhar para verificar a função da escolha sobre o desempenho nas alternativas, com e sem arranjo. Ao longo de todas as fases do estudo, à medida que o participante apresentasse erros, eram fornecidas instruções verbais, gestuais, e modelo. Inicialmente eram apresentadas instruções verbais, seguidas de gestuais e modelo, até que a resposta correta fosse emitida. Na fase de ensino, os participantes aprenderam os seis passos da tarefa e houve maior quantidade de instrução na presença do componente A, sem arranjo. Na fase de linha de base, nas tentativas com esquemas múltiplos, houve maior quantidade de instrução na presença do componente A; e nas tentativas com esquemas concorrentes com encadeamento, houve maior quantidade de instrução na alternativa com arranjo. Nessa, tanto em esquemas múltiplos como em esquemas concorrentes com encadeamento, três dos participantes concluíram a tarefa mais rapidamente quando na presença do arranjo. Na situação de escolha, dois participantes apresentaram preferência pela alternativa com arranjo, enquanto dois distribuíram suas escolhas igualmente entre as duas alternativas. Três dos quatro participantes apresentaram um número de erros bastante reduzido e relativamente bem distribuído dentre as alternativas. A alternativa com arranjo instrucional mostrou ser uma opção preferível, sob o ponto de vista do indivíduo com deficiência mental. Além disso, trabalhando na presença do arranjo, os participantes concluíram a tarefa mais rapidamente e mantiveram o número de erros em nível baixo. A escolha foi exercida, portanto, sem prejuízo de seu desempenho nos parâmetros analisados. O estudo contribui para o desenvolvimento de programas de capacitação profissional do deficiente mental severo e traz implicações práticas importantes para o planejamento de ensino para essa população. Choice {{making is}} a fundamental skill for all individuals. Choice opportunities are related with important questions of human development, and of paramount importance {{to the development of}} clinical and educational programs for mentally retarded individuals. Despite its practical importance, {{little is known about the}} effects that choice may have in the work environment of this population. In this study, choice was investigated under two conditions: with and without environmental work support. Work performance was assessed as a function of conditions chosen. First, four mentally retarded adults learned to perform a work task under those two conditions. The task consisted of assembling notebook covers. An MDF (medium density fiber) board measuring 30 cm by 40 cm, was employed as work support and displayed several low <b>relief</b> <b>recipients</b> to suit its different components and was designed to provide immediate feedback, to increase or maintain the rate of work response and to prevent errors during the task routine. A number of small pieces of paper, 2 cm by 2 cm, in different colors, pieces of thin cardboard, 10 cm by 8 cm, glue sticks, candies and chocolate bars previously chosen by the participants in preference tests were used. The study took place in quiet, well lit and ventilated room at the participants institution, isolated from other workshop clients. Following initial training the participants worked individually either under multiple schedules or under concurrent-chain schedules according to a multiple-element design. When the multiple schedules condition was on, the components were either presence or absence of work support, quasi-randomly distributed. Under the concurrent-chain schedules conditions a FR- 1 was used on the first link, and either one of the two work alternatives, on the second link. Throughout the study, whenever the participant presented an error, verbal, gestual prompts and model were provided. Initially verbal prompts were provided and, if necessary, by gestual, verbal plus gestual prompts, and model, in this sequence, until the target responses were emitted. In relation to the parameters analyzed, the number of errors and prompts were higher working without work support than working with it, during the teaching phase. Baseline on task performance, under multiple schedules, showed prompts lower in the work support component in relation to the no work support component. Under concurrent chain schedule, however, the percentage of prompts under work support was higher in relation to the no work support alternative. As far as time spent to complete the task, in the teaching phase, two participants finished the work activity faster in the component without support. During baseline on task performance, under multiple schedules and chain concurrent schedules, three participants finished the task faster working with the work support. The results showed a preference for the work support alternative for two participants, while the other two distributed their choices evenly between the two alternatives. With the work support, time on task was relatively lower as compared to the no work support. The number of errors by P 3 was different from the other participants, who showed a much smaller number of errors evenly distributed between the experimental conditions. Working with support was preferable from the participants point of view. Besides that, under supported work, participants finished the task faster and the number of errors was kept in a low level. The participants could choose independently of his performance in the parameters analyzed. The study brings a contribution to vocational training programs for the severely retarded and to the development of a common interface with the areas of Behavior Analysis, Special Education and Ergonomics and brings practical implications for the design of teach procedures for mentally retarded...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{analysis}} in poor law history has uncovered {{the experiences of}} individual <b>relief</b> claimants and <b>recipients,</b> emphasising {{their role in the}} welfare process. The literature has, however, tended to draw a false dichotomy between understanding the experiences of the individual poor and understanding the administration of the poor laws. This thesis deploys a ‘policy process’ understanding of social policies, a concept developed in the social sciences, to understand the processes driving social policies under the poor laws. The thesis deploys a more holistic approach to understanding the poor laws, taking into account how those in positions of power, as well as welfare recipients, impacted upon social policies under the poor law. By applying this understanding to the literature, significant aspects of poor law history have been left under-researched. The adoption and implementation of enabling legislation in the final years of the old poor law, specifically Gilbert’s Act of 1782 and Sturges Bourne’s Act of 1819, have hitherto received little attention. Policy transfer under the old and New poor laws, an aspect that informed all stages of the policy process, has also been neglected. In addition, the ways in which welfare scandals {{during the early years of}} the New Poor Law influenced the development of social policies have not been treated to systematic analysis. This thesis tackles each of these lacunas in turn, using administrative records produced by the central welfare authorities and Parliament, and local administrative records from the rural south of England. It offers a more nuanced picture of poor law reform and policy innovation under the poor laws. Enabling legislation was adopted and dropped at different times, and it was implemented in different ways. Policy transfer was important in the administration of poor law policy throughout the period. Early welfare scandals arose in areas of policy strain and had influenced the development of national legislation. Cumulatively, the different foci demonstrate the multifarious ways in which policy was adopted, implemented and changed under the poor laws. They also highlight the importance of two groups in this process, key actors and stakeholders. Rather than viewing the experiences of relief claimants as separate to the administrative aspects of the poor laws, the ‘policy process’ approach allows us to view them as part of the same process. In turn, this offers new insights into how both relief claimants and relief administration impacted upon each other. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{financial}} crisis implicated the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives {{market as a}} source of systemic risk. In the wake of the crisis, lawmakers sought to reduce systemic risk to the financial system by regulating this market. One of the reforms that Congress introduced in the Dodd-Frank Act (P. L. 111 - 203) was mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives through clearinghouses, in an effort to remake the OTC market more {{in the image of the}} regulated futures exchanges. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash or liquid assets, called margin, to cover potential losses and prevent any firm from building up a large uncapitalized exposure, as happened in the case of the American International Group (AIG). Clearinghouses thus limit the size of a cleared position based on a firm’s ability to post margin to cover its potential losses. As lawmakers focused on clearing requirements to reduce systemic risk, concerns also arose as to whether the small number of large swaps dealers in existence—mostly the largest banks—might influence clearinghouses or trading platforms in ways that could undermine the efficacy of the approach. Concerns about conflicts of interest in clearing center around whether, if large swap dealers dominate a clearinghouse, they might directly or indirectly restrict access to the clearinghouse; whether they might limit the scope of derivatives products eligible for clearing; or whether they might influence a clearinghouse to lower margin requirements. Trading in OTC derivatives is in fact concentrated around a dozen or so major dealers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) estimated that, as of the third quarter of 2010, five large commercial banks in the United States represented 96 % of the banking industry’s total notional amounts of all derivatives; and those five banks represented 81 % of the industry’s net credit exposure to derivatives. The first group of Troubled Asset <b>Relief</b> Program (TARP) <b>recipients</b> included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. As a result of the high degree of market concentration, the failure of a large swaps dealer still has the potential to result in the nullification of tens of billions of dollars worth of contracts, which could pose a systemic threat. A 2009 -proposed amendment proposed to H. R. 4173, which passed the House, would have limited ownership interest and governance of the new derivatives clearinghouses by certain large financial institutions and major swap participants. Sections 726 and 765 in the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act mandate that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), respectively, must adopt rules to mitigate conflicts of interest. However, it allowed the agencies to decide whether those rules include strict numerical limits on ownership or control. In the CFTC’s proposed rules to mitigate conflicts of interest, published on October 18, 2010, and on January 6, 2011, the CFTC did choose to adopt strict ownership limits, along the lines of the Lynch amendment. The SEC’s proposed rule, published on October 13, 2010, does the same. This report examines how conflicts of interest may arise and analyzes the measures that the CFTC and SEC proposed to address them. It discusses what effect, if any, ownership and control limits may have on derivatives clearing; and whether such limits effectively address the types of conflicts of interest that are of concern to some in the 112 th Congress. These rulemakings may interest the 112 th Congress as part of its oversight authority for the CFTC and SEC. Trends in clearing and trading derivatives, and the ownership of swap clearinghouses, are discussed in the Appendix...|$|R
