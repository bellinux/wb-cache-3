25|$|Also in 1970, Thompson {{wrote an}} article {{entitled}} The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for the short-lived new journalism magazine Scanlan's Monthly. Although it was not widely <b>read,</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> {{was the first to}} use the techniques of Gonzo journalism, a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic first-person subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook. Ralph Steadman, who would collaborate with Thompson on several more projects, contributed expressionist pen-and-ink illustrations.|$|E

Another Labour backbencher, Jimmy Maxton, rose and asked the Prime Minister [...] "if he has <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>article,</b> {{and if he is}} aware that the article contains mainly a call to the troops not to allow themselves to be used in industrial disputes, and that that point of view is shared by a large number of Members sitting on these benches?"

500|$|An {{article in}} The Saturday Evening Post, {{published}} on April 17, 1954, while Reckless {{was still in}} Korea, resulted in a campaign by American supporters to get the Marines to bring her to the United States. An executive at Pacific Transport Lines, Stan Coppel, <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> and offered to let Reckless ride free {{on one of his}} company's ships from Yokohama to San Francisco. Prior to her departure for America, a ceremony, including a band, for Reckless' rotation to the United States was held during half time of a football game between the Marine Corps and Army. Reckless left Korea [...] for Japan aboard a 1st Marine Aircraft Wing transport plane. She then sailed from Yokohama on October 22 aboard the SS Pacific Transport, due in San Francisco on November 5, 1954. A typhoon delayed the ship's arrival until the evening of November 9. Reckless and her caretakers stayed aboard until the next morning. Reckless got sick during the storm and was once knocked out of her stall onto the deck by the storm, which happened {{near the end of the}} trip.|$|E

[...] The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, [...] "Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos."

500|$|When Rep. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina {{looked to}} prevent anti-slavery {{petitions}} {{from reaching the}} House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported {{what came to be}} known as the gag rule, which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836. He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery Herald of Freedom as a [...] "doughface", which had the dual meaning of [...] "craven-spirited man" [...] and [...] "northerner with southern sympathies". Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the Herald of Freedom article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one in 33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> on the Senate floor as [...] "proof" [...] that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one in 33 figure.|$|E
