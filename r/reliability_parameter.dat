40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} determine the optimal product reliability and production rate that achieves the biggest total integrated profit for an imperfect manufacturing process. The basic assumption of the classical Economic Manufacturing Quantity (EMQ) model is that all manufacturing items are of perfect quality. The assumption is not true in practice. Most of the production system produces perfect and imperfect quality items. In some cases the imperfect quality (non conforming) items are reworked {{at a cost to}} restore its quality to the original one. Rework cost may be reduced by improvements in product reliability (i. e., decreasing in product <b>reliability</b> <b>parameter).</b> Lower value of product <b>reliability</b> <b>parameter</b> results in increase development cost of production and also smaller quantity of nonconforming products. The unit production cost is a function of product <b>reliability</b> <b>parameter</b> and production rate. As a result, higher development cost increases unit production cost. The problem of optimal planning work and rework processes belongs to the broad field of production-inventory model which deals with all kinds of reuse processes in supply chains. These processes aim to recover defective product items {{in such a way that}} they meet the quality level of 'good item'. The benefits from imperfect quality items are: regaining the material and value added on defective items and improving the environment protection. In this point of view, a model is introduced here to guide a firm/industry in addressing variable product reliability factor, variable unit production cost and dynamic production rate for time-varying demand. The paper provides an optimal control formulation of the problem and develops necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of the dynamic variables. In this purpose, the Euler-Lagrange method is used to obtain optimal solutions for product <b>reliability</b> <b>parameter</b> and dynamic production rate. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed model. Time-varying demand Imperfect production Inventory Product reliability...|$|E

40|$|Background: Reproducibility {{concerns}} {{the degree to}} which repeated measurements provide similar results. Agreement parameters assess how close the results of the repeated measurements are, by estimating the measurement error in repeated measurements. <b>Reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> assess whether study objects, often persons, can be distinguished from each other, despite measurement errors. In that case, the measurement error is related to the variability between persons. Consequently, <b>reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> are highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the study sample, while the agreement parameters, based on measurement error, are more a pure characteristic of the measurement instrument. Methods and Results: Using an example of an interrater study, in which different physical therapists measure the range of motion of the arm in patients with shoulder complaints, the differences and relationships between <b>reliability</b> and agreement <b>parameters</b> for continuous variables are illustrated. Conclusion: If the research question {{concerns the}} distinction of persons, <b>reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> are the most appropriate. But if the aim is to measure change in health status, which is often the case in clinical practice, parameters of agreement are preferred. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a problem of}} difficult accessibility and low quality of data on the <b>reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> of the vehicle system components and the difficulties arising from this problem to estimate the <b>reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> of the systems themselves as statutorily required {{and in terms of}} international standards (e. g. ISO  26262). As a problem solution, the paper proposes a method for adjustment of the system reliability estimates based on the field observation of system failures. The method based on a Kalman filter uses non-parametric definition of the failure probability distribution (quantile «folding» of the distribution) with subsequent «unfolding» via Monte Carlo. A mathematical model shows how to use this method.  For clarity, the estimates of <b>reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> are given at the time of rollout (100 % of systems are in working order) and upon the failure of 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of produced systems, respectively.

The method allows, by varying filter parameters, a more conservative estimate of the <b>reliability</b> <b>parameters</b> or an estimate, which is more in accord with the field data. Thus, the results can be used at all stages of the system lifecycle, namely when developing, manufacturing and upon completing production for the aftermarket services. </p...|$|R
