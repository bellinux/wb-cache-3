5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the <b>regular</b> <b>rate</b> checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} exoplanets, Kepler-11d is named first for its host star, Kepler-11. Because Kepler-11d was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the five other planets in the system, their names are sorted by their distances from the host star; thus, because Kepler-11d is the third planet from Kepler-11, it was given the designation d. Kepler-11 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA Earth-trailing satellite purposed with discovering Earth-like planets in a small area of the sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra by observing planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit causes the star's brightness to dim slightly and at a <b>regular</b> <b>rate,</b> a phenomenon that the Kepler satellite notes till future study can prove or disprove the existence of a planetary body. Kepler-11d was flagged by Kepler-11, given the designation KOI-157.|$|E

The species {{may or may not}} survive in other locales. Species extinction occurs when the death rate over the entire species exceeds the birth rate for a long enough period for the species to disappear. It was an observation of Van Valen that groups of species tend to have a characteristic and fairly <b>regular</b> <b>rate</b> of extinction.|$|E
25|$|He was {{publishing}} {{new works}} at a <b>regular</b> <b>rate,</b> culminating in {{the first volume of}} his historical epic Frații Jderi, which saw print in 1935. In 1936, the writer accepted the honorary chairmanship of Adevărul and its morning edition, Dimineața. During that time, he was involved in a public dispute with the far right and fascist press, replying to their attacks in several columns. Affiliates of the radical right organized public burnings of his volumes. The scandal prolonged itself over the following years, with Sadoveanu being supported by his friends in the literary community. Among them was Topîrceanu, who was at the time hospitalized, and whose expression of support was made shortly before his death to liver cancer. In September 1937, as a statement of solidarity and appreciation, the University of Iași conferred Sadoveanu the title of doctor honoris causa.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} never {{completely}} at rest. It never stops functioning and firing neuronal signals, {{as well as}} using oxygen {{as long as the}} person in question is alive. In fact, in Stark and Squire’s, 2001 study When zero is not zero: The problem of ambiguous baseline conditions in fMRI, activity in the medial temporal lobe (as well as in other brain regions) was substantially higher during rest than during several alternative baseline conditions. The effect of this elevated activity during rest was to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the sign of the activity during task conditions relevant to memory functions. These results demonstrate that periods of rest are associated with significant cognitive activity and are therefore not an optimal baseline for cognition tasks. In order to discern baseline and activation conditions it is necessary to interpret a lot of information. This includes situations as simple as breathing. Periodic blocks may result in identical data of other variance in the data if the person breathes at a <b>regular</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 breath/5sec, and the blocks occur every 10s, thus impairing the data.|$|E

500|$|On January22, the {{disturbance}} intensified into a tropical depression. The JTWC upgraded the storm to tropical storm status on January23, {{three days after}} classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. On January25, the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bella, a week after beginning to issue advisories. Around that time, the storm became visible on MFR satellite imagery. Following a lengthy period of minimal development, Bella subsequently intensified at a more <b>regular</b> <b>rate</b> as it slowed its forward motion. On January26, it turned more to the southwest, but the westward track resumed on the next day. Aided by warm sea surface temperatures of , Bella began to intensify quickly. On January28, both the JTWC and the MFR upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, estimating winds of 120km/h (75mph); this made Bella a tropical cyclone, the first of the season. Around this time, the storm developed a well-defined eye 60km (35mi) in diameter.|$|E
2500|$|Atrial flutter is {{recognized}} on an electrocardiogram by presence of characteristic flutter waves at a <b>regular</b> <b>rate</b> of 200 to 300 beats per minute. Individual flutter waves may be symmetrical, resembling p-waves, {{or may be}} asymmetrical with a [...] "sawtooth" [...] shape, rising gradually and falling abruptly or vice versa. If atrial flutter is suspected clinically but is not clearly evident on ECG, acquiring a Lewis lead ECG may be helpful in revealing flutter waves.|$|E
2500|$|In sensory neurons, action {{potentials}} {{result from}} an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously depolarize their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a <b>regular</b> <b>rate,</b> like an internal clock. The voltage traces of such cells {{are known as}} pacemaker potentials. [...] The cardiac pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node in the heart provide a good example. Although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing. In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as bursting.|$|E

50|$|With the USCF, a game is {{considered}} to affect the Quick rating with more than 10 minutes, but up to 65 minutes, time controls per player. As 30 minute to 65 minute per player time controls are also under the <b>Regular</b> <b>rating</b> system, these games affects both the Quick and Regular ratings, and are known as dual rated games. However, the K factor (a statistic used for ratings) is reduced by comparison, meaning that players will either lose or gain (or rarely both) less rating points compared to a solely Quick or Regular game. Any time control over 65 minutes counts under the <b>Regular</b> <b>rating</b> only. All of these time controls include the delay added to the time control, such as a 60 minute with a 5-second delay is still {{considered to be a}} 60-minute game, not a 65-minute game.|$|R

60|$|One great {{advantage}} of the plan of having an account over that of paying cash at stated times is, that it affords {{an opportunity for the}} father or mother to allow interest for any balances left {{from time to time in}} their hands, so as to initiate the children into a knowledge of the nature and the advantages of productive investments, and familiarize them with the idea that money reserved has within it a principle of increase. The interest allowed should be altogether greater than the <b>regular</b> <b>rate,</b> so as to make the advantage of it in the case of such small sums appreciable to the children--but not too great.

He had already gone into the matter with Leof, who pointed out that, as at present he had no wish to keep up any show or to have a body of armed men in the house, it would suffice if the men were exercised every day for a month, and after that merely practised with sword and battle-axe for two or three hours once a week. On these terms he had no difficulty in obtaining considerably more than the number he asked for, and finally fifty men were enrolled.|$|E
6000|$|It is by {{the mines}} and {{fisheries}} (of both of which I shall speak particularly in another place) that Cornwall is compensated for a soil, too barren {{in many parts of}} the county, to be ever well cultivated except at such an expenditure of capital as no mere farmer can afford. From the inexhaustible mineral treasures in the earth, and from the equally inexhaustible shoals of pilchards which annually visit the coast, the working population of Cornwall derive their regular means of support, where agriculture would fail them. At the mines, the <b>regular</b> <b>rate</b> of wages is from forty to fifty shillings a month; but miners have opportunities of making more than this. By what is termed [...] "working on tribute," [...] that is, agreeing to excavate the mineral lodes for a per centage on the value of the metal they raise, some of them have been known to make as much as six and even ten pounds each, in a month. When they are unlucky in their working speculations, or perhaps thrown out of employment altogether by the shutting up of a mine, they still have a fair opportunity of obtaining farm labour, which is paid for (out of harvest time) at the rate of nine shillings a week. But this is a resource of which they are rarely obliged to take advantage. A plot of common ground is included with the cottages that are let to them; and the cultivation of this, helps to keep them and their families, in bad times, until they find an opportunity of resuming work; when they may perhaps make as much in one month, as an agricultural labourer can in twelve.|$|E
