5|$|Two {{years later}} in 1945, Zeller {{pointed out that the}} use of the name Longia was untenable, as it had already been used for a genus of <b>rusts</b> {{described}} by Hans Sydow in 1921, so he proposed the name Longula and introduced the new combination Longula texensis in addition to L.texensis var. major. The species was known by this name for about 60 years, until a 2004 phylogenetic study revealed the taxon's close evolutionary relationship with Agaricus, a possibility insinuated by Curtis Gates Lloyd a century before. This resulted in a new name in that genus, but it soon came to light that the name Agaricus texensis had already been used, ironically enough, by Berkeley and Curtis themselves in 1853, for a taxon now treated as a synonym of Flammulina velutipes. Since this made the new Agaricus texensis an unusable homonym, Gabriel Moreno and colleagues published the new name Agaricus deserticola in 2010. The mushroom is commonly known as the gasteroid Agaricus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} diseases of wheat and barley worldwide and are best controlled using genetic resistance. To increase the diversity of <b>rust</b> resistance in wheat and barley, a project was initiated to identify and characterise <b>rust</b> resistance genes from the wild species of Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) and Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum (wild barley), respectively. One hundred and two accessions of Sharon goatgrass from Israel and 318 Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) accessions from the Fertile Crescent, Central Asia, North Africa, and the Caucasus region were evaluated for resistance to leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and/or stripe <b>rust.</b> Sharon goatgrass exhibited a wide range of infection types (ITs) in response to leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and stripe <b>rust.</b> The percentage of resistant accessions in Sharon goatgrass was 58. 8 – 78. 4 % for leaf <b>rust,</b> 11. 8 – 69. 6 % for stem <b>rust,</b> and 46. 1 % for stripe <b>rust,</b> depending on the race used and the plant growth stage. Genetic studies with Sharon goatgrass revealed oligogenic resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> and stem <b>rust.</b> Wild barley also exhibited a wide range of ITs to leaf <b>rust</b> and stem rust; however, the overall frequency of resistance was lower than for Sharon goatgrass. The percentage of resistant accessions in wild barley was 25. 8 % for leaf <b>rust</b> and 5. 7 – 20. 1 % for stem <b>rust,</b> depending on the race used. Resistance to the new virulent stem <b>rust</b> race TTKS (i. e. Ug 99), present in eastern Africa, was found in both Sharon goatgrass (70 % of accessions) and wild barley (25 % of 20 accessions tested). Association mapping for stem <b>rust</b> resistance was applied in the WBDC using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers.

5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal <b>rusts,</b> and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Since Fe-Cu-C {{sintered}} steels {{are easily}} <b>rusted,</b> they are coated with <b>rust</b> preventive oils. High viscosity of those <b>rust</b> preventive oils decrease workability, and low viscosity deteriorates <b>rust</b> preventive performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to develop new <b>rust</b> preventive oils with contradictory properties of low viscosity and superior <b>rust</b> prevention. However, precise methodology to evaluate <b>rust</b> prevention ability has not been established. In this study, we developed new technique to quantitatively evaluate <b>rust</b> prevention ability by measuring the open circuit potential through thin corrosive solution on Fe-Cu-C sintered steels coated with a <b>rust</b> preventive oils. As a result, the ability for <b>rust</b> prevention can be measured quantitatively, and it decreases slowly over time, with repeating destruction and restoration. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} deteriorating processes of <b>rust</b> prevention ability for <b>rust</b> prevention oils are composed of three characteristics steps respectively. That is, in the first step the great open circuit potential changes from 0 V to- 0. 3 V with repetition were observed where the excellent <b>rust</b> prevention ability was kept, in the second step it decreases slowly from- 0. 1 V to- 0. 4 V with oscillation of the small potential changes where the gradual decrease of <b>rust</b> prevention ability was recognized and in the third step it decreases monotonously in the lower potential than- 0. 4 V where the <b>rust</b> was observed because of the remarkable deteriorating of the <b>rust</b> prevention ability...|$|R
