50|$|In Scotland, by {{the village}} of Munlochy on the A832, is a clootie well at an ancient spring {{dedicated}} to Saint Curetán, where rags are still hung on the surrounding bushes and trees. Here the well was once thought {{to have had the}} power to cure sick children who were left there overnight. Craigie Well at Avoch on the Black Isle has both offerings of coins and clooties. <b>Rags,</b> <b>wool</b> and human hair were also used as charms against sorcery, and as tokens of penance or fulfilment of a vow.|$|R
50|$|Peter McCarthy {{was born}} in Troy, New York on November 24, 1845, to Roman Catholic Irish {{immigrants}} Florence McCarthy and Mary Crowley. McCarthy grew up poor. He was educated in Troy's public school system. After graduating Troy High School in 1863, {{he worked in the}} sash and bind business in Troy. In 1864 McCarthy traveled west to Clinton, Iowa and lived there for two years. He then moved to Durham, Pennsylvania and was employed by the safe manufacturer Lewis P. Lillie. When he returned to Troy, New York, Peter and his brother Charles McCarthy founded C. & P. McCarthy and began trading in waste, <b>rags,</b> <b>wool</b> and cotton. C. & P. McCarthy was located on Riverstreet.|$|R
5000|$|The nest is a {{platform}} of twigs, usually high up on a tree with a preference for tall conifers like fir or pine. There are normally 3-5 eggs laid and they are incubated for 17-19 days. The young are fledged usually by about the 35th day. In India, the various races of the jungle crow breed from March to May, but in the plains some of them start even in mid December. The nest is built in a fork of a tree, and is a shallow cup of sticks, sometimes neat and well made, sometimes sketchy and ragged; it is lined with grass roots, <b>wool,</b> <b>rags,</b> vegetable fibre, and similar materials. Some nests {{have been found to}} be built partly or exclusively of wire.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, Batley was {{the centre of}} the [...] "shoddy trade" [...] in which <b>wool</b> <b>rags</b> and clothes were {{recycled}} by reweaving them into blankets, carpets and uniforms. In 1861 there were at least 30 shoddy mills in Batley. The owners of the recycling businesses were known as the [...] "shoddy barons". There was a [...] "shoddy king" [...] and a [...] "shoddy temple", properly known as the Zion Chapel. This imposing building in the town centre was opened in 1870, and reflected the popularity of the Methodist movement. The chapel is still active today. At the close of the 19th century, growth in population changed the form of governmental institutions above the parish of Batley; the Morley division of the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley was disused as special purpose districts were formed.|$|R
25|$|A box cooker has a {{transparent}} glass or plastic top, {{and it may}} have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, <b>wool,</b> <b>rags,</b> dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|R
5000|$|When Edell {{arrived in}} Nova Scotia in 1980, rug hooking {{was a deep}} part of Nova Scotian folk-culture since the 1850s, but it had not yet found a place within fine art. [...] Her move to Nova Scotia {{signaled}} a pivotal turn in her work; she started to incorporate the medium of rug hooking into her work, creating a unique visual style. [...] Edell’s work with this medium mixes the traditional practices of rug hooking with controversial themes such as feminism, sexuality, and death. She used the narrative possibilities of this medium to express a dream like quality with art historical references, sensuality, journeys and wit. “Using found <b>wool</b> <b>rag</b> (used clothing) and a traditional method of shrinking, she began to construct images that spoke of enclosed interior (indoor) spaces as related to the gender issue. She explores a socially-constructed gender that is developed {{through the use of}} myth (often Assyrian) and stereotype”. [...] Rug hooking and other domestic and often textile-based crafts, like quilting, knitting, sewing, and embroidery are often associated with the ‘feminine arts’. Because of this association with femininity and the domestic, they were devalued within the male-dominated hierarchy of art. [...] Edell, along with artists like Joyce Wieland, Kate Walker, Eva Hesse,Jackie Winsor, Miriam Schapiro pushed the boundaries between craft and art in the 1960-80's. They argued the distinction between craft and art was a gendered one.|$|R

6000|$|... 87. A Highland {{scene is}} beyond doubt {{pleasant}} enough {{in its own}} way; but, looked close at, has its shadows.[34] Here, for instance, is the very fact of one--as pretty as I can remember,--having seen many. It is a little valley of soft turf, enclosed in its narrow oval by jutting rocks, and broad flakes of nodding fern. From one side {{of it to the}} other winds, serpentine, a clear brown stream, drooping into quicker ripple as it reaches the end of the oval field, and then, first islanding a purple and white rock with an amber pool, it dashes away into a narrow fall of foam under a thicket of mountain ash and alder. The autumn sun, low, but clear, shines on the scarlet ash-berries and on the golden birch-leaves, which, fallen here and there, when the breeze has not caught them, rest quiet in the crannies of the purple rock. Beside the rock, in the hollow under the thicket, the carcase of a ewe, drowned in the last flood, lies nearly bare to the bone, its white ribs protruding through the skin, raven-torn; and the <b>rags</b> of its <b>wool</b> still flickering from the branches that first stayed it as the stream swept it down. A little lower, the current plunges, roaring, into a circular chasm like a well, surrounded on three sides by a chimney-like hollowness of polished rock, down which the foam slips in detached snow-flakes. Round the edges of the pool beneath, the water circles slowly like black oil; a little butterfly lies on its back, the wings glued to one of the eddies, its limbs feebly quivering; a fish arises, and it is gone. Lower down the stream, I can see over a knoll the green and damp turf roofs of four or five hovels, built {{at the edge of a}} morass, which is trodden by the cattle into a black Slough of Despond at their doors, and traversed by a few ill-set stepping stones, with here and there a flat slab on the tops, where they have sunk out of sight;--and at the turn of the brook I see a man fishing, with a boy and a dog--a picturesque and pretty group enough certainly, if they had not been there all day starving. I know them, and I know the dog's ribs also, which are nearly as bare as the dead ewe's; and the child's wasted shoulders, cutting his old tartan jacket through, so sharp are they.|$|R
