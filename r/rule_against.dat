5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week. That was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later that day that said Rivers {{would not be a}} candidate. Rivers cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the front runner for the office.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> hearsay {{was aimed}} at prohibiting the use of another person's statement, as {{equivalent}} to testimony by the witness to the fact.

25|$|In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court of Israel to allow {{same-sex}} {{marriage in the}} country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognise same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages.

25|$|Calligraphy is and {{has been}} the {{definitive}} Persian art form.

25|$|One of {{the twin}} {{elements}} of natural justice is the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> bias or nemo iudex in causa sua, which means {{that no one should}} be a judge {{in his or her own}} cause. The rule ensures that decision-makers will not be biased or prejudiced in a way that precludes a genuine and fair consideration of the arguments or evidence presented by the parties. Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent.|$|E

Human Rights Watch accuse Hugo Chávez and his allies of taking over the Supreme Court in 2004, filling it with supporters and making new measures allowing the government to dismiss justices from the court. In 2010, legislators from Chávez’s political party appointed 9 permanent judges and 32 stand-ins, which included several allies.

25|$|In 1520, Stockholm {{was taken}} by Christian II of Denmark and became {{the scene of the}} Stockholm Bloodbath. By 1521, Gustav Eriksson, a nobleman and {{relative}} of Sten Sture the Elder, managed to gather troops from Dalarna in north-west Sweden and help from Lübeck, with the purpose of defeating the Danes. In August 1521, his men elected him their monarch. The Swedish War of Liberation started, and would last until the capture of Stockholm, in June 1523. Gustav Vasa then consolidated his <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> claims from Denmark.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 1841, Attorney General Henry D. Gilpin {{began the}} oral {{argument}} phase before the Supreme Court. Gilpin first entered into evidence {{the papers of}} La Amistad, which stated that the Africans were Spanish property. Gilpin argued that the Court had no authority to <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> {{the validity of the}} documents. Gilpin contended that if the Africans were slaves (as evidenced by the documents), then they must be returned to their rightful owner, in this case, the Spanish government. Gilpin's argument lasted two hours.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E

Male evaluators tended to <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> women who negotiated but were less likely to penalize men; female evaluators tended to penalize both men and women who negotiated, and preferred applicants who did not ask for more. The study also showed that women who applied for jobs were not as likely to be hired by male managers if they tried to ask for more money, while men who asked for a higher salary were not negatively affected.|$|E
25|$|Other hypothetically {{relevant}} possibilities {{which almost}} never actually occur {{but have been}} invoked by lawyers or courts to invalidate transfers under the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> perpetuities include the slothful executor (a situation where the executor of the estate does not probate the will for many years after the testator's death), the magic gravel pit (a transfer to be made {{as soon as a}} gravel pit is out of gravel may not vest for hundreds of years), the war that never ends (a transfer to be made {{at the end of a}} war might never happen), and other similar situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of necessity is {{an exception to the}} <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> bias and operates to prevent a failure of justice. According to Anwar Siraj v. Tang I Fang (1982), necessity is the greatest single common law exception to the general rule that an adjudicator who appears to be biased or prejudiced must disqualify himself from participating in a proceeding. This rule is firmly established and is to the effect that disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act. The rule applies regardless of whether the disqualification arguably arises from the combination of prosecutorial and judicial functions, pecuniary interest, personal hostility or bias.|$|E
