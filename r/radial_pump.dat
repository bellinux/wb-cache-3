50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating <b>radial</b> <b>pump).</b> The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

The mini axial pump weighing 27 g (incl. 5 g rotor) has an outer diameter of 21 mm and a length of 10 mm in its largest point, but can produce a maximal blood flow of 6 l/min with 50 mmHg pressure increase. Therefore, it is suitable for the patients of 40 - 60 kg body weight. For other patients of 60 - 80 kg or 80 - 100 kg body weight, the mini axial pumps of 23 mm and 25 mm outer diameter had been developed before, these devices were acknowledged to be the world smallest LVADs by Guinness World Record Center in 2004.

40|$|Abstract In {{industrial}} applications turbomachines {{are not only}} used at their design point, but also at significant lower or higher flow rates. This operating range is limited on the low flow rate side by instabilities in flow-leading parts of the machinery. For these operating conditions vortices are created due to {{the separation of the}} boundary layer from the walls of the flow-leading parts of the machine, e. g. in the impeller. These unique or multiple stall cells can start to propagate {{at a fraction of the}} rotor speed in the impeller when the flow is further throttled. They induce very strong pressure oscillations and as a result machine parts can even be destroyed. It is very difficult to describe these phenomena physically and especially mathematically, because they depend on many operational parameters of the considered turbomachine. In the present experimental set-up a <b>radial</b> <b>pump</b> is investigated for various operating conditions down to rotating stall.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the experimental and computational investigation of the unsteady flow in the centrifugal pumps. This paper analysed the effect of the vaneless stator interference on the exit flow field of a <b>radial</b> <b>pump</b> operated in the DIM facility. High-response pressure transducers were used to determine unsteady pressure field at three planes at the pump and at diffuser inflows. The experimental data showed that unsteady pressure disturbances modes change when the flow was reduced. Detailed analysis showed that disturbances occur at distinct frequencies and that these rotated in the circumferential direction. Comparison of the pressure signals measured at two circumferential locations on the casing confirmed the characteristic frequency pattern to be a so called "rotating instability". This unsteady phenomenon was highlighted both at design flow rate and at low flow rates. The azimuthal distributions exhibited significant nonuniformities. The amplitude of this non-uniformity was sensitive to the flow rate. A simple model showed that, contrary to the common belief, the transport of the vane wake and secondary flows across the rotor was not enough to explain the magnitude of the variations. In this paper numerical investigations of the unsteady three-dimensional flow through the pump stage were also presented. Turbulence was modelled both by the k-ω transport equations model, and Reynolds Stress Model based on the coequation. The effects of the tip leakage flow were considered by meshing the tip clearance between rotor blade and casing. Results showed the jet-wake flow pattern induced an unstable vortex, which influenced flow discharging from the adjacent passage and destabilised jet-wake flow in the passage.

40|$|The present work {{illustrates}} the main {{results of an}} experimental campaign conducted in the Cavitating Pump Rotordynamic Test Facility (CPRTF) at Alta S. p. A., Pisa, on a three bladed, tapered-hub, variable-pitch inducer, named DAPROT 3, and on a mixed flow pump, named VAMPDAP. The latter consists of the combination between the DAPROT 3 inducer and a centrifugal pump placed downstream, called VAMPIRE. As a consequence of a displacement of the rotation axis, fluid induced rotordynamic forces arise, leading to a secondary motion of the shaft axis here referred as whirl motion. This precession of the shaft can be both unstable or stable depending on {{the direction of the}} rotordynamic force and the whirl frequency ratio. The combined effects of rotordynamic fluid forces and cavitation represent the dominant fluid mechanical phenomena that adversely affects the dynamic stability and pumping performance of turbopumps. In the experimental campaign, the rotordynamic forces and the hydraulic efficiency have been measured both in noncavitating and cavitating conditions, at different flow rates and temperatures, by means of a rotating dynamometer placed just behind the inducer. Two different methods have been exploited for the evaluation of fluid-induced rotordynamic forces. Indeed, in addition to the classic approach of discrete tests, a series of continuous tests have been performed in order to obtain a continuous spectra, allowing the possibility of accurately and unambiguously identifying the spectral minima and maxima, which are of special interest in the identification of the most dangerous operational condition of the test item. It has been found that the DAPROT 3 inducer presents a different behavior of rotordynamic forces with respect to the typical trend observed in centrifugal pump impellers in presence of a whirl motion concordant with impeller rotation, according to previous experimental campaigns. It has been observed also that cavitation does not affect the rotordynamic forces in a significant way. Nevertheless particular situations may arise in which a certain level of cavitation is capable to alter the stability regions and in which the presence of a cold or hot flow may play an important role. Conversely the flow rate has a great influence and its variation may destabilize a pump that is stable at design condition. An increasing deviation has been obtained for decreasing flow rate {{as a consequence of the}} interaction between rotating backflow and whirl motion. The effect of cavitation on hydraulic efficiency has been found to be negligible with variations within 1 %. On the other hand, the presence of rotordynamic forces may affect the efficiency up to 2 % depending on the whirl speed both for cold and hot flow conditions. For what concerns the VAMPDAP pump, a deviation from the typical trend of fluid-induced rotordynamic forces has been observed as a consequence of the presence of the inducer placed upstream with respect to a <b>radial</b> <b>pump,</b> whose experimental diagrams respect the expectations. The effect of cavitation on this pump is relevant only at high flow rates, where for discordant whirl motion a decrease in rotordynamic force appears, whereas in other operating conditions it can be considered almost negligible. The experimental campaign has included the evaluation of thermal cavitation effect by performing tests at two different temperatures also for VAMPDAP pump. From the results it has been observed that no significant thermal effects are found in terms of rotordynamic forces. Moreover, the hydraulic efficiency is not affected from cavitation since the maximum variations are in the order of 0. 9 % only at design and even lower at off-design conditions. At the same time the rotordynamic forces influence the efficiency in the order of 1 % depending on whirl speed...|$|E
40|$|Addressing {{the urgent}} need to develop LCOE {{competitive}} renewable energy solutions for US energy security and to replace fossil-fuel generation with the associated benefits to environment impacts including a reduction in CO 2 emissions, this Project focused on the advantages of using hydraulic energy transfer (HET) in large-scale Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems for harvesting off-shore tidal energy in US waters. A recent DOE resource assessment, identifies water power resources have a potential to meet 15 % of the US electric supply by 2030, with MHK technologies being a major component. The work covered a TRL- 4 laboratory proof-in-concept demonstration plus modeling of a 15 MW full scale system based on an approach patented by NASA-JPL, in which submerged high-ratio gearboxes and electrical generators in conventional MHK turbine systems are replaced by a submerged hydraulic <b>radial</b> <b>pump</b> coupled to on-shore hydraulic motors driving a generator. The advantages are; first, the mean-time-between-failure (MTBF), or maintenance, can be extended from approximately 1 to 5 years and second, the range of tidal flow speeds which can be efficiently harvested can be extended beyond that of a conventional submerged generator. The approach uses scalable, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, facilitating scale-up and commercialization. All {{the objectives of the}} Project have been successfully met (1) A TRL 4 system was designed, constructed and tested. It simulates a tidal energy turbine, with a 2 -m diameter blade in up to a 2. 9 m/sec flow. The system consists of a drive motor assembly providing appropriate torque and RPM, attached to a radial piston pump. The pump circulates pressurized, environmentally-friendly, HEES hydraulic fluid in a closed loop to an axial piston motor which drives an electrical generator, with a resistive load. The performance of the components, subsystems and system were evaluated during simulated tidal cycles. The pump is contained in a tank for immersion testing. The COTS pump and motor were selected to scale to MW size and were oversized for the TRL- 4 demonstration, operating at only 1 - 6 % of rated values. Nevertheless, in for 2 - 18 kW drive power, in agreement with manufacturer performance data, we measured efficiencies of 85 - 90 % and 75 - 80 % for the pump and motor, respectively. These efficiencies being 95 - 96 % at higher operating powers. (2) Two follow-on paths were identified. In both cases conventional turbine systems can be modified, replacing existing gear box and generator with a hydraulic pump and on-shore components. On a conventional path, a TRL 5 / 6 15 kW turbine system can be engineered and tested on a barge at an existing site in Maine. Alternatively, on an accelerated path, a TRL- 8 100 kW system can be engineered and tested by modifying a team member's existing MHK turbines, with barge and grid-connected test sites in-place. On both paths the work can be expedited and cost effective by reusing TRL- 4 components, modifying existing turbines and using established test sites. (3) Sizing, performance modeling and costing of a scaled 15 MW system, suitable for operation in Maine's Western Passage, was performed. COTS components are identified and the performance projections are favorable. The estimated LCOE is comparable to wind generation with peak production at high demand times. (4) We determined that a similar HET approach can be extended to on-shore and off-shore wind turbine systems. These are very large energy resources which can be addressed in parallel for even great National benefit. (5) Preliminary results on this project were presented at two International Conferences on renewable energy in 2012, providing a timely dissemination of information. We have thus demonstrated a proof-in-concept of a novel, tidal HET system that eliminates all submerged gears and electronics to improve reliability. Hydraulic pump efficiencies of 90 % have been confirmed in simulated tidal flows between 1 and 3 m/s, and at only 1 - 6 % of rated power. Total system efficiencies have also been modeled, up to MW-scale, for tidal, and wind, systems. Projected efficiencies are between 81 % (full rated flow) and 86 % (1 / 3 rated flow). This high efficiency in a wide operating range compares favorably with conventional systems having a performance range of 87 % (full rated flow) to 0 % (1 / 3 rated flow) efficiency.

The experimental campaign {{has been carried out}} in cold water at design and off- design conditions (80 %, 100 % and 120 % of the design flow rate) both in non-cavitating and cavitating regimes. The paper illustrates the different trends of the rotordynamic forces on the axial and <b>radial</b> <b>pumps</b> and highlights their contributions on the overall turbomachine. At positive whirl ratios, the behavior of the inducer is dominant while, at negative ones, both the pumps show the same trends {{in such a way that}} the overall behavior is roughly the sum of each single component...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{refers to}} the {{behavior}} of a vaneless diffuser of a <b>radial</b> flow <b>pump</b> in partial flow operating conditions. Some experimental data have been obtained using 2 D/ 2 C PIV and unsteady pressure measurements within the diffuser, in various operating conditions. The experimental results at the lower flow rate are compared with two-dimensionnal numerical calculations...|$|R
40|$|A new mode of {{operation}} using only {{the second stage of}} the LBL ECR has been developed. This single stage mode produces charge states and currents equal to or better than the traditional two stage operation of the LBL ECR for a variety of gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The critical parameter for this mode appears to be conditioning the plasma chamber walls with a coating of SiO 2. Various models to explain this effect will be discussed along with implications for ECR ion source design. A new Advanced ECR ion source which will operate at 14 GHz is being designed for the 88 - Inch Cyclotron. Construction is scheduled to begin in the fall of 1988 and test operation should begin in the fall of 1989. The design includes hollow core copper wire solenoids, iron yoke, a Nd-Fe-B sextupole, <b>radial</b> <b>pumping,</b> and access to the plasma chamber...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of a}} <b>radial</b> flow <b>pump</b> impeller with 2 D curvature blade geometry. Investigation {{of the behavior of}} the above impeller for a wide flow rate range and for various rotational speeds was carried out and the obtained experimental results were validated with available measurements of the same impeller within spiral casing.
