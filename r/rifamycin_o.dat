40|$|AbstractIt {{was found}} that enzyme from a {{microbial}} strain, Monocillium spp. ATCC 20621, catalyzed the oxidative reaction of rifamycin B to form <b>rifamycin</b> <b>O.</b> The identification of the reaction products suggested that the reaction proceeded by the oxidative cyclization of rifamycin B to give <b>rifamycin</b> <b>O,</b> which spontaneously hydrolyzed to rifamycin S in neutral aqueous milieu. The characteristic of the enzyme was different as {{compared with that of}} other polyphenol oxidases such as laccase. It is proposed that this new type of enzyme be classified into a subgroup EC 1. 10. 3. 6 with a trival name rifamycin B oxidase...|$|E
40|$|Patterns of inter-species {{secondary}} metabolite production by bacteria can provide valuable {{information relating to}} species ecology and evolution. The complex nature of this chemical diversity has previously been probed via directed analyses of {{a small number of}} compounds, identified through targeted assays rather than more comprehensive biochemical profiling approaches such as metabolomics. Insights into ecological and evolutionary relationships within bacterial genera can be derived through comparative analysis of broader {{secondary metabolite}} patterns, and this can also eventually assist biodiscovery search strategies for new natural products. Here, we investigated the species-level chemical diversity of the two marine actinobacterial species Salinispora arenicola and Salinispora pacifica, isolated from sponges distributed across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), via their secondary metabolite profiles using LC-MS-based metabolomics. The chemical profiles of these two species were obtained by UHPLC-QToF-MS based metabolic profiling. The resultant data were interrogated using multivariate data analysis methods to compare their (bio) chemical profiles. We found a high level of inter-species diversity in strains from these two bacterial species. We also found rifamycins and saliniketals were produced exclusively by S. arenicola species, as the main secondary metabolites differentiating the two species. Furthermore, the discovery of 57 candidate compounds greatly increases the small number of secondary metabolites previously known to be produced by these species. In addition, we report the production of <b>rifamycin</b> <b>O</b> and W, a key group of ansamycin compounds, in S. arenicola for the first time. Species of the marine actinobacteria harbour a much wider spectrum of secondary metabolites than suspected, and this knowledge may prove a rich field for biodiscovery as well as a database for understanding relationships between speciation, evolution and chemical ecology...|$|E
