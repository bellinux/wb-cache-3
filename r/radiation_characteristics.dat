5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of remote sensing. Passive sensors detect natural {{radiation}} that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors and in environmental remote sensing, the sensors used are tuned to specific wavelengths from far infrared through visible light frequencies to the far ultraviolet. The volumes of data that can be collected are very large and require dedicated computational support [...] The output of data analysis from remote sensing are false colour images which differentiate small differences in the <b>radiation</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the environment being monitored. With a skilful operator choosing specific channels it is possible to amplify differences which are imperceptible to the human eye.
