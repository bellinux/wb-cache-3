6000|$|The idea of {{the work}} {{occurred}} to me when exploring South-western Africa in 1850-51. I felt acutely {{at that time the}} impossibility of obtaining sufficient information on the subjects of which it treats; for though the natives of that country taught me a great deal, it was obvious that their acquaintance with bush lore was exceedingly partial and limited. Then remembering how the traditional maxims and methods of travelling in each country differ from those of others, and how every traveller discovers some useful contrivances for himself, it appeared to me, that I should do welcome service to all who have to rough it--whether explorers, emigrants, missionaries or soldiers,*--by collecting the scattered experiences of many such persons in various circumstances, collating them, examining into their principles, and deducing from them what might fairly be called an [...] "Art of Travel." [...] To this end, on my return home, I searched through a vast number of geographical works, I sought information from numerous travellers of distinction and I made a point of <b>re-testing,</b> in every needful case, what I had read or learned by hearsay.|$|E
60|$|So, we {{were left}} there alone, all that {{stifling}} day, in the Canal Rest House, testing and <b>re-testing</b> our story of The Boy's death {{to see if it}} was weak at any point. A native turned up in the afternoon, but we said that a Sahib was dead of cholera, and he ran away. As the dusk gathered, the Major told me all his fears about The Boy, and awful stories of suicide or nearly-carried-out suicide--tales that made one's hair crisp. He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the Shadow as the Boy, when he was young and new to the country; so he understood how things fought together in The Boy's poor jumbled head. He also said that youngsters, in their repentant moments, consider their sins much more serious and ineffaceable than they really are. We talked together all through the evening, and rehearsed the story of the death of The Boy. As soon as the moon was up, and The Boy, theoretically, just buried, we struck across country for the Station. We walked from eight till six o'clock in the morning; but though we were dead-tired, we did not forget to go to The Boy's room and put away his revolver with the proper amount of cartridges in the pouch. Also to set his writing-case on the table. We found the Colonel and reported the death, feeling more like murderers than ever. Then we went to bed and slept the clock round; for there was no more in us.|$|E

40|$|At Volvo Cars Corporation in Gothenburg, Sweden, the On-Board-Diagnostic {{certification}} {{process is}} performed in-house {{and it has}} been concluded that there is room for improvement concerning the procedure. Historically collected data has shown {{that a large number of}} <b>re-tests</b> were made during the certification as a result of faulty certification tests. In order to cover up for parts of this faultiness, this project has been undertaken with purpose to identify the most critical errors occurring during the certification process and suggest how the errors can be overcome. With the aim of identifying the most critical errors during the procedure, data was collected in which interviews and surveys were held with three different roles; software engineers, test operators and mechanics who are directly involved in the certification procedure. This effort contributed to one portion of the data that was used in the error selection process while observations and historical data represented the other portion of data. The outcome of the data collection clearly shows that the majority of all <b>re-tests</b> made were dependent on problems related to the software used in the cars. In order to tackle the software related problems, the author made a review of three different improvement models; DMAIC, 8 D and Shainin. The results of this comparison showed that a combination of DMAIC and 8 D frameworks were best suitable to be applied for the project. The application of these improvement strategies on the software problem led to three different causes, in which each cause had between one and three proposed solutions. The improvement project was led by the researcher in which he was responsible for all activities related to the problem resolution...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{attention}} restoration theory, directed attention is a limited physiological resource and is susceptible to fatigue by overuse. Natural environments are a healthy resource, which allows and promotes the restoration of individuals within it from their state of directed attention fatigue. This process is called the environmental restoration on individuals, and it is affected both positively and negatively by environmental factors. Aims: By considering the relationship among the three components of soundscape, that is, people, sound and the environment, this study aims to explore the effects of soundscape on the environmental restoration in urban natural environments. Materials and Methods: A field experiment was conducted with 70 participants (four groups) in an urban natural environment (Shenyang, China). Directed attention was first depleted with a 50 -min 'consumption' phase, followed by a baseline measurement of attention level. Three groups then engaged in 40 min of restoration in the respective environments with similar visual surroundings but with different sounds present, after which attention levels were <b>re-Tested.</b> The fourth group did not undergo restoration and was immediately <b>re-Tested.</b> The {{difference between the two}} test scores, corrected for the practice effect, represents {{the attention}} restoration of individuals exposed to the respective environments. Statistical Analysis Used: An analysis of variance was performed, demonstrating that the differences between the mean values for each group were statistically significant [sig. = 0. 027 (< 0. 050) ]. Results: The results showed that the mean values (confidence interval of 95 %) of each group are as follows: 'natural sounds group' (8. 4), 'traffic sounds group' (2. 4) and 'machine sounds group' (- 1. 8). Conclusion: It can be concluded that (1) urban natural environments, with natural sounds, {{have a positive effect on}} the restoration of an individuals' attention and (2) the presence of different types of sounds has significantly divergent effects on the environmental restoration...|$|R
