5|$|Another {{class of}} {{phytohormones}} is the jasmonates, first {{isolated from the}} oil of Jasminum grandiflorum which regulates wound <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> plants by unblocking the expression of genes required in the systemic acquired resistance response to pathogen attack.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{can make}} {{nutrients}} and minerals {{in the soil}} available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress <b>responses.</b> <b>In</b> general a more diverse set of soil microbes results in fewer plant diseases and higher yield.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
30|$|Biological agents used {{included}} etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab. Etanercept {{was used}} in 6 cases giving complete <b>response</b> <b>in</b> 3, partial <b>response</b> <b>in</b> 2 and no benefit in 1 case. Adalimumab {{was used in}} 2 cases, resulting <b>in</b> complete <b>response</b> <b>in</b> both cases (score 3).

5|$|As Chen {{was born}} in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E
5|$|Basket {{cells in}} CA3 receive {{excitatory}} {{input from the}} pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
2500|$|Another useful {{dynamic test}} {{involves}} measuring {{the response to}} exogenous steroids; individuals with AIS show a decreased <b>response</b> <b>in</b> serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) after a short term administration of anabolic steroids. [...] Two studies [...] indicate that measuring the <b>response</b> <b>in</b> SHBG after the administration of stanozolol could help to differentiate individuals with PAIS from those with other causes of ambiguous genitalia, although the <b>response</b> <b>in</b> individuals with predominantly male phenotypes overlaps somewhat with the <b>response</b> <b>in</b> normal males.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of Surfactant Protein A seemed to trigger an inflammatory <b>response</b> <b>in</b> the uterus of the mice, but later studies found an anti-inflammatory <b>response</b> <b>in</b> humans. In fact, {{the level of}} SP-A in a human uterus typically decreases during labor.|$|R
40|$|Poor ovarian <b>response</b> <b>in</b> IVF cycles is {{associated}} with diminished ovarian reserve and poor pregnancy outcome. Little is known about pregnancy outcome after a poor <b>response</b> <b>in</b> women with a normal ovarian reserve. This retrospective study studied women undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection between January 2003 to December 2008 in the FertilityPLUS Clinic in Auckland, New Zealand. All women with a poor <b>response</b> <b>in</b> the first cycle were selected. Primary outcome was live birth after the second cycle. Secondary outcomes were poor <b>response</b> <b>in</b> the second cycle and the predictive values of female age and basal FSH at first cycle and IVF outcome at second cycle. Of the 2487 women starting IVF, 142 women (5. 7 %) with a poor <b>response</b> <b>in</b> the first cycle were selected, of which 66 (46. 5 %) women had a repeated poor <b>response</b> <b>in</b> the second cycle. There were 31 live births in the second cycle (21. 8 %). Female age was the only significant predictor for repeated poor response (AUC 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 78) and clinical pregnancy (AUC 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 57 - 0. 75), but the predictive value was low. Therefore poor <b>response</b> <b>in</b> women with a normal ovarian reserve {{should not be a}} reason to discontinue further IVF treatment.

5|$|Jeopardy! is an American {{television}} {{game show}} created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants {{are presented with}} general knowledge clues {{in the form of}} answers, and must phrase their <b>responses</b> <b>in</b> the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by Sony Pictures Television, premiered on September 10, 1984, and is still airing.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal.

5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive <b>responses.</b> <b>In</b> large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E

5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional <b>responses.</b> <b>In</b> its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
