5000|$|<b>Star</b> <b>thistle</b> is a {{valuable}} source of pollen, thus nectar for pollinators. Yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle,</b> a noted pest plant, is a major nectar source for many central valley and foothill butterflies. <b>Star</b> <b>Thistle</b> populates ground that has been abused: dry, compacted, or scraped clean. A plant with a tap root system, it has {{a crucial role in}} restoring the soil by bringing up vital micronutrients. Similar to many plants classified as 'weeds', they [...] "quickly establish in, protect, and restore soil that has been left exposed by natural and human-caused disturbances".|$|R
