5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of <b>relative</b> <b>positioning</b> and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

40|$|There {{appears to}} be a growing {{recognition}} among economists and other social commentators that people attempt to enhance their <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> (which is commonly described as status) through consumption choices and other behaviour. It has been less common to consider whether attempts to enhance <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> impact on saving behaviour. This thesis makes a number of contributions relating to the impact of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> on saving behaviour. In this thesis I: - consider why concern for <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> may impact on saving behaviour. I demonstrate, with a simple intertemporal model the surprising result that when people are concerned with <b>relative</b> <b>position,</b> income risk can lead to most people saving less and the rich saving more. - conduct an empirical study to test the importance of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> on saving behaviour. I find a statistically and economically significant relationship between peer income and saving behaviour consistent with theories that people actively forgo saving to seek to enhance their <b>relative</b> <b>position.</b> I use the data to demonstrate that <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> can help to explain why prior research has consistently found that the rich have higher saving rates. - consider the policy implications of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> to saving behaviour. I examine the policies, primarily corrective taxation, that have been advocated to address externalities of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> in a static setting. I find that there are significant issues when these policies are considered in an intertemporal setting. I examine the policy of mandatory saving in addressing distortions caused by <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> and the possibility that concern for <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> improves the effectiveness of mandatory saving policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the influence on {{estimates of the}} value of statistical life (VSL) of the worker’s <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> in the wage distribution and <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> in the life cycle. Whereas past work on <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> effects in the labor market have been based on illustrative hypothetical examples, this paper develops empirical tests using actual market behavior. To test for the effect of <b>relative</b> wage <b>position,</b> we use two different measures: the individual’s wage rank in the state and the wage rank by gender in the state. Using the CPS coupled with constructed BLS fatality risk measures by industry and occupation group, we show that inclusion of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> variables in a canonical wage equation reduces VSL estimates by 25 - 33 %. This effect is the opposite of what the <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> theorists have hypothesized. In contrast, recognition of the worker’s <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> within the life cycle raises VSL estimates by up to 20 %, especially for older workers. ...|$|R

The proper initial length of each suspender is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment <b>relative</b> <b>positioning</b> and equality of load distribution amongst the several suspenders of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the falsework) and all suspender cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the main cable. A jacking saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single main cable.|$|E

These are graph drawings where the vertices are {{the elements of}} the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the edges and the <b>relative</b> <b>positioning</b> of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element x is smaller than (precedes) y then there exists a path from x to y that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the divides relation).|$|E

That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear, and the <b>relative</b> <b>positioning</b> of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded. According to art critic Rose-Marie Hagen, [...] "The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him, when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition." [...] Hagen also notes the historically baseless inclusion of women on the battlefield, attributing it to Altdorfer's [...] "passion for invention" [...] and saying they [...] "look like German courtly ladies, dressed for a hunting party" [...] in their feathered toques.|$|E

40|$|Do richer {{friends and}} neighbors improve your health through {{positive}} material effects, or do they make you feel worse through the negative effect of social comparison and relative deprivation? Using the newly available National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) data set that reports individuals' income positions within their self-defined social networks, this paper examines {{whether there is an}} association between <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> and health in the US. Because this study uses measures of individuals' positions within their self-defined social groups rather than researcher-imputed measures of <b>relative</b> <b>position,</b> I am able to more precisely examine linkages between individual <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> and health. I find a relationship between <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> and health status, and find indirect support for the biological mechanism underlying the relative deprivation model: lower <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> tends to be associated with those health conditions thought to be linked to physiological stress. I also find, however, that only extremes of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> matter: very low <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> is associated with worse self-rated physical health and mobility, increased overall disease burden, and increased reporting of cardiovascular morbidity; very high <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> is associated with lower probabilities of reporting diabetes, ulcers, and hypertension. I observe few associations between health and either moderately high or moderately low positions. This analysis suggests that the mechanism underlying the relative deprivation model may only have significant effects for those at the very bottom or the very top.

40|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} an individual's <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> {{in a community}} or population influences their health because (1) unfavorable comparisons lead those with a lower position to experience negative emotions that cause stress and detrimentally impact health and well-being, and (2) individuals with different statuses {{are less likely to}} develop trust and cohesion with one another. These processes are important for individual health and also because their results may detract from community level social resources. Surprisingly little work has investigated this hypothesis within small units of analysis such as neighborhoods. In this research, logistic regression analyses were conducted on data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to test the <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> hypothesis as it applies to distrust of neighbors and fair or poor self-rated health, and whether the relationship varies across neighborhood income inequality. Results indicate that <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> significantly predicts distrust, such that those with higher local position are more likely to distrust their comparatively lower income neighbors. <b>Relative</b> <b>position</b> was not significantly associated with self-rated health, but lack of trust of neighbors was significantly and positively associated with below average self-rated health. The effect of <b>relative</b> <b>position</b> did not vary across neighborhood income inequality for either outcome.
