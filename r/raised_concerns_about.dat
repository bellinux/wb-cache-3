40|$|Apology of the Albanian Issue {{written by}} Masar Stavileci 1 and The Disagreement written by Ismail Kadare 2 are two works written in {{different}} space and time, and different circumstances, but which correspond {{with each other}} for the serious <b>concerns</b> <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> the Albanian people. While the first author (Stavileci) <b>raises</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> erosion from the outside and from the inside {{as a result of the}} lack of coordination of internal major interests, the second author (Kadare) <b>raises</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the “erosion” within the Albanians themselves. Stavileci, writing during the pre-war time in Kosovo (1999), <b>raises</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the damage to the national development, spiritual, moral and psychological pan-Albanian development, as a result not only of foreign chauvinistic assaults, but also of the oligarchy and the inability of the Albanian political and intellectual class who, in dramatic conditions and situations of our people were to exceed themselves, thus leaving behind them narrow and small-minded political interests and bring together the divided Albanian nation; while, Kadare (2010) <b>raises</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the consequences of some individuals eroding the identity and values of the Albanian soul. Although written in various times and various geopolitical circumstances, both works meet with the concerns they raise: the preservation and strengthening of physical and spiritual Albanian integrity...|$|R

The 2007 collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis <b>raised</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> {{the stability of the}} skyway, one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar design features. Within days of the collapse, NJDOT announced that it would start a previously planned one-year, $10-million project to make critical repairs. The work was the first phase of a planned 10-year, $200-million interim renovation project, the first significant repairs since 1984.|$|E

Negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority were centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made on August 3, 1966, that the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the real estate tax rate increased.|$|E

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had <b>raised</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have <b>raised</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{plans to}} extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway {{interchange}} through Escondido were delayed by Caltrans director Jacob Dekema {{due to a lack}} of funding until 1980. However, in 1970, the community <b>raised</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the number of buildings that would need to be destroyed, as the freeway would go through a dense urban area. Other routes, including routing SR78 along I-15 south, were proposed. The majority of the Escondido City Council supported sending representatives to the upcoming California Coastal Commission meeting in January 1971 to expedite the process of construction.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes <b>raised</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors <b>raised</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E
