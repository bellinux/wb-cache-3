Yogurt is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness. Breakfast items include dosa, pesarattu (mung bean dosa), vada, and idli.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{he looked}} about gloomily. The weather had changed, a moist west wind drove heavy clouds {{across the sky}} and the fell-tops were hidden by mist. It {{threatened}} a wet hay-time and hay was scarce in the dale, where they generally cut it late after feeding sheep on the meadows. Osborn farmed some of his land and had hoped for a good crop, which he needed. The grass in the big meadow by the beck was long and getting ripe, but the <b>red</b> <b>sorrel</b> that grew among it had lost its bright color. The filling heads rolled in waves before the wind, but there was something dull and lifeless in the noise they made, and Osborn knew what this meant. Rain was coming and when rain began in the dale it did not stop.|$|E
6000|$|For example. He had wisely {{chosen a}} broad strip of linen {{as a means}} of {{fastening}} her to his loom when he was busy: it made a broad belt round her waist, and was long enough to allow of her reaching the truckle-bed and sitting down on it, but not long enough for her to attempt any dangerous climbing. One bright summer's morning Silas had been more engrossed than usual in [...] "setting up" [...] a new piece of work, an occasion on which his scissors were in requisition. These scissors, owing to an especial warning of Dolly's, had been kept carefully out of Eppie's reach; but the click of them had had a peculiar attraction for her ear, and watching the results of that click, she had derived the philosophic lesson that the same cause would produce the same effect. Silas had seated himself in his loom, and the noise of weaving had begun; but he had left his scissors on a ledge which Eppie's arm was long enough to reach; and now, like a small mouse, watching her opportunity, she stole quietly from her corner, secured the scissors, and toddled to the bed again, setting up her back as a mode of concealing the fact. She had a distinct intention as {{to the use of the}} scissors; and having cut the linen strip in a jagged but effectual manner, in two moments she had run out at the open door where the sunshine was inviting her, while poor Silas believed her to be a better child than usual. It was not until he happened to need his scissors that the terrible fact burst upon him: Eppie had run out by herself--had perhaps fallen into the Stone-pit. Silas, shaken by the worst fear that could have befallen him, rushed out, calling [...] "Eppie!" [...] and ran eagerly about the unenclosed space, exploring the dry cavities into which she might have fallen, and then gazing with questioning dread at the smooth red surface of the water. The cold drops stood on his brow. How long had she been out? There was one hope--that she had crept through the stile and got into the fields, where he habitually took her to stroll. But the grass was high in the meadow, and there was no descrying her, if she were there, except by a close search that would be a trespass on Mr. Osgood's crop. Still, that misdemeanour must be committed; and poor Silas, after peering all round the hedgerows, traversed the grass, beginning with perturbed vision to see Eppie behind every group of <b>red</b> <b>sorrel,</b> and to see her moving always farther off as he approached. The meadow was searched in vain; and he got over the stile into the next field, looking with dying hope towards a small pond which was now reduced to its summer shallowness, so as to leave a wide margin of good adhesive mud. Here, however, sat Eppie, discoursing cheerfully to her own small boot, which she was using as a bucket to convey the water into a deep hoof-mark, while her little naked foot was planted comfortably on a cushion of olive-green mud. A red-headed calf was observing her with alarmed doubt through the opposite hedge.|$|E
50|$|La Reina (also {{known as}} the Creole cattle) is a Nicaraguan local breed {{originating}} from the Bos taurus varieties brought to America during the Spanish colonization in the 15th century. In the 1950s Joaquin Reyna and her uncle Juan Diego Sol, both being Nicaraguan breeders, formed a herd with approximately 200 females with typical characteristics of Creole cattle from which the Reyna breed was created, their name originating from Juan Diego Sol himself. Selection of animals was focused on <b>red</b> coat colour (<b>sorrel)</b> and milk production. The Nicaraguan government started an official inventory in the 1970s and in 1988 the Reyna cattle were declared as national patrimony, and {{in conjunction with the}} National Agrarian University of Nicaragua (Universidad Nacional Agraria) (UNA) agreed to a genetic improvement program of the cattle.The purebred Reyna Creole cattle population in Nicaragua consists of about 650 purebred females, including calves, heifers and cows distributed in five herds. Considering four herds with records the number of cows presently amount to 285.|$|R
60|$|The Green {{lay at the}} {{extremity}} of the village, {{and from}} it the road branched off in two directions, one leading farther up the hill by the church, and the other winding gently down towards the valley. On {{the side of the}} Green that led towards the church, the broken line of thatched cottages was continued nearly to the churchyard gate; but on the opposite northwestern side, there was nothing to obstruct the view of gently swelling meadow, and wooded valley, and dark masses of distant hill. That rich undulating district of Loamshire to which Hayslope belonged lies close to a grim outskirt of Stonyshire, overlooked by its barren hills as a pretty blooming sister may sometimes be seen linked in the arm of a rugged, tall, swarthy brother; and in two or three hours' ride the traveller might exchange a bleak treeless region, intersected by lines of cold grey stone, for one where his road wound under the shelter of woods, or up swelling hills, muffled with hedgerows and long meadow-grass and thick corn; and where at every turn he came upon some fine old country-seat nestled in the valley or crowning the slope, some homestead with its long length of barn and its cluster of golden ricks, some grey steeple looking out from a pretty confusion of trees and thatch and dark-red tiles. It was just such a picture as this last that Hayslope Church had made to the traveller as he began to mount the gentle slope leading to its pleasant uplands, and now from his station near the Green he had before him in one view nearly all the other typical features of this pleasant land. High up against the horizon were the huge conical masses of hill, like giant mounds intended to fortify this region of corn and grass against the keen and hungry winds of the north; not distant enough to be clothed in purple mystery, but with sombre greenish sides visibly specked with sheep, whose motion was only revealed by memory, not detected by sight; wooed from day to day by the changing hours, but responding with no change in themselves--left for ever grim and sullen after the flush of morning, the winged gleams of the April noonday, the parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun. And directly below them the eye rested on a more advanced line of hanging woods, divided by bright patches of pasture or furrowed crops, and not yet deepened into the uniform leafy curtains of high summer, but still showing the warm tints of the young oak and the tender green of the ash and lime. Then came the valley, where the woods grew thicker, as if they had rolled down and hurried together from the patches left smooth on the slope, that they might take the better care of the tall mansion which lifted its parapets and sent its faint blue summer smoke among them. Doubtless there was a large sweep of park and a broad glassy pool in front of that mansion, but the swelling slope of meadow would not let our traveller see them from the village green. He saw instead a foreground which was just as lovely--the level sunlight lying like transparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered grass and the tall <b>red</b> <b>sorrel,</b> and the white ambels of the hemlocks lining the bushy hedgerows. It was that moment in summer when the sound of the scythe being whetted makes us cast more lingering looks at the flower-sprinkled tresses of the meadows.|$|E

There are three distinct carving periods {{to be found}} among the horses while all of the horses feature detachable [...] "pillows" [...] or saddles. Two of the styles are differentiated by the mane carving styles, and are traceable back to the Armitage Herschell Company and the Herschell Spillman Company, while two horses {{are thought to have}} been carved by Charles Dare. [...] One of the horses was missing from the carousel for nearly 15 years. It was thought lost until being discovered in the garage of a house which a person had just bought. It was in very poor condition upon return and was sent to a carver in Missoula, Montana for intensive restoration. While some of the horses are painted to resemble common breeds, many are named and painted in remembrance of horses known or owned by the sponsors. The horses range in color from Appaloosa and <b>Red</b> <b>Sorrel</b> to an African Paint. The breeds are as diverse as the colors and include a Morgan horse, wild mustang, and even a Zebra.

Vegetable production increases every year, this development causes the proliferation of pests and pathogens. In 2012, study was conducted in three market garden perimeters in Libreville and Owendo to ensure a sustainable pest control. Records of yellow traps and weekly visual observations were made in plots of pigweed (Amaranthus sp. Amaranthaceae), of <b>red</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Hibiscus sabdariffa L, Malavaceae), of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill, Solanaceae) and of cabbage (Brassica oleracea L., Brassicaceae). A total of 7119 insects were counted and taxonomically classified into 8 separate orders including 81 families. The main pests were represented by 4 families: Aphididae (31. 0 %), Cecidomyiidae (5. 1 %), Chrysomelidae (4. 0 %), Thripidae (2. 0 %) and 6 families of useful insects (pollinators and predators) : Dolichopodidae (5. 4 %), Andrenidae (2. 6 %), Coccinellidae (1. 7 %), Syrphidae (0. 6 %), Braconidae (0. 5 %), Hemerobiidae (0. 1 %).

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{study of}} the effects of {{cropping}} systems on buried weed seed is very costly. Most of the experiments of this nature were conducted prior to the introduction of herbicides. New techniques, material and methods are needed and could result in more research in this area of study. A polyester material was experimented with which provided a means for mechanically washing buried weed seed packets. This was accomplished through the development of an experimental seed packet washer. The washer and the polyester material made it possible to wash the soil from delicate seedlings growing inside the packets without damage to them. They in turn could be examined without removal from the seed packets making the procedure many times more economical. A seed removal technique was also developed which worked well in separating weed seed from mineral soil samples. This was accomplished by making slight modifications in the experimental seed packet washer regarding screening,. slope, water volume and the usage of various sizes of soil sieves. An economical bioassay method for studying the effects of crop leachates on <b>red</b> <b>sorrel</b> and rice germination and growth was also developed while simultaneously testing cropping system effects on buried weed seed in the greenhouse and field. This method and technique holds promise for other types of plant experiments involving liquid and culture media. Thirty-seven monoculture cropping systems were tested in the greenhouse and fourteen in the field for their effects on nine different buried weed seed species. Evidence is provided to show that broccoli, beans, asparagus, quackgrass, tomatoes and other plants fray be inhibitory to the subsequent germination and viability of the buried seed of Rumex acetosella L., Rumex crispus L., Brassica campestris L. and Amaranthus retroflexus L...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Imaging {{spectra of}} plant tissues yield {{considerable}} potential and useful information for basic studies and agriculture practice. We constructed an imaging spectrophotometer with spectral range from 400 nm to 1100 nm, {{which was used}} to study various physiological events of plant germplasm: location of bundle sheath and mesophyll cells in sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.); chlorophyll b deficiency of ornamental perennial grass (Millium effusum L. var. aureum); respiration rate of soybean roots (Glycine max Merr. var. Yuusuzumi); concentration of azosulfamide dye of apple (Malus domestica Borkh. var. Red Rome) flower buds; sucrose concentration and invertase activity in stems of hazel (Corylus avellana L. var. Barcelona); in vivo effects of a fungal pathogenPestalotiopsis microspora) and its phytotoxin in the foliage of the rare nutmeg (stinking) cedar or yew of Florida (Torreya taxifolia Am.) foliage; time course of water displacement by heavy water (deuterium oxide) in rossele (Jamaica sorrel, Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) leaves; water path estimation using mixtures of deuterium oxide. A novel algorithm was found to measure the estimated quantum yield image (YÂ¹). An imaging fluorometer based on this algorithm was constructed and tested for agriculture application: photoinhibition of photosynthesis, very early determination of freeze damage, herbicide effects and invasion by fungal pathogens in Scrofularia nodosa 'Variegata'. Excellent results were also obtained in testing four toxins: pestalopyrone, hydroxypestalopyrone, pestaloside, and triticone on three varieties (non soong, <b>red</b> <b>sorrel,</b> and altissima) on Hibiscus sabdariffa L. Triticone damage was still very obvious after 24 hours. Pestalopyrone effects disappear several hours after injection showing that photosynthetic function recovers rapidly from the pestalopyrone damage. Possibility of using chlorophyll protein complexes (CPX) in vivo for digital imaging storage, and {{the potential of the}} algorithm in remote sciences are also illustrated and discussed. Using optical correlation interferometry, a novel method for plant sciences, we imaged In vivo the z-direction, perpendicular to the leaf surface, through Tradescantia zebrina leaves. Non-invasively we: determined the number of major cell layers, followed the time sequence of decrease in depth of the cells z-axes after exposure of tissues to high salt, and observed disruption of cells caused by freezing and thawing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractâConsumers are {{demanding}} novel beverages that are healthier, convenient and have appealing consumer acceptance. The objectives {{of this study}} were to investigate the effects of adding grape polyphenols and the influence of presenting health claims on the sensory acceptability of wines. Fresh <b>red</b> <b>sorrel</b> calyces were fermented into wines. The total soluble solids of the pectinase-treated sorrel puree were from 4 Â°Brix to 23. 8 Â°Brix. Polyphenol in the form of grape pomace extract was added to sorrel wines (w/v) in specified levels to give 0. 25. 50 and 75 ppm. A focus group comprising of 12 panelists was use to select the level of polyphenol to be added to sorrel wines for sensory preference The sensory attributed of the wines which were evaluated were colour, clarity, aroma, flavor, mouth-feel, sweetness, astringency and overall preference. The sorrel wine which was most preferred from focus group evaluation was presented for hedonic rating. In the first stage of hedonic testing, the sorrel wine was served chilled at 7 Â°C for 24 h prior to sensory evaluation. Each panelist was provided with a questionnaire and was asked to rate the wines on colour, aroma, flavor, mouth-feel, sweetness, astringency and overall acceptability using a 9 -point hedonic scale. In the second stage of hedonic testing, the panelist were instructed to read a health abstract on the health benefits of polyphenolic compounds and again to rate sorrel wine with added 25 ppm polyphenol. Paired t-test was used for the analysis of the influence of presenting health information on polyphenols on hedonic scoring of sorrel wines. Focus groups found that the addition of polyphenol addition had no significant effect on sensory color and aroma but affected clarity and flavor. A 25 ppm wine was liked moderately in overall acceptability. The presentation of information on the health benefit of polyphenols in sorrel wines to panelists had no significant influence on the sensory acceptance of wine. More than half of panelists would drink this wine now and then. This wine had color L 19. 86 Â± 0. 68, chroma 2. 10 Â± 0. 12, hue Â° 16. 90 Â± 3. 10 and alcohol content of 13. 0 %.
