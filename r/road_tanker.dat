25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated <b>road</b> <b>tanker.</b> The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by <b>road</b> <b>tanker.</b>|$|E
25|$|Phases 2 and 3 {{would be}} {{undertaken}} between 2015 and 2030. Further aircraft parking stands {{would be built}} {{to the east of}} the terminal, and a taxiway would be constructed alongside and to the south of the runway, to avoid the need for aircraft to back-track on the runway. Both these developments would involve further reduction in the water area of the King George V Dock. The existing fuel farm would be relocated to a site at the east of the airport, where it could be supplied by barge, and linked to a hydrant based supply system, thus eliminating both <b>road</b> <b>tanker</b> deliveries and on-airport fuel bowser movements. The existing surface car park would be replaced by a multi-storey car park, allowing extension of the vehicle drop-off and pick up area. The jet centre and hangar facilities would be further extended. Finally the existing terminal building would be replaced.|$|E

2500|$|Logistics of the airport's {{construction}} were critical, {{because of}} the island's isolated location {{and the lack of}} construction equipment, which would require everything such as extremely heavy duty equipment and materials to be shipped in, thus resulting in a huge and unique logistics operation. Due to the limited landing infrastructure, with no breakwater or mooring facilities at the sea front, new harbour facilities capable of handling construction equipment and fuel supplies were constructed at Rupert's Bay. Fuel transfers between Rupert's Bay and the aerodrome, connected by a [...] haul road, were assumed to be by <b>road</b> <b>tanker</b> for 20 years, after which a capital allowance was made for enlargement of the bulk fuel storage and the installation of a fuel transfer pipeline.|$|E
2500|$|By Colton Junction, Tornado {{had reduced}} the lag to 2minutes, {{but due to}} a series of signals at the yellow warning aspect, on arrival at the York water stop, Tornado was again 5minutes behind schedule. A quick stop meant that she left York on time, having been {{serviced}} by a <b>road</b> <b>tanker.</b> The time taken from London to reach Peterborough, Grantham and York were all preservation era records. Back on schedule and nearing the finish line, Tornado was forced to slow down for a stopping train ahead of her, as she approached Waverley. Also, as revealed on the programme, during {{the latter part of the}} race approaching the Berwick stop, Tornado's speed had to be temporarily reduced to [...] due to one of the steam injectors (which is a device which uses the boiler's own steam to transfer water from the tender into the boiler, over-coming the high pressure within the boiler) failing to operate for 10minutes, risking the boiler running dry which would have necessitated dropping the fire to prevent major damage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{development}} of Shaikan - [...] "Phase Zero" [...] - had a target of producing 40,000 barrels of Shaikan crude oil per day. This target was successfully met by the end of 2014. In 2015, the oil was being exported under agreements reached between the Kurdistan Regional Government and the National Government of Iraq. The export was initially using long-distance <b>road</b> <b>tankers</b> to the Turkish coast, but during the summer of 2015 the <b>road</b> <b>tankers</b> began being re-routed along a much shorter distance to the export pipeline at Fishkabur, where the Shaikan crude is injected into the pipeline via a mixing plant operated by DNO. A more efficient arrangement involving the installation of a pipeline connection directly into the Shaikan field is anticipated. On 11 May 2015 an output of 41,345 barrels per day was commemorated with a group photograph in Kurdistan (source: Gulf Keystone Petroleum). In August 2015 the 45,000 barrels per day level was reached.|$|R
