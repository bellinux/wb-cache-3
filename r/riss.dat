The cheater on task assignment is harmed, but so too is the punisher, as all will die without a healthy garden. In this paper we study through simulation the cofoundress interaction with haploid, asexual genotypes which either replace a cheater or not (punishment), under both foundress viscosity (likely for A. versicolor) and random assortment.

40|$|In this article, a novel {{analytical}} approach is presented {{for the analysis}} of electromagnetic (EM) scattering from radially inhomogeneous spherical structures (<b>RISSs)</b> based on the duality principle. According to the spherical symmetry, similar angular dependencies in all the regions are considered using spherical harmonics. To extract the radial dependency, the system of differential equations of wave propagation toward the inhomogeneity direction is equated with the dual planar ones. A general duality between electromagnetic fields and parameters and scattering parameters of the two structures is introduced. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through a comprehensive example. The presented approach substitutes a complicated problem in spherical coordinate to an easy, well posed, and a previously solved problem in planar geometry. This approach is valid for all continuously varying inhomogeneity profiles. One of the major advantages of the proposed method is the capability of studying two general and applicable types of <b>RISSs.</b> As an interesting application, a new class of lens antenna based on the physical concept of the gradient refractive index material is introduced.

40|$|Question: Foundress {{associations}} {{of the desert}} leaf-cutter ant Acromyrmex versicolor exhibit a single forager-foundress prior to worker eclosion. A prior specialized task, removing soil from the nest during excavation, allocates later forager risk. Experiment reveals that a queen refusing such prior assignment is not replaced by her cofoundresses; rather, these latter suicidally punish the shirker, leading to the colony’s demise (<b>Rissing</b> et al. 1996). Why do cofoundresses fail to replace a shirker when failure implies reproductive death? Method: We model cofoundress options as a game in asexual haploid strategies where self preserving replacement of a shirking foundress exists as an alternative (Pollock et al. 2004). Embedding this game in {{the natural history of}} A. versicolor, we simulate populations for 500, 000 years, with 100 replicates under various parameter sets, some deviating significantly from A. versicolor. Shirkers appear through mutation, with suicidal punishers and self preservers mutating one to the other. Results: Self preservation never out-performs suicidal punishment, although it can recur and drift upwards for some time. Whenever forager assignment is retained, suicidal punishment dominates. But stability is stochastic: forager assignment may endure in many to most runs, yet be lost in others. Generally, the greater the frequency of self preservers, the more likely assignment will be lost entirely in the long run. Task coordination endures through suicidal punishment.

30|$|Ants employ two {{different}} ways to increase early colony growth, firstly, Oecophylla and other ant species are known to found new colonies with multiple queens (pleometrosis) {{in order to increase}} the probability of survival during the initial phase of colony development via a faster production of more workers (Peeters and Andersen 1989; Peng et al. 1998; Bernasconi and Strassmann 1999; Offenberg et al. 2012 a). Secondly, adoption of non-nestmate brood from other colonies may increase colony growth as several ant species are known to rob intraspecific brood from neighbouring colonies and in this way accelerate colony growth by adding these robbed individuals to their worker force (Bartz and Hölldobler 1982; <b>Rissing</b> and Pollock 1987). Recent studies have shown that artificial transplantation of pupae to young weaver ant colonies can be utilized to boost their growth (Krag et al. 2010; Offenberg et al. 2012 b; Peng et al. 2013; Ouagoussounon et al. 2013).

40|$|This study {{examines}} how U.

Using a unique dataset, which encompasses the entire population of 1, 441, 856 H- 1 B temporary work visa requests evaluated by government agents from May 2005 to April 2010, I assess whether agents' visa approval and denial decisions are shaped by immigrants' sending country characteristics. Through this program, government agents mediate a key institutional boundary: access to the U. S. labor market, by conferring or withholding "current" legal standing to potential immigrants. Controlling for important application evaluation criteria, I find that immigrant workers from sending countries with lower levels of economic development are less likely to receive approvals for initial and continuing employment requests, all else equal. Government agents' visa approvals may also shape career mobility among those immigrants previously granted legal standing through the evaluation of requests to change jobs or employers. In these evaluations, however, sending country level of economic development is not a statistically significant predictor of approval. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for theories of inequality and labor market mobility, in addition to practical considerations regarding the efficient and fair administration of immigration policy. by Ben A. <b>Rissing.</b> Thesis (S.

25|$|In 1800 Digonet was {{assigned}} to the Army of the Rhine under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and fought at the Battle of Stockach-Engen. Digonet and Pierre François Joseph Durutte were the two brigadiers in the division of Antoine Richepanse in the Army Reserve. The division was made up of the 4th, 50th and 100th Line Infantry Demi Brigades, the 13th Cavalry, 17th Dragoon and 5th Hussar Regiments and a combined grenadier battalion for a total of 6,848 foot and 1,187 horse. At the Battle of Messkirch on 5 May 1800, Moreau brought the Reserve into action late in the day. Austrian commander Paul Kray launched an attack that threatened to cut the Stockach road. Richepanse arrived on the battlefield and took Ignaz Gyulai's division in flank, driving it back. Kray gave up his effort to break down the French flank and retreated to the Danube at Sigmaringen. Digonet was present at the Battle of Biberach on 9 May.

25|$|Archduke Charles stopped {{long enough}} at Pforzheim to {{transfer}} his military stores to the army's wagon train. Moreau {{was surprised by}} his foe's decision to disengage and took several days to digest this information. The French commander planned to attack Pforzheim on 15 July, but by that date Charles was retreating farther to the east. On 21 July, there was a skirmish at Cannstadt near Stuttgart. There were 8,000 Austrians in nine battalions and eight squadrons involved in the clash. From Cannstadt, Charles retreated toward Schwäbisch Gmünd with Moreau following his enemies at a leisurely pace. Meanwhile, the isolated Austrian left wing withdrew through Villingen with Ferino in pursuit. The Swabians and Bavarian began negotiations with the French to quit the war while the Saxons marched away to the north to join Wartensleben's army. When Charles left {{the banks of the}} Rhine he left behind 30,000 troops in garrisons at Mannheim, Philippsburg, Mainz, Königstein im Taunus and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. On 29 July at Biberach an der <b>Riss,</b> the Swabian Regional Contingent was disarmed by Fröhlich on the instructions of Charles. These subtractions left Charles with only three-quarters of the strength of Moreau. On 2 August, Moreau's troops bumped into the Austrians at Geislingen an der Steige and for a week afterward there was constant skirmishing with Charles' rear guard.

30|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of major}} workers increased {{the size of}} intrinsic newly hatching workers. Worker size increased considerably between no transplantation and 100 pupae transplantation and less (and non-significantly) when comparing the 100 and 300 pupae transplantations (Figure  2). As a result the size range of workers in colonies receiving transplanted pupae increased, not only as large sized major workers from mature colonies were added (as pupae) to the nanitic workers, {{but also because the}} mean size of nanitic workers increased. If colony performance increased due to an increased task repertoire based on worker size range, then the adoption of pupae not only benefited the colony in terms of colony size, but also via better task handling. Larger workers may also directly benefit the efficiency of weaver ants in their control of pest species, if the presence of larger workers widens the prey spectrum and the hunting success of the colony (Dejean 1991; Crozier et al. 2010). Production of larger workers does not merely have implication for applied myrmecology. It is well known that adoption of robbed brood takes place under natural conditions in some ant species (Bartz and Hölldobler 1982; <b>Rissing</b> and Pollock 1987; Gadau et al. 2003; Kronauer et al. 2003). If the robbed brood not only adds numbers to the robbing colony but also accelerate its development of larger intrinsic workers and if this leads to increased colony performance, then an additional advantage is gained via brood robbing. Thus, the production of larger workers associated with pupae adoption may help to drive the evolution of brood robbing.|$|R
30|$|Not only colony size {{but also}} worker size {{variation}} {{is an important}} component of labor division in colonies of Oecophylla ants (Dejean 1991). The worker force includes two castes, minor and major workers. Small minor workers are most important in rearing brood, whereas large workers are more important in nest construction, territory defense and foraging for insect prey and transport of sexual brood (Crozier et al. 2010; Dejean 1991), the latter tasks becoming more important with colony size. Brian (1957) and Wood and Tschinkel (1981) indicated colony size as a major factor affecting worker size. Brian (1957) reported that worker size gradually increases in the monomorphic Myrmica rubra until the colony reached about 300 workers, or 10 % of its mature size. Wood and Tschinkel (1981) described the appearance of worker size variation in colonies of Solenopsis invicta of up to about 6000 workers showing that worker head width increase gradually as the colony grows. <b>Rissing</b> (1987) reported that the mean worker size increases during the first year in the polymorphic Veromessor pergandei, but he did not record colony size. Peng et al. (2004) showed that small Oecophylla smaragdina colonies less than 1.5  years old produce smaller and slimmer workers (nanitics). As colony task repertoire and thus the benefits derived from Oecophylla colonies may increase with worker size range and as worker size (and thus size range) may increase with increasing number of workers in a colony, the transplantation of pupae may lead to better performing colonies. The hypothesis that transplantation of pupae leads to production of larger workers should therefore be tested.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal is to}} {{investigate}} mathematically {{the behavior of a}} linear elastic, isotropic, homogeneous and finite body with a running crack under the influence of a wave. Here we concentrate on bounded crack velocities. Reducing the 3 D wave model given by Navier-Lame equation system to a 2 D one we get an in-plane model for plane elastic waves and an out-of-plane model for shear waves. The main points are in both cases: the description of the behavior of the elastic fields near the running crack tip and the derivation of the equations of motion of the crack tip. The method: Analysis of the transformed problem. A well-tried method in solid mechanics is to transform the current configuration (a non-cylindrical space-time domain). For this purpose it will be assumed there is a family of mapping which maps the reference configuration (cylindrical domain) into the current configuration. Additionally a further configuration, where the isotropic Laplacian appears, is considered. Roughly speaking, $h(t) $ describes the motion of the crack tip. Performing the above change of variables we get elastic wave equations with time-dependent coefficients and lower order terms in the reference domain. Using functional analysis arguments the solvability of the transformed initial boundary value problem is studied. Derivation of the equation of motion: Starting from the rate of the total energy in the current configuration we have to derive an equation of motion of crack tip, that means, a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for $h(t) $. In order to calculate the rate of the contributing energies we transform again the integrals into the reference configuration and use the results of the first item. Most of the studies on the dynamic crack propagation from the viewpoint of the fracture mechanics postulate the body is infinite in a thickness direction because the mathematical treatment is simple. However this postulate is not pertinent to most practical cases. We report here an analytical study on the dynamic crack propagation in a finite configuration. For both cases, the out of- and in-plane, the analytical solution is determined in the vicinity of a moving crack located in an isotropic medium. As specially, we are concerned with the variation of stress intensity factors and displacement fields near the crack tip. In order to construct the asymptotic of the singular solutions for in-plane fracture case, the matching procedure will be used once more. In contrast to before, the method is not directly applicable. For getting these fields we introduce auxiliary potentials related to the in-plane motion of the crack which are separable into Mode I (opening mode) and Mode II (in-plane sliding mode) crack problems. Once such asymptotic fields near the tip of a propagating crack are determined, other important quantities of relevance in dynamic fracture mechanics, such as dynamic stress intensity factors and dynamic energy release rate can be determinate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} U. S. immigration policies, as implemented by government agents, shape migration and key employment outcomes of foreign nationals. Using unique {{quantitative and qualitative}} data, never previously available outside the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (U. S. CIS) and U. S. Department of Labor (U. S. DoL), I assess agents' work legalization decisions that annually affect {{hundreds of thousands of}} workers. In so doing, I distinguish between competing theoretical accounts of labor market inequality and regulatory failure. In my first essay, I examine new U. S. CIS Freedom of Information Act data on the entire population of approved and denied H- 1 B temporary work visas over a five year period. I find that immigrant workers from sending countries with lower levels of economic development are less likely to receive approvals for initial and continuing employment requests, all else equal. In support of social boundary theories, but not theories of preference-based inequality, I find no statistically significant differences in approval outcomes among those immigrants previously granted legal standing and seeking to change jobs or employers. In the second essay (co-authored with Professor Emilio J. Castilla), we examine quantitative data on the entire population of approved and denied labor certification requests, a key prerequisite for most employment-based green cards, evaluated by U. S. DoL agents over a 40 month period. We find that approvals differ significantly depending on immigrants' foreign citizenship, all else equal. Yet, and in support of statistical accounts of inequality, we find that approvals are equally likely for immigrant workers from the vast majority of citizenship groups when agents review audited applications with detailed employment information. In my final essay, I analyze qualitative data from U. S. DoL analysts charged with ensuring that the hiring of immigrant workers will not adversely affect the employment of U. S. citizens. In so doing, I explore why regulation may fail to achieve its desired outcome. In contrast to past work, I proposed that well-designed and faithfully-enacted regulation may produce inconsistent or ineffective outcomes when reliant on regulated actors' truthful accounts of their activities, resulting in "anomic regulation" that masks evaluation rules and constrains regulated actors' ability to improve compliance. 2 by Ben A. <b>Rissing.</b> Thesis (Ph.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{detection of}} longitudinal crack-like indications in radiographic images is developed in this work. Conventional local detection techniques give unsatisfactory results for this task {{due to the}} {{low signal to noise}} ratio (SNR ~ 1) of crack-like indications in radiographic images. The usage of global features of crack-like indications provides the necessary noise resistance, but this is connected with prohibitive computational complexities of detection and difficulties in a formal description of the indication shape. Conventionally, the excessive computational complexity of the solution is reduced by usage of heuristics. The heuristics to be used, are selected on a trial and error basis, are problem dependent and do not guarantee the optimal solution. Not following this way is a distinctive feature of the algorithm developed here. Instead, a global characteristic of crack-like indication (the estimation function) is used, whose maximum in the space of all possible positions, lengths and shapes can be found exactly, i. e. without any heuristics. The proposed estimation function is defined as a sum of a posteriori information gains about hypothesis of indication presence in each point along the whole hypothetical indication. The gain in the information about hypothesis of indication presence results from the analysis of the underlying image in the local area. Such an estimation function is theoretically justified and exhibits a desirable behaviour on changing signals. The developed algorithm is implemented in the C++ programming language and testet on synthetic as well as on real images. It delivers good results (high correct detection rate by given false alarm rate) which are comparable to the performance of trained human inspectors. In dieser Arbeit wurde ein neuer Algorithmus zur Detektion rissartiger Anzeigen in der digitalen Radiographie entwickelt. Klassische lokale Detektionsmethoden versagen wegen des geringen Signal-Rausch-Verhältnisses (von ca. 1) der Rissanzeigen in den Radiographien. Die notwendige Resistenz gegen Rauschen wird durch die Benutzung von globalen Merkmalen dieser Anzeigen erzielt. Das ist aber mit einem undurchführbaren Rechenaufwand sowie Problemen bei der formalen Beschreibung der Rissform verbunden. Üblicherweise wird ein übermäßiger Rechenaufwand bei der Lösung vergleichbarer Probleme durch Anwendung von Heuristisken reduziert. Dazu benuzte Heuristiken werden mit der Versuchs-und-Irrtums-Methode ermittelt, sind stark problemangepasst und können die optimale Lösung nicht garantieren. Das Besondere dieser Arbeit ist anderer Lösungsansatz, der jegliche Heuristik bei der Suche nach Rissanzeigen vermeidet. Ein globales wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretisches Merkmal, hier Schätzfunktion genannt, wird konstruiert, dessen Maximum unter allen möglichen Formen, Längen und Positionen der Rissanzeige exakt (d. h. ohne Einsatz jeglicher Heuristik) gefunden werden kann. Diese Schätzfunktion wird als die Summe des a posteriori Informationsgewinns bezüglich des Vorhandenseins eines <b>Risses</b> im jeden Punkt entlang der hypothetischen Rissanzeige definiert. Der Informationsgewinn entsteht durch die Überprüfung der Hypothese der Rissanwesenheit anhand der vorhandenen Bildinformation. Eine so definierte Schätzfunktion ist theoretisch gerechtfertigt und besitzt die gewünschten Eigenschaften bei wechselnder Anzeigenintensität. Der Algorithmus wurde in der Programmiersprache C++ implementiert. Seine Detektionseigenschaften wurden sowohl mit simulierten als auch mit realen Bildern untersucht. Der Algorithmus liefert gute Ergenbise (hohe Detektionsrate bei einer vorgegebenen Fehlalarmrate), die jeweils vergleichbar mit den Ergebnissen trainierter menschlicher Auswerter sind...|$|R
40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2009 This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Globalization of Science and InnovationGlobalization of science and technology has long been a topic of interest to academics and policy makers. Despite extensive research, we know little about how and what firms globalize. Some recent studies suggest that the geographic distribution of inventive activities remain highly concentrated in industrialized countries. Arora and Yoon (2007) find that inventive activity in software remains concentrated in locations within the United States and among U. S. firms. MacHer, Mowery and Di Minin (2007) find similar results for the semiconductor industry. In a previous study, Fernandez-Ribas and Shapira (2009) show that the most technologically active U. S. corporations in nanotechnology develop an increasing number of inventions abroad. However, our results also indicate that the surge of new inventive locations outside the U. S. has not substituted the inventive activities developed at home. In fact, we find that nanotechnology inventions developed at home more than doubles the number of inventions developed abroad. By contrast, other studies suggest that R&D and innovation are moving to emerging markets. For example, Wadhwa et al. (2008) find that western pharmaceutical companies are shifting substantial preclinical and clinical-trial work to India and China. Several field studies show that indeed the globalization of knowledge, technology and capital is rapidly changing the way companies compete in the market. Increasingly companies appear to develop competitive advantages through intellectual property (Rivette and Kline 2000), open innovation approaches (Chesbrough 2003), global exploitation of technology (Archibugi and Iammarino 2002), and complex global value-chain relationships. These parallel processes suggests that globalization of innovation takes different forms, ranging from international research cooperation, international exploitation of technologies or global markets of technology, and has encouraged the emergence of new business relations. In this paper, we seek to contribute to this area by better understanding strategies of innovation by large businesses in new domains of technology characterized by rapid globalization. We focus on the emerging field of nanotechnology and study innovation strategies of the most active U. S., European and Japanese companies. We expand our previous work about the geographic distribution of inventive activities of U. S. firms (Fernandez-Ribas and Shapira, 2009), and investigate similarities and differences across companies. In addition, we investigate other characteristics of the inventive and innovation processes of nanotechnologies, including university-industry linkages, and the international exploitation of technologies. Our database is the nanotechnology publication and patent database developed by the Program in Research and Innovation Systems Assessment (CNS-ASU Center for Nanotechnology in Society) at Georgia Tech, complemented with WIPO PCT national phase reports and companies' profiles. Overall our sample consists of 60 + large multinational corporations and their subsidiaries. References Archibugi, D. and Iammarino, S.
