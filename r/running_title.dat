In 2005, she placed fifth in the 1500 metres at the English Schools Championships. While a student at Woodham Community Technology College, she won the national cross country <b>running</b> <b>title</b> for her age group in 2006. The following year she was runner-up at the English schools cross country and also placed second in the 1500m at the UK School Games and the English Schools Championships.|$|E
500|$|Kiplagat {{collected}} {{her first}} international road <b>running</b> <b>title</b> in only her second effort over the half marathon distance – her second world title after the senior crown at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. She said her next priority {{would be taking}} a medal on the track [...] "That is my goal for next year (World Championships in Daegu) and at the next Olympics". For Dire and Arusei – both prolific road runners – this was their first individual medal on the world stage. The younger Ethiopians (Feyse Tadese, Meseret Mengistu and Fate Tola) missed out on the medals but still set personal bests for the half marathon, as did Kenyan Joyce Chepkirui.|$|E
500|$|Hellblazer (also {{known as}} John Constantine, Hellblazer) is an American {{contemporary}} horror comic book series, originally published by DC Comics, and subsequently by the Vertigo imprint since March 1993 when the imprint was introduced. Its central character is the streetwise magician John Constantine, who {{was created by}} Alan Moore and Stephen R. Bissette, and first appeared as a supporting character in The Saga of the Swamp Thing #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title. Hellblazer had been published continuously since January 1988, and was Vertigo's longest <b>running</b> <b>title,</b> the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch. In 2013, the series concluded with issue 300, and {{has been replaced by}} a DC Universe title, Constantine. It was then relaunched in 2016 with the title The Hellblazer as part of [...] "DC Universe Rebirth", restoring the character to his original cast, tone and setting. Well known for its political and social commentary, the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} [...] "scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the Church of England" [...] {{is seen in}} the work of Sir Thomas Browne, a Norwich {{physician}} and scientist whose thought often meanders into mystical realms, as in his self-portrait, Religio Medici, and in the [...] "mystical mathematics" [...] of The Garden of Cyrus, whose full <b>running</b> <b>title</b> reads, Or, The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the ancients, Naturally, Artificially, Mystically considered. Browne's highly original and dense symbolism frequently involves scientific, medical, or optical imagery to illustrate a religious or spiritual truth, often to striking effect, notably in Religio Medici, but also in his posthumous advisory Christian Morals.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{reserved}} for Luke Milbourne, a clergyman, who, by that assurance, has consigned his name to no very honourable immortality. This person appears {{to have had a}} living at Great Yarmouth,[17] which, Dryden hints, he forfeited by writing libels on his parishioners; and from another testimony, he {{seems to have been a}} person of no very strict morals.[18] Milbourne was once an admirer of our poet, as appears from his letter concerning [...] "Amphitryon," [...] vol. viii. But either poetical rivalry, for he had also thought of translating Virgil himself,[19] or political animosity, for he seems to have held revolution principles, or deep resentment for Dryden's sarcasms against the clergy, or, most probably, all these united, impelled Milbourne to publish a most furious criticism, entitled, [...] "Notes on Dryden's Virgil, in a Letter to a Friend." [...] "And here," [...] said he, [...] "in the first place, I must needs own Jacob Tonson's ingenuity to be greater than the translator's, who, in the inscription of his fine gay (title) in the front of the book, calls it very honestly Dryden's Virgil, to let the reader know, that this is not that Virgil so much admired in the Augustaean age, an author whom Mr. Dryden once thought untranslatable, but a Virgil of another stamp, of a coarser allay; a silly, impertinent, nonsensical writer, of a various and uncertain style, a mere Alexander Ross, or somebody inferior to him; who could never have been known again in the translation, if the name of Virgil had not been bestowed upon him in large characters in the frontispiece, and in the <b>running</b> <b>title.</b> Indeed, there is scarce the magni nominis umbra to be met with in this translation, which being fairly intimated by Jacob, he needs add no more, but si populus vult decipi, decipiatur." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{here again}} let me recur {{to the aid}} of analogy. Suppose a life of Sir Thomas More by his son-in-law, or a life of Lord Bacon by his chaplain; that a part of the records of the Court of Chancery {{belonging}} to these periods were lost; that in Roper's or in Rawley's biographical work there were preserved a series of dicta and judgments attributed to these illustrious Chancellors, many and important specimens of their table discourses, with large extracts from works written by them, and from some that are no longer extant. Let it be supposed, too, that there are no grounds, internal or external, to doubt either the moral, intellectual, or circumstantial competence of the biographers. Suppose, moreover, that wherever the opportunity existed of collating their documents and quotations with the records and works still preserved, the former were found substantially correct and faithful, the few differences in nowise altering or disturbing the spirit and purpose of the paragraphs in which they were found; and that of what was not collatable, and to which no test ab extra could be applied, the far larger part bore witness in itself of the same spirit and origin; and that not only by its characteristic features, but by its surpassing excellence, it rendered the chances of its having had any other author than the giant-mind, to whom the biographer ascribes it, small indeed! Now, from the nature and objects of my pursuits, I have, we will suppose, frequent occasion to refer to one or other of these works; for example, to Rawley's Dicta et Facta Francisci de Verulam. At one time I might refer to the work in some such words as--"Remember what Francis of Verulam said or judged;" [...] or, [...] "If you believe not me, yet believe Lord Bacon." [...] At another time I might take the <b>running</b> <b>title</b> of the volume, and at another the name of the biographer;--"Turn to your Rawley! HE will set you right;" [...] or, [...] "THERE you will find a depth which no research will ever exhaust;" [...] or whatever other strong expression my sense of Bacon's greatness and of the intrinsic worth and the value of the proofs and specimens of that greatness, contained and preserved in that volume, would excite and justify. But let my expressions be as vivid and unqualified as the most sanguine temperament ever inspired, would any man of sense conclude from them that I meant--and meant to make others believe--that not only each and all of these anecdotes, adages, decisions, extracts, incidents, had been dictated, word by word, by Lord Bacon; and that all Rawley's own observations and inferences, all the connectives and disjunctives, all the recollections of time, place, and circumstance, together with the order and succession of the narrative, were in like manner dictated and revised by the spirit of the deceased Chancellor? The answer will be--must be--No man in his senses! [...] "No man in his senses--in THIS instance; but in that of the Bible it is quite otherwise; for (I take it as an admitted point that) it IS quite otherwise!" ...|$|E
