40|$|A Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) {{wall is a}} {{vertical}} grade separation that uses earth reinforcement extending laterally from the wall {{to take advantage of}} earth pressure to reduce the required design strength of the wall. MSE wall systems are often prefabricated to reduce construction time, thus improving constructability when compared with conventionally cast-in-place reinforced wall systems. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge for predicting the service-life of MSE retaining wall systems when recycled backfill materials such as Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) and Crushed Concrete (CC) are used instead of Conventional Fill Material (CFM). The specific knowledge missing is how these recycled materials, when used as backfill in MSE wall systems, affects the corrosion rate of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strips.</b> This work addresses this knowledge gap by providing recommendations for MSE wall systems backfilled with CC or RAP, and provides a guide to predict the service-life based on corrosion rate test data obtained from embedding steel and galvanized-steel earth <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strips</b> embedded in MSE wall systems backfilled with CC, RAP, and CFM. Experimental data from samples emulating MSE wall systems with steel and galvanized-steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strips</b> embedded in CC and RAP were compared to samples with strips embedded in CFM.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (R. C) elements strengthening using FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) {{composite materials}} {{is a technique}} whose efficiency has been evaluated and proved by testing and theoretical modelling [1, 2, 3]. FRP strengthening materials are made of fibers of different nature (usually carbon, glass and aramid) combined with epoxy resin, which guarantees the bonding to the support surface. FRP strengthened R. C. members often fail due to the FRP debonding, which is caused by combined shear and tensile high stresses. Referring to the flexural strengthening of RC beams, this shortcoming should be reduced by introducing U shaped FRP strips {{at the end of}} the flexural reinforcement. In this paper, aramid connectors are presented as an alternative technique; they could be inserted in concrete beams, and bonded to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strip</b> with epoxy resin. In this paper, experimental results of bending tests on concrete specimens, strengthened with carbon FRP and aramid (AFRP) connectors are presented. Experimental results of strengthened beams with aramid connectors, in terms of load-deflection diagrams, load-crack opening and load-strain diagrams, are compared to results of strengthened specimens without aramid connectors. Strengthened beams failure is due to debonding of strengthening material from the support, whereas the failure mechanism of the others strengthened beams is modified due to aramid connector...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{seismic testing}} of {{reinforced}} earth walls, and present design methods, are outlined. Six one metre tall model reinforced earth walls were tested under normal gravity on a shaking table. Accelerations, displacements and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strip</b> forces were measured. A series of simple sinusoidal single-pulse wave forms, and the El Centro 1940 north-south recorded earthquake motion {{were used as}} input to the shaking table. Permanent outward displacement of a block consisting of the facing, part of the reinforced block, and a wedge of retained soil behind the reinforced block occurred when a limiting or yield acceleration was exceeded. The wall facing remained essentially vertical. The critical (minimum) yield acceleration was found to occur when and after the failure surface outcropped at the fill surface. This critical yield acceleration was calculable using a limiting equilibrium formulation, within the variability of the observed results. A sensitivity analysis of the formulation is presented. The apparent soil friction angle is found to reduce during repeated seismic shaking, while the apparent soil-strip friction coefficient is found to increase probably to a limiting value. In design, the peak value of the friction coefficient found from direct shear tests between the soil and reinforcing can be used. To calculate design strip forces, an upper bound seismic earth pressure coefficient based on the Mononobe-Okabe dynamic earth pressure coefficient KAE is proposed. Measured displacements are plotted on charts for three sliding block displacement prediction methods. One approach, using random vibration and probability theory, is more rational and complete than the others, and provides {{an estimate of the}} prohability of exceedence of the calculated displacement. The method is quite complicated, however, and for everyday design a simple upper bound on a chart derived from an equivalent pulse technique is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{tests on}} notched steel plates {{reinforced}} by composite patch {{showed that the}} application of carbon fiber <b>reinforced</b> polymers (CFRP) <b>strips</b> with pretension of the overlays prior to bonding. This resulted in {{a significant amount of}} additional fatigue life. In particular, the pre-tension produces a compressive field in the steel plate which reduces the stress ratio that enhances crack growth retardation. The fatigue crack propagation rate is postulated to be a function of the effective strain energy density factor range. Fatigue crack growth data showed that standard crack growth retardation model cannot be used to evaluate the minimum effective stress. Hence, an ad hoc plasticity model is introduced and validated using experimental results. The proposed technique is an extension of the well know Newmans model. The bridging effect due to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strips</b> is analytically modeled in order to estimate the reduction of crack opening displacement and finally the magnification of the crack growth retardation.

In {{order to identify}} {{the position of the}} onset interfacial defects and their dynamic debonding mechanisms, a moving mesh strategy, based on Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach, is combined with a cohesive interface methodology, in which weak based moving connections are implemented by using a finite element formulation.

40|$|A two-step model able {{to predict}} the {{non-linear}} response of FRP strengthened threedimensional masonry structures is presented. In the first step, non-strengthened masonry is substituted by a macroscopically equivalent homogeneous material through a kinematic model based on finite elements and working on a heterogeneous assemblage of blocks. Non-linearity is concentrated exclusively on joints reduced to interfaces, exhibiting a frictional behaviour with limited tensile and compressive strength with softening. The homogenized stress-strain behaviour evaluated at the meso-scale is then implemented at a structural level in a finite element non-linear code, relying on an assemblage of rigid infinitely resistant six-noded wedge elements and non-linear interfaces, with deterioration of the mechanical properties. FRP <b>reinforcing</b> <b>strips</b> are modelled through rigid triangles and non-linear interfaces between adjoining triangles.

40|$|International audienceA {{multiphase}} model, {{developed in}} the context of elastoplasticity, is applied to the simulation and design of reinforced earth retaining structures.

The control of cracked composite is based on the changing of resistance of the SMA wire during the deformation phase. The variation of the resistance in the stretched SMA wire acts as a feedback to the on-off controller.
