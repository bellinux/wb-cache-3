In the theoretical part of the description of the types of multiple disability, we will pay the education of children with disabilities, comprehensive <b>rehabilitation,</b> <b>allowances</b> for handicapped, and foundations that help financial means living with disabilities easier. In the practical part, through a questionnaire survey, we will try to describe the views of parents on assistance from the state, and how satisfied they are with the education of their children with disabilities...|$|E
40|$|This Ph. D. {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the experiences users have with the Norwegian employment and welfare administration {{in the context of a}} major reform process. The Nav reform is the largest reform in the recent history of Norwegian public administration. The concern for the needs of the users played a central part in how the Nav reform was legitimated, and the reform was intended to “put the user in the center. ” The reform goal was to get more people off welfare and into work or activation, to give better and more user friendly services, and to make the employment and welfare administration more efficient. The overarching goal of my project has been – through the experiences of the users – to explore the nature of the user/Nav relation. While there is a relatively extensive body of research on the reform implementation process in itself, as well as on the employees of the organization, there has been a lack of thorough studies of the group the intentions of the reform was aimed at – the users. The study is based on qualitative interviews with 29 users receiving long term sick leave benefits, long term unemployment benefits or <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>allowances.</b> The data is analyzed to locate and describe the problems in people’s lives that lead them to approach Nav for help, and the impressions they have with their experiences with the Nav system. It also explores the users’ agency in their relation to Nav, and the relationship between the interviewees’ work ethic and the range of opportunity and limitation they face with regards to e. g. employment. As complimentary data, I use field observations from the lobby of a local Nav office to analyze interaction in this setting. The interview data is approached and analyzed as accounts of users’ experiences. The analysis is given direction through a wide scope of theoretical influences, but I have especially made use of the institutional ethnography developed by Dorothy Smith. The study is also anchored in Norwegian and international research on welfare, public administration, “bureaucratic encounters,” and the relationship between the state and its citizens. The study finds that the handling and outcome of a request for help from Nav concerning the kind of issues that the group in question have, are complex, and interwoven in different contexts such as health care systems, working environment issues and labor market relations. People value work highly, but when their health is weakened they need to find ways to balance work with their overall life situation. Nav comes across to the interviewees as a large and fragmented administration. They meet, and must relate to, a lot of different Nav employees and organizational units. They thus get to know a set of different (and sometimes contradictory) ways of doing things. Often, the users have to attempt to control and coordinate the different units and levels of Nav themselves, which often leads to diverging and/or belated outcomes. Users develop strategies for dealing with Nav, and some lean on their personal abilities or bureaucratic competencies which they can mobilize in their relation with the system. The user/Nav relation is characterized by a tension between help and control. It is important to note that for the users these are emotional and important relations, as they determine their opportunities for income security (and the extent of this), as well as how they will be made to or able to spend their time. It is also an issue of categorization and diagnose – and thus about their own identity. The local Nav office was meant to be at the core of the Nav reform, and was fronted as a “one stop shop. ” In my analysis of users’ experiences, a different image emerges. The local Nav office is a street level bureaucracy, but the other parts of Nav that the users’ need to deal with, such as case work units, on-line solutions and private service contractors providing services to Nav, follow different logics. The study indicates that the fragmented system the users are experiencing seems to stand in opposition to an efficient activation policy as well as a user friendly system. Given all the agents involved, and the unpredictability of the relations, this will put the Norwegian welfare system to new tests...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sick {{leave and}} return to work are common outcome {{variables}} in studies where {{the aim is to}} measure the effect of targeted interventions for individuals that are on sick leave benefits or other allowances. Use of official register data is often restricted, and research on sick leave {{and return to}} work are often based on the participants self-reports. However, there is insufficient documentation that there is agreement between self-reports and register data on sick leave benefits and allowances. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the individuals' knowledge about states of sick leave benefits or allowances compared with register data from The Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) in Norway. Method: 153 individuals, sick-listed or on allowances, participated in a 4 -week inpatient occupational rehabilitation program. 132 (86 %) answered a questionnaire on assessments of work, sick leave, and allowances three months after completed rehabilitation. Self-reported data were compared with register data from NAV according to four categories: working, sick-listed, on medical/vocational <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>allowance</b> or disability pension. Agreement between self-reported and register data was evaluated in cross-tabulations and reported with kappa values. Stratified analyses were done for gender, age, education, medical diagnosis and length of sick leave/allowances at baseline. Results: Good agreement was found for medical/vocational <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>allowance</b> (kappa=. 70) and disability pension (kappa=. 65). Moderate agreement was found for working (kappa=. 49) and fair agreement for sick-listed (kappa=. 36). Stratified analyses showed significant better kappa values for individuals that had been sick-listed less than 12 months before entering the rehabilitation program. Conclusions: Agreements from good to fair were found between self-reported and official register data on sick leave. However, official register data is preferred in research because this will ensure complete data sets. Data on sick leave and other benefits are not absorbing states, and there are often multiple and recurrent episodes. These data may be hard to obtain from self-reports. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} identify important factors that can explain re-integration to work for workers on long-term sick leave. The results indicate that multiple factors can explain whether or not people return to work. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate long-term sick workers' experience of professional support for re-integration to work. Participants were drawn from the database of The National Social Insurance Board in Norway. A random sample was selected of persons with mental illness or musculoskeletal disorders (either p- or l-diagnosis/symptoms related to International Classification in Primary Care), who were in receipt of <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>allowance.</b> The questionnaire was sent to 1 493 persons of whom 740 responded. The most significant finding is that work training/mastering actions were identified by the majority of the rehabilitation benefit recipients as being of slight or moderate use. This highlights the importance of work training/mastering actions being relevant in proportion to the specific situation the individual is presently within. Delays in waiting for treatment attributed to approximately half of the rehabilitation benefit recipient's problems returning to work. This study also highlights that rehabilitation benefit recipients experience loss of co-ordinated measures from those who are supposed to contribute to simplifying their return to work. 頲 009 IOS Press.

40|$|Det har i de senere år skjedd store forandringer på folketrygdens område. Det har blitt lagt mer og mer vekt på viktigheten av å kunne være i aktivitet hvis det ikke er medisinske hindringer for dette. I endringene som er foretatt, er det fokus på den enkeltes muligheter til å være i arbeid mer enn på eventuelle begrensninger. Dette kommer fram gjennom endringer på sykefraværsområdet med innføring av aktivitetsplikt for den sykmeldte og gjennom ny sykefraværsmodell med fokus på oppfølging, involvering av arbeidsgiver, behandler og NAV. Arbeidsplassen er hovedarena for sykefraværsoppfølging, og arbeidsgiver og arbeidstaker er hovedaktører. Dette er en videreføring av føringene i Intensjonsavtalen om et inkluderende arbeidsliv. Også på området for rehabiliteringspenger, yrkesrettet attføring og uføreytelser legges det vekt på at den enkelte skal forsøke seg i arbeid hvis det medisinsk sett er mulig. I 2010 skjer det en større endring ved at rehabiliteringspenger, yrkesrettet attføring og tidsbegrenset uførestønad fjernes og erstattes med arbeidsavklaringspenger, en ytelse hvor det også legges vekt på aktivitet. Samtidig innføres arbeidsevnevurdering med full tyngde som arbeidsmetode internt i NAV. På yrkesskadeområdet har det skjedd få endringer, men organiseringen av yrkesskadeordningen i Norge er under utredning. Samhandling med og kompetansetilbud til sykmeldere er gjennomført i de siste årene. Det er også utviklet statistikk over sykmeldinger skrevet ut av fastleger, et verktøy som kan benyttes i dialog med den enkelte fastlege. Fortsatt er mange sykmeldt eller på varige ytelser. Årsakene til dette er sammensatte. Det er behov for videre forskning på folketrygdens områder.   Damberg G. "From {{inactivity}} to action" - {{a review}} of development {{and changes in the}} national insurance scheme in recent years. Nor J Epidemiol 2009; 19 (2) : 139 - 146.   E NGLISH SUMMARY Recent years have seen major changes within the national insurance scheme. The importance of individual activity has been more and more emphasized in cases where there are no medical obstacles. The changes that have been made focus on the individual's opportunity to work actively rather than possible limitations. This manifests itself through changes in the field of sickness absence with the introduction of compulsory activity for the persons on sick leave, as well as a new sickness absence model focussing on follow-up, involvement of employers, the medical practitioner and The National Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The work-place is the most suitable arena for follow-up of sickness absence, and employer and employee are the most important participants. This is a continuation of the Letter of intent on a more inclusive working life (IW). Also within the fields of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>allowance,</b> vocational <b>rehabilitation</b> and disability benefits emphasis is placed on the individual's willingness to try working if medically feasible. The year 2010 will see extensive modifications of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>allowance,</b> vocational training and time limited disability benefit, which all will be replaced by "work ability assessment benefit" (AAP), a benefit which also emphasizes activity. At the same time a special assessment of work ability will be introduced as a working method internally in NAV. In the field of occupational injury there are few changes, but the organisation of the occupational injury scheme is under revision. Cooperation with medical practitioners and offers of training has been intensified during the past few years. NAV has also developed statistics over sick leave issued by general practitioners. This tool will be used in dialogue with the general practitioner. Still, many persons are on sick leave and long term benefits. The reasons for this are complex. Further research is needed within the field of national insurance. </p...|$|R
40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} thesis is to {{investigate}} needs of support and service in clients with long-term mental disabilities living in the community. A further aim is to study changes in these client needs during a 3. 5 -year follow-up. A questionnaire, The Need of Support and Service Questionnaire (NSSQ), was developed to provide staffs in psychiatric care and social services with a brief instrument to assess how their clients live {{in the community and}} to identify their needs. The results are based on 1, 759 clients. The prevalence of clients in urban and rural areas was 6. 4 / 1, 000 and 4. 5 / 1, 000 inhabitants, respectively. The clients living in the urban setting were more frequently male, older, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and needed more support in activities of daily living than rural clients. Clients identified by staff in psychiatric care only were more often living with a partner, with children living at home and more often had a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>allowance</b> than clients identified by social services staff. In clients assessed by both organizations similar needs at a group level were identified. However, agreements were lower at the individual level. Although clients reported fewer needs than staff in psychiatric care, the reported needs were in the same areas. A majority of the clients with unmet needs of service at baseline had their needs met at the 3. 5 -year follow-up. New unmet needs were also identified at the follow-up, however. The results demonstrate less improvement in clients with schizophrenia as compared with non-schizophrenic clients. In conclusion, needs of support and service present a dynamic process and both psychiatric care and social services should critically evaluate assessments of these needs...|$|R
40|$|The thesis "Rehabilitation of eye pathologies {{and visual}} {{handicap}} compensation" {{was aimed at}} the visually disadvantaged. People with visual impairments cannot receive information from their surroundings visually, but must rely on other senses, especially touch and hearing. In that some assistive devices help them. They {{play an important role}} in the integration of visually impaired into society and the workforce. Tools help blind users to orientate themselves in space, to simplify the care of his person and to keep in touch with friends. The theoretical part deals with the definition of the term oftalmopedie, anatomy and physiology of the visual organ, the type of visual defects, their causes and degree of disability. As the title of this thesis suggests a description of assistive devices, which are divided into non-optical, optical, optoelectronic, information technology and other tools to facilitate the visually disadvantaged movement and work. In short, the theoretical part deals with the social and rehabilitation centers dealing with this issue. For an overview the contributions to utilities are given. The aim of this thesis is to determine how to improve the quality of life of people with visual handicaps. Research questions are established according goals. The main issue is to determine what compensatory aids are most often currently used. The second question is what ophthalmologic pathology of the respondents found. For data collection, the thesis qualitative research was used. Two methods were used. The first method of analysis documents that revealed that compensatory aids are the most in South Bohemia bought. As a second method of questioning was used semi-structured interview technique. Respondents were selected by the method of occasional selection of the examined group. The main criteria for the interviews were a person with a visual handicap and willingness to be interviewed. The sample consists of six clients. The results were evaluated using the cluster method. Results are divided into two parts. The first part is an analysis of documents obtained from Tyflokabinetu o. p. s in České Budějovice. The second part contains the subjective opinions of customers on usability of assistive devices. Results are for greater clarity divided into circuits. The first area contains the identification data of the respondents; in the following range visual defects and degree of disability of the respondents are mentioned. Other topics deal with assistive devices and latest circuit shows <b>rehabilitation</b> and care <b>allowance.</b> Discussion is also divided by headings and research questions. In the discussion of the results are compared information from respondents with the statement in the theoretical work. The results indicate that the computer is the most desired tool. According to the response to the client, we can say that the trends visually disadvantaged people are the equivalent of "healthy" population. Computers used to mediate contact with friends, searching for new information and reading written text. The use of other equipment mainly depends on the individuality of the individual. The research confirmed that aids help people not only in the orientation in space, at work and in educational facilities, but also in many other activities. Visually disadvantage can, through today's technology to tailor the majority and keep it the same step. The knowledge gained from this thesis could be used to raise awareness about mobility aids how in the case of the handicapped citizens, and even the general public and as a basis for further research...|$|R
