40|$|Abstract Background Haemophilus parasuis is the causative {{agent of}} Glässer’s disease {{and is a}} {{pathogen}} of swine in high-health status herds. Reports on serotyping of field strains from outbreaks describe that approximately 30 % of them are nontypeable and therefore cannot be traced. Molecular typing methods {{have been used as}} alternatives to serotyping. This study was done to compare random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles and whole cell protein (WCP) lysate profiles as methods for distinguishing H. parasuis <b>reference</b> <b>strains</b> and field isolates. Results The DNA and WCP lysate profiles of 15 <b>reference</b> <b>strains</b> and 31 field isolates of H. parasuis were analyzed using the Dice and neighbor joining algorithms. The results revealed unique and reproducible DNA and protein profiles among the <b>reference</b> <b>strains</b> and field isolates studied. Simpson’s index of diversity showed significant discrimination between isolates when three 10 mer primers were combined for the RAPD method and also when both the RAPD and WCP lysate typing methods were combined. Conclusions The RAPD profiles seen among the <b>reference</b> <b>strains</b> and field isolates did not appear to change over time which may reflect a lack of DNA mutations in the genes of the samples. The recent field isolates had different WCP lysate profiles than the <b>reference</b> <b>strains,</b> possibly because the number of passages of the type strains may affect their protein expression. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{mutations in}} the type II topoisomerase genes in quinolone-resistant mutants selected from bacteria harbouring plasmid-borne qnr genes.

Results: The proportion of resistant mutants selected by the three quinolones was, respectively, in the same range for qnr-positive transconjugants and <b>reference</b> <b>strains.</b> Only 20 % (65 / 329) of the mutants selected from the transconjugants showed a gyrase mutation, whereas 79 % (94 / 119) of those from the <b>reference</b> <b>strains</b> without a qnr gene did (P < 0. 0001).

50|$|It {{was noted}} in the 2002 {{publication}} of the genome of <b>reference</b> <b>strain</b> Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 that its genome encodes a protein similar to Xanthomonas TALEs. Based on similar domain structure and repeat sequences it was presumed that this gene and homologs in other Ralstonia strains would encode proteins with the same molecular properties as TALEs, including sequence-specific DNA binding. In 2013 this was confirmed by two studies. These genes and the proteins they encode {{are referred to as}} RipTALs (Ralstonia injected protein TALE-like) in line with the standard nomenclature of Ralstonia effectors. Whilst the DNA binding code of the core repeats is conserved with TALEs, RipTALs do not share the T-zero preference, instead they have a strict G-zero requirement. In addition repeats within a single RipTAL repeat array have multiple sequence differences beyond the RVD positions, unlike the near-identical repeats of TALEs.|$|E

Cluster 2 also {{is characterized by}} low salt tolerance. Cells are obligate photoautrotrophs, lack phycoerythrin, and are thermophilic. The <b>reference</b> <b>strain</b> PCC6715 was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. Cluster 3 includes phycoerythrin-lacking marine Synechococcus species that are euryhaline, i.e. capable of growth in both marine and freshwater environments. Several strains, including the <b>reference</b> <b>strain</b> PCC7003, are facultative heterotrophs and require vitamin B12 for growth. Cluster 4 contains a single isolate, PCC7335. This strain is obligate marine. This strain contains phycoerthrin and was first isolated from the intertidal zone in Puerto Peñasco, Mexico. The last cluster contains what had previously {{been referred to as}} ‘marine A and B clusters’ of Synechococcus. These cells are truly marine and have been isolated from both the coastal and the open ocean. All strains are obligate photoautrophs and are around 0.6-1.7 µm in diameter. This cluster is, however, further divided into a population that either contains (cluster 5.1) or does not contain (cluster 5.2) phycoerythrin. The reference strains are WH8103 for the phycoerythrin-containing strains and WH5701 for those strains that lack this pigment. [...] More recently, Badger et al. (2002) proposed the division of the cyanobacteria into a α- and a β-subcluster based on the type of rbcL (large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) found in these organisms. α-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IA, while β-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IB of this gene. In support for this division Badger et al. analyze the phylogeny of carboxysomal proteins, which appear to support this division. Also, two particular bicarbonate transport systems appear to only be found in α-cyanobacteria, which lack carboxysomal carbonic anhydrases.|$|E
