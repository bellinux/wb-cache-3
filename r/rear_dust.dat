Meantime, the cavalcade, the banners, the music, and the barouches swept past him, with the vociferous crowd in the <b>rear,</b> leaving the <b>dust</b> to settle down, and the Great Stone Face to be revealed again, with the grandeur that it had worn for untold centuries.|$|R
40|$|A week old 120, Japanese quail chicks {{were equally}} and {{randomly}} distributed into four different treatment groups (T 0, T 1, T 2 and T 3), of three replicates having 10 chicks in each. All the chicks were <b>reared</b> on saw <b>dust</b> litter upto {{six weeks of}} age. The chicks in control group-T 0 were fed corn-soya based diet with multi- enzyme and group T 1, T 2 and T 3 were fed on diets containing 10, 20 and 30 per cent replaced soybean cake by sunflower cake with multi-enzyme supplementation, respectively. The significant (P< 0. 01) differences were noticed between the treatments for weekly live body weights upto sixth week. The blood-biochemicals viz., serum glucose, serum total protein and serum cholesterol level did not varied significantly. It was concluded that inclusion of sunflower cake {{do not have any}} adverse effect on blood-biochemical parameters however supplementation of multi-enzyme improves numerically the growth performance of Japanese quails.

40|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} early life {{exposure to a}} nonhygienic environment that contains endotoxin {{reduces the risk of}} developing allergic diseases. The mechanisms underlying the hygiene hypothesis are unclear and may involve subtle immune system interactions that occur during maturation. Experimental objectives of this study were to use a novel animal model to test the hygiene hypothesis and to characterize early life immune system responses to a nonhygienic environment. Mice were <b>reared</b> in corn <b>dust,</b> a grain-processing byproduct with a high-endotoxin content and microbial products or in a low-endotoxin environment. The influence of early or later life exposure to corn dust on a subsequent allergen stimulus (ovalbumin) was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell analysis, lung histology, serum IgE, and BAL cytokine measurements. The influence of the corn dust environment on the developing pulmonary immune system was assessed by BAL cell analysis and immunostaining of lung tissue. The corn dust environment contained significantly more endotoxin (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), and the dust exposures attenuated the cellular inflammatory response to ovalbumin in the adult mouse (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) but did not reduce serum IgE levels or alter baseline BAL fluid proinflammatory cytokine levels. The corn dust environment did not induce significant neutrophilia in lavage fluid but significantly increased the number of antigen-presenting cells in alveolar walls early in life by approximately 37...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Among {{the factors}} {{influencing}} dust pro-duction on the farms, animal activity {{is probably the}} least studied. Animal activity is strongly affected by circadian rhythms and it is altered by the rearing con-ditions, especially the management of light and the feeding strategy. In this study, a broiler flock was eval-uated until 35 d of age with the general objective of studying the factors influencing the production of dust, particularly the effect of animal activity, as affected by the lighting program. In an experimental room, 2 daily dark periods of 6 and 4 h with 158 birds divided in 12 groups, reared on wood shavings, were evaluated. A TEOM analyzer {{was used to measure}} dust concentra-tions, whereas animal activity was determined by ob-servation of birds on video tapes. Animal activity was defined by an activity index, which was determined by direct evaluation of birds on video tapes. The animal ac-tivity index was closely related to the lighting program (0. 084 and 0. 556 during dark and light periods, respec-tively) and was maximum at wk 4 of the <b>rearing</b> pe-riod. The <b>dust</b> concentrations during light periods were on average 4 times higher than during dark periods, with a maximum average concentration of 2. 82 mg·m− 3 during the last week of the cycle. Particulate matter emission was on average 2. 08 mg·animal− 1 ·hour− 1. Dust concentration increased linearly with bird weight and daily variations in dust production were characterized. As a result, a direct cause-effect relationship between animal activity and dust concentration was obtaine...|$|R
