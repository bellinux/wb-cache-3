The thermogravimetric charac- teristics of chars obtained in a drop-tube furnace were studied in this work. Chars from the devolatilisation of three bituminous coals were obtained at three times (100, 150 and 300 ms), three temperatures (900, 1, 000 and 1, 100 °C) and at high heat rate (104 K/s). The chars were burned using non-isothermal thermogravimetry (heated to 900 °C) and isothermal thermogravimetry at 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C to obtain their combustion profiles. Characteristic temperatures (ignition, peak and final tempe- <b>ratures)</b> were determined by non-isothermal thermogravimetry; it was found that chars from La Yolanda coal gave the highest figures for the characteristic temperatures.

5000|$|Sous <b>rature</b> as a {{literary}} practice originated {{in the works of}} German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976). The practice of placing words or terms under erasure first appeared in Heidegger's work The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, Heidegger's lecture course of 1929/30. And subsequently in a letter he penned to Ernst Jünger in 1956 titled [...] "Zur Seinsfrage" [...] (The Question of Being), in which Heidegger seeks to define nihilism. During the course of the letter, Heidegger also begins to speculate about the problematic nature of defining anything, let alone words. In particular, the meaning of the term ‘Being’ is contested and Heidegger crosses out the word, but lets both the deletion and the word remain. “Since the word is inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.” According to the Heideggerian model, erasure expressed the problem of presence and absence of meaning in language. Heidegger was concerned with trying to return the absent meaning to the present meaning and the placing of a word or term under erasure “simultaneously recognised and questioned the term’s meaning and accepted use”.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is {{to argue that}} a {{selection}} of Samuel Beckett's later prose texts represent {{an examination of the}} plight of being, through writing, in Jacques Derrida's terms, sous <b>rature.</b> By writing sous <b>rature</b> - representing, and then putting specific images of representation "under erasure" - Beckett establishes his own "technique" by which to give form to the "timeless" self and world, not as an "absolute" negation or no thing, but as a positive nothingness (the presence of an absence, as Derrida has it). While writing sous <b>rature</b> does echo Jacques Derrida's use of the phrase, and Heidegger's earlier inquiry into the metaphysics of being in Being and Time, the theoretical aspect of this study, while certainly present, is slight. Instead, sous <b>rature</b> is employed as the definition of Beckett's own process of writing in these later texts which allows him to develop a new "syntax of weakness" and "literature of the unword. " By using language to represent the experience of being, and then putting that language sous <b>rature,</b> Beckett draws attention to the inadequacies of language as a means of representing the "timeless" self, and for explaining the experience of being in the world. By extension, this inability "to express" the "essential" "timeless" self through language becomes the means by which to express the experience of nothingness as the metaphysical plight of being. Although manufactured through a number of techniques, nothingness, in each instance, is all that which language fails to signify - the residua produced by the failure of language that encapsulates within its virtual form the unknown aspects of the "timeless" that remains outside the traditional "zone" of representation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Sea ice {{thickness}} {{changes over}} a nine-day period are determined for the Chukchi Polynya using Maykut’s (1986) and Kuhn et al. ’s (1975) theoretical predictive models. The models relate ice thickness to sea ice surface temperature., air temperature, wind speed, and sea water tem-perature. Sea ice surface temperatures {{are derived from}} AVHRR imagery and meteorological observations are taken from the synoptic weather sta-tion at Barrow, Alaska. The Maykut equation yields results {{that appear to be}} realistic for the ice thickness distribution within the polynya at the beginning stages of polynya formation. Ice thickness calculations at the later stages of polynya formation are partially invalidated by the movement of large floes to the oldest part of the polynya in response to a wind from the northeast. Such a major disturbance {{on the surface of the}} polynya com-plicates the identification of the type and thickness of ice that is forming. These results offer encouragement for the prospects of future field studies to validate and refine the technique and for the extension of the technique to calculation of heat transfer and salt rejection within the Chukchi Polynya and other polynyas.

40|$|The ongoing {{downscaling}} of microelectronic devices requires {{dopant activation}} with diffusion {{kept to a}} minimum. One method considered in device processing is microsecond annealing by pulsed lasers. This is a highly non-equilibrium process during which intrinsic point defects generated at the surface diffuse into the material and form a variety of defects during cooling-down. Since the defects lie close to the surface, they may well affect the effective concentration {{and the formation of}} leakage currents in pn-junctions of advanced technologies. These defects may be clusters of intrinsic point defects or contain residual impurities like oxygen or dopants.

40|$|Proceedings of the {{international}} liquid crystal conference, Bangalore, 1973. We propose a new model for the statistical description of short range order in nematic liquid crystals of positive dielectric anisotropy. We consider the molecules to be cylindrically symmet- ric and assume the pair potential {{to be of the}} form A*P 1,(cos Θij) - B*P 2 (cos Θij) which favours an antiparallel arrangement of the perma- 11 nent dipoles. From physical considerations, antiferroelectric long range ordering is not expected to be present in nematics. Applying the Krieger-James approximation, solutions are obtained with an apolar or P 2 (cos Θ) type of long range order, but allowing for antiferro- electric short range order. Two important consequences of the theory arc (i) the mean dielectric constant should increase slightly on passing from the nematic to the isotropic phase, (ii) the magnetic and electr~c birefringence in the isotropic phase should both vary approximately as (T-T*) - 1, where T* is the hypothetical second order transition point, except when the dipolar interactions are very strong, in which case the electric birefringence should exhibit a slower variation at tempe- <b>ratures</b> well above T*.

In froze n matrices or adsorbed on the surfaces of silica aerogel, both Ru(I 1) complex/electron acceptor dyads of this study are photoluminescent, and the absence of quenching has been traced to the environmental rigi dity. When doped aerogels are cooled at 77 K, the emission intensity increases by approximately 4 x, and the spectra shift to the blue, analogous to what is observed with Ru(I 1) complexes in solutions undergoi ng fluid-to-rigid transition. However, in contrast to frozen solution s, the luminescent moieties in the bulk of aerogels kept at low tempe <b>ratures</b> are still accessible to gas-phase quenchers diffusing through the mesopores, leading to more sensitive platforms for sensors than o ther room-temperature configurations. Thus the photoluminescence of o ur Ru(I 1) complex dyads adsorbed on aerogel is quenchable by O 2 both at room temperature and at 77 K. Furthermore, it was also found that O 2 modulates the photoluminescence of aerogels doped with 4 -benzoyl -N -methylpyridinium-based dyads over a wider dynamic range compared wi th aerogels doped with either our vislogen-based dyads or with Ru(I 1) tris(1,lO-phenanthroline) itself...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication {{of a complete}} thermocouple assembly. Elements of construction and installation are discussed under the headings thermocouple current, fabrication, switch box fabrication, field installation of the cable and temperature readings. The principle of measurement is that the emf generated between a reference junction of known temperature and one of unknown temperature can give the unknown temperature. The two metals used are copper and constantan, and the wires must be protected electrically from short circuits. Twenty gauge duplex wire individually encased in polyvinyl chloride is satisfactory. The wires from the installation are usually terminated in a weatherproof switch box. Leeds and Northrup rotary switches, type 31 - 3 are used. Simple clamp type connectors and terminal blocks ensure positive connection. The copper wires are attached to rotary switches. The constantan wires are attached to a common constantan wire. The thermocouple cable's outer jacket is cut at the depths at which readings are required and the copper and constantan wires are soldered to give a thermocouple junction. The completed multi-wire cable is inserted in a suitable length of polyethylene hose. A lucite or brass plug seals the lower end. Steel switch boxes house the switches and wire connection from the elements and still provide accessibility for readings. The cable and switch box are filled with high quality transformer oil. Installation involves pushing the assembly into a bore hole {{or in the case}} of short cables, a test pit. Longer assemblies are usually lowered into bore holes with a 10 - 20 lb weight tied to the bottom. Finally the bore hole is backfilled so that no air pockets exist.
