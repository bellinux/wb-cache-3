40|$|The AML 1 (RUNX 1) gene, one of {{the most}} {{frequent}} targets of translocations associated with human leukemias, encodes a DNA-binding protein that plays pivotal roles in myeloid differentiation through transcriptional regulation of various genes. Previously, we reported that AML 1 is phosphorylated on two serine residues with dependence on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which positively regulates the transcriptional activity <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction between AML 1 and the corepressor mSin 3 A is regulated by phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1 and that release <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1 from mSin 3 A induced by phosphorylation activates its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1 regulates its intranuclear location and disrupts colocalization <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1 with mSin 3 A in the nuclear matrix. PEBP 2 β/CBFβ, a heterodimeric partner <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1, was shown {{to play a role in}} protecting AML 1 from proteasome-mediated degradation.

40|$|Acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL) is a subtype {{of acute}} myelocytic leukemia(AML) {{associated}} with unique {{features such as}} the presence of atypical promyelocytes and bleeding tendency due to disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC). In a retrospective study, we analyzed 96 cases <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> seen at our hospital between June, 1989 and December 1993. Thirteen cases of APL(14 %) were identified and their clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. The 86 cases of other types <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> served as controls. The distinct clinicopathologic features of APL as contrasted to other types <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> included younger age of patients, shorter duration of symptom before diagnosis, higher level of albumin at presentation, and a higher proportion of patients having coagulation abnormalities (75 vs. 25 %). Bone marrow cellularity was higher in APL when compared to other types <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> (100 vs. 90 %, P = 0. 013). Of 13 patients with APL, 4 died of bleeding/sepsis between days 2 to 4 after admission. Seven of 9 patients who received induction therapy achieved complete remission(CR).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is chromosomal translocation between AML 1 /RUNX 1 on chromosome 21 and ETO gene on chromosome 8 resulting in the expression <b>of</b> chimeric oncogene <b>AML</b> 1 -ETO. Although patients with t(8; 21) translocation have good prognosis, 5 -year survival is observed only in 50 % <b>of</b> the cases. <b>AML</b> 1 -ETO translocation is usually accompanied by overexpression of mutant C-Kit, a tyrosine kinase, which contributes to uncontrolled proliferation of premature blood cells leading to relapse and poor prognosis. We illustrate the potential use of esculetin on leukemic cell line, Kasumi- 1, bearing t(8; 21) translocation and mutated C-Kit gene. Esculetin decreases the expression <b>of</b> <b>AML</b> 1 -ETO at both protein and transcript level within 24 hours of treatment.
