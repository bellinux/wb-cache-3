50|$|The Remington R5 RGP is {{essentially}} a gas-piston derivative of the previous Remington R4, itself a clone of the AR-15/M16/M4 series., The standard R5 comes with a Magpul stock and an Ergo <b>rifle</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|E
5000|$|All of {{the firing}} {{mechanisms}} {{are attached to}} the main rifle assembly - the pistol inserts from the bottom to provide the <b>rifle</b> <b>grip</b> (the pistol also holds caps for authentic firing sounds). The [...] "Rifle" [...] function shot twelve white bullets one at a time via a bolt action spring mechanism through the silver barrel. Three different [...] "rockets" [...] (The green Anti Tank, Anti Bunker and the red Armour Piercing fired via spring action on the main barrel. The Grenade Launcher was on top of the gun.|$|E
5000|$|When the 3rd Platoon {{lost its}} leader, Bacon took command of that platoon {{as well and}} led both platoons against the {{remaining}} enemy positions. During the evacuation of the wounded, Bacon climbed {{the side of a}} nearby tank to gain a vantage point and direct fire into enemy positions, despite his exposure to enemy fire. [...] "I got my boot heel shot off, I got holes in my canteens, I got my <b>rifle</b> <b>grip</b> shot up," [...] he recalled in [...] "Beyond Glory," [...] a 2003 book by Larry Smith of history interviews with Medal of Honor recipients. [...] "I got shrapnel holes in my camouflage covers, and bullets in my pot. A bullet creased the edge of it, tore the lining off." [...] He was personally credited with killing at least 4 enemy soldiers and destroying an antitank gun.|$|E
5000|$|In firearms, freebore is {{the part}} of the barrel that the bullet travels through before being engaged in the barrel's rifling, {{therefore}} it is [...] "free" [...] from <b>rifling</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|R

[...] "That row was not about sheep.... Jean Isbel didn't beat y'u for anythin' about sheep.... Old John Sprague was in Greaves's store. He heard y'u. He saw Jean Isbel beat y'u as y'u deserved.... An' he told ME!" ...|$|R

50|$|The SKS has a {{conventional}} layout, {{with a wooden}} stock and <b>rifle</b> <b>grip.</b> It is a gas-operated rifle that has a spring-loaded bolt carrier and a gas piston rod that work to unlock and cycle the action via gas pressure exerting pressure against them. The bolt is locked to contain the pressure of ignition {{at the moment of}} firing by tilting downwards at its rear and being held by a lug pressed into the receiver. At the moment of firing, the bolt carrier is pushed rearwards, which causes it to lift the bolt, unlocking it, and allowing it to be carried rearwards against a spring. This allows the fired case to be ejected and a new round from the magazine to be carried into the chamber. The SKS represents an intermediate step in the process towards the development of true assault rifles, being shorter and less powerful than the semi-automatic rifles that preceded it, such as the Soviet SVT-40, but being longer (10 cm or 4in) than AK-series rifles which replaced it. As a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity than those arms that replaced it.|$|E

50|$|The launcher's barrel could slide {{forward to}} accept a single 40 mm round into the breech. It came with a {{primitive}} version of the quadrant sight later used with the M203. It differed from the later model by featuring an external cocking handle and an extended trigger that allowed the weapon to be fired without removing the hand from the <b>rifle's</b> pistol <b>grip.</b> This same extended trigger was also one source of the weapon's problems as it allowed accidental discharges of a loaded weapon if caught by tree branches, gear, or anything else capable of overcoming the 6 to 11 pound trigger pull.|$|R
5000|$|The grenade launcher's trigger is {{installed}} {{directly under the}} F2000's trigger {{so that it can}} be manipulated without removing the shooting hand from the <b>rifleâ€™s</b> pistol <b>grip.</b> The double-action trigger lets the operator [...] "try again" [...] if the grenade's percussion type primer doesn't ignite. The breech release button is found on the left side of the launcher body, like on the M203. The grenade launcher comes with a basic flip-up ladder sight, but it was intended to be used with a specially designed optoelectronic fire control system designated FCS, developed in cooperation with the Finnish company Noptel.|$|R
50|$|The R4 has a side-folding tubular stock, which folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver. The <b>rifle's</b> handguard, pistol <b>grip,</b> magazine, stock arms and {{shoulder}} pad are all made from a synthetic material, making it lighter in weight than the equivalent original Galil model which uses heavier metal and wood in these components.|$|R
5000|$|Under the new interpretation, {{many types}} of thumbhole stocks were now to be {{considered}} as pistol grips {{for the purposes of}} the Arms Act; any semi-automatic <b>rifle</b> with a <b>grip</b> having either the appearance or function of a military pattern free-standing pistol grip would be regarded by the police as an MSSA. Specifically, a semi-automatic rifle would henceforth be considered an MSSA if it had any of: ...|$|R
5000|$|Different breech layouts allow {{players to}} use larger hoppers {{that are more}} common among {{contemporary}} semi-automatic markers or horizontal feed tubes. There are two styles available for the Phantom; gravity feed and stock class. Another feature which may differ depending on user preference is the grip frame. The two most common grip frames available for the CCI Phantom paintball marker are the [...]45 style and M16 style. The [...]45 is {{an offshoot of the}} common grip structure for handguns chambered for the [...]45 ACP pistol cartridge such as the M1911 Colt pistol. However, the [...]45 grip frame is a purely visual replica of its firearm relative as the Phantom cannot be fed by a magazine. The standard grip on the [...]45 grip frame is the government model rubber grip with finger grooves produced by Hogue Inc. The M16-style grip frame is derived from the structure of the rifle of the same name, the M16 <b>rifle.</b> The M16-style <b>grip</b> used in the Phantom is produced by Ram-Line and is made of plastic. Players can also opt to use either 12 gram CO2 powerlets or a tank filled with CO2 or compressed air.|$|R
