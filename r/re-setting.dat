If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce a single bright blip on the upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, a faint second blip would appear to smear out the upper trace, noticeable even before the blip on the lower trace became visible.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} example of the {{practical}} implementation of a protocol for experimental bifurcation detection based on on-line identification and feedback control ideas. The current experimental practice for the detection of bifurcations involves a cumbersome approach typically requiring long observation times in the vicinity of marginally stable solutions, as well as frequent <b>re-settings</b> of the experiment for the detection of turning-point or subcritical bifurcations. The approach exemplified here addresses these issues drawing from ideas of numerical bifurcation detection. The idea is to couple the experiment with an on-line computer-assisted identification/feedback protocol so that the closed-loop system will converge to the open-loop bifurcation points. We demonstrate the applicability of this instability detectio...|$|R
5000|$|While the SP engines {{could operate}} only on {{relatively}} straight and heavily built mainlines, their long service lives of between 28 and 30 years proved {{that they were}} good locomotives. The most serious mishap was when, in November 1946, one of the SP 4-10-2 locomotives suffered a boiler explosion which killed four train crew. However, the inside cylinder's rod created serious maintenance problems because the floating bushings failed, which lengthened maintenance down-time since such failures required major valve <b>re-settings</b> that caused delays. It was reported that such failures created such great pounding on the rails that railroad housewives along the line [...] "complained of crockery cracking when a defective 4-10-2 rumbled past their homes".|$|R
40|$|We {{implement}} a practical protocol for the active, on-line detection of bifurcations in experimental systems, based on real-time identification and feedback control ideas. Current experimental {{practice for the}} detection of bifurcations typically requires long observation times in the vicinity of marginally stable solutions, as well as frequent <b>re-settings</b> of the experiment {{for the detection of}} turning point or subcritical bifurcations. The approach exemplified here addresses these issues drawing from numerical bifurcation detection procedures. The main idea is to create an augmented experiment, using the experimental bifurcation parameter(s) as additional state variables. We implement deterministic laws for the evolution of these new variables by coupling the experiment with an on-line, computer-assisted identification/feedback protocol. The "augmented" experiment (the closed-loop system) thus actively converges to what, for the original experiment (the open-loop system), is a bifurcation point. We apply this method to the real-time, computer-assisted detection of period-doubling bifurcations in an electronic circuit. The method succeeds in actively driving the circuit to the bifurcation points, even in the presence of modest experimental uncertainties, noise, and limited resolution. The active experimental tracing of a codimension- 1 bifurcation boundary in two-parameter space is also demonstrated...|$|R

2500|$|The rule of marteloio {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} changing bearing at sea. More specifically, it helped a navigator plot the traverse from one navigational course to another. For example, suppose a ship was to sail from Corsica to Genoa, a course bearing straight north ("Tramontana") for some 130 miles. But the winds are not cooperative, and the ship was forced to sail northwest ("Maestro") for some 70 miles. [...] How does it return to its original route? [...] <b>Re-setting</b> its bearing to northeast ("Greco") seems sensible enough, but how long should it sail on that bearing? [...] How would a navigator know when the ship had reached its old route and should turn north again? [...] How to avoid overshooting or undershooting the old course? ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{adjustments}} {{are done}} at two different scales. [...] At the small scale (within a township) {{it is done}} by starting the sectional surveys (township [...] "subdivisions") in the southeast corner and moving progressively toward the northwest corner. [...] The algorithm used is to move northward to establish the six eastern-most sections (and quarter-sections), then move west at one mile intervals, parallel to the eastern boundary of the township, repeating this process, until {{the western side of}} the township is reached. [...] The result of this is that the northernmost and westernmost tiers of sections—11 in all—are thus allowed to deviate from one square mile, but the other (southeasterly-most) 25 sections are not. [...] This method accommodates the curvature problem within a township, and it also allows for any errors made during the surveying itself—which were nearly unavoidable due to the physical difficulty of the work and the crude equipment used—without overly compromising the basic rectangular nature of the system as a whole. [...] At the larger multiple township scale, the standard parallels mentioned above allow a longitudinal <b>re-setting</b> of township corner locations, so that townships widths do not continually decrease as one proceeds north (and is in fact the primary reason for their establishment). [...] Thus, corrections for curvature of the earth exist at two separate spatial scales—a smaller scale within townships, and a larger scale between multiple townships and within standard parallels.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere is no {{question}} that the economic matters ensuing from the late and not over crisis, have been heavily debated in conferences and materials of specialty. Nevertheless, the effects of the crisis on the educational system have been less studied or perceived as a lifelong learning tool in dealing with future moments of systemic changeovers. Any deep economic crisis has undeniable serious rippling effects on the social and educational fabric of society. All the more so, when the focus of the present study is on a country struggling to fit itself into the mold of progressive societies. Choosing upfront to look at the tertiary/university system of education (as additionally in contact with the later developments of human life), and more precisely at the investments in the public system of education and at the investments in the reconfiguration of the core competences obtained by students as direct consequence of the variation in the labor force sector, the present paper examines from quantitative and qualitative perspectives the changes and <b>re-settings</b> of the Romanian tertiary educational system, with the declared aim to trace and explain what brought about the change, how has it altered the educational system and how can one use gained experience in the future as promising tool for lifelong learning strategies if an institution or an individual decides to do so...|$|R

50|$|With the {{development}} of the first steam locomotives, reversing was an obvious necessity. Stephenson's Locomotion used slip-eccentrics although these were soon considered impractical, owing to the lack of access to the crank axles acting as both carrying axle and crankshaft. A somewhat contrived method used for the replica Locomotion is to try and display it on a track with raised ends, so that the locomotive can be allowed to roll backwards under its own weight, and <b>re-setting</b> its own eccentrics. A better solution was to use fixed eccentrics, but to provide two of them, one for each direction. The required eccentric, and direction, was selected by engaging only one gab at a time.|$|E
