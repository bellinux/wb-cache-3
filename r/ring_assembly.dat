40|$|The LSm {{proteins}} {{are known}} to organize as multiprotein <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> which interact with RNAs to allow chemical modification or nuclease protection. The determination of structures of large heterogenous protein complexes poses particular difficulty for structural biologists, requiring the careful assembly of components into a viable complex suitable for data collection. Avenues for in vitro assembly include recombinant construction of all or some components via co expression, or expression of polyproteins with engineered linkers. We describe our polyprotein construction of appropriate dimer, trimer and heptamer combinations known to make up mixed LSm subcomplexes. By reconstituting mixed complexes of LSms we are defining the heteroheptameric <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> by crystallography and studying their specific interactions their associated protein factors. 1 page(s...|$|R

Depletion of RhoA halts contractile <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and ingression, whereas, anillin depletion leads to a less severe phenotype when the contractile ring forms and ingresses partially. Depletion of anillin in Drosophila spermatocytes greatly reduces the localization of Rho and F-actin to equatorial regions.|$|E

40|$|The Seasat {{spacecraft}} failed on October 9, 1978, after satisfactory {{operation in}} orbit for 105 days, {{as a result}} of a loss of electrical power in the Agena bus that was used as a part of the spacecraft. The loss of power was caused by a massive and progressive short in one of the slip <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> that was used to connect the rotating solar arrays into the power subsystem. The most likely cause of this short was the initiation of an arc between adjacent slip <b>ring</b> brush <b>assemblies.</b> The triggering mechanism of this arc could have been either a wire-to-brush assembly contact, a brush-to-brush contact, or a momentary short caused by a contaminant that bridged internal components of opposite electrical polarity...|$|R

The process can be divided to the following distinct steps: anaphase spindle reorganization, division plane specification, actin-myosin <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and contraction, and abscission. Faithful partitioning of the genome to emerging daughter cells is ensured through the tight temporal coordination of the above individual events by molecular signaling pathways.|$|E

First, the bullet-shaped protective cover {{would have to}} be modified and reinforced to allow {{for the use of the}} solid-rocket motors, something not needed with the LES, which bolts on top of the LIDS docking <b>ring</b> <b>assembly.</b> Second, the necessity to fire multiple motors (LES uses one motor and multiple nozzles) simultaneously for an abort decreases the theoretical reliability of the launch abort system by introducing more failure modes.|$|E
50|$|The G&C/A section {{consisted}} of two separate portions, the G&C and the adapter connected by a manufactured splice. At the forward end of the G&C there was a quick access splice for attachment to the warhead section. At the aft end, the adapter was grooved to accept the V-band that spliced the propulsion section to the G&C section. The RV separation system {{consisted of}} a linear shaped charge <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> bolted to the G&C section so that separation occurred just forward of the G&C manufactured splice. A protective collar on the outer surface of the adapter, mounted over the linear shaped charge, provided personnel protection during G&C/A handling operations.|$|E
40|$|The density {{functional}} theory {{calculations of}} 7 -methylguanine clusters revealed that stable <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be formed {{with or without}} anions in the center position and hexameric clusters are the most stable and most planar ones. The coordination of anions (Cl&# 8722;, Br&# 8722;, NO 3 &# 8722;) stabilizes and thus favors the formation of planar aggregates. We believe that the predicted planar structures stabilized by anions are good models for self-assembly structures formed at solid-liquid or solid-gas interfaces. Comparing the bonding and average H-bond energy to reference ribbon calculations we pointed out {{the presence of the}} previously introduced cooperativity effect in circular supramolecular structures of 7 -methylguanine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLarge {{accurate}} annular weldments {{are important}} {{to a number of}} heavy industries, such as power generation and civil aero-engine. This research examines the interaction between small assembly gaps and the Preliminary Welding Process (PWP), colloquially known as tack welding. This study has identified two fundamental weld distortion geometries prevalent within ring structures; the quantised saddle and the quantised conic, both a consequence of the small assembly gaps. Furthermore, physical weld trials and finite element modelling, in both simple two plate <b>assemblies</b> and full <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> have shown that volumetric weld shrinkage is the principle thermal-mechanical mechanism driving the identified distortions, so careful placement of the initial welds to avoid assembly gaps can yield a 19 × reduction in out-of-plane distortions in the final weldment...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimentally}} validated simulation code is used {{to study}} the development and contribution of various friction components during turbocharged diesel engine transients. This is accomplished {{with the use of}} a recently proposed detailed friction model. Mean friction mean effective pressure modelling is found to considerably underestimate actual friction around firing TDC, leading to lower speed droops for abrupt load increases. The piston <b>rings</b> <b>assembly</b> contribution is dominant for the particular engine, due to its high number of piston rings and its low crankshaft speed. The model can be used to investigate such interesting cases as the effect of engine oil temperature on engine transient response, or the variation of oil film thickness during a cycle or a transient event.

5000|$|The {{scaffold}} {{theory is}} supported by information that shows that {{the formation of the}} ring and localization to the membrane requires the concerted action of a number of accessory proteins. ZipA or the actin homologue FtsA permit initial FtsZ localization to the membrane. [...] Following localization to the membrane, division proteins of the Fts family are recruited for <b>ring</b> <b>assembly.</b> Many of these proteins, such as FtsW, FtsK, and FtsQ are involved in stabilization of the Z ring and may also be active participants in the scission event. The timing of Z-ring formation suggests the possibility of a spatial or temporal signal that permits the formation of FtsZ filaments.|$|E
50|$|Vps4 {{subunits}} {{have two}} functional domains, an amino-terminal MIT domain and a central AAA-ATPase domain. The MIT domain {{is responsible for}} the interaction of Vps4 with the MIM domain of Vps2. The AAA-ATPase domain hydrolyzes ATP to power disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex. This “stripping” of ESCRT-III allows all associated subunits to be recycled for further use. Vta1 is a dimeric protein containing one VSL domain (so named because it is found in the proteins Vps4, SBP1, and LIP5), which enables binding to Vps4, and a MIT domain for associating with ESCRT-III subunit Vps60. Though not essential, Vta1 has been shown to aid in Vps4 <b>ring</b> <b>assembly,</b> accelerate the ATPase activity of Vsp4, and encourage ESCRT-III disassembly.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} anillin-like protein homologues found outside of metazoans. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast), there are Mid1p and Mid2p. These two anillin-like proteins {{do not have}} any overlap in their functions. Mid1p has been characterized as a key regulator in cytokinesis, responsible for arranging contractile <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> and positioning. Mid2p acts later in cytokinesis to organize septins during septation, or the invagination of inner membranes, outer membranes, and the cell wall that occurs in order to separate daughter cells completely. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) also have two anillin-like proteins, Boi1p and Boi2p. Boi1p and Boi2p localize to the nucleus and contractile ring at the bud neck, respectively. They are essential for cell growth and bud formation.|$|E

50|$|The three {{rotor blades}} were {{mounted on a}} <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> {{supported}} by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At {{the end of each}} was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre support ring and along the rotors to the jets.|$|E
50|$|OEM {{machinery}} {{manufacturers are}} discovering {{the benefits of}} using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or slip ring as {{a connection to the}} moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip <b>ring</b> <b>assembly</b> or standard electrical slip ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila oogenesis, the {{development}} of a mature oocyte depends on having properly developed ring canals that allow cytoplasm transport from the nurse cells to the oocyte. Ring canal assembly is a step-wise process that transforms an arrested cleavage furrow into a stable intercellular bridge by the addition of several proteins. Here we describe a new gene we named cheerio that provides a critical function for <b>ring</b> canal <b>assembly.</b> Mutants in cheerio fail to localize ring canal inner rim proteins including filamentous actin, the ring canal-associated products from the hu-li tai shao (hts) gene, and kelch. Since hts and kelch are present but unlocalized in cheerio mutant cells, cheerio is likely to function upstream from each of them. Examination of mutants in cheerio places it in the pathway of <b>ring</b> canal <b>assembly</b> between cleavage furrow arrest and localization of hts and actin filaments. Furthermore, this mutant reveals that the inner rim cytoskeleton is required for expansion of the ring canal opening and for plasma membrane stabilization...|$|R

50|$|The Alpha joint is {{the main}} rotary joint {{allowing}} the solar arrays to track the sun; in nominal operation the alpha joint rotates by 360° each orbit (however, see also Night Glider mode). One Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) is located between the P3 and P4 truss segments {{and the other is}} located between the S3 and S4 truss segments. When in operation, these joints continuously rotate to keep the solar array wings on the outboard truss segments oriented towards the Sun. Each SARJ is 10 feet in diameter, weighs approximately 2,500 pounds and can be rotated continuously using bearing assemblies and a servo control system. On both the port and starboard sides, all of the power flows through the Utility Transfer Assembly (UTA) in the SARJ. Roll <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> allow transmission of data and power across the rotating interface so it never has to unwind. The SARJ was designed, built and tested by Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaResearch and {{development}} testing of rotating machinery {{has always been}} limited {{in the number of}} measurements because slip <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies</b> have a limited number of conductors available for signals to pass from rotating to non rotating sections. Such testing has been impeded because relatively long wires are needed to pass low level analog signals. Because of the line resistance and capacitance and their susceptibility to stray fields, much effort is dedicated to the investigation of line loss and protection from EMI. The solution in recent years is to use current drivers or to digitize these signals as close to the transducers as possible or to employ painstaking procedures for correction of data in software. At NASA's Ames Research Center, recent research requirements have approached the limit of practical slip <b>ring</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Line lengths needed for wind tunnel tests can be 300 feet. The solution provides for an increase of channels by an order of magnitude, improved data quality, elimination of all efforts to correct data for line loss, a simple and quick installation, real time monitoring with extensive graphics capability and a manageable method for data storage. The system is called the Rotor Mounted Data Acquisition System (RMDAS) and has been acquired through a U. S. Government contract with Aydin Vector Division in Newtown, Pennsylvania. This is a high density, high speed, signal conditioning and multiplexing system which mounts on the rotating hub of full scale rotorcraft and transmits PCM, NRZ-L bit streams to a fixed end data system. The system is 512 channel capable at 20 KSPS/channel when configured for maximum channel capacity. The channel sampling capability for a single channel or for a group of channels is 177 KSPS. The individual channel sample rate can be changed by reprogramming the number of channels per segment.
