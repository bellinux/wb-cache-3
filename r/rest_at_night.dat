5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted men can be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E

It was {{drawn up by}} The Ministry of Labour {{and it is the}} main source of the worker’s rights. The right for a clean and private place in which to relax in their free time. Also, clean and appropriate clothes, and sufficient food (Article 8). The right to medical care when needed, including dental and eye care, the costs of which should be met by the employer. The workers are covered by health insurance in the case of emergency (Article 9). The right to work for ten non-consecutive hours every day with frequent short breaks, and at least eight continuous hours of <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> (Article 11). The right for a weekly rest period of 24 hours, and deciding which day in the week is to be discussed between the worker and the employer (Article 12). The right for annual leave consists of 6 days also the dates should be discussed between the employer and the worker (Article 12). The right for a return ticket {{at the end of the}} contract (Article 13). The right for one phone call every month on the charge of the employer (Article 14). The right for sick leave when there is a medical report, half a month with pay and half a month with half pay (Article 15). There is no stipulation in the contract for any free legal assistance for the domestic workers.|$|E
500|$|The impala is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though {{activity}} tends to cease during the hot midday hours; they feed and <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> Three distinct social groups can be observedthe territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The territorial males hold territories {{where they may}} form harems of females; territories are demarcated with urine and faeces and defended against juvenile or male intruders. Bachelor herds tend to be small, with less than 30 members. Individuals maintain distances of [...] from one another; while young and old males may interact, middle-aged males generally avoid one another except to spar. Female herds vary in size from 6 to 100; herds occupy home ranges of [...] The mother–calf bond is weak, and breaks soon after weaning; juveniles leave the herds of their mothers to join other herds. Female herds tend to be loose and have no obvious leadership. Allogrooming is an important means of social interaction in bachelor and female herds; in fact, the impala {{appears to be the}} only ungulate to display self-grooming as well as allogrooming. In allogrooming, females typically groom related impalas, while males associate with unrelated ones. Each partner grooms the other six to twelve times.|$|E

50|$|These {{squirrels}} live in forests, active {{during the}} day and <b>resting</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> spending most of their time in trees. Their dreys (or nests) are built in branches from leaves and twigs. The squirrel's main diet consists of soft fruit, nuts and seeds. Females generally give birth to 2 or 3 young during the April to August dry season.|$|R
50|$|Due to the black-handed tamarin’s small size, {{they are}} {{considered}} prey by many other animals. Their predators include man, diurnal birds of prey, snakes, and various cat species including margay and ocelot, which are capable arboreal hunters. Because black-handed tamarins have both aerial and terrestrial predators, they utilize any tree or bundled, thick foliage into which they can climb, and they maintain a group sleep system to keep safe while <b>resting</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} Colonel Havard’s {{observations}} was to ascertain important {{information about the}} changing battlefield and how to apply it to the Army Medical Corps. [...] In his official report, Havard {{compiled a list of}} lessons learned from the Russo-Japanese experience. [...] He noted the lack of frontal assaults that were the result of improved weaponry, particularly the machine gun. [...] Flanking movements became more necessary to avoid the machine gun, which necessitated increased frequency and distance of forced marches. [...] In previous wars, soldiers were able to <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and armies saw little action during winter months. [...] Both practices had become antiquated. [...] Attacks were often ordered at night and the waging of war never ceased, even in sub-zero temperatures. [...] According to Havard, the result of these trends was soldiers experiencing an increased amount of battle fatigue, as well as resurgence in the usefulness of the bayonet in night assaults. The Japanese claimed seven percent of their casualties resulted from bayonet wounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{mountain}} gorilla is diurnal, most active between 6:00a.m. and 6:00p.m. Many of these hours are spent eating, as {{large quantities of}} food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before <b>resting</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. They leave their sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests.|$|R

He also had confidence in the grizzled, olive-faced Spaniard who stood gravely behind him, gripping the steering-wheel.|$|E

2500|$|After each battle, {{characters}} earn experience points (EXP), {{but they}} do not automatically level up when a certain amount of EXP has been gathered.

AP is spent on the Ascension, the game's leveling system, which is divided into skill trees called [...] "Astralspheres". Each Astralsphere is sorted by type, being associated with magic, combat or passive abilities. Spending AP opens up nodes within the Astralsphere, which in turn grants access to further nodes which require higher amounts of AP to unlock.|$|R

But Mrs. Diffidence ought rather to have been called Dame Desperation, or Desperate Resolution; for she seems, if anything, the more stubborn genius of the two-(Cheever). By these conversations between Diffidence and Despair, after they had retired to bed, Bunyan perhaps designed to intimate that, as melancholy persons seldom get <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> the gloominess of the season contributes to the distress of their minds.
