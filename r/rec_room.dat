25|$|Ed's Bowling (formerly Red's), is an {{entertainment}} complex {{consisting of a}} bowling alley, arcade, and formerly a pool hall, music stage, and restaurant. The stage was one of Edmonton's major music venues. Past players have included many bands, both Canadian and international. Wilco, Arcade Fire, The Flaming Lips, The Mars Volta, Mot√∂rhead, Matthew Good Band, Sloan, P.O.D., Joe Satriani, Cradle of Filth, Theory of a Deadman, Our Lady Peace, In Flames, Lifehouse, Children of Bodom, Bring Me the Horizon, Testament, DragonForce, Opeth, GWAR, Muse and Switchfoot {{are just some of}} the bands that have played at the venue. It was formerly known as the nightclub/restaurant/rec room Red's. At the end of June 2006, the owners of Red's closed its doors after they chose not to renew their lease. The mall separated it into three areas, converting the stage/restaurant area into a separate concert venue known as the Edmonton Event Centre, while the other area containing the lounge, the arcade and the bowling alley was re-dubbed Ed's <b>Rec</b> <b>Room</b> and a mini-golf course, Putt 'n' Glow. The Edmonton Event Centre closed on New Years Day 2013. It was demolished in December 2013, and Sport Chek took over its former space. In 2017, Ed's <b>Rec</b> <b>Room</b> renamed themselves to Ed's Bowling, so they would not get confused with the newly opened <b>Rec</b> <b>Room,</b> operated by Cineplex.|$|E

500|$|The Enterprise {{engine room}} was {{redesigned}} while keeping {{consistent with the}} theory that the interior appearance had to match the corresponding area visible in exterior views of the starship. Michelson wanted the engine room to seem vast, a difficult effect to achieve on a small sound stage. To create the illusion of depth and long visible distances, the art department staff worked on designs that would utilize forced perspective; set designer Lewis Splittgerber considered the engine room the most difficult set to realize. On film the engine room appeared hundreds of feet long, but the set was actually only [...] in length. To achieve the proper look, the floor slanted upward and narrowed, while small actors of three, four, and fivefeet in height were used as extras to give the appearance of being far from the camera. For [...] "down shots" [...] of the engineering complex, floor paintings extended the length of the warp core several stories. J.C. Backings Company created these paintings; similar backings were used to extend the length of ship hallways and the <b>rec</b> <b>room</b> set.|$|E
