60|$|Almost every {{section of}} the trading and {{political}} community looked with favour upon the budget as a whole, though {{it was true that}} each section touched by it found fault with its own part. Mr. Gladstone said that they were without exception free traders, but not free traders without exception. The magnitude and comprehensiveness of the enterprise seized the imagination of the country. At the same time it multiplied sullen or uneasy interests. The scheme was no sooner launched, than the chancellor of the exchequer was overwhelmed by deputations. Within a couple of days he was besieged by delegates from the paper makers; distillers came down upon him; merchants interested in the bonding system, wholesale stationers, linen manufacturers, maltsters, licensed victuallers, all in turn thronged his ante-room. He was now, says Greville (Feb. 15), “the great man of the day!” The <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> on currants created lively excitement in Greece, and Mr. Gladstone was told that if he were to appear there he could divide honours with Bacchus and Triptolemus, the latest benefactors of that neighbourhood.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{dangerous}} thing in this controversy, with the ugly rush of vested interests always lying {{in the wake of}} the Protectionist movement to be considered, to make even verbal concessions. Some time ago I made a speech in which I said that there was no objection to the extension of inter-colonial preference. By this I meant the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> between Colonies which have already a discriminating tariff; and it seemed to me in such a case that there is a net reduction of duty to the good. I do not see any objection to that, because under the most-favoured-nation principle we gain any advantage which is gained by either party to the transaction. In any case, the sums involved in inter-colonial preference at the present time are extremely small, and, however that might be, the matter is one which is wholly outside our control, because we have no authority over the Colonies in this respect, and we may just as well look pleasant about it and accord a sympathetic attitude to such a process.|$|E

6000|$|Anticipating the {{immediate}} dissolution of Parliament, Sir Robert Peel had issued {{an address to}} the electors of Tamworth, justifying his commercial policy. In the opinion of Lord George Bentinck it set forth a statement as to the effect and operation of those financial measures which had taken place {{in the course of the}} last six years, which, if left altogether unrefuted, might have a dangerous tendency at the coming elections. The general effect of that statement was, that by the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> to a large extent, it was possible to relieve the people of this country of burdens amounting to more than seven millions and a half sterling with little or no loss whatever to the revenue. But the truth was, Sir Robert Peel in his reductions had dealt only with little more than ten millions sterling of the revenue of the country, and had left the remaining thirty-seven millions untouched. Now on that portion of the revenue with which alone he had dealt, there was a deficiency, through his changes, to the amount of five millions sterling, which loss was compensated by the increase on those very articles which Sir Robert had left untouched. It was the opinion of Lord George Bentinck that the conclusion which Sir Robert Peel had drawn from the comparatively barren results of the increased duties on imports carried by the Whigs in 1840, viz., that indirect taxation had reached its limit, and which was indeed the basis of his new system, was a fallacy, and that the anticipated increase of import duties had not accrued in 1840 in consequence of our having had three successive bad harvests, 'and a bad cotton crop to boot,' all of which had checked the consuming power of the community. Sir Robert Peel had been favoured by three successive good harvests and nearly £100,000,000 invested in six years in domestic enterprise. 'The interposition of Providence,' said Lord George, 'is never a part of our debates.' ...|$|E

This speech succeeded in making the tariff, and the idea of protectionism, a true party matter. In the 1888 election, the Republicans were victorious with the election of President Harrison, and majorities in both the Senate and the House. For the sake of holding the party line, the Republicans felt obligated to pass stronger tariff legislation.|$|E

40|$|While {{the trade}} {{relationship}} among the countries increases, {{there is a}} necessity from the states to motivate its national industries to be inserted in a more competitive global market, providing then, equilibrium to its commercial balance and its development. To achieve a cheaper distribution system and potentially stable, the whole logistics system must be efficient. In short, this new set of logistical processes requires a logistical environment that is time-based, collaborative and flexible. The Industrial-Airport concept consolidates this necessity for the intensification of the logistic system of the Country, providing the installation of industrial plants in international airports specified for exportation with disbureaucracy, simplification of procedures and <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> taxes and logistics costs, increasing, on the other hand, the industrial competitiveness in an international global market.

40|$|The {{design current}} for the Next Linear Collider (NLC) damping rings is {{an order of}} {{magnitude}} higher than existing damping rings. As opposed to storage rings, damping rings are required to operate at a high repetition frequency. Transient beam loading is therefore particularly severe. The NLC design [1] calls for a full current fill pattern consisting of up to 4 trains of 90 bunches for a total dc current of 1. 2 A. However, using conventional filling techniques, with a rapid current ramp the ring energy acceptance could decrease due to transient loading and the beam might not be captured. In this paper we describe two features of the low-level rf system design. The first avoids any <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> cycle while the second ensures beam capture and regulation of the cavity voltages and beam phase. ...|$|R
50|$|The kelp {{trade was}} badly {{affected}} {{by the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and had collapsed totally by 1820. Kelp (or seaweed) was harvested from the seashore at low tide, dried and burnt to yield an alkali extract used in the manufacture of soap and glass. It was a very labour intensive industry. Production had steadily grown from the 1730s to a peak level in 1810, with most production located in the Hebrides. The end of war reintroduced competition from Spanish Barilla, a cheaper and richer product. This, combined with the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> on the foreign import, and the discovery that cheaper alkali could be extracted from common salt, destroyed the seasonal employment of an estimated 25 to 40 thousand crofters. There was little prospect of alternative employment; the only possibility was fishing, which was also in decline at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Compact fusion {{toroidal}} machines operating in DT {{have the potential}} to become efficient sources of neutrons for material testing. An Ignitor-like device could be envisaged for this purpose, making full use of the intense neutron flux that it can generate without reaching ignition. Preliminary radiation damage estimates for some fusion-relevant materials have shown that few full-power months of operation would provide adequate dpa levels. The main features and technological issues of a High Field Neutron Source Facility based on the Columbus concept, with about 50 % more volume than Ignitor, are illustrated and discussed. Optimization of the plasma temperature and density relative to the reference ignition scenario (with the assistance of auxiliary heating power) can achieve considerable <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> cycle requirements. The constraints imposed by flux availability, magnet heating and wall loading will inevitably impose a complete redesign of the machine, with the adoption of novel materials (such as MgB 2 superconductor already adopted for Ignitor), and new modes of operation will need be investigate...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} data {{gathering}} has received significant attention as {{an application of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Staggered data tree based protocols {{have been shown to}} be successful in reducing energy consumption in data gathering scenarios. An important part of staggered protocols is the process of schedule construction. In order to minimize energy consumption, this process must be fast. In this paper we present TrickleTree, a fast distributed protocol for establishing staggered communication schedule. TrickleTree has three functions: to establish routes, i. e. construct a data gathering tree, to establish a staggered communication schedule, i. e. assign time slots to links, and to disseminate the maximal tree depth in the network. To minimize network setup time, TrickleTree combines the neighborhood discovery and scheduling steps. To reduce message overhead, TrickleTree uses adaptive gossiping. The behavior of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation. The results show up to 90 % reduction in schedule setup time and a 50 % <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> cycle compared to a flooding approach...|$|R
