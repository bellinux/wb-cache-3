40|$|Abstract. A newly {{developed}} multi-wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) method would accomplish the high performance slicing of silicon and silicon carbide with a narrow kerf width under a clean process environment. However, the thinner wire is challenging process with a normal round shape wire electrode. Therefore, a new wire electrode with track-shaped section was proposed {{in order to satisfy}} both the narrow kerf width and the high wire tension even in the case <b>of</b> thin <b>wire</b> electrode. In this study, the <b>running</b> control <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated, and the possibility of proposed process was discussed. A brass coated steel wire electrode with track-shaped section of aspect ratio 1 : 2 could perform the smaller vibration and the stable running up to 300 m/min.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{efficient}} and precise slicing method {{is required for}} the slicing of silicon carbide ingot. The newly developed multi-wire electrical discharge slicing method would decrease the kerf width and the cracks generated on machined surface. However, much higher wire tension is required in order to reduce wire vibration and to perform a smaller kerf width. Thin wire electrode with round section does not have enough cross sectional area under the high wire tension condition. Therefore, a wire electrode with track- shaped section was proposed and applied to the <b>wire</b> EDM slicing <b>of</b> silicon carbide ingot. The <b>running</b> control <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated.

In the experiments of self-producing heat <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> 6 types <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes to characterise residential power line configurations {{and to determine}} the extent to which wire codes provide a proxy measure of residential magnetic field strength in a case-control study of childhood leukaemia conducted in nine states within the United States. METHODS: Misclassification <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0. 89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on <b>wire</b> codes because <b>of</b> misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code range. The lack of an association between high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area...|$|R
