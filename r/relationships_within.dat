5|$|All {{the cats}} in this genus {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} that {{is believed to have}} lived around 6–7million years ago in the Near East (the Middle East). The exact <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> the Felidae are close but still uncertain, e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the North African variety F. s. lybica.|$|E
5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of europium in minerals {{relative to}} other rare-earth elements {{is known as the}} europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> a suite of igneous rocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} {{the results of}} a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B.ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> the series supported the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi.|$|E

5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> Noasauridae. The specimen CCG 20011 (an as-of-yet unnamed taxon formerly {{referred to the}} tetanuran Chuandongocoelurus), which {{was not included in}} other analyses, was found to be closer to Elaphrosaurus than Limusaurus, with the three taxa representing Elaphrosaurinae. Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa within Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal to the group of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae within Noasauridae.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how manage and maintain a good digital customer <b>relationship</b> <b>within</b> a brand community, customer-centric model of brand community [4] is applied in this study. According to McAlexander et al. [4], “a community {{is made up of}} its entities and the relationships among them” (p 38). Therefore, a Social Media brand community comprises entities, e.g. the brand, products, customers, the company and four relationships, such as customer-brand relationship, customer-product relationship, customer-company relationship, and customer-other customer relationship. This study is going to explore individual digital customer <b>relationship</b> <b>within</b> Social Media brand community through investigating these four relationships.|$|R

5|$|Although ancient Lapita potteries {{date back}} to 1500 BC, {{and the people of}} the island have long been {{involved}} in the arts, since the establishment of the ADCK, Kanak arts and crafts have become more popular in New Caledonia. Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are popular as is flèche faîtière, a carving which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes. Music, dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function and dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> the clan and with ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata is {{classified}} in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, according to the systems proposed by Cornelis Bas (1969), and Rolf Singer (1986). It was one of 49 Amanita species included in a 1998 molecular phylogenetic analysis intended to help clarify natural groups and phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> the genus. In the cladogram, A.rubrovolvata is on a branch next to a cluster of species including A.pantherina var. lutea, A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.sinensis. These results were comparable to those published in later phylogenetic analyses (1999, 2004, 2010) that have included A.rubrovolata {{as part of a}} larger dataset.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary <b>relationships)</b> <b>within</b> the family Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated}} that Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to survey {{significant}} literature on policy coordination and outline relevant problems and solutions for Latvia. In the rapidly changing environment organisations have to ensure not only smooth vertical coordination (hierarchical, principal – agent <b>relationship)</b> <b>within</b> organisation, but also enhance horizontal coordination (decentralised, network <b>relationship)</b> both <b>within</b> and between organisations. A recent body of literature has argued that none of these challenges are unfamiliar in the public administration...|$|R
5|$|P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the subject of {{subsequent}} studies seeking to clarify the <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> Mentheae. Further research combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with rbcL sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between Perovskia and Salvia clade I. It also distinguished between P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides, while confirming their close relationship. A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{has demonstrated that}} the Microsporidia, unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> this group.|$|E
5|$|They used a {{cladistic}} {{analysis to}} examine its <b>relationships</b> <b>within</b> Oryzomyini, also including {{two species of}} Holochilus, Lundomys, and five other oryzomyines. They found that Noronhomys appeared closest to Holochilus, with Lundomys more distantly related. Eighteen shared characters (synapomorphies) supported the grouping of Noronhomys with Holochilus. Another form described as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus primigenus, may also be related, but is likely to fall outside the Holochilus–Noronhomys clade.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} distinction {{is made from}} situational switching, where alternation between varieties redefines a situation, being a change in governing norms, and metaphorical switching, where alternation enriches a situation, allowing for allusion {{to more than one}} social <b>relationship</b> <b>within</b> the situation.|$|R
50|$|The genus Ganguroo is {{a species}} of early to middle to late Miocene {{kangaroo}} found in Riversleigh, in Australia. The <b>relationship</b> <b>within</b> the Macropodidae is in dispute, though it is phylogenetically proposed to be a sister taxon with the Macropodidae.|$|R
50|$|Civic {{engagement}} has an interrelated <b>relationship</b> <b>within</b> {{the various}} entities of the state.
