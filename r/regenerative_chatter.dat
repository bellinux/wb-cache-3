However, many materials that are increasingly used in aerospace components are difficult to machine at high spindle speeds because of their thermal properties. Examples include titanium and nickel alloys. For these materials, low-speed machining must be employed, and in this regime the role of <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> is less clearly understood due to the phenomenon of process damping. In the present study, a time domain model of process damping is developed. This model is used to explore the relationship between cutting conditions and the amplitude of chatter vibrations. A qualitative agreement is found between experimental behaviour and the numerical model.

The present work attempts to address these issues, by first developing an efficient approach to variable helix tool stability based upon the Laplace transform. Then, this new analysis method is used to demonstrate the importance of multi-frequency effects and nonlinear cutting stiffness. The work suggests that whilst variable-helix tools can have more operating regions that are stable, un-modelled behaviour (such as nonlinearity and multi-frequency effects) can have a critical influence on the accuracy of model predictions...|$|E

Chatter is a self-excited type of vibration that develops during machining due to process-structure dynamic interactions resulting in modulated chip thickness. Chatter is an important problem, since it results in poor surface quality, reduced productivity and reduced tool life. The <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> results from phase differences between two subsequent passes of the cutting tool and occurs earlier than mode coupling chatter in most cases. In <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> theory, stability limit in the cutting process is inversely proportional to the negative real part of frequency response function (FRF) of the cutting tool-workpiece assembly. If the negative real part of the FRF at the cutting point can be decreased, depth of cut, in other words productivity rates, will increase. In piezoelectric shunt damping method, an electrical impedance is connected to a piezoelectric transducer which is bonded to the main structure.

40|$|Communicated by Yang Kuang) Abstract. In {{a turning}} process modeled using delay {{differential}} equations (DDEs), we investigate {{the stability of}} the <b>regenerative</b> machine tool <b>chatter</b> problem. An approach using the matrix Lambert W function for the analytical solution to systems of delay differential equations is applied to this problem and compared with the result obtained using a bifurcation analysis. The Lambert W function, known to be useful for solving scalar first-order DDEs, has recently been extended to a matrix Lambert W function approach to solve systems of DDEs. The essential advantages of the matrix Lambert W approach are not only the similarity to the concept of the state transition matrix in linear ordinary differential equations, enabling its use for general classes of linear delay differential equations, but also the observation that we need only the principal branch among an infinite number of roots to determine the stability of a system of DDEs. The bifurcation method combined with Sturm sequences provides an algorithm for determining the stability of DDEs without restrictive geometric analysis. With this approach, one can obtain the critical values of delay, which determine the stability of a system and hence the preferred operating spindle speed without chatter. We apply both the matrix Lambert W function and the bifurcation analysis approach to the problem of chatter stability in turning, and compare the results obtained to existing methods.

Some {{of the effects of}} vibration and chatter are short tool life span, tool damage, inaccurate dimension, poor surface finish and unacceptable noise. The basic dynamic model of turning operation should include a rotating work piece excited by a force that moves in the longitudinal direction. Dynamic interaction between a rotating work piece and moving cutting forces can excite vibration and chatter noise under certain conditions. This is a very complicated dynamic problem. Vibration and chatter in machining is one example of moving load problems as the cutter travels along the rotating work-piece. These moving cutting forces depend on a number of factors and <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> is the widely accepted mechanism and model of cutting forces which then introduce time delays in a dynamic model. In this investigation, the work piece is modelled as a rotating Rayleigh beam and the cutting force as a moving load with time delay based on the regenerative mechanism. The mathematical model developed considers work piece and cutting tools both as a flexible. Without doubt, this dynamic model of vibration of work piece in turning {{operation is}} more realistic than previous ones as the dynamic model has multiple-degrees-of-freedom and considers the vibration of the cutter with <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter.</b> It is found that the cutting force model of <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> which introduces time delay in a dynamic model leads to interesting dynamic behaviour in the vibration of rotating beams and a sufficient number of modes must be included to sufficiently represent the dynamic behaviour. The effects of depth of cut, cutting speed and rotational speed on the vibration and chatter occurrence are obtained and examined. Simulated numerical examples are presented. These three different parameters are vital and definitely influence the dynamic response of deflection in the y and z directions. The depth of cut is seen to be the most influential on the magnitude of the deflection. In addition, higher cutting speed combined with high depth of cut promotes chatter and produces a beating phenomenon whereas rotational speeds have a moderate influence on the dynamic response. Furthermore, several turning experiments are conducted that demonstrate vibration and chatter in the machining operations.

The generation of complex shapes with high quality for various types of materials is the main advantage of milling in contrast to other machining processes. During the milling process, the occurrence of self-excited vibrations or chatter may cause reduction in material removal rate (MRR), damage to the tool and spindle bearing or may result in poor dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the work-piece. In this paper, milling process is modeled as {{two degrees of freedom}} (2 DOF) system in which the tool wear and process damping effects are considered.

Variable pitch and variable helix milling tools have been previously proposed to avoid the onset of <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter.</b> Although variable pitch tools have been considered in some detail in previous research, this has generally focussed on behaviour at high radial immersions. In contrast there has been very little work focussed on predicting the stability of variable helix tools. In the present study, three solution processes are proposed for predicting the stability of variable pitch or helix milling tools. The first is a semi-discretisation formulation that performs spatial and temporal discretisation of the tool. Unlike previously published methods this can predict the stability of variable pitch or variable helix tools, at low or high radial immersions.

The model predictions are compared to previously published work on variable pitch tools, along with time-domain model simulations.

The focus of this thesis is to investigate the mechanism behind these vibrations {{in order to help}} reducing the generated noise in the future designs. Primary investigations show that the main mechanism which results the mentioned noise is <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> vibrations due to axial and torsional flexibilities. There is a gap in modeling of chatter vibrations in indexable drills where loadings and geometries are asymmetrical and due to torsional vibrations, delay terms are variable. The first step of simulating <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> vibrations in the drill is to model static cutting forces in a reliable way. In this thesis, a model is proposed which is capable of predicting static cutting forces through segmentation of cutting edges. Since, using this model, forces can be calculated separately on each insert, it is possible to consider differences of inserts in estimationof the cutting loads. The obtained loads are used in the chatter simulation. A model is proposed to simulate chatter vibrations by considering axialand angular deflections and the coupling between them. The resulted model isa system of delay differential equations with variable delays. Variations in timedelays, tool jump-outs and backward motions of inserts have been included inthe proposed time-domain simulation. A set of experiments is conducted toverify the model...|$|E
40|$|As {{the first}} step towards {{deriving}} a wear equation for the wear land of cutting tool, stress distributions, which {{are one of the}} most important factors determining wear rates, are analysed. The proposed method, in which uniform equivalent stresses in the workpiece along the wear land are postulated, gives the normal stress and the frictional stress on the wear land independently, using only elastic analysis incorporating the FEM when the orthogonal cutting data are in hand. The numerical solutions obtained show the same profiles of stresses as those of the stresses on the rake face of cutting tool. The overall average stresses gradually increase with wear development and are approximately equal to those of experimental values when neither tool vibration nor <b>regenerative</b> <b>chatter</b> exist...|$|E
