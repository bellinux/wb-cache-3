The processability of the films is governed {{by the amount of}} surfactant which is shown to alter strongly the wetting and viscosity of the ink. The increase of viscosity results from surfactant mediated attractive interactions between the carbon nanotubes. Links between the formulation, ink rheological properties, and electro-optical properties of the films are determined. The provided guidelines are generalized and used to fabricate optimized electrodes using conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes. In these electrodes, the carbon nanotubes act as highly efficient viscosifiers that allow the optimized ink to be homogeneously spread using the <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> method. From a general point of view and in contrast to previous studies, the CNTs are optimally used in the present approach as conductive additives for viscosity enhancements of electronic inks...|$|R

40|$|In this study, microfibrillated {{cellulose}} (MFC) {{was applied}} {{in an aqueous}} suspension as a coating material on paper substrates. Two different coating techniques were used: <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> and size press. The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated paper substrates were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated paper substrates exhibited a higher roughness than the reference paper substrate. This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated paper substrates showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference paper substrates, and most importantly, reduced air permeance and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the <b>rod</b> <b>coated</b> paper substrate with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight. The water vapour transmission rate was also decreased with the applied MFC coatings. Advantages and drawbacks were identified for the <b>coating</b> techniques. The <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern.

30|$|On {{the other}} end of the {{spectrum}} lies the solution-based process, where several methods have been reported including vacuum filtration [42], <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> [43], drop coating [26, 44], and printing [45 – 47]. The solution process of CNTs is enabled by successfully dissolving them in suitable organic solvents or in aqueous solution with the assistance of certain types of surfactants [48, 49]. SWCNT thin films obtained by vacuum filtration and <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> have been used for flexible, stretchable, and transparent electrodes [33, 50], while printed SWCNT networks have been demonstrated to act as both electrodes and channel materials for TFTs [45]. One key advantage of solution-based process is low temperature and compatibility with various types of widely used polymeric materials, thus enabling the low-cost and large-scale deposition onto various flexible and stretchable substrates [12, 20]. More importantly, through the solution process, it is possible to selectively assemble the SWCNTs with the same electronic type or chirality obtained by post-growth purification and separation [51 – 53]. With the tremendous progress in SWCNT separation and purification, semiconductor-enriched SWCNTs (sSWCNTs) are now available in large quantities [54], which enables the wafer-scale fabrication of sSWCNT TFTs with high yield and uniform performance [44]. The most significant advantage of using sSWCNT networks for TFT application lies in the unique combination of superior flexibility/stretchability, optical transparency, and low-temperature solution process, which are not possible with conventional polysilicon or amorphous silicon platforms [3, 4]. In addition, compared with organic semiconductors, sSWCNT networks not only offer drastically better air stability but also multiple orders of magnitude improvements in carrier mobility [5].|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} post-implant {{infection in the}} medical field has prompted further investigation into possible protective coatings to alleviate this problem. This study explores {{the use of a}} "scaffold" system to carry antimicrobial substances and prevent such infections. Hydroxyapatite (HAP), a calcium phosphate mineral phase, was used as a protective coating to bond with bone and act as a delivery system. Two polymers were also explored as delivery systems. PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate) is a non-resorbable polymer, while PLGA (poly-lactide-glycolide) is resorbable and was expected to dissolve to release antimicrobials. The two antimicrobial agents were analyzed in the coatings were chlorhexidine and silver nitrate. Chlorhexidine has antimicrobial effects {{on a wide range of}} both gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, and exhibits low resistance prevalence. Similarly, silver nitrate has been shown to inhibit growth of a wide range of microorganisms. The surfaces of the titanium alloy and stainless steel substrates were coated with combinations of HAP-based systems via the surface induced mineralization (SIM) method, and with the polymers through a dip-coating method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the composition of the coatings and confirm their components. The efficacy of each type of coating in inhibiting microbial growth was tested in culture plates inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of the targeted infections. Metal <b>rods</b> <b>coated</b> with HAPlchlorhexidine and HAP/silver nitrate both showed inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the uncoated <b>rods,</b> HAP-only <b>coated</b> <b>rods,</b> and all polymer <b>coated</b> <b>rods</b> exhibited no antimicrobial effects.
