50|$|A rocker sole shoe or <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe is a shoe {{which has}} a thicker-than-normal sole with rounded heel. Such shoes ensure the wearer does not have <b>flat</b> <b>footing</b> along the proximal-distal axis of the foot. The shoes are generically known {{by a variety of}} names {{including}} round bottom shoes, round/ed sole shoes, and toning shoes, but also by various brand names. Tyrell & Carter identified at least six standard variations of the rocker sole shoe and named them: toe-only rocker, rocker bar, mild rocker, heel-to-toe rocker, negative heel rocker and double rocker.|$|R
50|$|Orthopedic {{anomalies}} {{also occur}} relatively frequently, with hip dysplasia {{being the most}} common orthopedic issue. Clubfoot and <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> feet have also been reported.|$|R
50|$|Rocker soles may replace regular soles on any {{style of}} footwear. Some <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes are purpose built {{to reduce the}} {{function}} or replace the lost function of a joint. For example, {{a person with a}} hallux rigidus (stiff big toe) may use a <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe to replace the flexion lost at the metatarsal joint. <b>Rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes are also used to compensate for the lost range of motion, however caused, at the tibiotalar joint (ankle joint). In such cases, the wearer maintains solid and stable footing while standing, but the rock of the heel assists with the propulsive phase of gait, making walking more natural and less painful to the affected joints. Beneficiaries of this type of sole modification include people suffering from arthritis or any other disorder or injury causing pain and/or loss of motion in foot joints.|$|R
40|$|Background: Gait {{analysis}} after total ankle replacement {{and ankle}} arthrodesis is usually measured barefoot. However, {{this does not}} reflect reality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare patients barefoot and with footwear. Methods: We compared 126 patients (total ankle replacement 28, ankle arthrodesis 57, and tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis 41) with 35 healthy controls in three conditions (barefoot, standardized running, and <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes). Minimum follow-up was 2 years. We used dynamic pedobarography and a light gate. Main outcome measures: relative midfoot index, forefoot maximal force, walking speed. Findings: The relative midfoot index decreased in all groups from barefoot to running shoes and again to <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes (p < 0. 001). The forefoot maximal force increased wearing shoes (p < 0. 001), but there was no difference between running and <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes. Walking speed increased by 0. 06 m/s with footwear (p < 0. 001). Total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis were equal in running shoes but both deviated from healthy controls (total ankle replacement/ankle arthrodesis smaller RMI p = 0. 07 / 0. 017; increased forefoot maximal force p = 0. 757 / 0. 862; slower walking speed p < 0. 001). In <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes, this ranking remained the same except the relative midfoot index merged to similar values. Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis were inferior in both shoes. Interpretation: Runners are beneficial and the benefit is greater for fusions and replacements. <b>Rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes have little added benefit. Total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis were equal but inferior to healthy controls. Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis has an inferior outcome...|$|R

40|$|Prevalence of <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and its {{associated}} personal characteristics among public primary school students was investigated. This cross-sectional study involved 474 public primary school students (253 females and 221 males) {{between the ages of}} 6 and 10 years. <b>Flat</b> <b>foot</b> diagnosis was made using Staheli plantar index (PI), where values > 1. 15 were indicative of <b>flat</b> <b>foot.</b> The number of children diagnosed with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> was 106, yielding a prevalence rate of 22. 4 %. Flexible <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> accounted for 93 (87. 7 %) of the positive diagnoses, whereas bilateral <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> was present in 97 (91. 5 %) of the cases. There was a significant relationship between higher prevalence of pes planus and older age, with the 6 -year-old group showing the highest prevalence. Boys were twice as likely to be diagnosed with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> as girls, and obese participants were three and a half {{times more likely to have}} <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> compared with those of normal weight. In summary, about one in every five public primary school children aged  6 – 10 years would be diagnosed with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> anomaly, and obesity further increased the risk.

50|$|Relative to the skeletally mature foot structure, it is {{expected}} that an infant and young child should display a <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> posture with a lower medial longitudinal arch and everted heel position. Consistently across many studies, paediatric <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> posture has been found to reduce with age.

While correlation of femoral anteversion with intoeing is documented, its relationship with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and internal rotation of hip, indirectly femoral anteversion. Methods: 651 Children, 339 boys and 312 girls, aged 3 - 6 years, were examined and Contact Index II for <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> as well as internal rotation of hip measured. 82 children with other foot and leg deformities were excluded from further analysis. Results: Out of 569 children, 95 (16. 7 %) had <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> - 56 bilateral, 39 unilateral - with Contact Index II of 0. 88 or above. All children with <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> (and none of the normal 474) had raised internal rotation of hip (mean 69. 9 °, range 62 - 80 °).

40|$|Background In {{patients}} with Down syndrome (DS) {{one of the}} most common abnormalities is <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> which can interfere significantly with normal daily activities, such as gait. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the relationship between the <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and the gait alterations in DS children. Method Twenty-nine {{patients with}} DS and 15 non-affected subjects were assessed using 3 D Gait Analysis, using an optoelectronic system, force platforms and video recording. The degree of <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> was assessed using the arch index and kinematic and kinetic parameters were identified and calculated from 3 D Gait Analysis for each study participant. Results Data showed that ankle plantarflexion moment and ankle power during terminal stance were significant to differentiate the patients with and without flat feet: their peak values were significantly lower for the patients with <b>flat</b> <b>foot.</b> In addition, the research for correlation demonstrated that the higher the arch index value, the lower the peak of ankle moment and of the generated ankle power during terminal stance and the minimum of absorbed ankle power. Conclusions Children with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> displayed a less functional gait pattern in terms of ankle kinetics than children without <b>flat</b> <b>foot,</b> suggesting that the presence of <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> may lead to a weaker efficient walking.

40|$|Background In {{children}} with Down syndrome (DS) hypotonia and ligament laxity are characteristic features which cause {{a number of}} orthopaedic issues, such as <b>flat</b> <b>foot.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if {{children with}} <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> are characterised by an accentuated external foot rotation during walking. Method Fifty-five children with DS and 15 typically developing children recruited as control group were assessed using three-dimensional gait analysis, using an optoelectronic system, force platforms and video recording. Parameters related to foot rotation were identified and calculated and the participants’ foot morphology was assessed using the arch index. Results Data obtained in this study showed that while DS children without <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> displayed the foot position on the transverse plane globally close to controls during the whole gait cycle, the DS children with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> were characterised by higher extra-rotation of the foot in comparison with those without <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and controls.

Recent literature sea rches have examined the use of <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes specifically examining pathologies such as RA, diabetes, pressure distribution and specific a natomical locations of the foot during gait (25). In addition, there has been research investigating the biomecha nical effects of using a <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe with a mbulation (18).

40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Flat</b> <b>foot</b> {{as one of}} {{the lower}} {{extremity}} deformities might change kinetic variables of gait. Fatigue is one of the factors which can alter the vertical ground reaction force (GRF). Effect of fatiguing condition on vertical GRF was not documented in individuals with <b>flat</b> <b>feet.</b> OBJECTIVE: To examine the fatigue effect on vertical GRF in individuals with <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> compared with a normal group during barefoot walking. DESIGN: Repeated measure ANOVA for the effects of fatigue on individuals with <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> and normal feet. SETTING: Biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen subjects with <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> and 17 normal subjects (recruited according to their arch height ratio) completed the test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three vertical GRF measures (F 1; the first peak force, F 2; minimum force; and F 3; the second peak force) were extracted before and after a functional fatigue protocol. RESULTS: No significant interaction between fatigue and group was observed for the three vertical GRF measures. For F 2, fatigue and group effects were significant (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 02, respectively). Furthermore, F 2 was higher in the <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> group compared with the normal group; F 2 also increased after fatigue. For F 3, only a significant fatigue effect was observed (p = 0. 004). F 3 decreased after fatigue in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> group, a decrease in the variation of vertical GRF might be due to more flexible foot joints. After fatigue, muscles might lose their ability to control the foot joints and cause higher F 2 in the <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> group. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} metabolic energy cost and external mechanical work for step-to-step transitions after tibiotalar arthrodesis, {{and the effect}} of MBT <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes. Methods: Oxygen uptake, forceplate and kinematic data were recorded in 18 controls and 15 patients while walking at a fixed speed of 1. 25 m/s in three walking conditions: barefoot, normal walking shoes and MBT <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes. Metabolic energy cost, external mechanical work, and the roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex were analyzed. Findings: Tibiotalar arthrodesis leads to higher metabolic energy cost during walking. During step-to-step transitions positive work during push-off with the impaired ankle was decreased but negative work during collision was not affected. The roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex did not differ between groups and shoe conditions. However, both in patients and controls <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes did lead to decreased positive work at push-off and increased negative work at collision and consequently higher metabolic energy cost of walking. Interpretation: External mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is not different between patients and controls and could not account for the higher metabolic energy cost in patients. Apparently, patients adopt a different walking strategy that limits step-to-step transition cost but nevertheless induces a higher metabolic energy cost. Despite restricted ankle movement, patients retain a normal roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex. MBT shoes do not affect roll-over shape and appear to have a counterproductive effect on step-to-step transition cost and walking economy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

The recently developed paediatric flatfoot clinical-care pathway (FFP) has provided an evidence based approach to diagnosis and management. The intra and inter-rater/measurer reliability of the FFP has been investigated in this study. Methods From a study population of 140 children aged seven to 10 years, a sample with <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> was identified by screening with the Foot posture index (FPI- 6). Subjects who scored ≥ 6 on the FPI- 6 for both feet became the study's <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> sample. A same subject, repeated measure research design was used for this study which examined the reliability of the FFP in 31 children aged seven to 10 years, as rated by three examiners.
