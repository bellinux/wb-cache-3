[...] He disliked the hazing {{tradition}} and behavioral restrictions of Annapolis, and accumulated many [...] and earned mediocre grades {{during his years}} at the Academy. [...] As one biographer wrote, McCain [...] "was given to taking unauthorized midnight leave and {{spent much of his}} four ... years in contention with authority and working off massive doses of extra duty." [...] McCain later stated: [...] "I was known as a 'ratey' plebe, and that's the plebe who does not conform always to the specific rules and regulations of the upperclassmen. Some of these upperclassmen would ... <b>require</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do such things which only incited rebellion and mutiny in me, see." [...] At one point, McCain had so many demerits he was at risk of not graduating; his partying and drinking was especially dangerous as it was taking place during Prohibition. [...] For much of his final year there, he was banished from Bancroft Hall, the normal residence for midshipmen, and forced instead to live on the barracks ship [...] [...] He graduated in 1931, finishing 423rd out of 441 in class rank, nineteenth from the bottom.|$|E
500|$|For {{guitar and}} bass players, {{the players are}} given the {{opportunity}} to play single notes or chords, both as single notes or sustained, during which the players must continue to hold down the fret button(s) for the extent of the sustain. Some charts provide the ability to hold down one sustained note via its fret button while strumming additional notes. Warriors of Rock also provides simulated hammer-ons and pull-offs, where, after striking one note, specifically marked notes can be played by fingering the correct buttons but without strumming. There are also note portions of some songs where notes appear semi-transparent relative to normal notes; these notes, introduced in Guitar Hero World Tour, can be played simply by tapping the correct buttons on the controller without strumming or using a touch-sensitive [...] "slider bar" [...] below the fret buttons, if the player is using a World Tour controller. [...] Bass players can play open chords by strumming without holding any fret buttons. Warriors of Rock introduces sustained open chords for bass players, although unlike other sustainable notes, does not <b>require</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hold down the button required to execute the note initially. Drum players, when using velocity-sensitive drum kits, may be presented with both ghosted notes or notes with a shield icon over them; these represents drum notes that should be struck softer or harder than normal, respectively, to score more points. Drum players can also attach a second bass drum pedal, necessary for certain songs in the [...] "Expert+" [...] difficulty.|$|E
