50|$|Dr. Gary A. Strobel (born September 23, 1938) is an American {{microbiologist}} and naturalist who {{was born}} and raised in Massillon, Ohio. He was co-contributor to the discovery that somaclonal variation occurs in plants and can be used for plant improvement. The discovery of the <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> in Agrobacterium rhizogenes also originated in his laboratory. His son, Scott Strobel, is a professor at Yale University.|$|E
50|$|Historically, this {{substance}} {{has been}} {{best known for}} its involvement in plant-pathogen recognition, especially its role as a signal attracting and transforming unique, oncogenic bacteria in genus Agrobacterium. The virA gene on the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> of Agrobacterium rhizogenes is used by these soil bacteria to infect plants, via its encoding for a receptor for acetosyringone and other phenolic phytochemicals exuded by plant wounds. This compound also allows higher transformation efficiency in plants, in A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation procedures, and so is of importance in plant biotechnology.|$|E
50|$|Bacteria {{related to}} the {{nitrogen}} fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case of inter-kingdom conjugation. For example, the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of Agrobacterium and the root-tumor inducing (<b>Ri)</b> <b>plasmid</b> of A. rhizogenes contain genes {{that are capable of}} transferring to plant cells. The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into opine-producing factories. Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy. Infected cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} fixing Rhizobia are {{an interesting}} case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories {{for the production of}} opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> can be {{engineered}} to also contain T-DNA, used for genetic transformation (biotransformation) {{of the plant}} cells. The resulting genetically transformed root cultures can produce high levels of secondary metabolites, comparable or even {{higher than those of}} intact plants.|$|R
25|$|The Ti and <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> are {{themselves}} conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.|$|R
50|$|In the rhizosphere, plants {{may suffer}} from wounds by soil {{pathogens}} or other sources. This {{leads to the}} secretion of phenolic compounds like acetosyringone which have chemotactic effects that attract the bacteria. Under such conditions, certain bacterial genes are turned on leading to the transfer of its tDNA from its root-inducing plasmid (<b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid)</b> into the plant through the wound. After integration and expression, in vitro or under natural conditions, the hairy root phenotype is observed, which typically includes overdevelopment of a root system that is not completely geotropic, and altered (wrinkled) leaf morphology, if leaves are present.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} Agrobacterium to {{transfer}} genes to plants and fungi {{is used in}} biotechnology, in particular, genetic engineering for plant improvement. A modified Ti or <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> can be used. The plasmid is 'disarmed' by deletion of the tumor inducing genes; the only essential parts of the T-DNA are its two small (25 base pair) border repeats, {{at least one of}} which is needed for plant transformation. The genes to be introduced into the plant are cloned into a plant transformation vector that contains the T-DNA region of the disarmed plasmid, together with a selectable marker (such as antibiotic resistance) to enable selection for plants that have been successfully transformed. Plants are grown on media containing antibiotic following transformation, and those that do not have the T-DNA integrated into their genome will die. An alternative method is agroinfiltration.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{information}} {{indicating that the}} agropine-type root-inducing (<b>Ri)</b> <b>plasmid</b> pRi 1855 of Agrobacterium rhizogenes contains functional genes for auxin production (aux) in the right transferred DNA (T-DNA) region (TR-region). These genes were cloned and introduced into the T-region of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmids of mutants of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying an aux mutation. Depending on the Ri aux gene present, the oncogenicity of the Ti aux- 1 and/or aux- 2 mutations was restored, showing that the Ri aux genes are able to complement the Ti aux genes. Agrobacterium strains with an agropine-type <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> not only cause hairy root on certain plant species, but they also induce tumors on other plant species. In this paper it is shown that a mutation in either of the aux genes in the <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> leads to a total loss of tumorigenicity and a strongly diminished rhizogenicity of the host bacterium, revealing that the aux genes are important for tumor and root induction. Agrobacterium strains containing the TR-region but not the TL (left) -region of the <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> are still tumorigenic on certain plant species but are no longer capable of hairy-root induction...|$|E

40|$|T-DNA genes on Ti and <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> from Agrobacterium are {{replicated}} and repaired in bacteria but {{expressed in}} plant cells. Therefore, {{they can be}} useful tools to disclose the relative roles played by the two main mechanisms involved {{in the evolution of}} DNA base composition: (1) mutational bias along DNA replication/repair processes and (2) selective gene expression constraints. We compare the base-compositional features of 15 T-DNA genes with those of (1) other genes located on Ti or <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> but outside the T-DNA region (non-T-DNA genes) and (2) a sample of nuclear genes from a natural host plant species (tobacco). The similarity in G+C content found between T-DNA and plant genes at replacement sites, as well as the similar stronger avoidance of CpG at II-III codon positions, support an ancestral plant origin for T-DNA genes. When G+C content and codon usage are considered, T-DNA genes are more similar to non-T-DNA genes than to those of plants, indicating that the mutational bias along replication and repair processes in bacteria is the major factor driving the global compositional properties of T-DNA genes. However, when the reduction in the available CpG methylation targets and the distribution of these avoidances on the different codon positions are considered, T-DNA genes are more similar to those of plants than they are to the other plasmid genes. The requirements for expression of T-DNA genes in the plant cells would have modulated the compositional features of their sequences, mainly CpG avoidance.

A. rhizogenes-mediated transformation {{has been used to}} study gene functions, produce transgenic roots and/or plants, produce secondary metabolite, and study plant–pathogen interactions (Christey 2001; Veena and Taylor 2007; Ono and Tian 2011).

In our study, we have observed that these A. rhizogenes-infected ice plants showed better growth not only in roots but also in aerial parts of ice plants. The improved vegetative growth in A. rhizogenes-infected ice plants might be due to change of plant hormone amounts in host tissues. The effects of A. rhizogenes transformation on hormone amounts and metabolism in ice plant tissues await further investigations.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was {{to find the best}} Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain, which can induce hairy root initiation faster and the best inducer molecule which can potentiate hairy root induction in host plants. Four different wild strains of A. rhizogenes, namely A. rhizogenes 15834, A 4, WS and WR were used for hairy root infection in four host plants (Ipomoea batatas, Solenostemon rotundifolius, Vigna vexillata and Canavalia sp). Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains initiated hairy roots from the host plants without inducer molecules (AS and sugars) to a lesser level. Phenolic compound acetosyringone (AS) and sugars (D-glucose, mannose and galactose) were used to activate the virulence genes of the root inducing (<b>Ri)</b> <b>plasmid</b> which initiates transcription of virulence genes for hairy root induction. AS and sugars activated the virulence genes of the root inducing (<b>Ri)</b> <b>plasmid</b> of A. rhizogenes strains, which further initiated the transfer of T-DNA region to the host plants and enhanced hairy root induction frequency. As enhanced hairy root induction percentage in the entire host plants ranges from 11 to 61. 5 % and sugars from 16. 5 to 39. 5 %.

40|$|Abstract. The common soil {{bacteria}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes are unique genetic pathogens capable of fundamentally redirecting plant me-tabolism {{in order to}} generate macroscopic tissue masses (crown galls and hairy roots, re-spectively) which support the growth of large populations of Agrobacteria. Central to pathogenesis is the horizontal transfer of a suite of oncogenes from the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmids of A. tumefaciens and the root-inducing (<b>Ri)</b> <b>plasmids</b> of A. rhizogenes into the plant cell genome. These oncogenes alter the synthesis, perception and/or transport of phy-tohormones in planta, leading {{to the development of}} the crown gall and hairy root struc-tures from single genetically transformed plant cells. Crown galls and hairy roots become effective sinks that divert plant resources to produce opine compounds that can only be me-tabolized by the infecting strain of Agrobacterium. The basic genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying A. tumefaciens tumorigenesis were initially described over 20 years ago, with the characterization of the ipt, iaaM and iaaH oncogenes.

40|$|Summary – Hairy roots {{induced by}} Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been {{proposed}} as a versatile, easy and reproducible system for testing nematode resistance in crop plants. Here, A. rhizogenes was used to induce transgenic hairy roots on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) containing the LEMMI 9 cDNA in sense and/or antisense orientation under control of a nematode responsive promoter. The purpose was to inhibit the expression of this gene that is strongly activated in the nematode-induced feeding sites in order to block their development and, thus, make the plants resistant. Several LEMMI 9 transgenic lines produced fewerMeloidogyne incognita second-stage juveniles than the control lines, but a large variation in progeny was also seen among the control lines. Therefore, we recommend that several independent wild-type hairy root lines are generated and tested to obtain a solid control group for evaluating putative resistance constructs. Keywords – Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Lycopersicon esculentum, Meloidogyne incognita. The molecular basis of Agrobacterium-mediated plant cell transformation is the transfer and stable integration of a DNA sequence (T-DNA) from the A. tumefaciens tumour-inducing (Ti) or A. rhizogenes root-inducing (<b>Ri)</b> <b>plasmids</b> into the plant genome (Gheysen et al., 1998).

40|$|Catabolic mannopine (MOP) cyclase encoded {{by certain}} Agrobacterium Ti and <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmids</b> lactonizes MOP to agropine (AGR).

The enzyme also converted AGR to MOP with the lactonizing activity being predominant over the reverse reaction. MOP cyclase is specific for imine conjugates of D-hexose and L-glutamine and was not inhibited by sugars or amino acids. The enzyme lactonized deoxyfructosyl glutamine, a natural intermediate of MOP synthesis and catabolism, to a product indistinguishable from chrysopine, a newly discovered crown gall opine. The enzyme also lactonized N- 1 -(1, 2 -dideoxy-D-mannityl) -L-glutamine, indicating that a hydroxyl group at carbon atom 2 of the sugar moiety is not required for the enzymatic reaction.

Using a subcloned {{region of the}} <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> as 32 P-labeled probe, two lambda clones containing most of the 'left' T-DNA (TL) region were isolated. One of these lambda clones contains the left TL-DNA/plant junction, which was located by comparing nucleotide sequences from the appropriate regions of the <b>Ri</b> <b>plasmid</b> and this lambda clone.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the crown gall disease caused by bacteria of the genus Agrobacterium was assessed for 13 isolates and 5 plant tissues belonging to 4 different species.

Two primers' pairs were used to test the incidence of crown gall disease in Tunisian nurseries. The first targeted the virulence region within the Ti plasmid and the second the polygalacturonase gene used for the identification of Allorhizobium vitis. Simple PCR and sequencing unambiguously demonstrated the unexpected contamination of the asymptomatic plant tissues by part of the Ti plasmid (virulence region).

However, the most conserved sequences of the A. rhizogenes T-DNAs are not of the rol genes but those defining ORF 8, 13 and 14. Sequence comparisons have suggested that the gene product of ORF 8 might be involved in mediating auxin-related effects since it has certain significant similarities with: (i) the Tms 1 protein encoded by tms 1 gene located on the A. tumefaciens T-DNA; (ii) the A. rhizogenes rolB product; and (iii) the putative protein encoded by A. tumefaciens T-DNA gene 5.

Transgenic seedlings expressing 35 S-ORF 8 appeared to be resistant to auxin concentrations that inhibited germination and growth of wild-type seedlings. Cotyledons of transgenic seedlings exhibited a thin and lanceolated shape but adult tobacco plants expressing ORF 8 were not affected in their growth pattern and morphology.

Uptake assays of strains harboring pRiA 4 or pArA 4 a, along with complementation analyses, indicate that MOP cyclase is not sufficient for catabolism of AGR but that the strains must also express an AGR transport system. To determine the requirement for MOP cyclase in opine catabolism unequivocally, a site-specific, nonpolar deletion mutation abolishing only MOP cyclase activity was introduced into pYDH 208, a cosmid clone that confers utilization of MOP, AGR, and mannopinic acid (MOA). Strains harboring this MOP cyclase-negative mutant clone, pYDPH 208, did not utilize AGR but continued to utilize MOP. Growth on AGR was restored in this strain upon introduction of clones encoding the pTi 15955 -derived catabolic or anabolic MOP cyclase genes. The induction pattern of MOA catabolism shown by strain NT 1 harboring the MOP cyclase-deficient pYDPH 208 suggests that AGR is converted into MOP by MOP cyclase and that MOP, but not AGR, induces catabolism of MOA.
