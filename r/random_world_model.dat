We illustrate the usefulness of this technique by using it to attack a popular data sanitization scheme known as Anatomy. We stress that Anatomy {{is not the only}} sanitization scheme that is vulnerable to this attack. In fact, any scheme that uses the <b>random</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>model,</b> i. i. d. model, or tuple-independent model needs to be re-evaluated. The difference between the attack presented here and others that have been proposed in the past is that we do not need extensive background knowledge. An attacker only needs to know the nonsensitive attributes of one individual in the data, and can carry out this attack just by building a machine learning model over the sanitized data. The reason this attack is successful is that it exploits a subtle flaw in the way prior work computed the probability of disclosure of a sensitive attribute. We demonstrate this theoretically, empirically, and with intuitive examples. We also discuss how this generalizes to many other privacy schemes...|$|R
40|$|Large graph {{databases}} {{are commonly}} collected and analyzed in numerous domains. For reasons related to either space efficiency or for privacy protection (e. g., {{in the case}} of social network graphs), it sometimes makes sense to replace the original graph with a summary, which removes certain details about the original graph topology. However, this summarization process leaves the database owner with the challenge of processing queries that are expressed in terms of the original graph, but are answered using the summary. In this paper, we propose a formal semantics for answering queries on summaries of graph structures. At its core, our formulation is based on a <b>random</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>model.</b> We show that important graph-structure queries (e. g., adjacency, degree, and eigenvector centrality) can be answered efficiently and in closed form using these semantics. Further, based on this approach to query answering, we formulate three novel graph partitioning/compression problems. We develop algorithms for finding a graph summary that least affects the accuracy of query results, and we evaluate our proposed algorithms using both real and synthetic data. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{intelligent}} agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting {{in that environment}} it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather {{should be based on}} the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly from the semantics of <b>random</b> <b>worlds.</b> For example, <b>random</b> <b>worlds</b> captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of <b>random</b> <b>worlds</b> allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other nondeductive reasoning systems...|$|R

40|$|A vehicle {{simulation}} is "surface-interacting" if {{the state}} of the vehicle (position, velocity, and acceleration) relative to the surface is important. Surface-interacting simulations perform ascent, entry, descent, landing, surface travel, or atmospheric flight. The dynamics of surface-interacting simulations are influenced by the modeling of gravity. Gravity is the sum of gravitation and the centrifugal acceleration due to the world s rotation. Both components are functions of position relative to the world s center and that position for a given set of geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude) depends on the <b>world</b> <b>model</b> (<b>world</b> shape and dynamics). Thus, gravity fidelity depends on the fidelities of the gravitation <b>model</b> and the <b>world</b> <b>model</b> and on the interaction of the gravitation and <b>world</b> <b>model.</b> A surface-interacting simulation cannot treat the gravitation separately from the <b>world</b> <b>model.</b> This paper examines the actual performance of different pairs of <b>world</b> and gravitation <b>models</b> (or direct gravity models) on the travel of a subsonic civil transport in level flight under various starting conditions...|$|R

In general, a <b>world</b> <b>model</b> {{can serve as}} a central component in autonomous and cognitive systems for integrating, storing and disseminating information about an observed environment. Thus, a <b>world</b> <b>model</b> creates an abstract, simplified representation of an observed real-world domain. For allowing high-level information processing on a semantic layer, representations of real-world entities can be semantically enriched by domain models. In general, a domain model contains only a fixed number of a priori defined concepts from a closed world. However, in many real-life applications, the considered environment is not closed. For coping with changing environments, a cognitive system must be equipped with an adaptive <b>world</b> <b>model</b> able to adjust to an observed open environment. This technical report proposes details on how the OOWMcan be extended for adaptive <b>world</b> <b>modeling</b> by continuously evaluating the quality of its domain model in comparison to observed information...|$|R
