40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, (l), data {{have been given}} on the intensity and spectral distribution of solar radiation at New Orleans {{from the beginning of}} 1928 through the first half of 1932, including measurements of total radiation (direct and diffuse, sun and sky) on a horizontal lane for 7 months in 1931 and for 8 months in 1932. A su E sequent report (2) extended these data to cover 1933. The present paper summarizes the data for the 10 -year period 1931 through 1940. The work was aided b grants from the David Trautman Schwartz Research i $ und of Tulane University. The methods and procedures b which the values were obtained have remained essentia iI y the same throughout this period except that in September 1939 the Richard <b>recording</b> <b>millivoltmeter</b> used in conjunction with the Eppley pyrheliometer for the continuous measurement of total radiation on a horizontal plane was replaced by a Leeds and Northrup recording potentiometer. For the most part, measurements of solar radiation at normal in-cidence and its spectral distribution-ultra-violet, luminous and infra-red-were made at 10 a. m., 12 in. and 2 p. m. on days when the sun was unobscured by clouds or haze. Measurements were also made at the same times of the spectral distribution of the total radiation, direct and diffuse, and of the diffuse sky radiation only, as received on a horizontal surface. Spectrograms to show the short-wave-length limit of the spectrum were also taken at these times. The determinations for 1931 were made from a tower about 40 feet above sea level built on the roof of a small building adjacent to the lakorato; x since January 1932, the measurements have been ma e from a better location {{on the roof of the}} laborato building about 100 feet above sea level. This buzing is situated on the college campus about 4 miles from the business center, at latitude 29 ’ 56 ’ N., longitude 90 ’ 7 ’ 19 ”, and in an atmosphere reasonably clear of smoke and dust...|$|E
