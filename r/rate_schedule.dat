Domestic policy initiatives that Bradley led or was associated with included reform of child support enforcement; legislation concerning lead-related children's health problems; the Earned Income Tax Credit; campaign finance reform; a re-apportioning of California water rights; and federal budget reform to reduce the deficit, which included, in 1981, supporting Reagan's spending cuts but opposing his parallel tax cut package, one of only three senators to take this position.

5000|$|The United Gas Pipe Line Co., {{a natural}} gas {{pipeline}} company that operated {{in several states}} and was subject to regulation under the NGA, provided gas under long term contracts to distribution companies such as the Texas Gas Transportation Corp., Southern Natural Gas Co., and the Mississippi Valley Gas Co. The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases {{in the cost of}} gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United Gas <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> on file with the FPC or any effective <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> with the FPC which proposed to increase the contract rates. The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> The distribution companies and MLG&W intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its Mobile Gas decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule.</b> The FPC upheld the new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the [...] "going" [...] rate on the effective United Gas <b>rate</b> <b>schedule,</b> and distinguished Mobile Gas as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{throughput}} maximization problem in the downlink of CDMA data networks. Proper transmission <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> of data service in downlink can reduce the intra-cell interference; hence maximize the throughput of the downlink. Various works have been done for the transmission <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> to maximize total throughput in a CDMA network. Among these works, only the best effort method can be applied as a practical scheduling scheme. However, in this method some users may have no chance to receive their data at all during the whole scheduling time horizon since this method considers only throughput maximization. In this paper, we consider the fairness among users while maximizing total throughput of the system. Since the interference from neighboring cells of a certain cell to each user in the cell is stochastic, this problem becomes a stochastic optimization problem. The fairness among users is modeled in two different ways, a hard minimum requirement constraint and a soft minimum requirement constraint for each user. Transmission <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> methods for the two models have been suggested and tested through numerical simulation. Our simulation test showed that the method for the model with soft constraint has excellent performance in both throughput and fairness.

40|$|Residential {{natural gas}} {{customers}} in the United States face volumetric charges for natural gas that average about 30 % more than marginal cost. The large markup on natural gas – {{which is used to}} cover the fixed infrastructure and operating costs of the local distribution companies – is widely recognized to be inefficient. Nonetheless, attempts to reduce volumetric charges, and cover the revenue shortfall through increased fixed monthly fees, have faced opposition {{based on the belief that}} current <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> have desirable distributional consequences. We evaluate this claim empirically using nationally-representative household-level data. We find that natural gas consumption is weakly correlated with household income, so current <b>rate</b> <b>schedules</b> are only mildly progressive. Under current <b>rate</b> <b>schedules,</b> high-volume customers pay a disproportionately large share of fixed costs, but these exhibit a weak correlation with high-income households. The correlation is somewhat weaker still when we consider alternative indicators of household financial stress, such as poverty status or number of children in the household. We show, for example, that poor households with multiple children would receive lower bills on average under marginal cost pricing. We present evidence that one cause of the weak redistributiona...|$|R

50|$|The opinion also {{explained}} that the NGA {{was different from the}} Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) then in effect, which required transportation companies to use the same <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> for all customers and did not authorize special rates to be set by contract with individual customers as the large number of customers engaged in interstate commerce did not permit an administrative agency to review contracts with special rates. In comparison, there were relatively few gas companies and customers, and the NGA’s authorization to set rates using contracts recognized that dedicated infrastructure and capacity with individualized costs might be required for a gas company to serve a customer. Based on this difference, the Court then distinguished the prior case of Armour Packing Co. v. United States (1908), where a contract between a shipper and a railroad used the same rate as in a <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The railroad later filed a new <b>rate</b> <b>schedule</b> with the ICC.

In this paper, a high sampling rate of visual feedback is achieved by distributed computation on a cloud image processing platform.

A sending <b>rate</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategy aiming at saving the network load is proposed based on the tracking error. Experiments on a 7 degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator are carried out to validate the proposed approach.
