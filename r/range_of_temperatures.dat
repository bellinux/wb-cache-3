5|$|Significant {{advances}} in astronomy came {{about with the}} introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures,</b> masses, and sizes.|$|E
5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures,</b> making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E

Acartia margalefi is {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time in British waters, where it is found to be an important copepod in the mesozooplankton community structure of Southampton Water and Horsea Lake.

25|$|One {{significant}} {{example of}} the use of piezoelectric crystals was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories. Following World War I, Frederick R. Lack, working in radio telephony in the engineering department, developed the “AT cut” crystal, a crystal that operated through a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Lack's crystal didn't need the heavy accessories previous crystal used, facilitating its use on aircraft. This development allowed Allied air forces to engage in coordinated mass attacks through the use of aviation radio.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of the Lummer and Kurlbaum cavity radiation source {{was that it was}} an experimentally accessible source of black-body radiation, as distinct from radiation from a simply exposed incandescent solid body, which had been the nearest available experimental approximation to black-body radiation over a suitable <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The simply exposed incandescent solid bodies, that had been used before, emitted radiation with departures from the black-body spectrum that made it impossible to find the true black-body spectrum from experiments.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{is capable}} of greater {{work-hardening}} than is the case with pure copper, so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping. There is an increase in work-hardening capability with increasing percentage of arsenic, and it can be work-hardened over a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> without fear of embrittlement. Its improved properties over pure copper can be seen with as little as 0.5 to 2wt% As, giving a 10 to 30% improvement in hardness and tensile strength.|$|E

25|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry, or DSC, is a thermoanalytical {{technique in}} which {{the difference in the}} amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> to be scanned.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{negative}} feedback is that radiation leaving the Earth increases {{in proportion to the}} fourth power of temperature, in accordance with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This feedback is always operational; therefore, while it may be overridden by positive feedbacks for comparatively small temperature changes it will dominate for larger temperature changes. An {{example of a}} positive feedback is the ice-albedo feedback, in which increasing temperature causes ice to melt, which increases the amount of heat that Earth absorbs. This feedback only operates in a restricted <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> (those for which ice exists, and does not cover the whole surface; once all the ice has melted, the feedback ceases to operate).|$|E
