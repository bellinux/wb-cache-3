5|$|A {{detachment}} from SeaBee Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7, based at Naval Station Rota, Spain, constructed a United States Africa Command-funded boat <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> concrete perimeter wall for the Coast Guard, which was handed over in December 2010. In February 2011, the United States turned over two donated USCG Defender class boats to the Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn did {{not fire}} on the {{occasional}} German traffic still using the bridge, preferring not to advertise the Allied presence until {{the rest of the}} battalion had arrived. Upon his arrival, Frost began securing more buildings around the <b>ramp,</b> <b>and</b> a small section attack was made on the bridge. The German defenders quickly repulsed this however and Tatham-Warter organised a stronger attack, to be led by Grayburn.|$|E

5|$|The Waterfront Development Corporation {{plans to}} spend $500,000 in {{upgrades}} to the Louisville Waterfront Park near the bridge, which will take place from late 2015 to early 2016. Improvements will include additional landscaping, a new path west from the <b>ramp,</b> <b>and</b> a plaza underneath the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between westbound Highway403 and eastbound on the parkway being {{provided by a}} loop <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> access between westbound on the parkway and westbound Highway403 requiring a left turn at a traffic light.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face. In the episode, while being launched off a <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} tornado, later named the Lone Grove Tornado, first touched down in southeast Jefferson County, Oklahoma at 6:48pm CST (00:48UTC) near the Red River. The tornado crossed through {{rural areas as}} it moved to the northeast into Love County, before going into Carter County at 7:10pm CST (01:10UTC). The tornado continued moving to the northeast for the next 15 minutes before striking Lone Grove, Oklahoma. The tornado then crossed Interstate 35 {{just north of the}} Prairie Valley Road exit <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> tracked through rural areas of northeastern Carter County to the east of Springer, ending at 7:43pm CST (01:43UTC).|$|E
5|$|US-24 and US-40 run {{concurrently}} with I-70 and the Kansas Turnpike as it heads east toward Kansas City. The {{first free}} exit on the turnpike is a diamond interchange with 110th Street at Exit 410. This interchange is located {{just south of}} the Kansas Speedway. Just east of here, the route intersects I-435 at Exit 411. This exit uses a cloverleaf interchange with one directional <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> collector–distributor roads to avoid issues with traffic exiting immediately north of the turnpike. After this interchange, the highway enters Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the runways, parking <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> other {{features}} of Tamiami Airport were still visible {{on campus and}} clearly discernible in aerial photos. Construction has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past. University Park is a lush, heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and a 15-acre nature preserve, {{as well as a}} palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ramps</b> <b>and</b> flats of mass {{transport}} deposits are commonly studied on seismic profiles as kinematic indicators. In this study, <b>ramps</b> <b>and</b> flats {{on the margin}} of salt diapirs are mapped in a high quality 3 D seismic volume from SE Brazil (Espírito Santo Basin). Our aim is to test how differently oriented <b>ramps</b> <b>and</b> flats at the basal shear surface of specific MTD interval {{can be used to}} infer the direction of mass flow. Statistical analysis of thickness variation of the {{mass transport}} deposit within depocentre created by <b>ramps</b> <b>and</b> flats was estimated along slope in order to elucidate the mode of emplacement of the associated MTD. Sliding at the plane of failure is enhanced by seafloor faulting <b>and</b> nearby halokinesis. <b>Ramps</b> significantly contribute to local changes in gradient at the basal shear surfaces, as they are linked to promontories (Type I) and paleo-fault scarps (Type II) ...|$|R

5|$|When the New Jersey Department of Transportation started {{construction}} on upgrading the bypass, the fly-over <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> on-ramp {{to and from}} Route172 were torn down for {{construction of a new}} interchange along a new local/express format. The overpass was closed on October 12, 2007 to begin the construction. The bridge was built by 1955 and was replaced in 2008. On January 2, 2009, the new exit ramp for Route18 to Route172 was reopened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with Angle and Cena locking up, leading to Angle taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by Angle {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff came down the <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit Angle with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E

5|$|Team Razer was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} devised and popularised the crushing and piercing arm weapon. Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight robot Venom is a scaled-down replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of Robot Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} Robot Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of Robot Wars was used as the model for a pull-back toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> barrels. A small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the Robot Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the Robot Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev OKB {{began work}} in September 1946 on a {{military}} transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Randy Orton and Cactus Jack. Three months prior at the Royal Rumble, after Mick Foley {{eliminated}} Orton from the Royal Rumble match, Orton hit Foley with a steel chair, and the two brawled up the <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> into the back. In March at WrestleMania XX, Evolution (Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair) faced off against The Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Foley and The Rock) in a Handicap match. Evolution won the match when Orton pinned Foley after an RKO. Two weeks later, Foley challenged Orton to a Hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Backlash, which Orton accepted that same night.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
5|$|I-97 {{temporarily}} gains {{two extra}} lanes {{in each direction}} between MD 100 and its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 176 (Dorsey Road). Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimore–Washington International Airport. I-97 continues through Ferndale, where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Baltimore Light Rail immediately before the highway's four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard), which provides access to the transit line's terminal station, Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie. I-97's final interchange is with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The Interstate crosses the Cabin Branch of Curtis Creek within the interchange, which includes a flyover ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695; that <b>ramp</b> <b>and</b> the one from eastbound I-695 to I-97 merge {{on the inside of}} the two carriageways of the Beltway. The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I-695 to I-97 in Brooklyn Park. The highway continues as I-895A, a pair of ramps that merge with the spur from I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) to MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). The continuation from I-97 includes a ramp to westbound I-695 that allows access to the Beltway's interchange with MD 648.|$|E
