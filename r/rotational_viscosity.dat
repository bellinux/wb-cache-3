50|$|Viscosity {{is usually}} {{described}} as the property of a fluid which determines {{the rate at which}} local momentum differences are equilibrated. <b>Rotational</b> <b>viscosity</b> is a property of a fluid which determines the rate at which local angular momentum differences are equilibrated. It is only appreciable if there are rotational degrees of freedom for the fluid particles. In the classical case, by the equipartition theorem, at equilibrium, if particle collisions can transfer angular momentum as well as linear momentum, then these degrees of freedom will have the same average energy.

If the particles have rotational degrees of freedom, this will imply an intrinsic angular momentum and if this angular momentum can be changed by collisions, it is possible that this intrinsic angular momentum can change in time, resulting in an intrinsic torque that is not zero, which will imply that the viscous stress tensor will have an antisymmetric component with a corresponding <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosity</b> coefficient. If the fluid particles have negligible angular momentum or if their angular momentum is not appreciably coupled to the external angular momentum, or if the equilibration time between the external and internal degrees of freedom is practically zero, the torque will be zero and the viscous stress tensor will be symmetric. External forces can result in an asymmetric component to the stress tensor (e.g. ferromagnetic fluids which can suffer torque by external magnetic fields).|$|E

5000|$|These {{types of}} {{polymers}} {{have played a}} role in biomedical and robotic applications and liquid crystalline polymers. In 1974, R.B. Meyer predicted ferroelectricity in chiral smectic liquid crystals by pure symmetry conditions. Shortly after, Clark and Lagerwall had done work on the fast electrooptic effect in a surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) structure. This opened up promising possibility of technical applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals in high-information display devices. Through applied research, it was shown that SSFLC structure has faster switching times and bistability behavior in comparison with commonly used nematic liquid crystal displays. In the same time period, the first side-chain liquid crystalline polymers (SCLCP) were synthesized. These comb-like polymers has mesogenic side chains that are covalently bonded (via flexible spacer units) to the polymer backbone. The most important feature of the SCLCP's is their glassy state. In other words, these polymers have a [...] "frozen" [...] ordered state along one axis when cooled below their glass transition temperature. This is advantageous for research in the area of nonlinear optical and optical data storage devices. The disadvantage is that these SCLCP's suffered from their slow switching times due to their high <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosity.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of an isolated field-oriented chain of dipolar particles in elongational fluid flow. Our main goal is to emphasize the effect of dipolar interactions on the chain's contribution to the pressure tensor and to the viscosities of a dilute suspension of these linear aggregates. In our model, despite the overall rigid appearance of the chain at rest, the constituent beads may move slightly relative to one another, conferring {{a certain degree of}} flexibility to the chain. This flexibility is quantified in terms of a dimensionless parameter, λ^- 1, comparing thermal and dipolar energies. We perform an expansion in λ^- 1, and obtain the first correction to the rigid chain contribution to the Kramers' pressure tensor for different flow geometries. The interplay of the elongational flow field and the field-induced chain orientation gives rise to a rich variety of scenarios.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosity</b> for a chlorine fluid {{and for a}} fluid composed of small linear molecules by using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.

40|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) {{was used to}} measure the translational diffusion of labeled apomyoglobin (tracer) in concentrated solutions of ribonuclease A and human serum albumin (crowders), as a quantitative model system of protein diffusive motions in crowded physiological environments. The ratio of the diffusion coefficient of the tracer protein in the protein crowded solutions and its diffusion coefficient in aqueous solution has been interpreted in terms of local apparent viscosities, a molecular parameter characteristic for each tracer-crowder system. In all protein solutions studied in this work, local translational viscosity values were larger than the solution bulk viscosity, and larger than <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosities</b> estimated for apomyoglobin in the same crowding solutions.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the macroscopic mechanical behavior of highly concentrated fiber suspensions for which the mechanical behavior is governed by local fiber–fiber interactions. The problem is approached by considering the case of a net of rigid fibers of uniform length, linked by viscous point interactions of power-law type. Those interactions may result in local forces and moments located at the contacting point between two fibers, and respectively power-law functions of the local linear and angular velocity at this point. Assuming the existence of an elementary representative volume which size is small compared {{to the size of the}} whole structure, the fiber net is regarded as a periodic assembly of identical cells. Macroscopic equilibrium and constitutive equations of the equivalent continuum are then obtained by the discrete and periodic media homogenization method, based on the use of asymptotic expansions.
