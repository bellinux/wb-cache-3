5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise.

Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
