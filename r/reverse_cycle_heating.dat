This HVAC system consists of an air-based photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collector and a phase change material (PCM) thermal storage unit integrated with a <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>heat</b> pump, in a ducted system. The system was designed for operation during both winter and summer using daytime solar radiation and night-time sky radiative cooling, respectively. The PVT collector heats or cools fresh air from ambient and thereby provides heating or cooling either directly to the indoor space, or to the PCM storage unit. The heat stored in the PCM can be used later to condition the space or precondition the air entering the air handling unit. Analytical models for the PVT collector and PCM unit were developed in order to be easily implemented into a practical building management system (BMS). Experimental studies on the PVT collector and PCM unit were carried out and the data was used to validate the effectiveness of the models.

40|$|Cooling a {{greenhouse}} with a refrigeration system rather than conventional ventilation {{makes it possible}} to maximise the fractional enrichment time for carbon dioxide, and more importantly enrich during periods of high photosynthetically active radiation. Using conventional climate control methods, enrichment is limited to periods when the greenhouse is not being ventilated, thus reducing the potential enrichment time of the crop. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a simulation model of {{a greenhouse}} crop growing with a closed cycle climate control system, using a heat pump, with a reversible (dual) <b>cycle,</b> for <b>heating</b> and cooling. A computer implemented mathematical model developed by Wells (1992) was modified to simulate cucumber crop growth in a greenhouse of commercial size and allowing certain parameters to be set. These parameters included: two types of control system, four levels of enrichment, three crop periods, and at two locations, Auckland and Christchurch. The three crop periods chosen were 26 Jan to 26 April, 25 May to 23 August, and 20 September to 19 December. The two types of control involved conventional fan ventialtion and electric <b>heating,</b> and closed <b>cycle</b> climate control using a <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>heat</b> pump. Greenhouse carbon dioxide enrichment levels used were 350, 600, 900, 1200 μ 1. 1 - 1. The two locations chosen were Auckland and Christchurch. An economic analysis of the results was carried out calculating Annual Marginal Return (AMR) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for treatments compared to control. It was concluded that carbon dioxide enrichment combined with conventional control is a worthwhile investment in Christchurch but less so in Auckland. Due to the high capital cost, carbon dioxide enrichment combined with closed cycle climate control is a less attractive investment. However, as considerable energy savings are possible with closed cycle climate control, it is worthwhile investigating other less expensive forms of closed cycle climate control.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the effects of irreversibility on the performance of a <b>reverse</b> Joule-Brayton <b>cycle</b> <b>heat</b> pump for domestic heating applications. Both the simple and recuperated (regenerative) cycle are considered at a variety of operating conditions corresponding to traditional (radiator) heating systems and low-temperature underfloor heating. For conditions representative of typical central heating in the UK, the simple cycle has a low work ratio and so very high compression and expansion efficiencies and low pressure losses are required to obtain a worthwhile COP. An approximate analysis suggests that these low loss levels would not necessarily be impossible to achieve, but further investigation is required, particularly regarding irreversible heat transfer to and from cylinder walls. In principle, recuperation improves the cycle work ratio, thereby making it less susceptible to losses, but in practice this advantage is compromised when realistic values of recuperator effectiveness are considered.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Department of Energy {{in response to a}} request from the HVAC industry for consolidated information about alternative <b>heating</b> and cooling <b>cycles</b> and for objective comparisons of those cycles in space conditioning applications. Twenty-seven different heat pumping technologies are compared on energy use and operating costs using consistent operating conditions and assumptions about component efficiencies for all of them. This report provides a concise summary of the underlying principals of each technology, its advantages and disadvantages, obstacles to commercial development, and economic feasibility. Both positive and negative results in this study are valuable; {{the fact that many of}} the cycles investigated are not attractive for space conditioning avoids any additional investment of time or resources in evaluating them for this application. In other cases, negative results in terms of the cost of materials or in cycle efficiencies identify where significant progress needs to be made in order for a cycle to become commercially attractive. Specific conclusions are listed for many of the technologies being promoted as alternatives to electrically-driven vapor compression heat pumps using fluorocarbon refrigerants. Although <b>reverse</b> Rankine <b>cycle</b> <b>heat</b> pumps using hydrocarbons have similar energy use to conventional electric-driven heat pumps, there are no significant energy savings due to the minor differences in estimated steady-state performance; higher costs would be required to accommodate the use of a flammable refrigerant. Magnetic and compressor-driven metal hydride heat pumps may be able to achieve efficiencies comparable to <b>reverse</b> Rankine <b>cycle</b> <b>heat</b> pumps, but they are likely to have much higher life cycle costs because of high costs for materials and peripheral equipment. Both thermoacoustic and thermionic heat pumps could have lower life cycle costs than conventional electric heat pumps because of reduced equipment and maintenance costs although energy use would be higher. There are strong opportunities for gas-fired heat pumps to reduce both energy use and operating costs outside of the high cooling climates in the southeast, south central states, and the southwest. Diesel and IC (Otto) engine-driven heat pumps are commercially available and should be able to increase their market share relative to gas furnaces on a life cycle cost basis; the cost premiums associated with these products, however, make it difficult to achieve three or five year paybacks which adversely affects their use in the U. S. Stirling engine-driven and duplex Stirling heat pumps have been investigated in the past as potential gas-fired appliances that would have longer lives and lower maintenance costs than diesel and IC engine-driven heat pumps at slightly lower efficiencies. These potential advantages have not been demonstrated and there has been a low level of interest in Stirling engine-driven heat pumps since the late 1980 's. GAX absorption heat pumps have high heating efficiencies relative to conventional gas furnaces and are viable alternatives to furnace/air conditioner combinations in all parts of the country outside of the southeast, south central states, and desert southwest.

40|$|Domestic heating for the {{majority}} of the housing stock within the UK and Ireland use a fossil fuel boiler, oil or gas, within a central heating system distributing heat to the living space through hydronic radiators. Current trends show a rise in the price of fossil fuels (through an increasing global demand) which is having a direct impact on the individual and the economy, increasing the price of all commodities through increased transportation costs and increasing the cost of energy (heating and electricity). The increasing costs and the environmental impact associated with the burning of fossil fuels are therefore driving the need for more renewable/more energy efficient means of supplying heat. Utilising a <b>reversed</b> Rankine <b>cycle</b> <b>heat</b> pump is a proven, well established method of providing high energy efficient heat transfer from a low temperature source to a high temperature sink through the manipulation of a working fluid about a pressure differential. The temperature and pressure differential across the compressor, have a large impact on the system performance. The aim of this work was to develop an air to water heat pump as an alternative to the fossil fuel boiler whilst using the existing heat distribution system and comparable water temperatures. This system could therefore be retrofitted into {{the majority}} of the existing housing stock providing an affordable energy efficient solution to the majority of homeowners whilst reducing national greenhouse gas emissions. An advanced cycle Economised Vapour Injection heat pump was utilised to improve the system efficiency when compared with a conventional system for the high temperature and pressure lift retrofit application. The COP was improved for the EVI cycle across the range of conditions tested. Between the minimum and maximum pressure differentials, the EVI cycle provided a performance improvement of between 1 % and 27 %. An off-the-shelf inverter was coupled to the BVI compressor to provide capacity control. The inverter-motor combination was evaluated detailing the maximum and minimum frequency limits. The heat pump performance was then evaluated between these limits comparing both the EVI and conventional cycles. As the frequency/compressor RPM was reduced, the improvement for the EVI cycle with respect to the conventional increased. The transient characteristics and the control strategies of the systems were evaluated showing large reductions of the start-up time-frame and power consumption when using the EV} cycle at increased speeds. When compare:d with the conventional cycle at 50 Hz (nominal frequency), the maximum energy and time sav ings were 45 % and 64 %, respectively. This work concludes that th is set-up, using a nominal single speed compressor with an off-theshelf inverter is not ideal and creates reliability issues; however, it also highlights the potential benefits achievable when utilising capacity control which can be optimised by maximising the load matching range with a dedicated variable speed compressor.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the surface}} {{temperature}} of the outdoor coil in an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit is below both the air dew point and freezing point of water, frost can be formed and accumulated over the surface of the outdoor coil, which is usually of multi-circuit structure in order to minimize its refrigerant pressure loss and enhance the heat transfer between refrigerant and ambient air. However, frosting adversely affects the operational performance and hence the energy efficiency of the ASHP unit, therefore periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely standard defrosting method used for ASHP units is <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting. A previous related study has suggested that during <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting, downwards flowing of melted frost due to gravity over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit could deteriorate defrosting performance, by using more energy for defrosting and prolonging a defrosting process. If however an outdoor coil can be horizontally installed, the flow path for melted frost over coil surface can be shortened, and a better defrosting performance expected.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit {{is used for}} space heating at a low ambient {{temperature}} in winter, frost may be formed on its outdoor coil surface. Over time, frost accumulation on coil surface may become sufficient to restrict air passage through the coil and increase the heat transfer resistance between ambient air and coil surface, leading to performance degradation for the outdoor coil, or even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Therefore, periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard defrosting method for an ASHP unit is <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting. During a standard <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting (SRCD) operation, the indoor coil in an ASHP unit actually acts as an evaporator. Because the indoor fan is usually turned off during defrosting, there is an insignificant amount of energy from indoor coil, leading to a number of associated operational problems such as a longer defrosting duration and the risk of having a lower air temperature inside a heated space during defrosting, etc. To solve the fundamental problem of insufficient heat available during defrosting while ensuring the efficient and safe system operation, a novel <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting (NRCD) method which is thermal energy storage-based using sub-cooling energy of refrigerant for ASHPs has been developed. Comparative experiments using both the SRCD method and the NRCD method were carried out on an experimental ASHP unit with a nominal 2. 5 kW heating capacity. Experimental results clearly suggested that when using the NRCD method, the discharge and suction pressures were increased by 0. 56 and 0. 12 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the defrosting duration and heating-resumption duration were shortened by 30. 8 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, and the defrosting energy consumption was reduced by 13. 9 %, compared to those when using the SRCD method. Practical application: ASHPs have been widely used worldwide due to their significant energy-saving potentials. However, frost can be formed on the outdoor coil surface when an ASHP unit operates for space heating. Frost accumulation on coil surface reduces the coil's efficiency, or causes even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. <b>Reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method. This paper presents the <b>reverse</b> <b>cycle</b> defrosting performance for an ASHP unit with a PCM-HE acting as both a sub-cooler during heating operation and a heat source during defrosting operation, which could help to ensure the safe operation and achieve a higher defrosting efficiency of the ASHP unit.
