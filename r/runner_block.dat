50|$|By 1916 Linn had {{developed}} an even smaller, more stable gasoline-powered half-track with an improved flexible traction system, independent of each other, {{with a central}} triangle-shaped rocker using two tear-dropped <b>runner</b> <b>blocks</b> suspended by axles, then surrounded by an independent roller chain to disperse the load through these rollers, patented in 1918. The feature being with constant ground following traction, and steering accomplished by front wheels (or sled in winter); full power was supplied to both tracks {{all the time and}} transmitted to the ground so there was no loss of tractive effort when turning. Lombard and most other crawlers used a rigid bed inside the tracks which would be lifted off the ground at times, and track-steer crawlers reduce power through clutch or brake action to their tracks to turn, losing additional tractive effort. With its payload carrying ability, the Linn did not require trailers or wagons to move a load, something which off-road terrain does not always permit, and no dead weight or ballast was needed for traction, as simply more payload could be added.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the Semi-Solid Processing of {{indirect}} squeeze casting, runners were needed for each part cavity. In our experiment, {{it was found}} that some of the <b>runners</b> were <b>blocked,</b> and some parts were not filling in full mold. Numerical simulation was applied to analyze this phenomenon, and the results show that it was the shell which emerged on the chamber surface that <b>blocked</b> the <b>runner.</b> Experimental results also confirmed our interpretation. Some measures have been used to correct it, such as runner design, two-layer coating, and process improvement which eliminated <b>blocking</b> of the <b>runner.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a micro-hydraulic turbine for power generation installed in sewer pipes. The runner has a circular hollow around the central (rotating) axis so that solid materials included in water can be easily flow through the <b>runner</b> without <b>blocking</b> the turbine. The laboratory experiments are also conducted. The hollow is very effective to make polyester fibers pass through the turbine. The guide vane is useful to heighten the turbine performance. But it is easily blocked by the fibers, making the turbine lose the function...|$|R
5000|$|A federal inquiry {{was held}} {{shortly after his}} {{disappearance}} and, although Walsh was named {{as a member of}} the [...] "Big Seven" [...] by testimony from a former associate, the investigation failed to solve his disappearance. Numerous rumors circulated about his disappearance, including his body being stuffed into a barrel filled with cement and dumped into the sea by a rum <b>runner</b> off <b>Block</b> Island, as well as unidentified witnesses who reported seeing several men using lime to fill a shallow grave; however, neither of these leads were investigated.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2007, {{the company}} {{released}} a print advertisement for its Intel Core 2 Duo processor featuring six African American runners appearing to bow {{down to a}} Caucasian male inside of an office setting (due to the posture taken by <b>runners</b> on starting <b>blocks).</b> According to Nancy Bhagat, Vice President of Intel Corporate Marketing, viewers found the ad to be [...] "insensitive and insulting", and several Intel executives made public apologies.|$|R
5000|$|Barber {{began to}} focus on {{strength}} training and lifting in 2004, upon the suggestion of his new running backs coach, Jerald Ingram. Tiki began to work with a strength coach, Joe Carini, in New Jersey. His added upper-body strength allowed him to break more tackles and become a more powerful runner. Barber also improved in other ways {{over the course of his}} career. He improved his patience as a <b>runner,</b> waiting for <b>blocks</b> to set and holes to emerge before accelerating forward. He also learned to deliver blows to defenders instead of being on the receiving end of them. [...] He also benefitted from an improved offensive line and Coughlin's emphasis on the running game.|$|R
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, {{a few weeks before the}} Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled The Runner, this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment the <b>runner</b> leaves the <b>blocks</b> once the starter's gun has fired.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first baseman}} is usually {{at the end}} of a double play, though he can be at the {{beginning}} and end of a double play. Unusual double plays involving the first baseman include the 3-6-3, 3-4-3, 3-2-3, or a 3-6-1 double play. In a 3-6-3 or 3-4-3 double play, the first baseman fields the ball, throws to second, where the shortstop (6) or second baseman (4) catches the ball to make the first out and then throws back to the first baseman who reaches first base in time to tag first base before the batter reaches first base. For a 3-2-3 double play, the bases must be loaded for the force-out at home plate or the catcher must tag the runner coming from third base out. With a force-out at home plate, the first baseman fields the ball, throws to the catcher, the catcher steps on home plate for the first out, then he throws it back to the first baseman to complete the double play. The 3-2-3 double play with a tag out at home plate is usually not attempted because of the possibility of the catcher not being able to tag the <b>runner</b> and/or <b>block</b> the plate. If the runner at third base is known as a good or fast baserunner, the first basemen will make considerable effort to make sure the third base runner does not advance to home plate for a run by [...] "looking" [...] him back to third base. The primary goal of the first baseman in this instance is to ensure the runner doesn't advance and that the team records at least one out, especially in a close game. A 3-6-1 double play is almost like a 3-6-3 or a 3-4-3 double play, but the first baseman is usually playing deep in the infield. Here, the first baseman throws the ball to the shortstop covering second, but the pitcher then has the responsibility of covering first base to receive the throw from the shortstop.|$|R
