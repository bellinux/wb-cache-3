50|$|This is a <b>reasonably</b> <b>well-formed</b> crater, {{although}} it has suffered some erosion. There is a small crater lying across the rim to the southwest, and a smaller crater across the northeastern rim. The rim edge is otherwise relatively circular with some slight slumping along the inner edge. The interior floor is generally level, and the site where a central peak is usually located is instead occupied by a small craterlet.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{graph-based}} summarization framework (Opinosis) that generates concise abstractive summaries of highly redundant opinions. Evaluation results on summarizing user reviews show that Opinosis summaries have better agreement with human summaries {{compared to the}} baseline extractive method. The summaries are readable, <b>reasonably</b> <b>well-formed</b> and are informative enough to convey the major opinions. ...|$|E
40|$|A fetus-in-fetu (FIF) is an {{uncommon}} developmental abnormality {{characterized by a}} <b>reasonably</b> <b>well-formed</b> but aborted fetus that {{is seen in the}} form of an encapsulated, pedunculated vertebrate tumor in the patient's abdomen. We report an interesting case of a double FIF in a 20 -year-old man, who presented with acute abdominal pain and a lump. CT scan of the abdomen revealed two ill-formed fetuses-in-fetu, which were seen as a 15 -cm complex, encapsulated mass in the lower retroperitoneum; there was also free fluid in the abdomen. The diagnosis of a ruptured twin FIF was made. Complete surgical excision of the lesion was performed and the diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically. To the best of our knowledge, the CT scan findings of a ruptured double FIF in an adult have not been previously documented...|$|E
50|$|The Gold Creek Reservoir {{track is}} {{described}} as 5.5 km long. It starts and ends at the dam and circumnavigates the reservoir. It is suitable for running, walking, and mountain biking by a capable rider but not horse riding. Taken clockwise and starting on {{the western end of}} the top of the dam, the first 1.5 km (approx) is generally a narrow winding track clinging to steep hillside with some climb. The next 1.5 km (approx) appears to be formed by repeated use of a quad bike and is generally wider and flatter. The next 1.5 km (approx) return path along {{the eastern side of the}} reservoir is narrow and fairly rugged, climbing and dropping repeatedly. The final 1 km (approx) back to the foot of the dam is <b>well-formed,</b> <b>reasonably</b> wide and gentle with formed steps on the steeper sections. The track finishes from the east by traversing the bottom of the spillway; it is difficult to make out from the foot of the dam. A 1 km side-track visiting a Hoop Pine plantation is described on the information board, which also describes various notable sights on the track. As of March 2010 lantana growth has made these tough to spot. The track is very overgrown and little used and its route can no longer be seen at the northernmost point. This makes circumnavigation of the dam very difficult.|$|R
