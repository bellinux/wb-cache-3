50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>beauty,</b> Holacanthus tricolor, is {{a species}} of marine {{angelfish}} of the family Pomacanthidae. Other common names include corn sugar, coshubba, rock beasty, and yellow nanny.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>beauty</b> feeds {{primarily}} on sponges. It may also eat tunicates, jellyfish, and corals, {{as well as}} plankton and algae. In home aquaria, keepers have had limited success with diets of meat- and algae-based fish foods. The fish requires sponges to survive.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{surrounding}} mountains include Black Mountain, Elephant Mountain, Pilot Knob, Prospect Mountain, Shelving <b>Rock,</b> Sleeping <b>Beauty</b> Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Tongue Mountain Range. Some of the lake's more famous bays are Basin Bay, Kattskill Bay, Northwest Bay, Oneida Bay, and Silver Bay.|$|R
50|$|The adult <b>rock</b> <b>beauty</b> {{is mostly}} yellow, turning blue toward the tail. The tail itself is yellow. The {{pectoral}} fins and ventral fins are yellow, and the lips and {{the edges of}} their dorsal fins and anal fins are dark blue. The adult measures up to 10 in.|$|E
50|$|The golden {{zoanthid}} often contrasts vividly in colour {{with its}} host sponge, {{which would be}} expected to advertise its presence to potential sponge predators. It contains toxic substances that may deter fish such as the <b>rock</b> <b>beauty</b> (Holacanthus tricolo) from eating the host sponge. The golden zoanthid may also benefit from living on a sponge in that the sponge is a filter feeder and actively draws in a current of water through its pores. It can only cope with the most minute particles and the polyps may be able to capture the bigger food items wafted along in the current.|$|E

Bill {{anomalies}} are generally {{thought to be}} genetic in origin and genetic changes in bill shape can occur rapidly in a population. The scythebill anomally demonstrates how quickly a drastic bill modification may occur. The crown color pattern anomaly is similar to distinctive markings found in other members of this genus [Queen Angelfish, H. ciliaris (Linnaeus) and hybrid Townsend Angelfish H. ciliaris X H. bermudensis Goode] in the tropical western Atlantic. It suggests how quickly this pattern could have origi-nated in the other species, and/or some propensity of this pattern in the genus. The distinct double-spot color pattern anomaly suggests how quickly new color patterns can originate in genus Hypoplectrus. This is important because species in this genus are distinguished almost {{solely on the basis}} of color pattern and speciation may be occurring rapidly. Anomalies should be recorded because they may give us some hints at the genetic origin of species characters and some could represent potentially inheritable characters. We suggest these potentially inheritable characters could be recognized and described when they first arise in an individual and before they become inherited by a population.

50|$|Tenaya Lake is an alpine lake in Yosemite National Park, {{located between}} Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows. The surface of Tenaya Lake has an {{elevation}} of 8150 ft. The lake basin was formed by glacial action, which left a backdrop of light granite <b>rocks,</b> whose <b>beauty</b> was known to the Native Americans. Today, Tenaya Lake is easily accessible by State Route 120 and is a popular lake for water activities.|$|R

50|$|Third is {{the bank}} reef community. Bank reefs {{are larger than}} patch reefs and are found on the outer reefs. Bank reefs consist of three zones. The reef flat is closest to the keys, and {{consists}} of coralline algae growing on fragments of coral skeletons. Further out to sea are the spur and groove formations, low ridges of coral (the spurs) separated by channels with sand bottoms (the grooves). The shallowest parts of the spurs support fire corals and zoanthids. Starting at five or six feet deep, Elkhorn, star, and brain corals {{are the most important}} members of the community. Various types of gorgonians are also common. Beyond the spur and groove zone is the forereef, which slopes down to the deeps. The upper forereef is dominated by star coral. At greater depths plate-like corals dominate, and then as the available light fades, sponges and non-reef building corals become common. Bank reefs provide habitat for various fishes, including French angelfish, Blue and Queen parrotfish, Queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), <b>Rock</b> <b>beauties</b> (Holacanthus tricolor), Goatfish (Parupeneus cyclostomus), Porkfish (Anisotremus virginicus) and snappers. The sand found around and in the Florida Reef is composed of shell, coral skeleton and limestone fragments.|$|R
40|$|Three {{anomalies}} are described: a scythebill in Greater Antillean Grackle, Quiscalus niger (Boddaert) (Passeriformes: Emberizidae), a crown {{color pattern}} in <b>Rock</b> <b>Beauty,</b> Holacanthus tricolor (Bloch) (Perciformes: Pomacanthidae), and a double-spot color pattern in Butter Hamlet, Hypoplectrus unicolor (Walbaum) (Perciformes: Pomacanthidae).

Following these potentially inheritable characters could help to explain how such characters enter into a population. This approach to the study of inherited characters could fill a void in our knowledge of evolution and speciation. Rev. Biol. Trop. 54 (Suppl. 3) : 161 - 169. Epub 2007 Jan. 15. Se describen tres anomalías: el pico de guadaña en el chinchilín, Quiscalus niger (Boddaert) (Passeriformes: Emberizidae), un patrón de color de corona en el isabelita medioluto, Holacanthus tricolor (Bloch) (Perciformes: Pomacanthidae), y un patrón de color de doble mancha en el vaca blanca, Hypoplectrus unicolor (Walbaum) (Perciformes: Pomacanthidae). Generalmente se piensa que las anomalías en el pico son de origen genético y que los cambios genéticos en la forma del pico pueden ocurrir rápidamente en una población. La anomalía del pico de guadaña demuestra cuan rápido puede ocurrir una modificación drástica del pico. La anomalía del patrón de color de corona es similar a otras marcas distintivas encontradas en otros miembros de este género [isabelita reina, H. ciliaris (Linnaeus) y el híbrido isabelita azul H. ciliaris X H. bermudensis Goode] en el Atlántico occidental tropical y también indica cambios rápidos. Esto es importante porque las especies de este género se distinguen casi solamente por patrones de color. Las anomalías deberían ser registradas ya que podrían darnos algunas pistas acerca del origen genético de las características de las especies. Proponemos que los caracteres potencialmente heredables pueden reconocerse y describirse cuando aparecen en un individuo, antes de que sean heredados a la población, llenando un vacío en nuestro conocimiento de la evolución y la especiación...|$|E

50|$|The {{land near}} Round Lake was settled in 1817 by David Collin III. It lies within one mile (1.6 km) of the Erie Canal, which was {{completed}} in 1825. It is remarkable that a forest so close to a major transportation route remained nearly untouched throughout the 19th Century. However, for the entire interval between 1817 and {{the purchase of the}} land for Green Lakes State Park, most of it was owned by Collin or by his descendants. One of these descendants, Betsy Knapp, wrote a memoir <b>Rocks,</b> Fields and <b>Beauty</b> Forever: One Family's Memories of Fayetteville's Green Lakes in 1989. Her memoir makes clear that the land was never clearcut either for lumber or for potash. In essence, the forest was preserved by the Collin family until its purchase for the park in 1928.|$|R

40|$|Petra and Beida are two {{adjacent}} {{archaeological sites}} in southern Jordan characterised by both a striking monumental heritage, and an imposing geomorphologic landscape. These sites, besides preserving important remainders of protohistorical cultures, contain {{the most important}} Nabatean vestiges of the entire Middle-East and have more recent, Roman Crusade and Islamic, significant remains as well. On account {{of the importance of}} their archaeological and monumental heritage, the two sites are included in the UNESCO’s World Heritage list and are the heart sites of a National Archaeologic Park. Less known, yet not less interesting, is the rich and striking geomorphologic heritage of the Petra-Beida area, characterised by tectonic troughs alternating with steep mountains riddled by canyons and passages to form a town of <b>rocks.</b> The intrinsic <b>beauty</b> and significance of landforms and landscapes could be the driving elements for touristic and educational aims, towards an integration of the geomorphologic heritage with the archaeological-monumental one. In this connection, both Nabatean water management systems and historical burials of monumental areas by flood events are primary links to an integrated approach, suitable for being exploited for tourism and cultural goals. Ongoing researches by means of GPS systems and laser scanning allowed us the detailed reconstruction of both parts of the Nabatean water systems and historical alluvial fills. The digital elaboration and modellisation, as well as computer simulations and reconstructions, besides their intrinsic scientific meaning, can be powerful tools for tourism improvement and educational work...|$|R
40|$|Owen Fiss {{focused on}} “the {{robustness}} of public debate” to conclude {{on his last}} page: “The autonomy protected by the First Amendment and rightly enjoyed by individuals and the press is not an end in itself, {{as it might be}} in some moral code, but is rather a means to further the democratic values underlying the Bill of Rights. ” This article embraces the same values but more conservatively. Whereas Fiss defended state-sponsored coercion, I leave the government mostly outside the descriptions and arguments presented here. Scholars have sought to apply the law—of crimes, torts, intellectual property, and statutory allotments and immunities—as remedies for online abuse and harassment. A few states have modified their penal codes in this direction. I applaud many of these innovations but do not rely on them. They can be rejected for purposes of the thesis that I sketch in these pages. Like writings that come before it, this article challenges the chestnut that freedom comes at the expense of another progressive good. Equality, to some writers; antisubordination, to others; “civil rights” also serves. In contending that free speech advances and supports these progressive goals, I step into big footprints—not just those of Owen Fiss but before him, inter alia, Harry Kalven, who argued when the sixties revolution was young that white speakers ought to thank “the Negro” and his civil rights struggle for enlargement of their First Amendment rights delivered to them by the Supreme Court. But my connection to free speech is more literal than what these great precedent-writings teach. Abuse and harassment pull valuable words out of the marketplace of ideas, I argue. They lessen the discourse. Also following in the path of other writings, this article notes a few higher stakes present in online speech as contrasted with its lower-tech antecedents. Electronic discourse adds anonymity, amplification, and permanence; within this medium, these conditions reinforce each other. Think of a rock thick and opaque enough to hide behind, durable enough to intimidate, heavy enough to inflict a real blow. Don’t stop there. Think also of a <b>rock’s</b> majesty and <b>beauty.</b> Opacity, durability, and weight are strengths as well as dangers. In this article, I advocate measures against abuse and harassment because (not “even though”) I cherish free speech...|$|R
