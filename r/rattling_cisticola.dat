50|$|The <b>rattling</b> <b>cisticola</b> (Cisticola chiniana) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cisticolidae which is native to Africa south of the equator, and parts of East Africa. It is a common to {{abundant}} species in open savanna and scrubland habitats, whether in arid, moist or upland regions. Especially during summer, it is highly conspicuous due to its strident and repetitive call-notes from prominent perches.|$|E

Some birders in Australia use a variant of pishing called [...] "squeaking" [...] (making a kissing sound through pursed lips or against the back of one's hand) to which white-eared honeyeaters, several species of whistlers and grey fantails show an initial response and in turn attract other species.|$|E
