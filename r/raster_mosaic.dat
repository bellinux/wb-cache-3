40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodology {{and the results}} of a comprehensive automatic image classification task aiming to map the European settlements using 2. 5 m-resolution input data. The processing approach is consistent with the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) [1]; certain adjustments were driven by the specific input data characteristics and the specific application needs. In the study discussed here, a total of 2, 275 SPOT- 5 3 -band pan-sharpened images were processed. The main output is a seamless 10 m-resolution <b>raster</b> <b>mosaic.</b> Each pixel value expresses the proportion of the pixel area covered by buildings. Complementary information about the open spaces between buildings and the proportion of vegetation is also produced at the same spatial resolution. JRC.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the vectorial Kappa (κv) {{that one can}} utilize to assess congruence between two vectorial mosaics. The vectorial Kappa extends for vectorial mosaics {{the approach of the}} so-called Cohen's Kappa index, commonly used to compare <b>raster</b> <b>mosaics.</b> By comparing both approaches, we aim to demonstrate how efficient and convenient a vector-based congruence may be when working on vectorial mosaics.

40|$|The {{efficient}} management of very large spatial raster objects {{is becoming an}} important new feature of Geo-Information Systems. This paper investigates and summarises the main requirements that must be fulfilled by a spatial raster management solution. The investigations primarily focus on the management of very large <b>raster</b> <b>mosaics,</b> as a typical example for future requirements, {{both in terms of}} data volume and functionality. The aspects investigated include spatial objects access, spatial partitioning and partition indexing, multi-resolution, georeferencing and storage management. The paper then presents two system architectures which approach the problem at different levels of abstraction. The first architecture, GrIdS, is a DBMS application which investigates spatial raster management concepts and techniques available at a middleware layer. The paper discusses some of the key features of the GrIdS project, including a tile-based multi-resolution concept for very large <b>raster</b> <b>mosaics.</b> The section on GrIdS is concluded by the presentation of results which demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of this approach. CONCERT, the second architecture presented, enables the investigation of extensible database concepts and techniques supporting the {{efficient management}} of large objects, in particular spatial raster objects...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{raster data}} management on very large <b>raster</b> or <b>raster</b> <b>mosaics</b> {{is becoming more}} and more important in spatial data sharing in a distributed GIS environment. The success of such large raster data repository or data warehouse will often demand much greater system scalability and more advanced query ability than the traditional file-based approach. In this paper, we’ll present a DBMS-independent spatial raster management solution that combines the spatial data management with the conventional corporate data in a common relational database. In particular, we’ll take ESRI’s ArcSDE[1] product as an example, following its design to implementation to give a complete view on how this can be accomplished. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{focus of}} the chapter is related to review {{techniques}} for the automatic generation of good quality digital <b>mosaics</b> from <b>raster</b> images. <b>Mosaics,</b> in the digital realm, are illustrations composed {{by a set of}} small images called ”tiles”. The tiles tessellate an input image with the aim of reproducing the original visual information rendered into a mosaic-like style. This chapter will review the major different approaches for digital mosaic generation reporting a short description and a discussion about the most relevant and recent issues. Particular emphasis will be devoted to techniques able to generate artificial mosaics that emulates in some way ancient mosaics both in terms of tile positioning and tile cutting procedures. Visual comparisons among different approaches together with suggestions for future work will be also provided. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} extend {{database}} technology beyond traditional applications {{a new paradigm}} called "externalization of database functionality" has been proposed in research and development. Externalization of database functionality is {{a radical departure from}} traditional thinking. Traditionally, all data is loaded into and owned by the database, whereas in the new paradigm data may reside outside the database in external repositories or archives. Nevertheless, database functionality such as query processing, optimization, physical database design, indexing and more general replication support is provided. In this paper we explore the applicability of our CONCERT approach when raster image data from photogrammetry and cartography are used. We report on investigations of a joint project where engineering applications such as 3 D building reconstruction and <b>raster</b> image <b>mosaics</b> are supported by database functionality. We specifically mention advantages with respect to tertiary storage integration and database memory mapping thus directly supporting application specific algorithms...|$|R
30|$|To {{define the}} plane {{over which the}} mosaic is to be captured, the user focuses the camera view on the four {{exterior}} corners of the sample by moving the stage with the joystick. Using Matlab, for each corner we query the Prior stage for its position. We fit a plane to these four points using the Matlab function lsplane then we compute the grid of points (x,y,z) over which the stage moves. The spacing of points in the grid depends on the fixed field-of-view of each image and the predefined image overlap (40 % overlap in both dimensions is a good compromise between speed and ensuring each image has overlapping features). We <b>raster</b> scan the <b>mosaic</b> points to avoid large movements of the stage.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to {{generate}} a digital mosaic starting from a <b>raster</b> input image. <b>Mosaics</b> generation of artistic quality is challenging. The basic elements, the tiles, typically small polygons, must be packed tightly, emphasizing orientations chosen by the artist. An adhoc boundaries detection {{have to be performed}} according to the directional guidelines. Different mosaic styles can be automatically rendered, depending on artistic techniques considered (“opus musivum”, “opus vermiculatum”, etc.). The proposed method is able to reproduce the colors of the original image emphasizing relevant boundaries by placing tiles along their direction. The boundaries detection is based on the statistical region merging algorithm. In particular the technique is able to reproduce the “opus vermiculatum ” mosaic style. Several examples reported in the paper show how the right mixture of mathematical tools together with century proved ideas from mosaicists may lead to impressive results...|$|R
40|$|As {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} advances, imagery {{becomes one of}} the most important data sources for GIS applications –as it can quickly provide the most current and most detailed information with high resolution image data. Traditional image processing workflow becomes inefficient in GIS applications especially in the case of disaster analysis. This paper introduces two ArcGIS data models that are designed for on-demand image processing in managing imagery: <b>raster</b> product and <b>mosaic</b> dataset. A <b>raster</b> product allows you to access single scene remote sensing image products dynamically such as a pan-sharpened and orthorectified GeoEye image or multi-spectral Landsat scene with a single drag and drop to the map display. Mosaic datasets allow you to catalog a large collection of images from many sensor platforms, process them on-the-fly and dynamically mosaic the images together. The key concept – the raster function that is used to implement on-the-fly image processing capabilities – will also be discussed...|$|R
