40|$|The patch-clamp {{method has}} been used to {{determine}} the actions of three newly synthesized cardiac drugs on a calcium-depend-ent potassium channel, K(Ca), in CAl hippocampal neurons. Activation of a 65 -pS channel was evident in excised inside-out patches with the internal side of the membrane exposed to Ca 2 (0. 2 mM); cessation of channel activity was immediate upon perfusion with ethylene glycol bis($-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid-containing solution. In the presence of low con-centrations (0. 1 - 10 M) of the drugs UK- 68798, KC- 8857 (tedi-samil), or WY- 48986 (<b>risotilide),</b> channel openings evinced rapid flickering behavior from open to nonconducting levels; current amplitude was not affected by the drugs. The actions of the drugs were consistent with a voltage-independent block of open K(Ca) channels. In addition, the three drugs, at concentrations similar to those applied to inside-out patches, also blocked K(Ca...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of an Ikblocker, <b>risotilide</b> (R) on the dynamic {{properties}} of perfused rabbit AV nodes using intermittent right atrial premature pacing and bipolar surface electrograms. R was serially perfused with 1, 3 and 6 × 10 – 6 M R for 15 minutes following pre-drug measurements. ResultsTypical changes in the antegrade recovery curve produced by R are shown in the figure. There was a concentration dependent decrease in Δ. AH from the pre-drug value of 56 ± 15 ms to 29. 2 ± 16. 9 ms and 13. 7 ± 5. 9 ms by 3 and 6 × 10 - 6 M respectively (n = 6). A reciprocal increase in the AV node effective refractory period was observed from 91 ± 15 ms (pre-drug) to 139 ± 16 ms (3 × 10 - 6 M) and 170 ± 16 ms (6 × 10 - 6 M). AH∝ was unchanged at any concentration of R. ConclusionsThese results suggest that class III antiarrhythmic agents may increase action potential duration and the refractory period of the structure(s) limiting AV conduction and thereby eliminate {{a majority of the}} “slow” AV node conduction. These findings may have important implications for a pharmacologic approach to the treatment of AV node reentry tachycardias...|$|E
