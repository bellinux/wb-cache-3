An independent review of MSHA’s role in Crandall Canyon by retired MSHA managers Earnest Teaster and Joseph Pavlovich, found that the agency failed to properly consider bounce activity in the mine prior to approving the mining plan, failed to properly evaluate the roof control plan and failed to follow established mine rescue protocols at all times at Crandall Canyon Mine. Specifically, the authors wrote that, “MSHA’s failure to adequately evaluate the roof control plans contributed to the August 6 accident.” An independent review of MSHA’s actions at Crandall Canyon also faults the agency for failing to control access to the mine, concluding that “MSHA improperly allowed media representatives and family members to enter the <b>rescue</b> <b>area,</b> and allowed an unlimited number of persons underground during the rescue operation.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of international aviation, air disaster often happens. When the plane crashed {{in the vast}} ocean, how to locate the wreckage and fast and effective rescue is worth studying. This paper focuses on locating the crashed plane, determining the <b>rescue</b> <b>area</b> and the search strategies. To locate the crashed plane, the mechanics principle of the crashed plane is analyzed and the dynamic differential equation which can be solved by applying the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm was built. Substituting the related parameters into the numerical solution, We can get the final trajectory and the velocity of the crashed plane. Thus, the crash site can be roughly determined. To determine of rescue, according to the ocean currents of the crash site and the suspicious area, the drifting trajectory of the main plane wreckage to set up <b>rescue</b> <b>area</b> can be roughly confirmed. For the search strategies, the Bayesian probability is applied in the search area. Firstly, the search area {{can be divided into}} several small areas which can be represented by appropriate search probabilities in term of the distances between among of drifting trajectories and other subjective information. The closer distance, the greater the priority search probability. Then the search work can be started a prior in the small area with the highest probability. If the crashed plane cannot be found, the priority search probability of every small areas should be updated and repeat the previous work {{until the end of the}} search...|$|E

Authors {{agree that this}} article remains {{permanently}} open access {{under the terms of}} the Creative Commons Attribution License 4. 0 International License Abstract We propose a unified framework to study the walk problem in a polygonal area by two collabo-rative guards. A walk is conducted by the two mobile guards on the area’s boundary. They start at an initial boundary point, move along the boundary, and may possibly meet together again at an ending boundary point. It is required that the two guards maintain their mutual visibility at all times. Depending the geometric properties of the polygonal area, a walk may or may not be possible. In this work, three versions of the problem, namely, general polygon walk, room walk and street walk, are characterized in a unified manner in our framework. One additional merit of our framework is its simplicity. Applications of the walk problem by two guards include military <b>rescue,</b> <b>area</b> exploration, art gallery surveillance, etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to create an}} indoor rescue {{scenario}} with multiple self-localizing robots that are able to collaborate for a victim search. Victims are represented by RFID tags and detecting them combined with an accurate enough location data is considered as a successful finding. This setup is created for use in a laboratory assignment at Linköping University. We consider the indoor localization problem by trying to use as few sensors as possible and implement three indoor localization methods - odometry based, passive RFID based, and our approach by fusing both sensor data with particle filter. The Results show that particle filter based localization performs the best in comparison to the two other implemented methods and satisfies the accuracy requirements stated for the scenario. The victim search problem is solved by an ant mobility (pheromone-based) approach which integrates our localization method and provides a collaborative navigation through the <b>rescue</b> <b>area.</b> The purpose of the pheromone mobility approach is to achieve a high coverage with an acceptable resource consumption.

40|$|In recent times, {{the growing}} number of people enjoying nature-based tourism and {{recreation}} activities has led to an increase in search and rescue (SAR) missions in mountainous areas. During SAR responses time is of essence, and the speed of SAR ground responses is affected largely by the mode of transportation and the road and trail network. This study presents a detailed analysis of vehicle and walking speeds of SAR ground crews along a secondary transportation network and on off-trail areas, culminating in mode-specific regression models. Thereafter, these models are integrated into GIS to generate maps of the total accumulative travel time of a <b>rescue</b> <b>area.</b> This GIS model is then evaluated by calculating likely rescue times when using small All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) as an alternative to 4 WD cars. The results show that vehicle speeds strongly depend {{on the quality of the}} secondary transportation network in terms of roughness and gradient. The spatial analysis in the GIS model reveals that the alternative use of small ATV can reduce the total cumulative travel time of SAR crews significantly, especially in areas where the quality of the secondary transportation network is poor. Management implications With the ever increasing popularity of mountain-based outdoor activities, search and rescue (SAR) missions in challenging terrain are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, a rigorous analysis of the effectiveness of modes of transport as a function of terrain characteristics is an important contribution to SAR operations. The study finds that: A GIS based rescue concept is recommended as a precautionary measure in all mountainous areas; it should include trail characteristics to document the accessibility of the management area. An ATV is most likely the best means of ground transportation, especially when searching for missing recreationists and for providing first aid. In areas with frequent accidents it might worthwhile to consider improving trail conditions for ATV acces...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION : Hiking in basque {{mountains}} {{has grown}} rapidly. It {{participates in the}} transformation of socio-economic activities and recreation of the past 30 years. This is a low-supervised activity (only 2 % is member of a federation). There is few studies about this. They mainly concern high mountains. The aim {{of the study is}} to demonstrate the specificity of the basque medium altitude mountain accidents in order to adapt prevention. METHOD : Descriptive study of summer time hiking accidents occured in the <b>rescue</b> <b>area</b> and based on the data of Bayonne's SAMU/EMS. A phone survey complete the study to assess the experience and equipment of injured or ill hikers. RESULTS / DISCUSSION : 140 casualties : 82 % of all accidents in basque mountain. The hiking is the main issue of prevention in the medium elevated mountains. Specificity : older population (> 50 years = 64 %), majority of women, significant part of medical accidents (34 %), medical illness has highest severity than trauma injuries (18 % vs 8 %), role of local fire brigades (44 % of rescue operations). Difficulties of regulation and underestimation of the severity of medical illness. The study of the experience and equipment enables to follow the effects of prevention. It shows here the failure of the main accident prevention french campaign : 55 % is under-equipped, 60 % has no respect for safety instructions. The importance of medical illnesses and the experience assessment reflects the features of the visitors : relatively inactive urban population, unfamiliar with the wilderness. CONCLUSION : A better understanding of the accident in basque medium altitude mountains should allow care providers to improve their emergency management. Prevention must be part of the development projects of the basque mountains : Sustainable Development Charter of the Basque Mountain.
