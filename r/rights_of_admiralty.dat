6000|$|A {{plentiful}} entertainment, at the Duke of Argyle's cost, regaled {{the reverend}} gentlemen who had assisted at {{the ordination of}} Reuben Butler, and almost all the respectable part of the parish. The feast was, indeed, such as the country itself furnished; for plenty of all the requisites for [...] "a rough and round dinner" [...] were always at Duncan of Knock's command. There was the beef and mutton on the braes, the fresh and salt-water fish in the lochs, the brooks, and firth; game of every kind, from the deer to the leveret, were to be had for the killing, in the Duke's forests, moors, heaths, and mosses; and for liquor, home-brewed ale flowed as freely as water; brandy and usquebaugh both were had in those happy times without duty; even white wine and claret were got for nothing, since the Duke's extensive <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>admiralty</b> gave him a title to all the wine in cask which is drifted ashore on the western coast and isles of Scotland, when shipping have suffered by severe weather. In short, as Duncan boasted, the entertainment did not cost MacCallummore a plack out of his sporran, and was nevertheless not only liberal, but overflowing.|$|E

This office is normally held by a High Court Judge who holds the appointment <b>of</b> <b>Admiralty</b> Judge. The jurisdiction of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Admiralty</b> <b>of</b> the Cinque Ports extends from Shore Beacon, Essex, to Redcliffe, near Seaford, Sussex. It covers all the sea from Seaford to a point five miles off Cape Grisnez {{on the coast of}} France, and the coast of Essex (and Birchington, near Margate, Kent). The last full sitting was in 1914. According to general civilian practice, the registrar can act as deputy to the judge, and the only active role of the judge now is {{to take part in the}} installation of a new Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Appeal from the court's decisions lies to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.|$|R
