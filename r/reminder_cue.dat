40|$|Inappropriate {{speed is}} a causal factor in around {{one third of}} fatal {{accidents}} (OECD/ECMT, 2006). But are drivers always consciously responsible for their speeding behavior? Two studies are reported which show that an interruption to a journey, caused by stopping at a red traffic light, can result in failure to resume the speed of travel prior to the interruption (Study 1). In Study 2 we showed that {{the addition of a}} <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> could offset this interruption. These studies were conducted in a number of Australian school zone sites subject to a 40 km/h speed limit, requiring a reduction of between 20 km/h and 40 km/h. Motorists who had stopped at a red traffic signal sped on average, 8. 27 km/h over the speed limit compared with only 1. 76 km/h over the limit for those who had not been required to stop. In the second study a flashing "check speed" <b>reminder</b> <b>cue,</b> placed 70 m after the traffic lights, in the same school zones as those in Study 1 eliminated the interruptive effect of stopping with drivers resuming their journey at the legal speed. These findings have practical implications for the design of road environments, enforcement of speed limits, and the safety of pedestrians. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Associative {{learning}} {{refers to}} {{our ability to}} learn about regularities in our environment. When a stimulus is repeatedly followed by a specific outcome, we learn to expect the outcome {{in the presence of}} the stimulus. We are also able to modify established expectations in the face of disconfirming information (the stimulus is no longer followed by the outcome). Both the change of environmental regularities and the related processes of adaptation are referred to as extinction. However, extinction does not erase the initially acquired expectations. For instance, following successful extinction, the initially learned expectations can recover when there is a context change – a phenomenon called the renewal effect, which is considered as a model for relapse after exposure therapy. Renewal was found to be modulated by reminder cues of acquisition and extinction. However, the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of reminder cues are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of reminder cues on renewal in the field of human predictive learning. Experiment I demonstrated that renewal in human predictive learning is modulated by cues related to acquisition or extinction. Initially, participants received pairings of a stimulus and an outcome in one context. These stimulus-outcome pairings were preceded by presentations of a <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> (acquisition cue). Then, participants received extinction in a different context in which presentations of the stimulus were no longer followed by the outcome. These extinction trials were preceded by a second <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> (extinction cue). During a final phase conducted in a third context, participants showed stronger expectations of the outcome {{in the presence of the}} stimulus when testing was accompanied by the acquisition cue compared to the extinction cue. Experiment II tested an explanation of the <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> effect in terms of simple cue-outcome associations. Therefore, acquisition and extinction cues were equated for their associative histories in Experiment II, which should abolish their impact on renewal if based on simple cue-outcome associations. In contrast to this prediction, Experiment II replicated the findings from Experiment I indicating that the effectivenes of reminder cues did not require direct reminder cue-outcome associations...|$|E

Although a lot of social marketing programs use stickers and mirror clings as <b>reminder</b> <b>cues,</b> {{there is very little}} research that tests their effectiveness over the long term. This study consisted of a 6 -week program where parents were sent a mirror cling of Roger the Red Robot, and asked to place it on their bathroom mirror where their child brushes their teeth. Through responsive text messages periodically over a 6 -week period, parents were asked to report the number of times they brushed their child’s teeth, and whether they or their child suggested the tooth brushing. They also responded to a follow up question three months later asking whether their mirror cling was still up, and how often they were currently brushing their child’s teeth. Although results indicate that parents liked the mirror cling, {{there is no evidence that}} it increased the frequency of tooth brushing for the duration of the study. When it came to the perception of the mirror cling, however, parents reported that they felt the mirror cling helped to remind both themselves and their child to brush twice a day. [URL]...|$|R

In this study, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), non-amnestic cognitive impairment (naMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) elders were assessed using the Miami Prospective Memory Test (MPMT). A unique aspect of the paradigm was that participants were scored for intention to perform, accuracy in recollection for specific elements of the task, {{and the need for}} <b>reminder</b> <b>cues.</b> Excellent test-retest stability was obtained for MPMT Event-Related (ER), combined Time-Related (TR) subscales, and total MPMT score for aMCI subjects. MPMT impairments were observed in 48. 6 % of aMCI, 29. 4 % of naMCI, and 10. 0 % of normal elderly participants. Prospective memory deficits were common in participants with aMCI, and occurred in almost a third of naMCI participants. Intention to perform and need for <b>reminder</b> <b>cues</b> were significantly more impaired than retrospective memory for specific details of the task. It is concluded that assessment of different elements of prospective memory is important in MCI research and that inability to remember intended actions is a significant feature in those as risk for Alzheimer’s disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} {{of fear and}} stress leaves an indelible trace on the brain. This indelible trace is observed as both changes in behavior and changes in neuronal structure and function. Fear and stress interact on many levels. The {{experience of}} stress {{may lead to the}} formation of a fearful memory trace of a place or <b>reminder</b> <b>cue,</b> and fearful memory formation is regulated by the extent of concurrent stress. The concurrent experience of fear and stress may amplify fear and slow fear extinction which may lead to pathology. Fear memory formation involves changes in synaptic plasticity while stress and glucocorticoids change neuronal structure. Thus, both neurons and synapses are changed. These changes can be identified, visualised and mapped within focused microcircuits. In this Research Topic we focus on current advances in both the neurobiology and behavioral consequences of fear and stress...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{concerns the}} paired {{presentation of a}} conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US, biologically significant event that elicits a certain behaviour). Because of the paired presentation of the CS and the US, an association between the CS and the US is formed that results in conditioned behaviour to the CS. A subsequent extinction procedure wherein the CS {{is presented in the}} absence of the US will gradually lead to the disappearance of the conditioned behaviour. However, research has shown that a context change after extinction can cause a return of conditioned behaviour. This post extinction phenomenon is referred to as renewal. Together with several other post extinction phenomena such as spontaneous recovery, reinstatement and rapid reacquisition, renewal demonstrates that extinction does not entail the unlearning of the CS-US association. Instead, extinction is now described as the learning of a new, inhibitory association between the CS and the US (CSnoUS). Extinction is viewed as an essential element in most treatments of anxiety and specific phobias. In an exposure treatment for specific phobias, the object of fear is presented repeatedly to the patient until the fear disappears. Clinical studies have demonstrated that, when patients leave the treatment context, fear often returns. These observations demonstrate that the renewal effect may be an important model for the return of fear after exposure treatment. The renewal effect has mainly been demonstrated in animal conditioning studies. More recently, the renewal effect has also been demonstrated in experimental research with humans. From the field of animal conditioning, several mechanisms have been proposed for the role of context in the learning of the inhibitory association during extinction. Research has provided evidence against the view that the context enters into a direct association with the US. Instead, evidence has been gathered suggesting that the context modulates the CS-noUS association. To date, research that addresses the mechanisms underlying extinction and renewal in humans is scarce. The research that is described in the present dissertation aimed at addressing this need. In the first part of the dissertation, a fear conditioning preparation was used to investigate whether the different forms of renewal that have been observed in animals can also be observed in humans. In addition, because findings from the animal laboratory have suggested that a change in the temporal context can also elicit renewal, the effect of a change in a temporal context after extinction was also investigated. More specifically, the effect of a retention interval (spontaneous recovery) and of a change in intertrial interval after extinction was investigated. In a second part of the dissertation, a predictive learning task was used to investigate two possible methods to reduce renewal: (1) by presenting an extinction <b>reminder</b> <b>cue,</b> and (2) by conducting extinction in multiple contexts. Within this second part of the dissertation, the mechanism underlying the effect of such a <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> was also directly tested because our results differed from the findings that have been obtained with animals. The present findings show that multiple processes may underlie the role of context in renewal. In the present studies, it was shown that the efficiency of methods to reduce renewal is dependent on the degree to which the acquisition and extinction context enter into a direct association with the US, or on the degree to which the <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> enters into a direct association with the US. status: publishe...|$|E

Here we test a behavioural intervention after real-life trauma {{derived from}} cognitive neuroscience. We hypothesised that intrusive memories would be significantly reduced in frequency by an intervention involving a computer game with high visuospatial demands (Tetris), via disrupting consolidation of sensory elements of trauma memory. The Tetris-based intervention (trauma memory <b>reminder</b> <b>cue</b> plus c. 20 minute game play) versus attention-placebo control (written activity log - standardised task for same duration) were both delivered in an Emergency Department within 6 {{hours of a}} motor-vehicle accident, in a randomized controlled trial assessing intrusive memory frequency in the subsequent week. Results vindicated {{the efficacy of the}} Tetris-based intervention compared to the control condition: there were fewer intrusive memories overall (primary outcome), and time-series analyses showed intrusion incidence declined more quickly. There were convergent findings on a measure of clinical post-trauma intrusion symptoms at one week, but not on other symptom clusters or at 1 month. Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that a larger trial, powered to detect differences at one month, is warranted. Participants found the intervention easy, helpful and minimally distressing. By translating emerging neuroscientific insights and experimental research into the real world, we offer a promising new low-intensity psychiatric intervention that could prevent debilitating intrusive memories following trauma...|$|E
40|$|We are {{currently}} experiencing the greatest refugee crisis since World War II (United Nations High Commission for Refugees, 2016). It {{is important to}} understand how war-related trauma impacts psychological and physiological health. The purpose of our review was to synthesize existing research that examines physiological indicators of stress (particularly cortisol) and the mental health consequences of war-related trauma. Cortisol is a physiological by-product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA-axis) and has been widely used to measure stress reactions. The psychological variables of interest were Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), responses to <b>reminder</b> <b>cues,</b> coping strategies, and different types of trauma (e. g., concentration camps; war; rape) across development. All articles included in the review were found using the PsycINFO database. Articles were included if it was a published, peer-reviewed empirical article that included cortisol measurements (saliva or blood) in relation to psychological variables among war-related trauma participants (including refugees, but excluding veterans). Overall, results demonstrated decreases in cortisol levels in response to <b>reminder</b> <b>cues</b> and among participants with PTSD. Negative coping strategies were also associated with lower cortisol levels.

40|$|Background: Excessive {{alcohol use}} is a {{prevalent}} and worldwide problem. Excessive drinking causes a significant burden of disease and is associated with both morbidity and excess mortality. Prototype alteration and provision of a <b>cue</b> <b>reminder</b> could be useful strategies to enhance the effectiveness of online tailored interventions for excessive drinking. Objective: Through a Web-based randomized controlled trial, 2 strategies (ie, prototype alteration and <b>cue</b> <b>reminders)</b> within an existing online personalized feedback intervention (Drinktest) aimed to reduce adults' excessive drinking. It was expected that both strategies would add to Drinktest and would result in reductions in alcohol consumption by intrinsic motivation and the seizure of opportunities to act. Methods: Participants were recruited online and through printed materials. Excessive drinking adults (N= 2634) {{were randomly assigned to}} 4 conditions: original Drinktest, Drinktest plus prototype alteration, Drinktest plus <b>cue</b> <b>reminder,</b> and Drinktest plus prototype alteration and <b>cue</b> <b>reminder.</b> Evaluation took place at 1 -month posttest and 6 -month follow-up. Differences in drinking behavior, intentions, and behavioral willingness (ie, primary outcomes) were assessed by means of longitudinal multilevel analyses using a last observation carried forward method. Measures were based on self-reports. Results: All conditions showed reductions in drinking behavior and willingness to drink, and increased intentions to reduce drinking. Prototype alteration (B=- 0. 15, P<. 05) and <b>cue</b> <b>reminder</b> usage (B=- 0. 15, P<. 05) were both more effective in reducing alcohol consumption than when these strategies were not provided. Combining the strategies did not produce a synergistic effect. No differences across conditions were found regarding intentions or willingness. Conclusions: Although individuals' awareness of their cue was reasonable, their reported alcohol consumption was nevertheless reduced. Individuals appeared to distance their self-image from heavier drinking prototypes. Thus, prototype alteration and <b>cue</b> <b>reminder</b> usage may be feasible and simple intervention strategies to promote reductions in alcohol consumption among adults, with an effect up to 6 months.

Infants typically show highly specific remembering following a reminder, or reactivation procedure, {{but in some}} instances, (such as size perception) have demonstrated an ability to remember when given a cue or prime that differs in certain specific characteristics, relative to the training experience. The capacity of infants to use a novel view of an object as a prime to retrieve a training view was tested in this investigation, using simple (single part) 3 D objects, and an operant training procedure. Infants trained with a simple object, shown in a limited range of views, demonstrated remembering of this event following a delay sufficient to produce forgetting in a control group. Remembering was demonstrated both when the primed view of the object was from within the limited training range and when the primed view was substantially novel (that is, outside the training range). This finding holds implications for the capacity of young infants to establish an abstract representation of 3 D shape. spac...|$|R
40|$|Ample {{evidence}} suggests that consolidated memories, upon their retrieval, enter a labile state, in which they might be susceptible to change. It has been proposed that memory labilization allows for the integration of relevant information in the established memory trace (memory updating). Memory labilization and reconsolidation do not necessarily occur when a memory is being reactivated, but only when {{there is something to}} be learned during memory retrieval (prediction error). Thus, updating of a fear memory trace should not occur under retrieval conditions in which the outcome is fully predictable (no prediction error). Here, we addressed this issue, using a human differential fear conditioning procedure, by eliminating the very possibility of reinforcement of the <b>reminder</b> <b>cue.</b> A previously established fear memory (picture-shock pairings) was reactivated with shock-electrodes attached (Propranolol group, n = 18) or unattached (Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group, n = 19). We additionally tested a placebo-control group with the shock-electrodes attached (Placebo group, n = 18). Reconsolidation was not triggered when nothing could be learned during the reminder trial, as noradrenergic blockade did not affect expression of the fear memory 24 h later in the Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group. Only when the outcome of the retrieval cue was not fully predictable, propranolol, contrary to placebo, reduced the startle fear response and prevented the return of fear (reinstatement) the following day. In line with previous studies, skin conductance response and shock expectancies were not affected by propranolol. Remarkably, a double dissociation emerged between the emotional (startle response) and more cognitive expression (expectancies, SCR) of the fear memory. Our findings have important implications for reconsolidation blockade as treatment strategy for emotional disorders. First, fear reducing procedures that target the emotional component of fear memory do not necessarily affect the cognitive component and vice versa. Second, mere retrieval of the fear memory is not sufficient to induce its labilization and reconsolidation...|$|E
40|$|Few {{previous}} studies have explored in detail how children respond affectively and cognitively to feedback in the normal interactions of the primary school classroom and how they relate feedback to their sense of autonomy. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of nine ‘profile’ children aged 9 to 10 years in a UK school. They were observed and video-filmed in threes, twos or individually during literacy and numeracy lessons across two terms from January to July 2010. The video-recordings were shown later the same day to the {{children who had been}} filmed, being stopped at frequent intervals to allow the participants to comment on specific feedback incidents. The children claimed that learning was frustrated by overly directive feedback and that their learning benefited when the teacher’s feedback included substantial but not burdensome detail. The children felt their learning was supported by feedback <b>reminder</b> <b>cues</b> and they noticed that negative and positive feedback provoked emotions which could interfere with or support learning. The article concludes by suggesting that Assessment for Learning might be conceptualised as a classroom conversation in which children as well as teachers assess how teacher feedback relates to children’s learning, which would itself constitute a major contribution to their autonomous learning...|$|R
40|$|Nonreinforced {{retrieval}} {{can cause}} extinction and/or reconsolidation, two processes that affect subsequent retrieval in opposite ways. Using the Morris water maze task we show that, in the rat, repeated nonreinforced expression of spatial memory causes extinction, which is unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis within the CA 1 {{region of the}} dorsal hippocampus. However, {{if the number of}} nonreinforced retrieval trials is insufficient to induce long-lasting extinction, then a hippocampal protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process recovers the original memory. Inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis after reversal learning sessions impairs retention of the reversed preference and blocks persistence of the original one, suggesting that reversal learning involves reconsolidation rather than extinction of the original memory. Our results suggest the existence of a hippocampal protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process that operates to recover or update retrieval-weakened memories from incomplete extinction. Consolidation is the protein synthesis-dependent process that stabilizes new memories and makes them resistant to pharmaco-logical and traumatic disruption (McGaugh 1966). Since the ob-servation that trained animals re-exposed to <b>reminder</b> <b>cues</b> along with hypothermia or electroconvulsive shock show diminished retrieval (Misanin et al. 1968; Lewis et al. 1972), several au-thors have suggested {{that at the time of}} retrieval consolidated memories become vulnerable again (Przybyslawski and Sara 1997; Przybyslawski et al. 1999). It was proposed that in order to endure after retrieval, memories must undergo a further round of protein synthesis-dependent stabilization called reconsolidatio...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the study}} was to pilot test two {{interventions}} designed to reduce children's susceptibility to peers' candy intake and to determine if interventions had different effects on boys and girls. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In the standard intervention, peer modeling was explained while communicating the importance of not following other's food intake by means of photos, video clips and interactive tasks. A second animated intervention was similar but added a monkey puppet as a (<b>cue)</b> <b>reminder.</b> A social modeling component was conducted 1 day after the intervention to test whether the interventions affected the extent to which children model their peers' eating. During the modeling session, the participants' (N = 141; 78 % boys, mean age = 7. 84 +/- 0. 72 years) solved a puzzle with a same-sex 'confederate' who was instructed to eat chocolate candy when he/she was covertly signaled. The monkey puppet was put in sight to test whether the monkey served as a <b>cue</b> <b>reminder</b> in the animated intervention. Candy intake was compared across control and intervention conditions. RESULTS: The standard intervention reduced candy intake in boys but not girls. Nevertheless, children still remained susceptible to a peer's eating. There was no significant effect of the animated intervention on consumption.

40|$|Children {{notoriously}} {{struggle to}} inhibit incorrect, prepotent responses, but often improve if a delay is introduced {{before they can}} respond. Children may use delays to actively compute correct answers (Diamond et al., 2002). Alternatively, delays may improve child performance by allowing prepotent responses to passively dissipate (Simpson et al., 2012). A third, untested account posits that improvements previously attributed to delays may instead reflect the influence of additional instructions and reminders in delay conditions. The present study tests predictions arising from each account via a go/no-go box search task. Three-year-olds opened boxes to find stickers or left them shut, based on go and no-go cues. Each child completed one of four conditions crossing cue highlighting (hidden placement of the cue vs. visible placement of the cue and additional <b>cue</b> <b>reminders)</b> with delay period (responses allowed immediately versus responses allowed only after a delay).

However not all cues are equally effective in initiating the process, unpredictable cues triggered it, predictable cues do not. We hypothesize that the different effects observed by the different reminder types on memory labilization-reconsolidation depend on a differential neural involvement during reminder presentation. To test it, we developed a declarative task and compared the efficacy of three reminder types in triggering the process in humans (Experiment 1). Finally, we compared the brain activation patterns between the different conditions using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) (Experiment 2). We confirmed that the unpredictable reminder is the most effective in initiating the labilization-reconsolidation process. Furthermore, only under this condition there was differential left hippocampal activation during its presentation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the factors that influence adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens in culturally diverse populations with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) related to age, ethnicity, and intravenous drug use. The critical incident technique was used to identify factors determining adherence. Through a series of brief, focused interviews, patients were asked to recall specific incidents that affected their adherence to HIV medications. Patients’ responses were grouped into categories using Ethnograph software. Two nurse experts, with 94 % agreement, determined the reliability of the category listings. A v 2 analysis compared the proportion of patients reporting each factor across age, ethnicity, and intravenous drug use categories. The total sample of 52 participants included 46 male outpatients with HIV/AIDS receiving care through a Veteran’s Administration Hospital in northern California and 6 health care providers. The interviews yielded a total of 294 incidents. Six major categories were identified, and a taxonomy of critical factors determining highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) adherence was developed. The categories included <b>reminders</b> and <b>cues</b> (30 %), planning (18 %), response to HIV/AIDS (17 %), HIV medication characteristics (14 %), interactions with others (12 %), and patient characteristics (10 %). The two largest categories representing patient-related factors accounted for nearly half of the incidents. Patients most influenced by positive support from others included non-Caucasians, those under the age of 50 years, and those with fewer years of education. The taxonomy of adherence behaviors provides important information for developing culturally relevant patient adherence education programs and an essential foundation for developing future studies...|$|R

This research experimentally determined whether exposure to food cues in TV programs affects energy intake during TV viewing among young women, independently from food cues presented in TV advertisements. The experiment involved a 2 (TV program with or without food cues) by 2 (TV advertisements with or without food cues) between-participants design. While watching TV, participants could freely eat peanut chocolate candies and crisps (potato chips). Participants were 121 young women (mean age =  19. 6 years; mean BMI =  22. 5). Participants who watched a TV program with food cues tended to have a lower total energy intake and ate significantly less peanut chocolate candies than participants who watched the same TV program without food cues. This effect was particularly pronounced among participants with a higher BMI. Food advertisements did not affect energy intake. Findings may indicate that subtle continuous food cues during TV programs could make young females more aware of their own eating and/or weight, leading to reduced intake of particularly sweet snack foods during TV viewing.

Based on previous studies on environmental and sociocognitive determinants of caregivers' compliance with HH guidelines in day care centers (DCCs), an intervention has been developed aiming to improve caregivers' and children's HH compliance and decrease infections among children attending DCCs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. Methods/design: The intervention will be evaluated in a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial among 71 DCCs in the Netherlands. In total, 36 DCCs will receive the intervention consisting of four components: 1) HH products (dispensers and refills for paper towels, soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and hand cream); 2) training to educate about the Dutch national HH guidelines; 3) two team training sessions aimed at goal setting and formulating specific HH improvement activities; and 4) <b>reminders</b> and <b>cues</b> to action (posters/stickers). Intervention DCCs will be compared to 35 control DCCs continuing usual practice. The primary outcome measure will be observed HH compliance of caregivers and children, measured at baseline and one, three, and six months after start of the intervention. The secondary outcome measure will be the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in 600 children attending DCCs, monitored over six months by parents using a calendar to mark the days their child has diarrhea and/or a cold. Multilevel logistic regression will be performed to assess the effect of the intervention on HH compliance. Multilevel poisson regression will be performed to assess the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in children attending DCCs. Discussion: This is one of the first DCC intervention studies to assess HH compliance of both caregivers and children, as well as the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in children, as outcome measures. When an effect of the intervention on improving HH compliance and/or reducing incidence of infections is shown, (inter) national dissemination of the intervention in other DCCs may be considered.

40|$|FEM-PrEP did not {{demonstrate}} {{a reduction in}} HIV acquisition because of low study pill adherence. Yet, plasma and intracellular drug concentrations indicated that some participants had evidence of recent pill use. We conducted a follow-up study to identify, among other topics, participants' reasons for taking the study pill. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews (SSIs) were conducted with 88 FEM-PrEP participants. Participants were purposefully selected based on their adherence drug concentrations collected during FEM-PrEP and placed into three adherence interview groups: "high," "moderate," and "none/scarce. " Participants in the high and moderate groups described reasons why they adhered most {{or some of the}} time, including factors that facilitated their adherence. Participants in all groups described what they believed made it possible for other FEM-PrEP participants to adhere. In addition, 224 FEM-PrEP participants reported on their reasons for taking the study pills through a quantitative, audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI). Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. Five themes were identified from the SSIs as facilitating factors of adherence: 1) participants' support for the research, 2) HIV risk reduction, 3) routine formation and use of tools, 4) adherence counseling, and 5) partner awareness and support. Participants described similar facilitators when they spoke about other participants' adherence. Among the 172 participants who reported in ACASI that they had taken a study pill, wanting to help answer the research question was the most frequently stated reason for taking the pills (94 %, n = 161). We also found evidence of preventive misconception. Adherence was facilitated by personal motivations, such as risk reduction and interest in the research outcome, and by adherence strategies consisting of external <b>cues,</b> <b>reminders,</b> and support. These findings can inform future HIV prevention clinical trials and the rollout of effective antiretroviral-based HIV prevention technologies for women...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{cognitive function}} {{in everyday life}} is {{the formation of an}} intention and the execution of this intention at an appropriate time in the future – a function also known as prospective memory. In safety-critical domains such as healthcare, failure to remember future intentions can have severe consequences. Healthcare researchers and memory researchers have recognised the prospective memory challenges that healthcare staff face, such as remembering routine tasks or resuming interrupted tasks. However, healthcare researchers have not fully considered the cognitive processes involved in prospective memory, and experimental memory researchers have not fully considered the rich and supportive environment in which healthcare staff work. This thesis combines theories about prospective memory drawn from basic research with the approach of distributed cognition to investigate the prospective memory performance of intensive care nurses. A particular focus of the thesis is the resumption of interrupted healthcare tasks. The healthcare literature on interruptions is motivated by the possibly disruptive effects of interruptions on memory, but this potential outcome has seldom been investigated directly. In a retrospective analysis of a full-scale simulation study with anaesthesiologists (Study 1), we showed that whether anesthesiologists remember or forget an interrupted blood transfusion bedside check depends on how they handle the interruption. Only anaesthesiologists who engaged fully with the interruption forgot the check. The study shows that interruptions can lead to forgetting of tasks. The results highlight the fact that interruption management needs to be considered when investigating interruptions in healthcare, a factor that we considered in Study 2. Laboratory research has shown how demanding prospective memory tasks such as resuming interrupted tasks can be. In a theoretically-motivated prospective observation using a mobile eye tracker (Study 2), we investigated which characteristics of an interruption influence the resumption lag, which is the time {{from the end of the}} interruption to the recall of the interrupted primary task. The resumption lag served as an indicator of how effortful task resumption was. Furthermore, we investigated how nurses managed prospective memory demands caused by interruptions and how interruption management affected the initial prospective memory demand. The results of a series of multiple regression models show that longer interruptions and a context change due to the interruption make the resumption of interrupted tasks more effortful. Nurses managed prospective memory demands by, for example, holding task artifacts while attending an interruption. This lowers the cognitive demands for an individual nurse because the artefact indicates the task that needs to be resumed and when. Using such ideas we extended the “individual model” of interruption and resumption processes to a “distributed model” to accommodate the behaviour we observed in the field. The next study addressed the role of external support in a controlled setting. To test the influence of the reminders, we controlled the presence and absence of reminders in different prospective memory situations (Study 3). To achieve the necessary control but still allow nurses to use their experience to manage memory demands, we used a full-scale simulator and a scenario representative of professional practice. The results showed that only <b>reminders</b> designed to <b>cue</b> a specific action, or reminders that are essential for the action, improved prospective memory performance. In addition, reminders affected prospective memory processes and strategies for managing prospective memory demands. The final study of the thesis was designed to apply the knowledge gained by implementing a cognitive aid to help nurses remember intentions (Study 4). We tested whether introducing an emergency equipment drawer divider with pictorial representations of emergency equipment items at the appropriate locations would increase how completely the drawers would be stocked. The introduction of the divider resulted in a small but significant increase in equipment completeness, it increased the standardisation between different patient bays, and it eased the safety check for staff with less local intensive care experience. In summary, this research program presents a first step towards investigating prospective memory demands in critical care settings using different methods. The results indicate factors that impede or support remembering of future intentions and highlight how nurses distribute and manage prospective memory challenges. The approach of a distributed prospective memory was suggested for studying and improving prospective memory performance in complex socio-technical domains. However, remembering future intentions in socio-technical settings such as healthcare is a complex task. Future research is discussed that could advance our understanding further, and so potentially increase patient safety...|$|R
40|$|Background: Obesity is {{the number}} one health risk facing Americans. The obesity {{epidemic}} in America is attributed to physical inactivity, unhealthy food choices, and excessive food intake. Structured weight loss programs have been successful in initiating behavior change and weight loss; however, weight is almost always regained over time. The rate of weight gain is highest immediately after cessation of a structured weight loss program. Thus, effective interventions are needed that can successfully be used following a structured weight loss program to sustain weight loss and prevent weight relapse. Due to low cost, ubiquity, and ease of use, healthcare communicated through mobile technology, or "mHealth", may be able to serve as an effective medium to reach {{a large number of people}} to facilitate weight loss behaviors. Short message service (SMS), also known as text messaging, is easy to use, ubiquitous, affordable, and can target people directly where they are regardless of geographic location, socioeconomic status, or demographic factors. A review of the literature demonstrated limited information regarding message content, timing and frequency of message delivery and only 3 of 14 SMS-related interventions reviewed demonstrated a statistically significant effect on weight loss, diet or exercise. Additionally, information on how to integrate and leverage SMS as a health promotion tool for weight loss was also limited in the literature. The Behavior Change Process model was used as a guide to understand how to develop an intervention to help people sustain recent weight loss. Furthermore, research suggests interventions that target and frame messages about how people reach goals in their life through either a prevention or promotion focus may be beneficial at motivating people to self-regulate and sustain recent behavioral changes. The goal of this study was to design an intervention that would help people stay in the continued response phase of the Behavior Change Process and help prevent weight relapse. Using the Behavior Change Process and regulatory focus theory, an intervention was developed that leveraged short message service (SMS) to deliver messages to people who have recently lost weight in attempt to help them sustain weight loss and prevent relapse. Methods: First, a pilot study was conducted to inform the development of a SMS software application, the development of message content and the frequency and timing of message delivery. Second, an exploratory 3 -arm mixed methods randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the feasibility, acceptability, perception of the usefulness, and efficacy of a weight loss sustaining mHealth SMS intervention among people with obesity. Participants (N= 120) were randomized to a promotion message group, a prevention message group, or an attention-control general health message group. Participants completed baseline assessments, and reported their weight at 1 and 3 months post-baseline to assess efficacy of the intervention on sustaining weight loss. In addition, participants partook in a phone interview follow completion of the intervention to assess acceptability and usefulness. Results: Participants found the message content and intervention acceptable and a majority perceived value in receiving messages via SMS that promote weight loss sustaining behaviors. Interview data implied that the intervention served as a <b>reminder</b> and daily <b>cue</b> to action. Participants were favorable towards receiving a daily reminder, which they noted helped them to stay focused, and in some cases to keep them motivated to continue losing weight. And a majority, 42 (91 %) who participated in a telephone interview said that they preferred to get messages on their cell phone due to accessibility and convenience. A minimum of one message per day delivered at approximately 8 : 00 A. M. was deemed the optimal delivery time and frequency. This was particularly true for weight loss, which many participants reported as a daily struggle that begins every morning. With regards to sustaining weight loss, there was a statistical trend in sustained weight loss at months 1 and 3 in the promotion and prevention framed message groups compared to the control group in both the intent-to-treat and evaluable case analyses. Clinically, there was a significant decrease in mean weight of approximately 5 pounds at month 3 in the promotion and prevention groups compared to the control. Additionally, effect sizes indicated a large effect of the intervention on sustaining weight loss in the promotion and prevention groups relative to the control group. Conclusion: Overall results showed that at the continued response phase of the behavioral change process, it was feasible to design an application to deliver promotion and prevention framed weight loss sustaining messages. In particular, prevention framed messages may have been more useful in helping participants sustain weight loss. Though there was less than 80 % power to detect a statistically significant difference, the observed effect sizes in this study were significant and demonstrated a large effect of the promotion and prevention interventions on sustaining weight loss relative to control. Furthermore, there was a clinically significant increase in mean weight loss and in the number of people who sustained weight loss in the promotion and prevention intervention groups compared to control. These findings may serve as a reference for future interventions designed to help people thwart relapse and transition from a state of sustaining recent weight loss behaviors to a state of maintenance. Technological tools such as this SMS intervention that are constructed and guided by evidence-based content and theoretical constructs show promise in helping people sustain healthy behaviors that can lead to improved health outcomes.

40|$|Background: Maintaining high {{adherence}} {{is crucial}} to ensure that medications are effective (WHO, 2003). However, adherence rates are low (e. g. Haynes et al., 2002; Kardas, 2002; Osterberg & Blaschke, 2005). While some patients make a deliberate decision to alter or discontinue their treatment, others can be non-adherent unintentionally (WHO, 2003). Forgetfulness in particular {{is the main reason}} of unintentional non-adherence (Unni & Farris, 2011), and several technologies have been designed to support patients’ memory. At present, patients have access {{to a wide range of}} commercial adherence technologies, from simple smartphone apps to complex medication management systems. The topic is also popular among academic researchers, with many working on novel approaches to supporting patients’ memory (e. g. de Oliveira et al., 2010; Lee & Dey, 2014; Rodríguez et al., 2011). However, existing adherence technologies tend to provide timed alerts ("Please take your pill") and largely neglect people’s actual behaviour and the context within which they remember their medications. Contextual cues, e. g. routine events or meaningful objects, play an important role in supporting medication adherence, as they aid both prospective memory and habit formation; as a result, medication-taking becomes a part of a daily routine. Tasks linked to routine events, e. g. taking pills with breakfast, are easier to remember than tasks that need to take place at a specific time, such as taking pills at 7 am (Park & Kidder, 1996). Moreover, research conducted with older adults shows that medication management is often guided by the physical environment and temporal rhythms of the day (Palen & Aaløkke, 2006), and that it is possible to improve adherence rates through tailoring remembering strategies and leaving visible cues in routinely visited places (Insel & Cole, 2005). Such contextual cues can also support the process of habit formation: as the behaviour is consistently repeated in the presence of stable cues, with time they start to guide the behaviour and provide triggers to action (Lally & Gardner, 2011). However, adherence technologies tend to disregard contextual cues and the habitual nature of many medication regimens, and instead alert users when it is time to take the pill (Stawarz et al., 2014). Similarly, behaviour change technologies designed specifically to support habit formation also neglect contextual cues and instead focus on behaviour tracking and reminders (Stawarz et al, 2015). By supporting the identification and reinforcement of contextual cues, technology could aid both prospective memory and habit formation: it could help patients remember the new regimen and turn it into a reliable medication habit. Aims: Previous research by Stawarz et al. (2015) suggests that contextual cues support habit formation, but because habits take time to develop, people can still forget; conversely, reminders support remembering, but they can inhibit habit development. However, their study measured the development of an artificial habit (texting the researchers), lasted only for 4 weeks, and did not account for the role of location as a contextual cue. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the impact of contextual <b>cues</b> and <b>reminders</b> on the development of automaticity of behaviour (representing habit strength) and frequency of repetition (representing adherence to the regimen) over a longer period and with behaviours participants wanted to turn into habit. The understanding of how these factors influence the process of habit formation would enable us to design more effective adherence technologies that assist patients when they start a new regimen (prospective memory support) as well as over the long term (habit support). Method: 209 participants were recruited on social networks, and among students and university staff. They were 18 - 58 years old (mean age = 27, SD = 7. 6 years); 68 % were women, 74 % were students. They were asked to repeat a healthy behaviour for 3 months and report via SMS the time they completed it. To ensure that the task was meaningful and participants were working towards a habit they would like to develop, before signing up they were given a choice between two simple tasks: a daily meditation habit (focusing on one’s breathing for a minute) or drinking more water (one glass). These tasks were selected for these study because they are simple and do not require any specialised tools or resources, which reduces the effort required to complete them every day. 56 % of participants selected meditation and 44 % selected drinking water as their task. The study had 4 cue conditions informed by previous research: none, SMS reminder, trigger event, trigger event + location. Dependent variables were automaticity and adherence. Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (SRBAI; Gardner et al., 2012) was used to assess automaticity levels at the end of the study. Three months later participants received a follow-up survey that investigated whether they continued with the task. Results: 115 participants completed the study. The results showed that while contextual cues were better at supporting habit formation than <b>reminders,</b> not all <b>cues</b> were equal. Trigger events or time of day had the most impact on supporting the new behaviour, as both helped participants repeat it even when their routine changed (e. g. during holidays). However, relying on location as a trigger was not effective as this cue was too vulnerable to routine changes. The follow-up survey also revealed that while many participants did not develop a daily habit, many developed a habit, e. g. they started carrying a water bottle, meditating during commute or doing breathing exercises when stressed. In addition, in line with previous research, the results showed that while participants who received reminders forgot less often, they reported low automaticity, which indicated that the habit did not develop. Conclusions: To effectively support adherence and help users remember their medications in the long term, technology needs to provide prospective memory reminders and also facilitate habit formation. One way to achieve that is by using reminders to reinforce the associations between the task and its cue to aid habit development while still supporting prospective memory. Future adherence technologies should remind users about their cues (“Please remember to take your medications with breakfast”) instead of simply reminding users to act now (“Time to take your medications”) ...|$|R
