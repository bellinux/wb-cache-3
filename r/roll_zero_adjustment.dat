We first characterize {{the pattern of}} optimal capacity adjustment for a monopolistic firm and find that capacity behaves as a stabilizer for the firm¡¯s output.

We find that when {{there is only a}} small cost of adjustment, a firm has more incentive to deviate at a larger capacity.

However, including risk into the threshold phase of the loss frame causes the announcements to have zero effects. These results have important implications for the climate change debate...|$|R

Results of some tests show that gain and <b>zeros</b> <b>adjustments</b> are sufficient to guarantee robust stability and performance with respect to various operating points. Making use of the flexible structure of LMI's, we propose an algorithm that minimizes the norm of the controllers gain matrix while it guarantees the damping factor specified for the closed loop system, always using a controller with flexible structure. The technique used here is the pole placement, {{whose objective is to}} place the poles of the closed loop system in a specific region of the complex plane.

We present an adaptive electronic interface that allows for the accurate mapping of the sensor’s voltage output to sensor resistance profiles. The adaptive interface uses a linearized Wheatstone bridge in a constant current configuration. The balancing of the bridge and the adjustment of the subsequent gain stage is performed using programmable variable resistors. The programmable resistors are controlled by a LabVIEW ® program. The same control program also determines and records all the resistor values in the interface circuit. The resistance of each sensor is accurately computed by LabVIEW ® using the interface-circuit resistor values and the voltage output of the circuit. Compensating for sensor drift can be done in LabVIEW ® by adjusting the programmable resistor values so that a zero-voltage output is produced during the reference cycle. By doing this <b>zero</b> <b>adjustment</b> between each “sniff ” of an odorant, the baseline drift can be minimized.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{literature has}} been generated on {{the estimation of}} allocative and technical inefficiency using static production, cost, profit, and distance functions. We develop a dynamic shadow distance system that integrates dynamic adjustment costs into a long-run shadow cost-minimization problem, which allows us to distinguish static allocative distortions from short-run inefficiencies that arise due to period-to-period adjustment costs. The set of estimating equations is comprised of the first-order conditions from the short-run shadow cost-minimization problem for the variable shadow input quantities, a set of Euler equations derived from subsequent shadow cost minimization {{with respect to the}} quasi-fixed inputs, and the input distance function, expressed in terms of shadow quantities. This system nests within it the static model with <b>zero</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. Using panel data on U.

Second, we find that adjustment costs represent about 0. 42 % of total cost, and about 1. 26 % of capital costs. Third, while both models reveal that labor is not utilized efficiently, the dynamic model indicates a longer period of over-use and less variance over time in the degree of inefficiency. With the dynamic model, productivity growth is larger but more stable.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a nonslender delta wing, with a 50 ° leading edge sweep, was conducted {{in order to understand}} the unsteady vortical flows during a dynamic rolling motion. Dye flow visualization and DPIV (Digital Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements were conducted in a water tunnel study. When vortex breakdown was present over the wing at <b>zero</b> <b>roll</b> angle, its variation was little affected at static or dynamic roll angles. However, there were relatively large variations of maximum vorticity and in the size of the vortical flow region in a cross-flow plane. In the static case, when vortex breakdown was at the apex of the wing at <b>zero</b> <b>roll</b> angle, a coherent vortex was formed and vortex breakdown could be observed over the wing for large roll angles. In the dynamic case, even for small dimensionless frequencies, there were coherent leading-edge vortices on both sides of the wing throughout the whole cycle, rather than partially or completely stalled flow as in the static case. However, the variation of breakdown location over a cycle was much smaller. When the dimensionless frequency of the rolling motion was substantially increased, the amplitude of cyclic variations in breakdown location decreased. In addition, hysteresis increased with increasing frequency, and was most noticeable at <b>zero</b> <b>roll</b> angle. The existence of multiple vortices with the same sign of vorticity as the primary vortices was apparent at some roll angles. Variation of circulation also showed hysteresis and had certain similarities to the variations of breakdown location, although the magnitudes of these variations were much larger...|$|R

5000|$|The first ohmmeters {{were based}} on a type of meter {{movement}} known as a 'ratiometer'. [...] These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no <b>zero</b> <b>adjustment</b> was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full deflection range. By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.|$|R

This IVT configuration uses its CVT as a continuously variable regulator (CVR) of the rotation speed of any one of the three rotators of the planetary gear system (PGS). If two of the PGS rotator speeds are the input and output of the CVR, there is a setting of the CVR that results in the IVT output speed of zero.
