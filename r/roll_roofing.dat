5000|$|... ==Overview== <b>Roll</b> <b>roofing</b> {{is usually}} {{restricted}} to a lightweight mat compared to shingles, {{as it must}} be rolled for shipment. Rolls are typically 36 in by 33 ft in size. Due to its light weight compared to shingles, <b>roll</b> <b>roofing</b> is regarded as an inexpensive, temporary material. Its wide width makes it vulnerable to temperature-induced shrinkage and tearing as it expands and contracts.|$|E

50|$|The barn {{was built}} about 1935 and {{measures}} about 63 ft by 43 ft. The peeled log walls {{rest on a}} concrete foundation. A gambrel roof crowns the two story structure. Other contributing structures include the pump house (1932), built in stucco with applied half-timber detailing and a <b>rolled</b> <b>roof</b> edge. The 1933 hydroelectric plant is similar in style and construction. Dams are associated with each building. A root cellar, stone walls, a lily pond and its feeder canal all date from the historical period.|$|R
50|$|The {{outhouse}} is 4 x 5 ft, plank board walls, <b>rolled</b> <b>roofing,</b> {{and has no}} foundation. It is {{northwest of}} the cabin. The boathouse is 13 x 23 ft is also northwest of the cabin. It has a concrete foundation and walls of concrete and flat sawn logs. The roof is gable with green metal roofing. The east wall with a wooden overhead garage door faces the lake {{and there is a}} concrete boat ramp. The interior has wooden walls and a concrete floor.|$|R
50|$|The main {{environmental}} concern in recycling asphalt shingles is the rare presence of asbestos in shingles manufactured before 1980. Asbestos {{was also used}} in some felt paper, <b>roll</b> <b>roofing,</b> roof paint, roof coating, caulking, and mastic.|$|E
50|$|Bituminous {{waterproofing}} {{systems are}} designed to protect residential and commercial buildings. Bitumen (asphalt or coal-tar pitch) is a mixed substance made up of organic liquids that are highly sticky, viscous, and waterproof. These systems are sometimes used to construct roofs, {{in the form of}} roofing felt or <b>roll</b> <b>roofing</b> products.|$|E
5000|$|Asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing</b> or {{membrane}} is a {{roofing material}} commonly used for buildings that feature a low sloped roof pitch in North America. The material {{is based on}} the same materials used in asphalt shingles; an organic felt or fiberglass mat, saturated with asphalt, and faced with granular stone aggregate.|$|E

50|$|The {{center and}} east {{sections}} are smaller two-by-two-bay two-story buildings with <b>rolled</b> asphalt <b>roofs,</b> progressively lower in height. Another chimney {{rises from the}} east block, currently used as a kitchen. A chimney on the center block has been largely dismantled.|$|R
50|$|The one-story cabin stood {{above the}} timberline. It was built of {{concrete}} with a stone veneer. The roof framing used peeled logs with an asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing</b> weather surface, {{protected by a}} log lattice on top. The cabin had two doors and ten windows, and measured about 32.33 ft by 16.33 ft.|$|E
5000|$|Barn - The barn, {{built around}} 1910, is two stories. It is a {{vertical}} board structure with a gambrel roof covered in <b>roll</b> <b>roofing.</b> The building has a concrete foundation. The windows are fixed pane 4 lite. On the east {{is a double}} door. The hay track and door are still evident on the south side. Two garage doors were added on the south.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>roofing</b> is a bitumen {{product that}} is exposed to the weather. To protect the base from {{ultraviolet}} degradation mineral granules are added {{on top of the}} felt, also decreasing the product's fire vulnerability. Thin, transparent film is added {{to the base of the}} felt during manufacturing on all torch-on products. This stops the felt from sticking to itself when rolled up during the packaging process.|$|E
40|$|South {{and west}} facades. Facing northeast.; This one story gable end Eclectic house is unique {{because of its}} <b>rolled</b> {{composition}} <b>roof</b> which mimics the thatched roofs of rural England. This Tudor subtype has a combination of brick, wood and stone building material. Brick is used on the lower front facade, diagonal wood siding {{is used in the}} gables, and horizontal wood siding is used elsewhere. There is a stone chimney on the south facade. The gabled entry porch also has a <b>rolled</b> shingle <b>roof.</b> The house sits on a cement block foundation. Although this house fits into the Eclectic (1890 - 1940) architectural category, it could best be called a "Northern Michigan cottage", from which it was patterned...|$|R

50|$|A gable roofed brick malt-dressing area {{separates}} the stone kilns from two slightly larger kilns. Machinery for processing grain (cleaning, moving, grading) {{is located on}} timber platforms at different levels connected by timber stairs. Sky lights over this area have <b>rolled</b> iron <b>roofs.</b> Rooms for the collection of dust are located on the upper level.|$|R
50|$|The patrol {{cabin is}} a one story log cabin {{on a log}} sill {{foundation}} using 14 in logs. The cabin is square in plan with asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing</b> on the gabled roof. The door retains its original wrought iron hardware. The interior is floored with 8 in boards, cut to a length of 3 ft to fit a pack saddle. The interior logs are trimmed with split-pole chinking. The ceiling is open, with exposed log framing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>roofing</b> is {{normally}} applied {{parallel to the}} eaves {{from the bottom of}} the roof upwards, lapping each new roll in the same manner as shingles. Its use is restricted to roofs with a pitch of less than 2:12. To avoid penetrating the exposed membrane with nails, adhesive or [...] "lap cement" [...] must be used at the bottom edge to keep it from being lifted by the wind. The upper edge of the roll is nailed and covered by the next roll.|$|E
5000|$|The ranch {{consists}} of seven cabins, a lodge-dining hall and a laundry-utility building, {{as well as}} a barn, garages, sheds and a corral. The ranch is sited on {{the west bank of the}} Snake River. All buildings are in the style known as [...] "dude ranch vernacular", characterized by log construction and board-and-batten infill. Logs are generally varnished brown, but roofs are red or green asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing.</b> Cabins are largely original construction with newer toilet additions to the rear. Interiors are intact with exposed logs in the walls and floors.|$|E
50|$|Developed and {{constructed}} by Taylor Woodrow, the Arcon was an asbestos-clad {{variant of the}} Portal, with the same prefabricated kitchen and bathroom capsule. It had a longer life, but also came with a higher cost of construction. The later <b>rolled</b> top <b>roofed</b> Arcon Mk5 was developed by Edric Neel. 38,859 were constructed through the programme.|$|R
50|$|It is a -story {{frame with}} a two-story wing to the rear, giving it an L-shape. The facade is three bays wide. The green <b>rolled</b> asphalt <b>roof</b> is steeply pitched, cross-gabled with smaller dormer gables. Bargeboards {{decorate}} the cornices of the intersecting gables, with turned finials at the apexes. Two large brick chimneys further accentuate the vertical Gothic motifs.|$|R
50|$|Roof crush: When {{a vehicle}} rolls over {{and ends up}} on its roof, {{the weight of the}} vehicle may cause the roof of the vehicle to collapse, {{potentially}} crushing the occupants of the vehicle. Roof crush injury risks are higher in vehicles with a greater propensity to <b>roll</b> over. <b>Roof</b> crush kills or inures thousands of people every year.|$|R
50|$|Asphalt {{shingles}} are an American invention {{first used}} in 1901, in general use {{in parts of}} America by 1911 and by 1939 11 million squares of shingles were being produced. The forerunner of these shingles was first developed in 1893 and called asphalt prepared roofing which was similar to asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing</b> without the surface granules. In 1897 slate granules {{were added to the}} surface to make the material more durable. Types of granules tested have included mica, oyster shells, slate, dolomite, fly-ash, silica and clay. In 1901 this material was first cut into strips for use as one-tab and multi-tab shingles.|$|E
50|$|The White Grass {{overlooks the}} {{southern}} end of Jackson Hole, lying close to the southern Teton Range, just to the west. The ranch complex is organized around its central road, with the dining hall and lodge near the center and the cabins disposed {{to the north of the}} dining hall and on either side of the one lane road. Structures share a consistent rustic character, varied chiefly by a choice of green or red asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing.</b> The White Grass once featured a concrete-lined swimming pool, fed by water diverted from Stewart's Draw, which also fed a pond called Lake Ingeborg after Galey's wife Inge. The cold water in the supply ditches was used to cool drinks for the dudes.|$|E
50|$|The {{historic}} district at the Bar B C includes 37 structures, including cabins, a lodge, a dining hall, a laundry/utility building, man-made ponds, barns, sheds and corrals. The site {{is at the}} western edge of the Snake River bottomlands, nestled against a river terrace to the west. A central road climbs from the ranch through a cutting in the hillside. The buildings are chiefly 1- or -story log structures, rectangular in shape. Roofing is red or green asphalt <b>roll</b> <b>roofing.</b> The property layout is apparently casual, but centers on the dining hall and lodge, with cabins on either side of the main path, flanked by corrals to the north and the barn to the south. While the exteriors are in good condition and are considered contributing features, the interiors have lost much of their character through alterations and loss of fixtures.|$|E
