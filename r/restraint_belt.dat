40|$|Wheelchair-related {{physical}} <b>restraints,</b> lap <b>belts,</b> {{and other}} alternatives {{are intended to}} provide safe and adequate seating and mobility for individuals using wheelchairs. Physical <b>restraints</b> and lap <b>belts</b> are also helpful for positioning people in their wheelchairs {{to reduce the risk}} of injury during wheelchair tips and falls. However, when used improperly or in ways other than intended, injury or even death can result. Although widely prescribed, little evidence is available to direct professionals on the appropriate use of these <b>restraints</b> and lap <b>belts</b> and for whom these restraints are indicated. The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of available literature from 1966 – 2006 to identify the risks and benefits associated with lap belts while seated in wheelchairs. Twenty-five studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Nine studies reported the frequency of asphyxial deaths caused by physical restraints, nine studies reported the long-term complication and indirect adverse effects of physical restraints and lap-belt use, and seven studies reported the benefits of physical <b>restraints</b> and lap <b>belts</b> with individuals using wheelchairs. Despite the weak evidence, the results suggest a considerable number of deaths from asphyxia caused by the use of physical restraints occurred each year in the U. S. The majority of the deaths occurred in nursing homes, followed by hospitals, and then the home of the person. Most deaths occurred while persons were restrained in wheelchairs or beds. Based on that, caution needs to be exercised when using <b>restraints</b> or positioning <b>belts.</b> In addition, other seating and environment alternatives should be explored prior to using <b>restraints</b> or positioning <b>belts,</b> such as power wheelchair seating options. Positioning belts may reduce risk of falls from wheelchairs and should be given careful consideration, but caution should be exercised if the individual cannot open the latch independently. Also, the duration of use of the physical restraint should be limited. Therefore, several factors should be considered when devising a better quality of physical-restraint services provided by health care professionals. These efforts can lead to improved safety and quality of life for individuals who use wheelchairs. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} extends {{topology optimization}} techniques to consider multibody dynamics systems {{with a much}} more open design space, which can include passive, active, and reactive components, with a special application focus on a gunner restraint system (GRS) design problem. General representative models for the multi-functional components are established in a multibody dynamics system. The topology optimization process has been advanced for the optimization of geometrically nonlinear, time-dependent, and timing-dependent multibody dynamics systems undergoing large nonlinear displacements with nonlinear dynamics responses as design objectives. Three efficient sensitivity analysis methods have been proposed, which include the constant dynamic loading method, the time integration incorporated method based on the Generalized-Alpha algorithm and the iterative method. These new methods {{have made it possible}} to calculate the sensitivities in complicated multibody dynamic systems and provide users with choices to significantly reduce the computational costs, especially, in the topology optimization process, and to obtain desired accuracy in the sensitivity analysis. In addition to the sensitivity analysis methods, an efficient and reliable Kriging variable screening method based on the REML criterion has been developed to identify significant variables in the systems to determine the worst cases for various system uncertainty studies. A specific application of the multi-functional components system optimization technology is the GRS design problem, in which both the vehicle and the gunner can undergo large relative and absolute motions under various driving or threat conditions. In meanwhile, the restraint components may need to allow amplitude-dependent, time-dependent, timing-dependent nonlinear response behaviors, such as those seeing in <b>restraint</b> <b>belts,</b> airbags, and retractors. The restraint system layout design needs to keep a wide open design space, thus to find the truly optimal design. The developed methodologies have been employed in the GRS design problems to demonstrate usage of the new methodologies...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMass transit bus {{is one of}} the key {{modes of}} transportation, {{especially}} in highly populated areas of the United States (US). Review of literature has shown that there is very little research, which focuses on the safety and comfort of a bus operator. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). FARS shows that there were 300 fatal bus accidents during the period from 1995 to 1999. Statistical data also shows that 16 bus operators suffered fatal injuries during the period from 1991 to 2000. The operators end up driving for long duration of time, which makes the three-point type of <b>belt</b> <b>restraint</b> system uncomfortable. This may also lead to stress and fatigue. The use of a two-point seat <b>belt</b> <b>restraint</b> system may be more comfortable for the operator since his hands and torso will be unrestrained. However, the physical sled testing of this seat belt configuration revealed severe life threatening risk for the operator. It was observed that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15) value was above the threshold limit of 700 and the femur load value was well over their allowable threshold limit of 10, 000 N. The Neck Injury Criteria (Nij) value was very close to the allowable threshold limit of 1. Thus, safety and comfort of the transit bus operator appear to be contradictory to each other. In this research, an effort had been made to develop a methodology to design an airbag restraint system for a mass transit bus operator, which can satisfy the two contradictory objectives. An Inflatable lap belt type of airbag restraint system has been previously implemented in aircraft safety. This system is comprised of a two-point <b>restraint</b> type seat <b>belt</b> system with an airbag embedded in it. This type of airbag safety system was tested in this study for a mass transit bus operator with an aim to keep the HIC and the Nij values within allowable limits. Additional knee-padding was designed to minimize the femur loads. All of the research was conducted for frontal impact of a bus with the rigid-wall crash condition. A model development of a two-point <b>restraint</b> type seat <b>belt</b> system was carried out with the occupant simulation code, MADYMO. This model is validated with the help of physical sled test data. The baseline simulation model was used to develop the numerical model of an inflatable lap <b>belt</b> airbag <b>restraint</b> system. With the help of numerical models, the prototypes of airbag and inflators were manufactured. A physical sled test was also carried out for this system under frontal impact condition. This test data was utilized to validate the simulation results obtained from the MADYMO model. The physical sled testing as well as numerical models were developed for the three-point <b>belt</b> <b>restraint</b> system. Except the femur injury, all of the injuries were within the allowable safe limit. A physical sled test with the airbag and the knee-padding was also conducted to test the performance of an inflatable lap <b>belt</b> airbag <b>restraint</b> system. A knee-padding played a vital role to minimize the femur injury. The Results from this study can be utilized in the design and development of a safety belt system for optimal protection of mass transit bus operators in the event of a frontal impact crashes. This study can be utilized further for designing the safety restraint system for other crash conditions...|$|R
