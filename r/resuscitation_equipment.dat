40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Khartoum pediatric surgery units during period from April -November 2004. The main objectives were: to study the clinical presentation, referral and management of pediatric surgical emergencies. To assess the preoperative care offered to the child with suspected surgical problem and to evaluate the referral system of the surgical cases. It is a prospective descriptive study of 136 children with emergency surgical problems. Males were 81 (59. 6 %), where as females were 55 (40. 4 %). The male to female ratio was 1. 4 : 1. Newborns were the most reported age group constituting 35 (25. 7 %) of the study group. The common presentations of pediatric surgical emergencies were appendicitis 37 (27. 2 %), accidental injuries 33 (24. 2 %) and intestinal obstruction 31 (22. 8 %). Hydrocephalus with meningomyelocele was the commonest surgical emergencies in the newborns 12 (8. 8 %). The majority of children 96 (70 %) were referred from pediatric emergency units to surgery emergency units. In these cases first line doctors in pediatric emergency units were house officers 74 (77. 1 %) and registrars 22 (22. 9 %). Pediatric registrar assessed 84 (87. 5 %) during 30 min and 12 (12. 5 %) in more than 30 min. The pediatric consultants were informed in V about 62 (64. 6 %) of 96 referred children, of whom 38 (61. 3 %) were seen by the consultants Out of 96 cases referred for pediatric emergency, 49 (51 %) were referred immediately to the surgical emergency units.

Registrars or medical officers evaluated 62 (45. 6 %) during 30 min and 74 (54. 4 %) in more than 30 min. The consultant surgeon was notified in 111 (81. 6 %) children.

This study aimed to explore nurses’ experiences of translating continuing professional development education utilizing the HBB© course to nursing practice in Rwanda. This study was conducted using a qualitative descriptive design. A convenience sample of 10 nurses participated in individual interviews.

40|$|An {{operation}} for obtaining additional length {{in order to}} achieve end-to-end anastomosis of the trachea without signifi cant suture-line tension is described.

Despite the increased morbidity and mortality, IHCA incidence and outcomes remain largely unknown especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes the baseline characteristics, prearrest physiological parameters and the rate of survival to hospital discharge of adult patients with an IHCA at a tertiary hospital in Kenya. Methods:This was a retrospective chart review. Data on patient characteristics, pre-arrest physiological parameters and discharge condition were collected on all patients 18 years of age or older with an IHCA at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, from January 2013 to December 2013. Results:The main study population comprised 108 patients. The mean age was 59. 3 ± 18. 4 years and 63 (58. 3 %) patients were men. The initial rhythm post cardiac arrest was pulseless electrical activity (41. 7 %) or asystole (35. 2 %) in the majority of cases. Hypertension (43. 5 %), septicaemia (40. 7 %), renal insufficiency (30. 6 %), diabetes mellitus (25. 9 %) and pneumonia (15. 7 %) were the leading pre-existing conditions in the patients. A Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) of 5 or more was reached in 56 (67. 5 %, n= 83) patients before the cardiac arrest. The rate of survival to hospital discharge was 11. 1 %.
