40|$|The {{variation}} of refrigerant {{mass in the}} cylinder of <b>refrigerator</b> <b>compressor</b> has a great influence on the compressor’s thermodynamic process. In this paper, the m-θ diagram, which represents the {{variation of}} refrigerant mass in compressor cylinder (m) and the crank angle (θ), is proposed to investigate the thermodynamic process of the <b>refrigerator</b> <b>compressor.</b> Comparing with the traditional pressure-Volume (p-V) indicator diagram, the refrigerant’s backflow trigged by the delayed closure of valve can be clearly expressed in the m-θ diagram together with the mass flow rate. A typical m-θ diagram was obtained by experimental and theoretical investigations. To improve the thermodynamic model of the compressor, a 3 D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) FEA model has been introduced {{to find out the}} effective flow area of the valves. Based on the m-θ diagram, the effect of rotating speed on the backflow through the valve, which depends on the movement of the valve, has been investigated.

40|$|During its operation, a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>compressor</b> {{produces}} pulsating noise, primarily {{driven by}} the suction and discharge processes. Sound attenuating mufflers need to be designed without any additional pressure drop on both suction and discharge side. An additional pressure drop at the suction and discharge side will lead to lower charging and discharging of the compressor and hence reduces cooling capacity. Since a one dimensional formulation with plane wave assumption to calculate transmission loss is not applicable for small mufflers (ratio of length to diameter is less than 1), a numerical methodology was established and validated using an impedance tube. Detailed three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to further study the pressure drop across the mufflers for a given flow and compressor operating frequency. In the proposed new methodology, the pressure distribution is observed {{as a function of}} frequency and an optimal position of inlet and outlet pipes is decided to improve transmission loss.

40|$|The {{stack up}} of losses within a system gives an {{indication}} of its efficiency. In a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>compressor,</b> valves contribute to thermodynamic losses (pressure and cooling capacity) due to valve dynamics and mistiming. This paper proposes an improvement to an existing analytic closed form solution for efficiency estimation of such compressors by incorporating more detailed valve physics/ dynamics. For maximum energy efficiency ratio (EER), it is beneficial in certain variable capacity compressor architectures to drive the piston at a resonant frequency. In an oscillating system, this is typically determined by the mechanical spring-damper characteristics. This resonant frequency is usually a complex function of the geometry and operating conditions due to the gas-spring effect. A closed form solution for performance estimation of such a setup proposed earlier in literature (Choe 2 ̆ 6 Kim) {{does not account for}} the effect of valve dynamics. However, the timing of valve operation influences the in-cylinder pressure build-up transients and thus modulates the gas-spring stiffness. While an accurate estimation of the resonant frequency requires a multi-physics simulation of the compressor, a detailed simulation of such complexity is time intensive especially when performing design optimization studies and hence analytical models would be preferred. The current work presents an improved equivalent analytic model for such optimization. Uncertainty analysis of the present approach is also discussed by comparing different performance parameters against full nonlinear model estimates, as relevant...|$|E
40|$|Pressure-actuated {{reed valves}} play an {{important}} role in the compression process of a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>compressor.</b> The material properties and geometrical parameters of the valve and geometrical properties of valve port determine the flow coefficient which in turn impacts the compressor efficiency. Also, the moving mass of the valve and its stiffness governs the transient response (valve flutter) which impacts life and reliability of the valve in operation. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully design the reed valves to maximize compressor performance while meeting the above requirements. The design of reed valves involves determining the geometrical parameters (length, width and thickness) and material properties (type of steel etc.). These properties are chosen such that they correspond to the desired mass and stiffness of the valve. This work mainly focuses on determining the basic valve topology (geometrical parameters) with the desired mass and stiffness of the reed valve as design constraints. In order to obtain the optimum reed valve mass and stiffness values, an in-house system level performance simulation model is used. An analytical finite element based model has been built that searches for geometrical parameters which meets both target valve parameters and material limitations for reliability and life. This provides multiple valve designs with different geometrical parameters and gives the designer the flexibility to choose the most suitable valve design for a targeted application. Additionally, the basic valve topology will facilitate a more detailed performance analyses, viz. flow-thermal simulations and flow-structure interaction...|$|E

40|$|The huge {{landfills}} from {{solid waste}} {{generated by the}} massive utilisation of different products from domestic sources are badly affecting the environment. About 70 % of the solid municipal waste, two thirds of which comprises of household waste, is dumped as landflll all over the world. For efficient product lifecycle management via upgrade, maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, and reclamation of components etc., storage of product related information throughout its lifecycle is indispensable. Efficient use of information technology integrated with product design can enable products to manage themselves in a semiautomatic and intelligent manner. It means that products themselves should contain informationú that {{what to do with}} them when they are of no use. More advanced products may locate themselves and communicate with their recyclers through internet or some other communication technology. In this regard, different types of technologies have been investigated. These technologies are broadly classified as passive embedded information devices and active embedded information devices. Methods of automatic identification in combination with information technology can act as passive Embedded Information Devices (EID) to make products intelligent enough in order to manage associated information throughout their life cycles. Barcodes, Radio Frequency Identification tags, and a new technology called i-button technology were investigated as possible candidates for passive EIDs. The ibutton technology from the perspective of product lifecycle management is presented for the very first time in the literature. Experiments demonstrated that RFID and i-button technologies have potential to store not only the static but dynamic data up to some extent, such as small maintenance logs. As passive EIDs are unable to store the sensory data and detailed maintenance logs regarding a product, therefore, in addition to these demonstrators for passive EIDs, an advanced active EID demonstrator for lifecycle management of products with high functional complexity is also presented. Initially, the idea is presented as smart EID system that r~cords the sensory data of a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>compressor</b> and stores the detailed maintenance logs into the product itself. However, this idea is extended as intelligent EID that is implemented on a gearbox in order to predict the gearbox lifetime under an accelerated life test. This involves developmen,t of a novel on-chip life prediction algorithm to predict the gearbox lifetime under accelerated life testing scenario. The algorithm involves a combination of artificial neural networks and an appropriate reliability distribution. Results of accelerated life testing, simulation for the choice of appropriate reliability distribution and the life prediction algorithm are presented. Bi-directional communication software that is developed in order to retrieve lifecycle data from the intelligent EID and to keep intelligent EID updated is also explained. Overall, embedded information devices can be proposed as a good solution to support a sustainable approach to lifecycle management. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
