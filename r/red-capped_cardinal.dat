50|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal</b> (Paroaria gularis) {{is a small}} South American bird. It {{belongs to}} Paroaria, a genus of {{red-headed}} cardinal-tanagers.|$|E
50|$|The masked {{cardinal}} {{was formerly}} considered conspecific with the <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal.</b> The masked cardinal markedly {{differs from the}} <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal</b> by the black ear-coverts and the red (not black) lower throat and upper chest. Additionally, its lower mandible is typically whitish, {{but this is not}} entirely consistent, as it occasionally is pale flesh-coloured. This distinctive taxon was determined a different species, as suggested by the lack of hybridization with P. g. gularis in the limited area of overlap in southern Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal</b> {{feeds on}} insects, rice and fruit. It is usually found in {{conspicuous}} pairs or family groups. If {{there is a}} well-marked breeding season, it extends {{over much of the}} year. The <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal</b> has been recorded to breed at least from June to September in northern South America but at Sacha Lodge at the Napo River (Ecuador) an adult was seen feeding a fledgling shiny cowbird (a brood parasite) in late March. This suggests that breeding can also occur as early as February/March. There is no indication for a difference in breeding seasons between the red-capped and the masked cardinals.|$|E

Animals in this exhibit include Arrau River turtles, bay-headed tanagers, black pacu, {{turquoise}} honeycreepers, emerald tree boas, golden-headed manakins, leafcutter ants, mata matas, paradise tanagers, peacock bass, <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinals,</b> red-tailed catfish, rufous-crowned tanagers, silver-beaked tanagers, stingrays, sunbitterns, swallow tanagers, turquoise tanagers, violaceous euphonia, yellow-rumped cacique, yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles, green anaconda, and saffron finches.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} in Trinidad, far {{north-eastern}} Colombia and northern Venezuela. It was previously considered conspecific with the <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal,</b> from which it differs by the black ear-coverts and the red (not black) lower throat and upper chest. Additionally, its lower mandible is typically whitish, {{but this is not}} entirely consistent, as it occasionally is pale flesh-coloured. This distinctive taxon as a distinct species, as suggested by the lack of hybridization with P. g. gularis in the limited area of overlap in southern Venezuela. The common name masked cardinal was suggested.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>red-capped</b> <b>cardinal</b> is 16.5 cm (6.5 in) {{long and}} weighs about 22 g. (0.78 oz). The {{nominate}} subspecies has a crimson head, blackish lores and ocular region, and shiny black upperparts, {{apart from a}} white partial collar extending up the neck sides from the white underparts. The throat is black, extending to a point on the upper chest. The upper mandible is black, while the lower is pale flesh-coloured. The legs are dark grey (almost black) and the iris is brownish-orange. In pattern the juvenile resemble the adults, but the upperparts are dusky-brown, the head is deep brownish-buff (darker on the cap), the bill is entirely black and the iris is pale, dull creamy-yellow.|$|E
50|$|On 14 December 1964, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago {{introduced}} {{notes for}} $1, $5, $10 & $20. New denominations {{in the form}} of $50 & $100 notes were issued on 6 June 1977, although the $50 note was not continued after a shipment was stolen prior to issue. The $50 note was taken out of its brief circulation. The reverses of the current notes feature the Central Bank Building of Trinidad & Tobago. The obverses have the coat of arms in the center, a national bird and a place in Trinidad, such as a market, petroleum refinery, etc. In 2002, new $1 & $20 notes were introduced. In 2003, new $1, $5, $10 & $100 were also introduced. The notes were only slightly changed; they now have more security features & darker colour. Recently, more security features {{have been added to the}} notes by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2012 the $50 note was reintroduced to commemorate Trinidad and Tobago's Golden Jubilee of Independence. On the front of the note is a <b>Red-capped</b> <b>cardinal</b> bird and the commemorative text around the center of the coat of arms. Two versions of this denomination were released, one without the commemorative text around the centre of the coat of arms (general circulation) and one with the commemorative text.|$|E
