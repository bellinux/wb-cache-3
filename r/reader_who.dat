5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf <b>reader,</b> <b>who</b> was also a doll collector, {{have been found in}} her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
25|$|Systematic {{transliteration}} is {{a mapping}} from one system of writing into another, typically grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> knows {{the system can}} reconstruct the original spelling.|$|E
25|$|Dupin's method also {{emphasizes}} the importance of reading and writing: many of his clues come from newspapers or written reports from the Prefect. This device also engages the <b>reader,</b> <b>who</b> follows along by reading the clues himself or herself.|$|E

New weekly editions of LWN are initially only available to <b>readers</b> <b>who</b> subscribe at one of three levels (group subscriptions are also available). After a 1-week delay, each issue becomes freely available to <b>readers</b> <b>who</b> are {{unable or unwilling to}} pay.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for The New York Times, Hari Kunzru finds Great Soul to be [...] "judicious and thoughtful". Lelyveld's book, he writes, will be revelatory to American <b>readers</b> <b>who</b> {{may only}} be {{familiar}} with the rudiments of Gandhi's life and for those readers, perhaps especially Indian <b>readers,</b> <b>who</b> are better acquainted with the Gandhi story the book's portrait of the man will still be challenging.|$|R
25|$|Educated by tutors and at Starke's University School in Montgomery, Jones was a {{voracious}} <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> tackled {{everything from}} Tom Swift and Tarzan to Walter Scott and Foxe's Book of Martyrs. As a ten-year-old, his father gave him 50 missionary biographies for Christmas—which the boy finished by February.|$|E
25|$|A voluminous <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> {{possessed a}} remarkably {{analytical}} mind, a vivid memory, and an insatiable appetite for learning, Roberts {{was also a}} teacher who served as an advisor and resource to many – including several prime ministers in the Caribbean. He died on 24 July 1996, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, aged 58.|$|E
25|$|Sarmiento {{was born}} in Sta. Mesa, Manila. His father, Abraham, was a {{well-known}} lawyer and close friend of President Diosdado Macapagal who would be appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines years after his son's death. As a child, Sarmiento Jr. was a voracious <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> would engage in discussions with adults about literature, religion and art.|$|E

25|$|Most romanizations are {{intended}} to enable the casual <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds (phonemes) of the original as faithfully {{as possible in the}} target language. The popular Hepburn romanization of Japanese {{is an example of a}} transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.|$|E
25|$|Debussy was {{experimental}} {{from the}} outset, favouring dissonances and intervals {{that were not}} taught at the Academy. Like Georges Bizet, he was a brilliant pianist and an outstanding sight <b>reader,</b> <b>who</b> {{could have had a}} professional career had he so wished. The pieces he played in public at this time included sonata movements by Beethoven, Schumann and Weber, and Chopin's Ballade No. 2, a movement from the Piano Concerto No. 1, and the Allegro de concert.|$|E
25|$|Her novel, Spring Riot, was {{published}} in 1948 and got mixed reviews. Her next effort was a play, which she sent to producer Bob Whitehead. Because he had produced Member of the Wedding, she thought he would like it since her play was also about a child, but the play came back from Whitehead's office rejected. Allen waited {{for a couple of}} months and sent it back, rightly figuring that some reader had rejected it instead of Whitehead himself. This time Whitehead read the play and instantly optioned it, but due to casting problems her play was never produced on stage. The <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> had initially rejected her play was Lewis M. Allen, whom she would later marry.|$|E

25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> must recognise the sources and appreciate {{the results of the}} revision. Marino challenges the reader to pick up on the quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 Lawrence was {{introduced}} to Edward Garnett, a publisher's <b>reader,</b> <b>who</b> acted as a mentor, provided further encouragement, and became a valued friend, as did his son David. Throughout these months the young author revised Paul Morel, {{the first draft of}} what became Sons and Lovers. In addition, a teaching colleague, Helen Corke, gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair, which formed the basis of The Trespasser, his second novel. In November 1911, he came down with a pneumonia again; once he recovered, Lawrence decided to abandon teaching in order to become a full-time writer. He also broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows, an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} or classical Mongolian alphabet, {{sometimes called}} Hudum 'traditional' in Oirat {{in contrast to}} the Clear script (Todo 'exact'), is the original form of the Mongolian script used to write the Mongolian language. It does not distinguish several vowels (o/u, ö/ü, final a/e) and consonants (t/d, k/g, sometimes ž/y) that were not required for Uyghur, which was the source of the Mongol (or Uyghur-Mongol) script. The result is somewhat comparable to the situation of English, which must represent ten or more vowels with only five letters and uses the digraph th for two distinct sounds. Ambiguity is sometimes prevented by context, as the requirements of vowel harmony and syllable sequence usually indicate the correct sound. Moreover, as there are few words with an exactly identical spelling, actual ambiguities are rare for a <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> knows the orthography.|$|E

500|$|During the {{serialization}} of the manga, Tite Kubo said {{he received}} a letter from a <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> decided to name his son [...] "Ichigo". This brought joy as well as fear to the manga artist due to how his work influenced other people. While feeling that he also made a good manga during this comment, Kubo decided to work more on the character in hopes that once the real Ichigo grows up, he would feel proud with his name.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{discussed}} {{the merits of}} Carr's essay at great length in forums set up formally for this purpose at online hubs such as the Britannica Blog and publisher John Brockman's online scientific magazine Edge, where the roster of names quickly took on the semblance of a Who's Who of the day's Internet critics.

500|$|Dupin's method {{emphasizes}} the importance of reading and the written word. The newspaper accounts pique his curiosity; he learns about orangutans from a written account by [...] "Cuvier" [...] — likely Georges Cuvier, the French zoologist. This method also engages the <b>reader,</b> <b>who</b> follows along by reading the clues himself. Poe also {{emphasizes the}} power of the spoken word. When Dupin asks the sailor for information about the murders, the sailor himself acts out a partial death: [...] "The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation... the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Rogan {{writes in}} the book's introduction: [...] "an {{important}} caveat to any serious, well-researched biography or study of Morrison's life is that the reader {{should be aware that}} a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons. The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the <b>reader</b> <b>who</b> neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him." ...|$|E
