2500|$|On Number 79 is the {{restaurant}} Mårten Trotzig, named after Mårten Trotzigs Gränd, the narrowest alley {{in the old}} town passing next to it, in its turn named after the merchant Mårten Trotzig (1559–1617) who owned a building in the alley. [...] In {{the restaurant}} is an excavated medieval <b>refuse</b> <b>chute</b> once accessed through an exterior door.|$|E
50|$|Wrecker Joe Poska then hosts a christening party {{after his}} wife Martha gives birth to a baby boy, but the wreckers have to leave {{suddenly}} to reinforce a section of unstable wall {{on the top of}} the hotel. The work goes smoothly until Joe accidentally falls to his death down the <b>refuse</b> <b>chute</b> while helping Duke dump a load of bricks. Joe's death reinforces Kemp's theory about the jinx, and Duke blames himself. While walking disconsolately on the street, Duke donates money to a missionary, who predicts that he will lighten someone's burden. Soon after, Duke rescues Peggy Starr when she is thrown out of a café for trying to steal money for food, then attempts to jump into the river. Duke introduces Peggy to his friends as his cousin, and attributes his new good luck to her. After Matt falls for Peggy, both he and Duke convince Mike to hire her as a secretary.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} modeling waste-handling processes in construction, with particular emphasis on how to map out and simulate on-site waste sorting processes. The research proposes an application framework for (1) guiding the development of process mapping models and simulation models; and (2) further assessing the cost effectiveness of on-site waste sorting efforts under practical site constraints (such as labor resource availability, time control on <b>refuse</b> <b>chute</b> usage, and limited working area space in a building site). The connection has been established between the mapping and simulation techniques {{in the context of}} modeling waste handling processes in construction sites, such that the process flowchart resulting from the mapping technique can serve as convenient model input to facilitate the creation of a "dynamic" operations simulation model. A case study of the on-site waste sorting method with one <b>refuse</b> <b>chute</b> for waste classification is presented to demonstrate the complete application framework spanning (1) process mapping; (2) mapping-to-simulation model conversion; and (3) method optimization based on valid simulations.

50|$|The {{residential}} development incorporates {{a range of}} green technologies and innovations for effective energy, water and waste management. These include north-south orientation of the buildings, solar panels to generate lighting for common areas, centralised recyclable <b>refuse</b> <b>chutes</b> and a rainwater collection system. Intensified greenery at the eco-deck, vertical greening along the columns of the residential blocks, and green roofs at the roof decks helps to cool down the ambient temperature, while beautifying the precinct environment. In addition, there is a well-shaded jogging path for residents, exercise stations {{for the elderly and}} a children’s playground made from recycled materials.|$|R
50|$|Bangunan Gurucharan {{was built}} in March, 1963. The {{architect}} of Bangunan Gurucharan is T.Y. Lee and Sons and the contractor was Yap Keow. The owner of the building is Madam Gurucharan Kaur. The idea was to provide flexible rentable space that could be partitioned off into separate, smaller offices if required. Buildings amenities were located to avoid inconvenience, including the air-conditioning ducts, lavatories, staircases, lifts, and lighting. This was achieved by locating the lifts, staircases, <b>refuse</b> <b>chutes,</b> lavatories, and air-conditioning ducts {{to one side of}} the building and leaving the other side of the building open to natural lighting and outlook. Rentable areas are free of column obstruction. The building also marks the architect's exploration of curtain wall construction.|$|R

5000|$|In 1805 Joseph Williamson {{acquired}} {{an area of}} land in Mason Street, Edge Hill, Liverpool, which was then a largely undeveloped outcrop of sandstone with a scattering of scars from small-scale quarrying. He started to build houses on the site. These houses were eccentric in design [...] "of the strangest description" [...] without any rational plans. The ground behind the houses dropped sharply {{and in order to}} provide large gardens, which was the fashion at the time, Williamson built arches over some of the quarrying, and arched terraces over which the gardens could be extended. When these were complete he continued to employ his workmen, sometimes to carry out apparently pointless tasks, such as moving rubble from one place to another, then back again. His major project was to build a labyrinth of brick-arched tunnels in various directions and over various lengths within the sandstone. This tunnel-building continued until Williamson's death in 1840. In August 1867 the Liverpool Porcupine described the tunnels as being [...] "a great nuisance" [...] because drains ran straight into them, in one place creating a cess pool full of offensive water 15 ft deep, and they were being used for dumping <b>refuse,</b> including down <b>chutes</b> built into the buildings above for the purpose.|$|R
