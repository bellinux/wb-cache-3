5|$|Acclaimed Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms {{declared}} the work utterly false, while others called the novel criminal and slanderous. Reactions <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, {{being forced to}} leave town for selling the novel to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear). Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.|$|E

5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority {{and in the}} north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{court has}} had a total of 104 {{individuals}} serve on the court since its creation during the territorial period.

Of the current membership, four are men and three are women. Overall, the court has had seven women compared to ninety-seven men serve on the court. Additionally, there are currently two openly gay justices on the court.|$|E
5|$|The USGS also {{measured}} discharge at {{the village}} of Larrys Creek, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975.

Lycoming County operates a stream gauge at Salladasburg as part of the county-wide flood warning system.

Alan Alda revisited his role as Richard Feynman in Peter Parnell's play QED in a staged reading at Columbia University's Miller Theatre, and the choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church joined Oliver Sacks in an exploration of music and science. The festival also saw the première of Dear Albert, a reading for the stage written by Alda based on the letters of Albert Einstein, and starring Anthony LaPaglia as Einstein.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal issues}} of Burger King include several legal {{disputes}} and lawsuits involving the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) as both plaintiff and defendant {{in the years}} since its founding in 1954. These have involved almost every aspect of the company's operations. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents, the company's responses to these challenges have <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company's response to these various issues has drawn praise, scorn, and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years.|$|E
5|$|The ship's career {{spanned the}} globe, and <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{deployment}} to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in 1899–1901, to tours in the Americas throughout the 1900s, {{and a trip}} to Australia in 1905. During the Italo-Turkish War, she was transferred to the Red Sea, where she bombarded Ottoman troops and ports and helped to enforce a blockade before returning to Italy in April 1912 for a refit. The ship continued to serve in the Red Sea during World War I and as a result, did not see action. She was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and then a training ship in early 1924, before being sold for scrap in November 1924.|$|E

5|$|The nearly {{continuous}} wars of {{the first}} three decades of the new century resulted in modernization, if not (because of the treasury limitations) enlargement, of the Commonwealth's army. The total military forces available <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few thousands at the Battle of Kircholm, to the over fifty thousands plus pospolite ruszenie mobilized for the Khotyn (Chocim) campaign of 1621. The remarkable {{during the first half of}} the 17th century development of artillery resulted in the 1650 publication in Amsterdam of the Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima book by Kazimierz Siemienowicz, a pioneer also in the science of rocketry. Despite the superior quality of the Commonwealth's heavy (hussar) and light (Cossack) cavalry, the increasing proportions of the infantry (peasant, mercenary and Cossack formations) and of the contingent of foreign troops resulted in an army, in which these respective components were heavily represented. During the reigns of the first two Vasas a war fleet was developed and fought successful naval battles (1609 against Sweden). As usual, fiscal difficulties impaired the effectiveness of the military, and the treasury's ability to pay the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth {{to enable them to}} crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf possesses greater buttressing when compared to all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that the gray wolf is better adapted for cracking bone than other canids. In comparison to extant North American gray wolves, Beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with a significantly greater number of broken teeth. The frequencies of fracture in wolves <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 2% found in the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) up to a maximum of 11% found in Beringian wolves. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row also differs, with Beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with the incisors and then cracked with the carnassials and molars. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when taking and consuming large prey.|$|E
