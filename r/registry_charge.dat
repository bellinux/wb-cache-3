50|$|The {{types of}} vessels {{that can be}} {{registered}} at a particular registry {{is dependent on the}} rules of the registry. For example, the Liberian Registry registers seagoing vessels of more than 500 net tons that conduct foreign trade. Vessels over the age of 20 require a waiver as well as the vessel's classification society being willing to issue statutory certificates to the vessel. Vessels 15 years or older must have a Status Report of the vessel's Special Survey to be reviewed by Marine Safety. <b>Registries</b> <b>charge</b> a registration fee and annual fees.|$|R
5000|$|This tactic was {{possible}} only because under the HM Land Registry regulations then {{in effect for}} England and Wales, transactions involving small plots of unregistered land were exempt from registration. The regulations have since been revised; any unregistered plot, regardless of size, must now be registered on transfer. The Land <b>Registry</b> <b>charges</b> that would be payable under the current regulations would make a similar sale of micro-plots prohibitively expensive today. Under the regulations for the Land Registries Northern Ireland small [...] "souvenir plots" [...] are still specifically excluded from registration. In Scotland, souvenir plots cannot be sold.|$|R

50|$|Un{{registered}} land in English law is {{land that}} has not been registered with HM Land Registry. Under the residual principles of English land law, for unregistered land proof of title is based upon historical title deeds and a <b>registry</b> for certain <b>charges</b> under the Land Charges Act 1972.|$|R
5000|$|Canadian brands {{had complained}} {{that they were being}} charged [...] "exorbitant" [...] prices to {{register}} their trademarks as premium names. FTC chair Edith Ramirez has written to ICANN to say the agency will take action against the [...]sucks owner if “we have reason to believe an entity has engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act”. The Register reported that intellectual property lawyers are infuriated that [...] "the dot-sucks <b>registry</b> was <b>charging</b> trademark holders $2,500 for [...]sucks domains and everyone else $10." ...|$|R

50|$|Initially, {{registration}} of new domain names and their maintenance involved no direct {{costs for the}} registrant. In 1995, the National Science Foundation authorized Network Solutions (NSI), the private company that they had mandated to maintain and operate the <b>registries,</b> to begin <b>charging</b> registrants an annual fee. Some perceived this move as unfair, given that the market was closed to competitors.|$|R

Often, names are listed on CPS Central Registries/databases (different from Sex Abuse Registries) for decades, used for employment and licensing background checks. Frequently an accusation triggers placement of a person's name on the <b>registry</b> without being <b>charged</b> or convicted of a crime, resulting in a registry with [...] "false-positives" [...] entangled with wrongdoers.

50|$|However, proving {{ownership}} {{in the absence of}} the documents was an impossibility, and forgeries of crown grants were common and difficult to detect. Moreover, it was nearly impossible to determine if land was subject to common law encumbrances (i.e. mortgages). This led to the establishment in the 18th century of land registry systems, where a central office in each county was responsible for the filing of land deeds, mortgages, liens and other evidence of ownership, transfer or encumbrance. Under land <b>registry,</b> deeds and <b>charges</b> were not recognized unless they were filed, and persons who filed were given priority over previous transactions that had not been filed. Moreover, under statutes of limitation, in certain jurisdictions only documents that had been filed in the past 40 years had to be consulted to determine the chain of ownership.|$|R
50|$|Mr Mothew was a {{solicitor}} who {{had acted}} for both borrower and lender in a mortgage transaction {{relating to the}} purchase of a residential property. It was alleged that he negligently told the building society that there was no second charge on the house when the mortgage agreement was signed. At the time of reporting to the building society and requesting its funding, unbeknown to Mr Mothew, the borrower had a relatively small bank overdraft facility limited to £2,000. After completion of the purchase and mortgage (at which time the lender's funds were applied to the transaction) but before the transactions were registered at Land Registry Mr Mothew was approached by the borrower's bankers Barclays to say that they were granting a second mortgage facility to the borrower and seeking that their second charge be registered at Land <b>Registry.</b> The second <b>charge</b> documentation had been prepared and executed by the borrower at the bank's premises. By registering the second charge documentation contemporaneously with the purchase and (first) mortgage there was a waiver of fees payable to the Land Registry thereby saving expense for the borrower than if the second charge had been registered separately later. The Cheshunt Building Society were asked by Mr Mothew to consent to registration of the second charge which they did and they were also given formal notice of the second charge which they acknowledged. Mr Mothew delayed sending the application to the registry whilst the lender's consent was being obtained since it was also required to be lodged at the Land Registry. At the time of their default the borrower's overdraft facility had risen from £2,000 to £3,350. The housing market collapsed, and the homeowners (having lost their employment in the recession) defaulted on their mortgage with the building society. To realise their money, the building society had the property sold off for £53,000 in February 1991, a considerable time after they had taken possession of it. The lender claimed that if it had known of the borrower's overdraft facility, it would not have granted its mortgage to the borrower. They sued Mothew for the sum they lent (£59,000) less the proceeds of the sale.|$|R
