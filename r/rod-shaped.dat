5|$|Anaerobic, Gram-negative <b>rod-shaped</b> bacteria, {{including}} some Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, although resistance is increasing in Bacteroides fragilis.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and <b>rod-shaped</b> molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. <b>Rod-shaped</b> molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of <b>rod-shaped</b> micelles).|$|E
5|$|These {{molecules}} are <b>rod-shaped,</b> some {{created in}} the lab and some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been discovered, both man-made: disc-shaped (created by S. Chandrasekhar's group in India, 1977) and bowl-shaped (invented by Lui Lam in China, 1982, and synthesized in Europe three years later).|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are <b>rod-shaped</b> with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} insight here is that, whilst parallel {{arrangements of}} anisotropic objects {{lead to a}} decrease in orientational entropy, there {{is an increase in}} positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of <b>rod-shaped</b> objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in <b>rod-shaped</b> or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or <b>rod-shaped,</b> called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this hole is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are <b>rod-shaped</b> and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was <b>rod-shaped</b> and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
25|$|The term Bacterium, {{introduced}} as a genus by Ehrenberg in 1838, became a catch-all for <b>rod-shaped</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Sets {{of thirty}} <b>rod-shaped</b> {{counting}} chips {{have also been}} found in association with Liubo sets from other tombs.|$|E
25|$|Bifido{{bacterium}} longum is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, <b>rod-shaped</b> bacterium {{present in}} the human gastrointestinal tract {{and one of the}} 32 species that belong to the genus Bifidobacterium.|$|E
25|$|Hypsilophodontids {{more closely}} {{resemble}} their ancestors than the heterodontosaurids do. The most distinctive features are short scapula and <b>rod-shaped</b> pre-pubic process. The earliest is Agilisaurus {{from the middle}} Jurassic of China.|$|E
25|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei (also {{known as}} Pseudomonas pseudomallei) is a Gram-negative, bipolar, aerobic, motile <b>rod-shaped</b> {{bacterium}}. It is a soil-dwelling bacterium endemic in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, particularly in Thailand and northern Australia. It infects {{humans and animals}} and causes the disease melioidosis. It is also capable of infecting plants.|$|E
25|$|Thermus aquaticus is {{generally}} of cylindrical shape with {{a diameter of}} 0.5μm to 0.8μm. The shorter rod shape has a length of 5μm to 10μm. The longer filament shape has a length that varies greatly {{and in some cases}} exceeds 200μm. The <b>rod-shaped</b> bacteria have a tendency to aggregate.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>rod-shaped</b> {{bacteria}} E. coli, Caulobacter crescentus and B. subtilis cell size {{is controlled}} by a simple mechanisms in which cell division occurs after a constant volume has been added since the previous division. By always growing by the same amount, cells born smaller or larger than average naturally converge to an average size equivalent to the amount added during each generation.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax is {{a disease}} caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming, Gram positive, <b>rod-shaped</b> {{bacterium}} (Fig. 1). The lethality of the disease {{is caused by the}} bacterium's two principal virulence factors: (i) the polyglutamic acid capsule, which is anti-phagocytic, and (ii) the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three protein components: (i) protective antigen (PA), (ii) edema factor (EF), and (iii) lethal factor (LF).|$|E
25|$|Over 50% {{of known}} plant viruses are <b>rod-shaped</b> (flexuous or rigid). The {{length of the}} {{particle}} is normally dependent on the genome but it is usually between 300–500 nm with a diameter of 15–20nm. Protein subunits can be placed around the circumference of a circle to form a disc. In {{the presence of the}} viral genome, the discs are stacked, then a tube is created with room for the nucleic acid genome in the middle.|$|E
25|$|It was the {{standard}} unit of silver coinage at most ancient Greek mints, {{and the name}} obol was used to describe a coin that was one-sixth of a drachma. The notion that drachma derived from the word for fistful was recorded by Herakleides of Pontos (387–312BC) who was informed by the priests of Heraion that Pheidon, king of Argos, dedicated <b>rod-shaped</b> obeloi to Heraion. Similar information about Pheidon's obeloi was also recorded at the Parian Chronicle.|$|E
25|$|Clostridium tetani is a <b>rod-shaped,</b> {{anaerobic}} {{species of}} pathogenic bacteria, {{of the genus}} Clostridium. Like other Clostridium genus species, it is Gram-positive, and its appearance on a gram stain resembles tennis rackets or drumsticks. C. tetani is found as spores in soil or in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. C. tetani produces a potent biological toxin, tetanospasmin, and is the causative agent of tetanus, a disease characterized by painful muscular spasms {{that can lead to}} respiratory failure and, in up to 10% of cases, death.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens (updated {{scientific}} name Rhizobium radiobacter, synonym Agrobacterium radiobacter) is the causal agent of {{crown gall disease}} (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a <b>rod-shaped,</b> Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', {{not to be confused}} with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis, confusingly also called transfer RNA), from a plasmid, into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 Hans Gerdien of the Siemens {{corporation}} {{invented a}} magnetron. In 1912, Swiss physicist Heinrich Greinacher {{was looking for}} new ways to calculate the electron mass. He settled on a system consisting of a diode with a cylindrical anode surrounding a <b>rod-shaped</b> cathode, placed {{in the middle of a}} magnet. The attempt to measure the electron mass failed because he was unable to achieve a good vacuum in the tube. However, as part of this work, Greinacher developed mathematical models of the motion of the electrons in the crossed magnetic and electric fields.|$|E
25|$|Bactofilin is a cytoskeletal {{element that}} forms {{filaments}} throughout {{the cells of}} the <b>rod-shaped</b> proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus. The bactofilin protein, BacM, is required for proper cell shape maintenance and cell wall integrity. M. xanthus cells lacking BacM have a deformed morphology characterized by a bent cell body, and bacM mutants have decreased resistance to antibiotics targeting the bacterial cell wall. M. xanthus BacM protein is cleaved from its full-length form to allow polymerization. Bactofilins have been implicated in cell shape regulation in other bacteria, including curvature of Proteus mirabilis cells, stalk formation by Caulobacter crescentus, and helical shape of Helicobacter pylori.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a <b>rod-shaped</b> metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.|$|E
25|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative, <b>rod-shaped</b> coccobacillus, non mobile with no spores. It is a facultative {{anaerobic}} organism that can infect humans via the oriental rat flea. It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Quanguo Li et al. {{determined}} the plumage coloration of Microraptor {{based on the}} new specimen BMNHC PH881, which also showed several other features previously unknown in Microraptor. By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with scanning electron microscope techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In Microraptor, these cells were shaped {{in a manner consistent}} with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These <b>rod-shaped,</b> narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much like those of a modern starling, and indicated iridescence in the plumage of Microraptor. Though the researchers state that the true function of the iridescence is yet unknown, it has been suggested that the tiny dromaeosaur was using its glossy coat as a form of communication or sexual display, much as in modern iridescent birds.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} {{families of}} liquid crystals {{are used in}} liquid crystals. The molecules used have to be anisotropic, and to exhibit mutual attraction. Polarizable <b>rod-shaped</b> molecules (biphenyls, terphenyls, etc.) are common. A common form {{is a pair of}} aromatic benzene rings, with a nonpolar moiety (pentyl, heptyl, octyl, or alkyl oxy group) on one end and polar (nitrile, halogen) on the other. Sometimes the benzene rings are separated with an acetylene group, ethylene, CH=N, CH=NO, N=N, N=NO, or ester group. In practice, eutectic mixtures of several chemicals are used, to achieve wider temperature operating range (-10..+60°C for low-end and -20..+100°C for high-performance displays). For example, the E7 mixture is composed of three biphenyls and one terphenyl: 39 wt.% of 4'-pentyl-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 24..35°C), 36 wt.% of 4'-heptyl-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 30..43°C), 16 wt.% of 4'-octoxy-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 54..80°C), and 9 wt.% of 4-pentyl-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 131..240°C).|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{diagnosed}} in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide {{to make a}} thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, <b>rod-shaped</b> kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, {{they are not the}} standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
25|$|Archaeoceti is a parvorder {{comprising}} ancient whales. These ancient {{whales are}} the predecessors of modern whales, stretching {{back to their}} first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete {{is the presence of}} visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with Ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with Protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with Basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years ago. The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, <b>rod-shaped</b> pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. In October 2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in Japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.|$|E
500|$|Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg {{introduced}} the word [...] "bacterium" [...] in 1828. In fact, his Bacterium was a genus that contained non-spore-forming <b>rod-shaped</b> bacteria, {{as opposed to}} Bacillus, a genus of spore-forming <b>rod-shaped</b> bacteria defined by Ehrenberg in 1835.|$|E
500|$|The word {{bacteria}} is {{the plural}} of the New Latin , {{which is the}} latinisation of the Greek [...] (bakterion), the diminutive of [...] (bakteria), meaning [...] "staff, cane", because {{the first ones to}} be discovered were <b>rod-shaped.</b>|$|E
500|$|E. coli is a Gram-negative, facultative {{anaerobic}} (that makes ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but {{is capable of}} switching to fermentation or anaerobic respiration if oxygen is absent) and nonsporulating bacterium. [...] Cells are typically <b>rod-shaped,</b> and are about 2.0 μm long and 0.25–1.0μm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6–0.7μm3.|$|E
500|$|Escherichia coli ( [...] ; {{also known}} as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, <b>rod-shaped,</b> {{coliform}} bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains {{are part of the}} normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. [...] The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|English-language {{writings}} have conventionally treated nemertean as [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomate bilaterians {{that are}} most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; <b>rod-shaped</b> secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora, Echiura, Sipuncula, Annelida, Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in {{the walls of the}} fluid vessels and are served by [...] "drains" [...] from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body. Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.|$|E
500|$|The layer {{covering}} the apothecia is about 30μm thick, {{and made of}} blackened (carbonized) cells measuring 5–6μm in diameter. At {{the base of the}} apothecia is carbonized supportive tissue about 5μm thick. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal cells) are unbranched, threadlike (filiform), gradually enlarge to a width of 2.0μm at the tip, and have granular contents. The thin-walled cylindrical to club-shaped asci (spore-bearing cells) are on a short stalk, and measure 70–105 by 8–10μm; each ascus contains eight ascospores. Ascospores, which measure 45–65 by 3.0μm, have a thin but distinct sheath, and lack septa (cross-walls). Pycnidia (which appear before the apothecia mature) are intraepidermal, [...] (having the shape of a double-convex lens) in cross section, 0.1–0.3mm in diameter, and covered with a dark brown layer of cells. The phialides are arranged in a basal layer, and borne on short conidiophores. They are slender and subulate (tapering to a point), lack a collarette, and measure 5–10 by 2–2.5μm. The conidia are colorless, <b>rod-shaped,</b> lack septa, and have dimensions of 4–5 by 1.0μm.|$|E
