40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{agricultural}} landscapes of the natural soil zones of the Altai Region are subjected to intense anthropogenic impact, {{and they are in}} an unstable state.

50|$|Coloration {{of a light}} mane {{and tail}} with darker body color may be created by other genetic {{mechanisms}} known as dilution genes, most {{of which can be}} detected by DNA testing. The most common is palomino, created by one copy of the cream gene acting on a chestnut coat, resulting in a gold-colored coat with a white or cream colored mane and tail. Deep gold palominos may be hard to distinguish from light chestnuts with significant expression of flaxen, but genetic tests can aid determination of color. The Champagne gene acting on a chestnut coat may also produce a horse with a gold coat and ivory mane and tail, distinguishable from palomino by freckled skin and light-colored eyes. In most cases, a chestnut with flaxen can be distinguished from other colors by the presence of some <b>reddish,</b> <b>chestnut</b> hairs in the mane or tail.|$|R

The pores {{on the underside of}} the cap are quite gill-like, and decurrent (running down the length of the stem).

40|$|Advective-dispersive {{contaminant}} transport in soils {{continues to}} be a subject of extensive studies. Transport of conservative tracers, ie non-reactive ions, is mostly affected by soil physical heterogeneity that causes differences in mobility of different parts of soil solution. Transport of reactive contaminants is affected by both physical and chemical heterogeneity. The objective {{of this study was to}} observe the effects of soil structure and flow velocity on the transport of reactive calcium and sodium ions. Undisturbed southern chernozem and <b>chestnut</b> <b>soil</b> columns were used to monitor the concurrent chloride, calcium and sodium transport in slow-flow and fast-flow breakthrough experiments. Parameters of the advective-dispersive transport were estimated by fitting the advective-dispersive equation to the reduced break-through data. At low velocities, transport seemed to occur in pores having a wide range of effective diameters. Diffusion and slow transport in fine pores caused slow effluent concentration changes at the late stages of the transport. Creating fast flow resulted in a decrease in the proportion of pore space providing the initial breakthrough and in an increase in the proportion of pore space participating in the diffusion-driven mass exchange as compared with the slow-flow transport. Transport of reactive ions was affected by the flow rates in the same way as the transport of the conservative tracers. Flow rate effects on the transport were more pronounced in the <b>chestnut</b> <b>soil</b> that had poorer structure as compared with the chernozem soil...|$|R
