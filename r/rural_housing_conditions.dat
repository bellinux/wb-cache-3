40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the rural housing problem of Bihar. The causes of housing shortage {{have been identified}} in the context of rapid population growth, low per capita income, high poverty, unemployment, limited state resources, etc. A suitable strategy and institutional mechanism to implement the objectives of National Housing and Habitat Policy, 1998, may help ameliorate <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> <b>conditions</b> in the state. This calls for creation of an institution dedicated to rural housing which would facilitate credit, subsidy, technology, formation of self-help groups and support infrastructure required for rural housing. he economy of Bihar is predominantly agrarian. The erstwhile state of T Bihar was bifurcated into Bihar and Jharkhand on November 15, 2000. Bihar has since become a primarily agriculture-dependent state. It has an area of 94, 163 sq. km. This is around 3 % of the total area of India, while its share in the total population of India is much higher. The population of Bihar according to the Census of 2001 was 8, 28, 78, 796 persons, constituting 8 % of the total population of India. Consequently, the population density of Bihar at 880 persons per sq. km. is far higher than the all-India figure, which stood at 324 per sq. km. in 2001. More than 74 million of Bihar’s people live in rural areas, representing 89. 5 per cent o...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>housing</b> land {{accounted}} for 67. 3 % of China's total construction land in 2000. While {{there are numerous}} studies analyzing the loss of arable land due to urban sprawl, less {{attention has been paid}} to the study of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land in China. This paper develops a theoretical framework for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China. It introduces a research method, which is using the spatial differentiation in regional development for compensating the deficiencies in time-series data, to analyze the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in the Transect of the Yangtse River (TYR). Detailed land-use data and socio-economic data from both research institutes and government departments were used to test the following hypothesis on <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition. We assume that <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in every region will undergo specific stages the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land will decline gradually with the development of the local economy, and the end of the transition corresponds to a new equilibrium between <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> and other construction activities. Five regional types of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change were defined according to an aggregation index used to reflect landscape patterns. The outcomes indicated that the share of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land declines gradually from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Yangtse River, i. e. from Ganzi-Yushu to Luzhou-Diqing, Enshi-Chongqing, Tongling-Yichang and to Shanghai-Chaohu. Each region is in a different phase of the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition, which corresponds to a particular socio-economic developmental level. Finally, some policy implications were discussed by applying this research to land management issues. The authors argue that there are problems in the current <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land managerial system in China, and that the Central Government needs to define uniform regulations for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> according to regional socio-economic developmental level, physical <b>conditions</b> and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition phase...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Governance and Development, 2008. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 58 - 62). Being an agro based deltaic country, Bangladesh {{is one of the}} most land-scarce countries in the world. Though the National Land Utilization Policy has emphasized `family based land ceiling for rural housing' and <b>rural</b> model <b>house</b> building, but there is virtually no land-use plan for the rural areas that comprises about 85 % 0 of the total land area. The present facilities in respect of physical infrastructure, housing, water supply, sanitation, etc., are very inadequate. Housing shortage in the country in 1991 was estimated to be 3. 1 million units, out of which 2. 15 million units were in the <b>rural</b> areas (<b>Housing</b> Census 1991, BBS). Unplanned <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> is a major problem area in our national life. Although the government has implemented a few sporadic <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> projects viz. cluster/ ideal village projects etc. in the rural areas; those are very meager as compared to the needs of the vast majority of rural people. On the other hand, the Grameen Bank and few NGOs are providing loans for <b>rural</b> <b>house</b> building that has opened a new area in the field of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> of Bangladesh. Nevertheless, they are only able to serve a limited number of the rural population. Formulation of a proper institutional and legal framework for actively participating in <b>rural</b> <b>housing,</b> which has been included in the National Housing Policy, is still not being implemented. The study is conducted to analyze the present <b>housing</b> <b>condition</b> and pattern in rural Bangladesh and to identify the trend of shrinking cultivable land through horizontal expansion of housing. The investigation also covers the importance of the land zoning system to overcome the challenge of decent housing as well as food security for the booming population. The study argues that for proper land utilization the government could introduce a land management act with a land zoning system and a ceiling for <b>housing</b> in <b>rural</b> Bangladesh, as well as strengthen the housing facilities for disadvantaged people in a planned way. The study tries to find alternative ways of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> like Compact Township (CT) / Community Housing with basic infrastructural facilities and utmost utilization of land.

In China, farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land are the two major sources of land use transition. This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal coupling characteristics of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 2000 and 2008, and the data from the Ministry of Land and Resources of China. The outcomes indicated that: (1) during 2000 - 2008, the correlation coefficient of farmland vs. <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change is - 0. 921, and it shows that the change pattern of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land is uncoordinated; (2) the result of Spearman rank correlation analysis shows that <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change has played a major role in the mutual transformation of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land; and (3) it shows a high-degree spatial coupling between farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change in southeast China during 2000 - 2008.

The objectives of this study are to (i) analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of RHLT, and (ii) detect the underlying driving forces and mechanism of RHLT in Bohai Rim during 2000 - 2010. To achieve these goals, we collected and rasterized high resolution Landsat TM data, socio-economic and physical environmental data for the Bohai Rim. Spatial econometric regression models at both grid scale and county scale were developed to examine the driving forces of RHLT in Bohai Rim. The results indicated that the distribution of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land was characterized by vertical zonality, i. e., the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land decreased gradually with the increase of elevation, and was more sensitive to slope than to elevation. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the spatial mismatch of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change and rural population migration made the regional differences of RHLT more remarkable, based on which four <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land consolidation regional types were differentiated. The authors argue that towns are effective hubs for linking the urban system and rural system, and it is better to get the farmers to migrate to towns instead of big cities in the process of pushing forward China's new-type urbanization in the future. For this, it is necessary to further improve related system and institution. Only by this way can the relationship between out-migrated farmers and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land be orderly and completely removed, so as to smoothly pushing forward <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land consolidation.
