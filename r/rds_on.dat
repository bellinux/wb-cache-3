30|$|This rule {{consists}} of two parts: a precondition (before the symbol ::) and a performance (after the symbol ::). The precondition {{consists of}} a <b>rd</b> <b>on</b> the bag States containing the logical state off and a <b>rd</b> <b>on</b> the bag Sensors of the TelosB object to detect a presence. When the lamp is off, the rule waits for a resource indicating {{a presence in the}} room. This triggers the performance. The performance {{consists of two}} transactions (between {}). The first transaction verifies if the presence is still detected (line 5), sends the command to the lamp (line 6) and updates its logical state (lines 7 and 8). LINC ensures that all the actions are done or none of them. Hence, if the put operation fails on the actuator (e.g., communication error, actuator failure), the lamp stays off in the bag States.|$|R

50|$|In 2002, the Montreal Canadiens {{announced}} {{a deal to}} license its French-language broadcast rights {{for all of its}} preseason, season, and playoff games to RDS. This was controversial as it threatened the longest-running television show in Quebec, Radio-Canada's La Soirée du hockey. Days later, an agreement was reached whereby RDS and Radio-Canada would simultaneously broadcast Canadiens games on Saturday nights, saving the show. Within the province of Quebec, this arrangement stopped after the 2003-04 NHL season, and French-language Canadiens broadcasts now air exclusively on RDS. Simulcasted coverage continued in regions that do not receive <b>RDS</b> <b>on</b> analog TV (all of Canada south/west of the Ottawa Region) on Radio-Canada until the 2006-07 NHL season. RDS also has French-language rights to the Stanley Cup Finals, regardless of what teams participate. In June 2008, RDS's parent, CTV Inc., acquired the rights to The Hockey Theme after the CBC failed to renew its rights to the theme song. A re-orchestrated version of the tune, which has been the theme song of La Soirée du hockey and Hockey Night in Canada since 1968, has been used for hockey broadcasts on RDS and TSN beginning in the fall of 2008.|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{relative}} deprivation (RD) distinguishes between personal and group RD, and links {{the two to}} personal and group identity. Models linking RD and identity suggest that identity causally precedes RD. These models are extended {{in the present study}} to allow for causal effects of <b>RD</b> <b>on</b> personal and group esteem. An experiment is reported which was designed to examine the causal effects of personal and group <b>RD</b> <b>on</b> personal self-esteem and collective self-esteem. It was predicted that experiencing personal RD would lower personal self-esteem but would not affect collective self-esteem, and, conversely, that experiencing group RD would lower collective self-esteem but would not affect personal self-esteem. The results of a 2 (sex of subject) X 2 (sex of others in group: either 3 males or 3 females) X 2 (reward condition: fair or unfair) experiment supported this prediction for personal self-esteem, but only partially supported the prediction for collective self-esteem. The implications of the results for understanding the failure of RD to translate into action, and the usefulness of the experimental paradigm for inducing personal or group RD are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} the effect of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (<b>RD)</b> <b>on</b> central hemodynamics in patients with resistant hypertension. BackgroundHigh central blood pressure (BP) increases cardiovascular events and mortality independently of peripheral BP. The effect of <b>RD</b> <b>on</b> central BP is unclear. MethodsA total of 110 patients underwent bilateral RD. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to derive central aortic pressure and hemodynamic indices at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after ablation. Ten patients with resistant hypertension not undergoing RD served as controls. ResultsRD significantly reduced mean central aortic BP from 167 / 92 mm Hg to 149 / 88 mm Hg, 147 / 85 mm Hg, and 141 / 85 mm Hg at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0. 001), respectively. Aortic pulse pressure decreased from 76. 2 ± 23. 3 mm Hg to 61. 5 ± 17. 5 mm Hg, 62. 7 ± 18. 1 mm Hg, and 54. 5 ± 15. 7 mm Hg 1, 3, and 6 months after RD (p < 0. 001), respectively. Six months after RD aortic augmentation and augmentation index were significantly reduced by − 11 mm Hg (p < 0. 001) and − 5. 3 % (p < 0. 001), respectively. Carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity showed a significant reduction from 11. 6 ± 3. 2 m/s to 9. 6 ± 3. 1 m/s at 6 months (p < 0. 001). Consistently, ejection duration and aortic systolic pressure load were significantly diminished, indicating improvement of cardiac work load by RD. No significant changes were obtained in control patients. ConclusionsBesides the known effect of <b>RD</b> <b>on</b> brachial blood pressure, the study showed {{for the first time}} that this novel approach significantly improves arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics, which might have important prognostic implications in patients with resistant hypertension at high cardiovascular risk...|$|R
40|$|Resina draconis (bright red resin {{isolated}} from Dracaena cochinchinensis, RD) has been clinically used {{for treatment of}} myocardial ischemia (MI) for many years. However, the mechanisms of its pharmacological action on MI are still poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the plasma metabolic profiles of MI and investigate the mechanisms of <b>RD</b> <b>on</b> MI using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics combined with pattern recognition methods and metabolic pathway analysis. Twenty metabolite markers characterizing metabolic profile of MI were revealed, which were mainly involved in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, vascular smooth muscle contraction, sphingolipid metabolism, and so forth. After RD treatment, however, levels of seven MI metabolite markers, including phytosphingosine, sphinganine, acetylcarnitine, cGMP, cAMP, L-tyrosine, and L-valine, were turned over, indicating that RD is likely to alleviate MI through regulating the disturbed vascular smooth muscle contraction, sphingolipid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and BCAA metabolism. To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} comprehensive study to investigate the mechanisms of RD for treating MI, from a metabolomics point of view. Our findings are very valuable {{to gain a better understanding}} of MI metabolic profiles and provide novel insights for exploring the mechanisms of <b>RD</b> <b>on</b> MI...|$|R

Tuesday games were known as Les Méchants Mardis Molson-Ex while all of the other day or night games were known as Le Hockey Subway des Canadiens (Subway Canadiens Hockey). NHL telecasts not involving the Canadiens were simply titled Le hockey Bud Light de la LNH (Bud Light NHL Hockey). Since 2014, games have been known as Le hockey des Canadiens (Bell/Coca-Cola/McDonald's). (Bell/Coca-Cola/McDonald's Canadiens Hockey). The sponsor affiliations change from time to time.|$|E

As an application, it is shown that the RDS generated by the stochastic reaction–diffusion equation possesses a finite-dimensional random attractor in Lq(D) for any q⩾ 2, a comparison result of fractal dimensions under the different Lq-norms is also obtained...|$|E

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{information on}} the behavior of organophosphates and their impact on growth of beneficial soil bacterial communities (Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas sp.). Organophosphates were applied on soil at three different doses (R. D, 2 X R. D, 10 X R. D) which had a detrimental effect on microbial population. Available information raises concerns regarding the long term effect of organophosphates. The Xanthomonas count in Chlorpyrifos treated soil was found to be (0. 00 in RD,),(0. 003 x 10 6, in 2 RD),(0. 9 x 10 6,in 10 <b>RD)</b> <b>on</b> tenth day and (0. 0, in RD), (0. 00, in 2 RD),(0. 00, in 10 <b>RD)</b> <b>on</b> fortieth day as and when compared with control (2. 1 x 10 6) on zero day, (1. 9 x 10 6) on tenth day and (3. 4 x 10 6) on fortieth day.
