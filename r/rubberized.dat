5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The <b>rubberized</b> hull of {{military}} submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, <b>rubberized</b> silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{properties}} of <b>rubberize</b> cement mortar are treated with alkaline materials and tested and compared with normal <b>rubberize</b> and normal cement mortar. The rubber, which is treated with different alkaline materials such as: (NaOH, NaOCL, and Commercial detergent powder) of high pH (13 - 14), is used as partial replacement for sand in cement mortar. The percent of replacement ranged from 15 to 35 %. Compressive strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity are also tested for <b>rubberize</b> cement mortar, <b>rubberize</b> cement mortar treated with alkaline materials, and normal cement mortar. The {{results show that the}} treatment of rubber with alkaline materials significantly improves {{the properties of}} cement mortar. Moreover the results also show that NaOCL gives better improvement more than NaOH, while commercial detergent powder shows negative effects on all cement mortar properties. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, <b>rubberized</b> keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook {{follows the}} same design first {{seen in the}} MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than {{previous}} laptops in the MacBook line. This model has an all-white fingerprint-resistant glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a multi-touch glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini DisplayPort. The bottom of the MacBook features a <b>rubberized</b> non-slip finish. The built-in battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced {{earlier in the year}} with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by Macworld, the battery was found to last only about four hours while playing video at full brightness with AirPort turned off. However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness. Gizmodo also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on. The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.|$|E
25|$|Study {{results of}} the {{long-term}} acoustic benefits of <b>rubberized</b> asphalt are inconclusive. Initial application of <b>rubberized</b> asphalt may provide 3–5 decibels (dB) reduction in tire-pavement source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 decibels (dB) in total traffic noise level reduction (due to the other components of traffic noise). Compared to traditional passive attenuating measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), <b>rubberized</b> asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic benefits at typically much greater expense.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1960s, <b>rubberized</b> asphalt {{was used}} for the first time, mixing crumb rubber from used tires with asphalt. While a {{potential}} use for tires that would otherwise fill landfills and present a fire hazard, <b>rubberized</b> asphalt has shown greater incidence of wear in freeze-thaw cycles in temperate zones due to non-homogeneous expansion and contraction with non-rubber components. The application of <b>rubberized</b> asphalt is more temperature-sensitive, and in many locations can only be applied at certain times of the year.|$|E

25|$|On metal toothed zippers, the {{cut edges}} of the <b>rubberized</b> fabric of the zipper tapes are {{susceptible}} to fraying along the exposed weave. if not trimmed, the frayed edges can accelerate damage to the weave and eventually delaminate the edge. The moulded plastic zippers {{do not have an}} exposed cut edge, so do not have this weakness.|$|E
25|$|The Bridgestone {{product line}} in {{construction}} and civil engineering materials is similarly broad. Bridgestone supply Multi-Rubber Bearings for installing in foundations to protect buildings from earthquakes, inflatable rubber dams for managing waterways (no longer manufactured – 2008), marine fenders for protecting wharves, additives for pavement, waterproofing sheet, <b>rubberized</b> ceiling and roofing materials, panel tanks for storing water, bath fixtures and residential flooring, {{air and water}} systems.|$|E
25|$|Pre-World War II Type 14s {{are well}} made, with quality {{dropping}} during wartime. Machining marks, {{a lack of}} polishing, and thin bluing became more common as wartime shortages affected quality. The later Type 14s remained quite functional despite the decreased quality. Holster quality for the Type 14 also degraded as the shortages of critical raw materials forced a change from a leather holster to <b>rubberized</b> canvas.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A <b>rubberized</b> elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|E
25|$|Galoshes, {{also known}} as dickersons, gumshoes, or overshoes, are a type of rubber boot that is slipped over shoes {{to keep them from}} getting muddy or wet. In the United States, the word galoshes may be used interchangeably with boot, {{especially}} a <b>rubberized</b> boot. In the United Kingdom, however, a galosh is an overshoe made of a weatherproof material to protect a more vulnerable shoe underneath and keep the foot warm and dry.|$|E
25|$|Roadway surface types {{contribute}} differential noise {{effects of}} up to 4 dB, with chip seal type and grooved roads being the loudest, and concrete surfaces without spacers being the quietest. Asphaltic surfaces perform intermediately relative to concrete and chip seal. <b>Rubberized</b> asphalt {{has been shown to}} give a marginal 3–5dB reduction in tire-pavement noise emissions, and a marginally discernible 1–3dB reduction in total road noise emissions when compared to conventional asphalt applications.|$|E
25|$|The Small Box Respirator {{featured}} a single-piece, close-fitting <b>rubberized</b> mask with eye-pieces. The box filter was compact {{and could be}} worn around the neck. The SBR could be readily upgraded as more effective filter technology was developed. The British-designed SBR was also adopted {{for use by the}} American Expeditionary Force. The SBR was the prized possession of the ordinary infantryman; when the British were forced to retreat during the German Spring Offensive of 1918, it was found that while some troops had discarded their rifles, hardly any had left behind their respirators.|$|E
25|$|The {{frame of}} a boom is usually {{constructed}} from aluminum or carbon fiber. It usually has {{some type of}} padding on its main beams for comfort, and also to help protect itself, the board, and the sailor during falls. A boom can usually be adjusted in length to accommodate different sized sails. The front of the boom (where it attaches to the mast) is usually blunt-shaped, and constructed of a durable plastic. It may also have some padding or <b>rubberized</b> exterior, again to minimize damage in the event it strikes the board or rider during a fall.|$|E
25|$|Practically all early {{respirators}} {{consisted of}} a bag placed completely over the head, fastened around the throat with windows through which the wearer could see. Some were rubber, some were made of <b>rubberized</b> fabric, and still others of impregnated fabric, {{but in most cases}} a tank of compressed air or a reservoir of air under slight pressure was carried by the wearer to supply the necessary breathing air. In some devices certain means were provided for the adsorption of carbon dioxide in exhaled air and the rebreathing of the same air many times; in other cases valves allowed exhalation of used air.|$|E
25|$|At a December 7, 2010, press briefing, Google {{announced}} the Chrome OS Pilot Program, a pilot experiment {{and the first}} Chromebook, the Cr-48 Chrome Notebook, a prototype, to test the Chrome OS operating system and modified hardware for it. The device had a minimal design and was all black, completely unbranded although it was made by Inventec, and had a <b>rubberized</b> coating. The device was named after Chromium-48, an unstable isotope of the metallic element Chromium, and the participants were named Cr-48 Test Pilots. Google distributed about 60,000 Cr-48 Chrome Notebooks between December 2010 and March 2011 for free to participants and in return asked for feedback such as suggestions and bug reports. The Cr-48 was intended for testing only, not retail sales.|$|E
25|$|The crash {{resulted}} in a national embarrassment, leading Captain Albert W. Stevens, the scientific observer on board the Explorer balloon, to lobby for another attempt with an improved balloon to be named Explorer II. But news of the fatal crash of a Russian stratospheric attempt in 1934 left President Gilbert H. Grosvenor of the NGS sobered by the risk. A review of the crash by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) was held between July and September, revealing that the balloon had not opened symmetrically during the ascent, which caused stresses {{that led to the}} fabric tears. A month-long delay prior to launch had allowed the <b>rubberized</b> cotton to stick together, which created the uneven expansion. The hydrogen explosion followed when the gas in the bag mixed with the oxygen in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the <b>rubberized</b> cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.|$|E
25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} <b>rubberized</b> contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, the Firetruck used as play {{equipment}} at Columbia Park {{was determined to}} not meet the Federal Safety Guidelines for preventing head and hand entrapment, and protecting children from falling off the vehicle.

500|$|Two {{different}} waterproofing {{systems were}} proposed {{to the owner}} by Harry S. Peterson Co. The first system called for a <b>rubberized</b> asphalt membrane to be applied over the non-composite concrete topping, while the second one called for no membrane, and simply controlling leaks with a polyurethane sealant. The second system reduced initial building costs by $136,000. HSP argued strongly for the second option, and convinced the owner to install the second system. The report called this system [...] "intrinsically flawed", and leaks were noticed immediately after construction.|$|E
500|$|I {{found that}} such a {{pendulum}} actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. [...] At first we tried to use a <b>rubberized</b> blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E
