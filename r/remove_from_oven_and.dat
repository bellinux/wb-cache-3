50|$|Until recently, {{the process}} largely relied on both {{trial and error}} and the {{experience}} of the operator to determine when the part should be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> when it was cool enough to be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the mold. Technology has improved in recent years, allowing the air temperature in the mold to be monitored, removing much of the guesswork from the process.|$|R
30|$|After {{completing}} the first stage, drying at atmospheric condition, samples were oven dried (60  °C). Every five minutes, hydrogels were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> weighted using the digital balance {{for half an}} hour. As expected, the oven evaporates water captured in medium pores (6 – 10  µm). The trend of weight reduction of samples versus AAm/AA mole ratio and MBA mole percentage in the oven {{was similar to that}} of atmospheric condition (Fig. S 2 a, supplementary information). However, the maximum amount and minimum amount of evaporated water were achieved for 9.65 and 2.41  mol ratios of AAm/AA, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{mixture is}} placed into a lined mold, covered, and cooked {{in a water}} bath to control the temperature, which will keep the forcemeat from separating, as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine. Pâté and terrine are {{generally}} cooked to 160°F (71°C), while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120°F (59°C). After the proper temperature is reached, the terrine is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact {{the contents of the}} terrine. It is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend.|$|R
50|$|The {{meat and}} fat are then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> left to cool. When cool, the meat can be {{transferred}} to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept {{in the refrigerator for}} up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximize preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit.|$|R

50|$|As a spekkoek {{commonly}} {{has more}} than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2. Each layer is made by pouring {{a small amount of}} batter into a baking tin, which is then put into an <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> grilled <b>from</b> above until the layer has turned golden from the heat. The tin is then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former.|$|R
30|$|Once {{the samples}} were cut and ground flat and parallel, they were washed with water to <b>remove</b> any debris <b>from</b> sample preparation. They were then {{immersed}} in distilled water under vacuum of about 100 kPa for 24  h. Samples were {{taken out of the}} water and were weighed after their surface water had been removed. The samples were then placed into a laboratory oven at 105 °C and dried until a constant mass was observed. Subsequently, they were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> held in a dessicator until further characterization was implemented. Sample lengths and diameters were measured to within 0.01  mm. The connected porosity and dry bulk density of {{the samples were}} calculated following the methods recommended by Ulusay and Hudson ([2007]).|$|R
30|$|To {{simulate}} real-life {{applications of}} MPCM in buildings, a simple mass loss analysis was conducted. Samples of microcapsules (0.5  g each sample) were weighed out and spread into labeled aluminum pans (53.5  mm in diameter). Each pan was fully covered with microcapsules {{to give a}} constant surface area. The pans were loaded onto a tray in a drying oven pre-set to 50  °C.

30|$|The HTC {{processes}} {{were performed}} in a stainless steel autoclave (Parr, USA). In a 1.2 L teflon vessel (unstirred), 60  g of dried prawn shell and 0.9  L of deionized water at room temperature were added; the system was sealed and placed into the autoclave and the system remained overnight at room temperature. After this, the system was heated up in an electric furnace at selected temperatures (180, 200, 220  °C), during a chosen processing time (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20  h). When the reaction time was reached, the autoclave was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> subsequently placed in a cold-water bath. After cooling, the solid phase was separated from liquid by vacuum filtration and subsequently dried at 80  °C to remove residual moisture. The dried HCs were stored in closed flasks placed into a desiccator until further analysis.|$|R
5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary heat-treatable steels did not exist or were in their infancy. Soft, low-carbon steel was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when soft steels were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil {{in the bottom of the}} bath. The bottom of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the need}} to {{significantly}} extend the lifetimes of weapons, and because of potential implications of environmental O-ring failure on degradation of critical internal weapon components, the authors have been working on improved methods of predicting and verifying O-ring lifetimes. In this report, they highlight the successful testing of a new predictive method for deriving more confident lifetime extrapolations. This method involves ultrasensitive oxygen consumption measurements. The material studied is an EPDM formulation use for the environmental O-ring the W 88. Conventional oven aging (155 C to 111 C) was done on compression molded sheet material; periodically, samples were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>ovens</b> <b>and</b> subjected to various measurements, including ultimate tensile elongation, density and modulus profiles. Compression stress relaxation (CSR) measurements were made at 125 C and 111 C on disc shaped samples (12. 7 mm diameter by 6 mm thick) using a Shawbury Wallace Compression Stress Relaxometer MK 2. Oxygen consumption measurements were made versus time, at temperatures ranging from 160 C to 52 C, using chromatographic quantification of the change in oxygen content caused by reaction with the EPDM material in sealed containers...|$|R
5000|$|In Argentina, the matambre is {{sometimes}} {{served as a}} steak, {{but this is not}} the typical serving method. The more common method is known as [...] "matambre relleno" [...] (stuffed, or filled matambre). The ingredients for this dish vary from province to province, but most common include whole carrots, hard-boiled eggs, and plenty of black pepper. These ingredients are then rolled up inside of the matambre sheet and sewn or pinned together to keep the rolled matambre from coming unrolled. It is then boiled in milk, or sometimes water, and roasted in the oven. After it is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> cooled, it is sliced into thin pieces of lunch meat and served in toasted French roll with mayonnaise, and sometimes Argentine chimichurri, as a condiment. In Uruguay, and to a lesser extent in Argentina, matambre is marinated in milk, baked flat in the <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> covered with the marinade, with the addition of lightly beaten eggs and cheese at the end of the cooking period. It is called [...] "matambre a la leche" [...] (matambre in milk).Another method of serving matambre is [...] "matambre a la pizza" [...] which is prepared in a similar way but instead of being rolled it is topped with pizza ingredients like tomato sauce and mozzarella.|$|R
30|$|All {{the samples}} were {{prepared}} in a Hobart mixer. The ingredients were mixed for about 4  min. The fresh geopolymer pastes were cast into standard 50  mm plastic cube moulds and compacted using a vibrating table. The specimens were subjected to heat curing. In this regard, all moulds were sealed to minimize moisture loss and placed in an oven at 70  °C for 24  h. At the end of heat curing period, the specimens were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> kept undisturbed until being cool and then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the moulds and left in the laboratory at ambient temperature until the day of testing. Compressive strength of all specimens was measured according to AS 1012.9 (2014) using a loading rate of 0.33  MPa/s. For each mix, at least three specimens were tested in order to check the variability of performance under compression. The volumetric shrinkage of pastes was determined by measuring the length of three sides of the cubes before and after heating at respective elevated temperatures. The difference in volume changes indicates the volumetric shrinkage and six specimens were {{used to measure the}} volumetric shrinkage for each series. Similar method was also used to determine the mass loss of geopolymer pastes after exposed to respective elevated temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Metallocene {{ethylene}} homopolymer, ethylene- 1 -hexene and ethylene- 1 -octadecene copolymer {{films were}} characterized and analysed during their aging in a forced draft oven at 60 degrees C and compared to commercial polymers (HDPE and LDPE). Each polymer is essentially different in its structure, and the variables {{used in the}} present Study are comonomer size and content in the main linear backbone polymer. The polymers were characterized initially using GPC, DSC, FTIR, and tensile tests. Later, at different time intervals, samples were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> characterized using FTIR and GPC in order to detect changes in chemical structure, size, and molecular weight distribution due to thermo-oxidative aging. At the end of aging, films were subjected to tensile tests to quantify the effect of time on their useful life. As a qualitative reference parameter, the carbonyl index, the ratio of the infrared absorbance of the CO stretching band at 1715 cm(- 1) and the absorbance of a reference band at 718 cm(- 1), was determined. Kinetic thermo-oxidation is related to comonomer size and content in the main backbone polymer. As comonomeF size decreases or comonomer content increases, degradation rate increases. The scission factor (S) and carbonyl index (CI) graphs of each material show a slope increase which is related to the autocatalytic rate of oxidation...|$|R
30|$|Proper quality {{assurance}} {{procedures and precautions}} were taken to ensure {{the reliability of the}} results. The samples were carefully handled to avoid any external influences that could interfere with the integrity of the sample and hence contaminate it. All glassware’s were rigorously washed with detergent, rinsed with distilled water, thoroughly rinsed with analytical grade acetone and dried overnight in an oven at 150  °C. The glassware’s were then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> allowed to cool down and stored in dust-free cabinets. Deionized water was used throughout the study. For the spectrophotometric analysis, reagent blank determinations were used to correct the instrument readings. For validation of the analytical procedure, repeated analysis of the samples against internationally certified/standard reference material (SRM- 1570) of National Institute of Standard and Technology were used. The quality of organophosphorus pesticide residues was assured through the analysis of solvent blanks, procedural matrix blanks and duplicate samples. All reagents used during the analysis were exposed to same extraction procedures and subsequently run to check for interfering substances. In the blank for each extraction procedure, no pesticide was detected. A sample of each series was analysed in duplicates. All extracts were kept frozen until quantification was done. Recalibration curves were run with each batch of samples to check that the correlation coefficient was kept around r 2  =  0.99. A fortification level of 0.01  mg/kg for soil and 0.01  µg/L for water were chosen before the analysis to evaluate the recovery of the compounds in both soil and water samples. The efficiency of the analytical methods (the extraction and clean-up methods) was determined by recoveries of an internal standard. The recoveries of internal standards ranged between 70 and 94  % for all the organophosphorus pesticide analysed. These recovery values shows that the method used is reproducible.|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} making {{chemically}} pure, single-domain magnetite crystals substantially free of structural defects has been invented as {{a byproduct of}} research into the origin of globules in a meteorite found in Antarctica and believed to have originated on Mars. The globules in the meteorite comprise layers of mixed (Mg, Fe, and Ca) carbonates, magnetite, and iron sulfides. Since {{the discovery of the}} meteorite was announced in August 1996, scientists have debated whether the globules are of biological origin or were formed from inorganic materials by processes that could have taken place on Mars. While the research that led to the present invention has not provided a definitive conclusion concerning the origin of the globules, it has shown that globules of a different but related chemically layered structure can be grown from inorganic ingredients in a multistep precipitation process. As described in more detail below, the present invention comprises the multistep precipitation process plus a subsequent heat treatment. The multistep precipitation process was demonstrated in a laboratory experiment on the growth of submicron ankerite crystals, overgrown by submicron siderite and pyrite crystals, overgrown by submicron magnesite crystals, overgrown by submicron siderite and pyrite. In each step, chloride salts of appropriate cations (Ca, Fe, and Mg) were dissolved in deoxygenated, CO 2 - saturated water. NaHCO 3 was added as a pH buffer while CO 2 was passed continuously through the solution. A 15 -mL aliquot of the resulting solution was transferred into each of several 20 mL, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) -lined hydrothermal pressure vessels. The vessels were closed in a CO 2 atmosphere, then transferred into an oven at a temperature of 150 C. After a predetermined time, the hydrothermal vessels were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> quenched in a freezer. Supernatant solutions were decanted, and carbonate precipitates were washed free of soluble salts by repeated decantations with deionized water...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Horticulture in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyThe effects of liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disk growth regulator on the growth responses of three selected fynbos species were evaluated in this study. The experiment was arranged using a block design, consisting of 270 plant samples. The experiment consisted of three fynbos species, Coleonema album, Erica verticillata and Leucospermum cordifolium. Each species was subjected to three treatments, the control with no applications, liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks (hereafter referred to as disks). The control consisted of 10 plants samples, {{for each of the}} three species, arranged is numerical order 1 - 10. The liquid Kelpak® consisted of 40 plant samples. These 40 plants were divided into 4 groups, containing 10 plants and each group having a different treatment with group 1; 300 ml, group 2; 200 ml, group 3; 100 ml and group 4; 50 ml. The disks consisted of 40 plant samples. These 40 plants were divided into 4 groups, containing 10 plants each and each group having a different treatment with group 1, 2 disks, group 2, 1 disk, group 3, ½ disk and group 4 ¼ disk. The objectives of this study were to assess the desired application of Kelpak® by analysing the physiological improvements or growth responses on of Coleonema album, Erica verticillata and Leucospermum cordifolium. Prior to planting, pre-trial measurements were recorded of each individual cutting. A standard ruler was used to measure the root length and shoot length of each plant, measurements were taken in millimetres. The weight of each plant was measured with a Radwag AS 220 /C/ 2 analytical scale in grams. Plant growth, in terms of plant height was measured on a weekly basis. Plant height was measured with a standard ruler, from the surface of the medium to the tip of the tallest leaf. Watering during the trial period was conducted, using a hand held hose with a rosehead sprayer twice a week and during the third month of the trial once a week. Each container received an average of 250 ml of water. The final week of the trial final readings of the plants was conducted. Plants were carefully harvested and their roots were rinsed with tap water. A standard ruler was used to measure the root length and shoot length of each plant. The roots and shoots were then separated with a secateurs from each other. The fresh weight of each root and shoot weighed and recorded. The combined total weight in grams was captured. The roots and shoots were placed in a manila brown paper bag and placed in a laboratory oven at 55 °C for 48 hours. The plants were then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> the dry weight of each root and shoot weighed. The combined total was also recorded. The results indicated that liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disk had an effect on the growth of fynbos species at different application rates. Liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the shoot, root growth and total weight of plants in C. album grown in 15 cm pots over an 18 week period. The liquid Kelpak® indicated higher growth rates in the initial growing stages of C. album as the liquid was immediately available to the plant. The Kelpak ® Plantit® disks had better influence on the growth over a longer period as the disk dissolved at a slower rate which eventually became available to the plant. The liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the dry root weight and post-harvest root length of E. verticillata grown in 15 cm pots over a period. The Kelpak® Plantit® disks indicated higher growth rates in the dry root weight of E. verticillata but both the liquid and the disk had a positive effect on the post-harvest root length. The results also indicated that the successful rooting of E. verticillata was attributed to rooting hormone Seradix 2 under greenhouse heating environment. Liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the wet and dry shoot weights, dry root weights and post-harvest wet and dry total plant weights of L. cordifolium grown in 15 cm pots over the growth period. The Kelpak® Plantit® disks indicated higher growth rates in the dry shoot weights of L. cordifolium but both the liquid and the disk had a significant effect on the wet shoot weight. The liquid and the disks were also responsible for the improved dry root weight. The liquid application indicated the best post-harvest wet weight but the disks improved the post-harvest dry weights. It can therefore be confirmed that organic seaweed concentrates such as Kelpak® is effective on the growth development of L. cordifolium...|$|R
