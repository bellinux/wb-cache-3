25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} {{to be open to}} the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of street grids {{and the use of}} rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs to look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.|$|E
500|$|The Billboard Social 50 is a {{popularity}} chart which ranks {{the most}} active musical artists on the world's leading social networking services. Its data, published by Billboard magazine and compiled by Next Big Sound, is based collectively on each artist's weekly additions of friends, fans and followers, along with artist website views and streaming media. Bill Werde, the former editorial director of Billboard, called the Social50 [...] "yet another step" [...] {{in the evolution of}} the magazine and an [...] "important <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> changing times". [...] The chart initially only retrieved its data from YouTube, Vevo, Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, and iLike to create its ranking, but in November 2012 was expanded to include SoundCloud and Instagram. Data from Vine and Tumblr were added to the chart in June 2015.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which environmental groups cooperate globally. The literature on international environmentalism has increasingly stressed the development of cooperative networks among environmental NGOs, the sharing of environmental information and resources, {{and the development of a}} global civil society within the environmental movement. We determine the actual extent of this global environmental network, and the implications for international environmentalism. We examine the responses of 248 environmental groups included in the 1998 Global Environmental Organizations Survey (GEOS). The <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> questions yield valuable insights into {{the extent to which}} groups cooperate nationally and internationally, and the nature of this cooperation. In addition, we provide an initial explanation for the crossnational variation in groups' <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> questions...|$|R

[...] The Los Angeles Times was harsher, calling the debut [...] "rather bland". While praising anchors Ellerbee and Gandolf, calling them [...] "refreshing [...] off-center, running against the TV mainstream, making words, not whoopee", the Times ultimately felt that [...] "Our World offers no sense of who we really were in 1969 because, typical of TV, it renders everything equal." ...|$|E

The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales gave assurance of a warm welcome for those who wished to be part of an ordinariate.
