5|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{a discrete}} densely stained structure {{found in the}} nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.|$|E

At <b>the</b> macro level we demonstrate <b>the</b> historical development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> archeological layers. Our focus is on <b>the</b> progression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant in the centraladministration. We analyze from a New Public Manage-ment perspective to identify key factors that has influenced the role. Furthermore we briefly analyze that <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant is dependant on what structure and culture exists in a given organization. At the meso level, <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil servant is analyzed in relation to their ministerial service. The challenges to the role is problematized through fundamental norms and obligations. The Christiania case exemplifies the relationship between the minister and top-executive and how the various expectations and duties conflict. Next we analyze how a politicization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil service generally is reflected. At the micro level, we analyze how the Eritrea case challenges <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minor official.
