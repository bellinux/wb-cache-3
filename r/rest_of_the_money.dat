25|$|Despite of the {{recently}} gained independence from Russia, the Russian military was still present in Helsinki but did not {{take part in the}} Civil War. The company had receivables worth of 3,000,000 marks from the Russian Navy. As it was impossible to get the payment from the local military council, Schwindt travelled to Petrograd.

Schwindt had to leave the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to Petrograd, where he made deposit agreements with the local branches of Branobel and ASEA. After this Schwindt returned to Finland through Sortavala and joined to the White Guard. ASEA paid the saved amount to Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works, but the sum saved to Branobel, over 1.1 million rubles, was lost due to the revolution.

Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E

Quinn understands Artie's motives, is short-staffed for good detectives, and out of loyalty to Artie's slain partner, whose kids will be fatherless again if Artie goes to prison, tells Artie that no charges will be filed against him. Quinn tears up the confession letter and sends Artie home to be with his wife and adoptive children.|$|R

25|$|The {{national}} and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive.

The relief work in Jammu and Kashmir was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and Jaipal Singh. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international NGOs with high pay scales.

This authority has been highly criticised for luxurious non-developmental spending and false statistics. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.|$|E

One such example involved a supergroup of Latin musicians billed as [...] "Hermanos del Tercer Mundo", or [...] "Brothers of the Third World". Among the supergroup of 62recording artists were Julio Iglesias, José Feliciano and Sérgio Mendes. Their famine relief song was recorded in the same studio as [...] "We Are the World". Half of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to USA for Africa. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was to be used for impoverished Latin American countries.

500|$|But the [...] "free floating" [...] {{hypothesis}} presented its own difficulties; it did {{not explain}} the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles {{would have had to}} wash up on the bank [...] "within a couple of years" [...] of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Ongoing investigation below). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.|$|E

40|$|Backgrand and Aims: Paper {{currencies}} {{are widely}} exchanged for receiving goods and servicesthroughout our {{country as well}} as <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>Money</b> bills are used everywhere and in allcapacities, and are being exchanged among a lot <b>of</b> people during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> their circulation.

Contaminated money bills are potentially verydangerous to <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> humans. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this research is to specify the bacterial load ofvarious types of collected bills from different regions in Iran. Method:This research is a descriptive, cross- sectional study. At first, 400 different papercurrencies from various provinces in Iran were collected. Banknotes were put into the bottlescontaining sterile water and then heated for 12 - 24 hours at <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> 37 °C. Afterwards,the banknotes were removed by a sterile forceps and the remaining solution was incubated. Theseparated microbes were identified by using microbiologic methods. Results: Data analysis revealed that 46 % of different types of paper currency were contaminatedwith Gram positive and 54 % with Gram negative bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Grampositive cocci in particular Staphylococcus aureus were the most separated bacteria, which areknown as pathogens in various diseases in human body. Conclusion: These bacteria cause serious illnesses particularly in elder people, children andspecifically immuno-deficient patients. We concluded that paper money in this study wascontaminated.
