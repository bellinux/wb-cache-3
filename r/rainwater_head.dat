50|$|The {{left-hand}} wing {{is built}} of brick and was likely constructed {{sometime in the}} early 18th century. This wing was either constructed as replacement for an earlier structure or as a major overhaul of an already existing building. A <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> possibly dates {{this section of the}} building to 1734.|$|E
50|$|The Homestead was {{originally}} known as Homeside, and {{was built for}} local tanner John Anthill between 1710 and 1736, although the only certain date is a <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> marked 1740. It is similar in style to contemporary houses in the area designed by Francis Smith of Warwick, but because of peculiar proportioning, {{it is thought that}} it is actually a copy by a more local builder.|$|E
500|$|On {{both the}} north and south faces of the {{building}} there are two <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> made of cast lead, inscribed with the initials [...] "EDS".|$|R
50|$|An {{elephant}} and castle symbol on the <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> and initials on the datestone {{suggest that}} this house was built for {{a member of the}} Corbet family, probably by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard.|$|R
50|$|It {{is evident}} that Powell was fond of {{ornamental}} <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b> On the cathedral elevation there are two <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> with arms extending five feet on either side, giving {{the appearance of a}} cross. The entrance is rather insignificant and opens into the vestibule which is paneled in dark oak timber. There are private rooms on the cathedral side and small wards on the other, which open onto a wide balcony. The nurses’ quarters are in a two storey wing of Eton House, which is just adjacent to the hospital. A children’s wing was added in 1940 by John Darnell and the design is to blend with the main hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Swaine is {{believed}} to have inherited substantial wealth through the deaths of his father and brother (also Thomas Swaine), and through his marriage in 1640 to Mary Freeman, daughter of London merchant William Freeman. Swaine added considerably to the property. Leverington Hall was passed into the hands of his only surviving son, Thomas (1645-1728), a justice of the peace. A lead <b>rainwater</b> <b>head,</b> dated 1716, contains a crest and initials [...] "T.S.E." [...] for Thomas and Elizabeth Swaine.|$|E
50|$|The {{inscription}} on the <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> {{of the hall}} indicates the hall was built in 1792. According to records the hall was raised and altered in about 1845 and in 1889-90 additions were made by Robert Evans. The square plan building is built in three storeys and features stucco, with ashlar dressings and hipped slate roofs with various coped stacks. The windows mainly have glazing bar sashes and include a Venetian window and 4 reglazed French windows. At the rear, {{north end of the}} property, is a square service building with pyramidal roof, linked by a curved corridor.|$|E
50|$|James Harington, {{the author}} of The Commonwealth of Oceana, which found little favour with Oliver Cromwell, was born in Upton Hall in 1611. He wrote the book in the nearby village of Milton Malsor. Harington's mother was Jane Samwell (or Samuell) of Upton, {{daughter}} of Sir William Samwell. The Samwells bought the hall in 1600 from the Knightley family of Fawsley who had owned the hall since 1419. Most of the hall's appearance today {{is due to the}} Samwells. However, a late medieval roof remains above the hall ceiling. The front of the hall is 17th century. Sir Thomas Samwell's initials are on a <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> dated 1748. The Hall is a Grade I listed building. There are interesting family pictures and fine plasterwork dating from 1737. Also notable is the carved roof with late medieval tombers and the ballroom. The building is not open to the public except occasionally when Northampton Borough Council organise a heritage open day, usually a weekend in September.|$|E
50|$|Low-pitched {{corrugated}} iron roofs are {{hidden from view}} behind brick parapet walls. Rainwater, collected in concealed box gutters, is discharged through the parapet walls into painted metal <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> and downpipes. Metal ladders bolted to external walls provide access to the roofs.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the core is render scored as ashlar coursing. The end verandahs are timber framed, externally clad in chamferboard, which have been further clad in fibro sheet and metal siding. The gutters have acroteria, decorative <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> and moulded soffit brackets.|$|R
50|$|It {{is evident}} that Powell was fond of {{ornamental}} <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b> On the cathedral elevation there are two <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> with arms extending five feet on either side, giving {{the appearance of a}} cross. The entrance is rather insignificant and opens into the vestibule which is paneled in dark oak timber. There are private rooms on the cathedral side and small wards on the other, which open onto a wide balcony. The nurses’ quarters are in a two storey wing of Eton House, which is just adjacent to the hospital. A children's wing was added in 1940 by John Darnell and the design is to blend with the main hospital. Although St Martin's is arguably not the most practical design for a hospital, it was mentioned that Powell made the plan to suit the elevation.|$|R
50|$|Adjoining Watson Brothers Building in Margaret Street, the Acme Engineering Works is a {{single-storeyed}} brick workshop with {{an early}} galvanised iron extension at the rear. The front freestyle facade is symmetrical around a wide central opening with flanking arched double-hung sash windows. All three {{openings in the}} front facade currently have individual canvas awnings. At each edge of the facade a pilaster extends up to the parapet. Situated on each pilaster is a downpipe whose <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> has the date 1912 cast onto it. Between the pilasters above the central opening is a plain rendered portion and above this the name HB SALES in raised lettering. The parapet has a raised centrepiece separated from the side pilasters by inverted semi-circular cut-outs. The centrepiece consists of a dentilled cornice supporting an unusual triangular pediment with a curved top, behind which a gable roof extends {{the length of the}} building. A water closet projects to one side {{at the rear of the}} brick building, behind which is the galvanised iron extension, extant by 1913.|$|E
50|$|Nos. 80-88 Heol Maengwyn. Listed Grade II in November 1990 Next to the Parliament House. Dated 1911 {{and built}} for Lord Davies of Llandinam who bought two cottages {{on the site}} in 1909. Probably {{designed}} by Frank Shayler, architect of Shrewsbury who undertook other similar work for Lord Davies. Serves as a civic building including Tourist Office.An L-plan black and white Tudor revival building. Slate roof and stone chimney stacks. Three bay front with broad bracketed gable to left. Two storey porch advanced to centre with similar gable treatment. Overhanging eaves and garlanded <b>rainwater</b> <b>head.</b> Diamond leaded glazed windows with mullions and transoms to left. Cross framed oriel window and pediment over the segmental arched entrance with boarded and studded door. Similar construction to left hand side with a three storey tower midway along with a pyramidal roof and tall weathervane. Gable immediately to right and a double jettied gable to left, carried {{to left on a}} low cylindrical column. Pointed arch doorway to tower.Inside a dog-leg staircase has a stone handrail partly carved. Some half-timbered walls. There is a stone fireplace with half round columns to ground floor.|$|E
50|$|Large fixed glass display windows (some now boarded up) in the Boundary Street shopfront take {{advantage}} of the approaching slope of Adelaide Street to feature the showroom to maximum effect. The building is also notable for the banks of windows that throw light into the showroom and workshop areas. Decorated with an applied white cement rendered panel with a dentilled cornice and a decorative central tablet, the parapet front to Boundary Street screens a double gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. Tucked within the base of the tablet, a narrow rectangular <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> and downpipes drain the central box gutter of the roof. Banks of large timber framed casement windows with fanlights run across the upper storey of the front elevation, lighting the front of the workshop/office area of the upper storey. This fenestration is enlivened with the inclusion of a number of decorative windows with a pattern of radiating lights. A cantilevered awning projects over the footpath to Boundary Street sheltering the showroom shopfronts. Two roller door entrances provide vehicle access from Boundary Street to the showrooms. The pedestrian entrance off Boundary Street is boarded up.|$|E
50|$|Ipsden House {{was built}} in the 17th century. It was remodelled in the 18th century, {{probably}} 1764 which is the date on the <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads,</b> and one wing was gothicised in 1800. In the grounds is a dovecote that the DoE dated to the 15th century but Sherwood and Pevsner consider to be 17th century.|$|R
50|$|The rear facade facing Burnett Lane is {{rendered}} brickwork lined to suggest stonework. There are four window openings, with sandstone sills, on each level. The window openings have Tudor arched heads which are emphasised by a continuous hood mould. One the rear facade one rectangular {{cast iron pipe}} and two nineteenth century <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> survive.|$|R
5000|$|The newer double-depth portion is {{constructed}} of hand-made bricks set in English garden wall bond with stone quoins. It has a doorway with a segmental quoin stone surround and either side are pairs of diamond-paned casement windows. There are three similar windows {{of different sizes}} on the first floor. The <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> are dated 1900. & ref ...|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the house is in {{limestone}}ashlar on the east facade and the rebuilt south face, while the north and west sides are in coursed Rubble masonry. The source of the limestone is likely to be from the Ancaster stone or Heydour quarries. A three storey house double pile house, with ridge roofs with stone coped gables, crowned with small knopped obelisks. Four chimney stacks in central valley between roofs, one with 3 tall angle shafts, the other 3 with tall paired angle shafts. <b>Rainwater</b> <b>head</b> or Launder box dated 1630 drains the gulley between the parallel ridges on the north side. Four southern bays of the original seven bay east front demolished in late18th century leaving three northern bays. Mullioned windows, some of which have recently been re-fenestrated, having been previously blocked with brick. Projecting moulded cornice above corbelled out bay window at third floor level above the canted or bay oriel windows of the first and second floors. A similar moulded cornice crowned with a gablet with obelisks on apex and kneelers above the windows of the two other remaining bays. Inside a billiards room with 17th. century oak fielded panelling with chamfered beam and small panelled cupboard doors flanking fireplace. The original hall has been split with the insertion an of early 18th. century bolection moulded panelled dining room and a mid-18th. century marbled panelled drawing room.|$|E
50|$|The land {{on which}} the house stands was {{acquired}} by Thomas Rigdon of Chartham in Kent when he married Anne heiress of Anthony Villiers, whose mother {{had been a member}} of the Roos family, who had lived in Dowsby for eight generations. It the passed to his son Sir William Rigdon who died in 1610. At this point the property was purchased by Richard Burrell, a citizen and grocer of London. It is not clear if Sir William had started building the hall at this time or if the hall was built for Richard Burrell. An altered <b>rainwater</b> <b>head,</b> dated 1630, might even indicte that the building could be that late. The Dowsby Hall remained in Burrell ownership into the 18th. century and passed by marriage to Thomas Foster, who sold the hall with its farmland to a Mr Green in 1798. It is thought that the hall may have been in a dilapidated state by this point. John Green appears to have had demolished the southern portion of the house and the main entrance. The house was now extensively remodeled internally and the front door moved to the north side. The house had been drastically reduced in size presumally so that it would now be suitable to use as a farmhouse. It may have been at this time or earlier that some of the windows of the house had been bricked up, presumably to avoid Window tax. John Green was succeeded by James Dunn, a successful sheep breeder and then by the Dean family who successfully exported sheep to Argentina and they gave the village its church clock and the village hall as a First World War Memorial.|$|E
50|$|The {{house at}} 1 Burnett Street {{sits on a}} compact allotment, at a corner with Omar Street, {{approximately}} 1 km from Ipswich town centre. It occupies a prominent position on a hill overlooking a wide expanse of the town. It is clearly visible at a distance when travelling along Limestone St and from {{the northern end of}} Burnett St where Ipswich Grammar School is located. There {{are a number of other}} houses on the eastern section of Burnett Street that are entered on Queensland's Heritage Register, including Idavine on the adjacent allotment and Notnel at 6 Burnett Street. Across the street, a number of timber vernacular cottages have been converted into a single restaurant.The original house of rendered and painted brick is sited in the front eastern corner of the 617 sqm lot. The render has been scored to create the illusion of large masonry blocks. Its main roof is hipped with a short-ridge and sheeted in corrugated iron. The timber verandahs face the two streets with the eastern verandah edge sitting on the fence-line and the other setback approximately 1.2m. Their roof is continuous with the main roof at a slightly reduced pitch. The upper storey's balustrading is cast iron obtained from elsewhere by the Whybirds. A number of balusters are missing, and some aluminium frieze pieces have been fitted around the lower storey. A photo taken late in the 19th century shows the original verandah edge made up of simple timber columns with capitals, carved brackets and horizontal pieces between them. One chimneystack protrudes from the main roof at the eastern end of the ridge and there is a lone acroteria decorating it. There is also a lone decorated soldered <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> fitted to the western face.|$|E
5000|$|Nikolaus Pevsner {{praises the}} [...] "pretty {{classical}} doorway". The stone doorcase, described as [...] "good" [...] by English Heritage in the listing, has Ionic columns; {{there is a}} semicircular fanlight with a pediment above. The sash windows to the front face all have stone lintels with decorative keystones. The building retains two old lead <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is sheltered by a gabled roof {{hidden from view}} behind the pediment. The roof is timber-framed and clad with corrugated metal sheeting and rests within parapet walls on all four sides. Box gutters drain to two <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> {{at each end of}} the northern elevation. A masonry chimney with moulded cornice rises through the roof on the eastern side of the building.|$|R
50|$|The lower storey of {{the rear}} facade has a central set of large loading doors. Above this are three symmetrically placed double-hung sash windows with brick sills and low arches to their heads. This facade has two <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> and {{associated}} downpipes, {{the one in the}} southern-most corner appearing to be set into the wall. The facade to the north-west has only three, small windows in it.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} of two storeys, built in red brick with a tiled roof. The valley in {{the centre of}} the pitched roofs was covered over with a flat roof in 1967. The south-facing façade of the house is of seven bays under giant arches and with a deep plinth. A {{projecting}} central pediment contains a portrait bust of Mary Wandesford. The plain brick central door frame was given a timber doorcase in 1967, with a broken pediment above containing the coat of arms of Mary Wandesford in a lozenge. The rear elevation is simpler and lacks the arched recesses and the elaborate cornice of the front. An original <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> remains, bearing the date 1739. There are gardens at the front and the rear, and originally also an orchard. Bootham School, whose grounds lie behind the house, bought the orchard in 1957 for use as tennis courts. The interior ground floor has a central corridor off the entrance hall, and a staircase {{at each end of the}} house leading to an upper corridor. The ground floor was originally flagged throughout, but most of the flagstones were removed, probably in the nineteenth century, and wooden flooring was installed along with some internal staircases. Until the 1960s each dwelling consisted of a ground-floor sitting room, with a small range for heating and cooking, and a first-floor bedroom. There were no washing or toilet facilities inside until sometime in the nineteenth or twentieth century when the residents were able to share two indoor WCs and one bath. The house was remodelled in 1967-1968 to create twelve self-contained flats, each with its own kitchen and bathroom. Four are maisonettes and retain the 19th-century internal staircase leading to the bedroom. From the beginning there was a chapel where a chaplain held a service every Wednesday and Friday. The present chaplain takes communion once a month.|$|E
50|$|Architecture of the Georgian {{period in}} Wales may be {{considered}} to start with houses such as the recently restored Llanelly House. This was built in 1714 by Sir Thomas Stepney in Llanelli. At the time Llanelli was only a village and this {{should be considered a}} Country House rather than a town house The House has its original lead downspouts which are dated 1714, but there is no evidence as to whom the architect was. It is of seven bays with sash windows and a parapet with big gadrooned urns. Similar large block-like houses continued to be built during the reigns of George I and George II. Nanteos near Aberystwyth has a foundation stone of 1739 and completion date on the <b>rainwater</b> <b>head</b> of 1757. Taliaris in Carmarthenshire is another house of this form with a facade of Bath stone. It was probably built shortly after the marriage of Richard Gywnne to Ann Rudd in 1722-3. Taliaris is by an unknown, but on stylistic grounds {{it has been suggested that}} it is the work of a Bristol or Somerset mason or architectA further example of this type of house was the early 18th-century Glanbran, Cynhordy, Carmarthenshire which is described as Palladian with Mannerist touches. There was an ornamented Venetian window and a top window with paired pilasters. It was finally demolished in 1987.Houses with the typical Palladian arrangement of a central block attached wings or flanking pavilions were built at Dyffryn Aled in Llansannan in Denbighshire and Trawscoed at Guilsfield in Montgomeryshire. Dyffryn Alyn was built to designs by Joseph Turner in 1777, and the pavilions were added in a matching design by James Wolfe. Thomas Pennant records that the house replaced an old house of the Wynne family and Dianna Wynne built a new house in a most elegant and magnificent manner, on the side of the hill opposite the antient mansion and cased it in Bath stone. The very day after the workmen had finished their work, almost the whole casing fell down: which occasioned a vast expense in the repair. The house was demolished around 1920, but Pennant provided an excellent picture of this grand house in his extra-illustrated volumes of the tour, now in the National Library of WalesA development of the Palladian style was Pengwern Place (or Hall) near Rhuddlan of 1778. This was a Mostyn family house and today is much altered from its original appearance, which is shown in its original form in an engraving in Neale's Seats of 1818. The main block is of two and a half storeys and five bays with octagonal wings in brick with stone dressings. The central pediment over three bays on a giant order of Ionic pilasters. On either side at first floor level are two Venetian Windows. An impressive composition which is already starting to show the influence of Robert AdamAn important architect who established himself at Swansea in this period was William Jernegan, (c. 1751 - 1836). He probably came to Wales as an assistant to John Johnson, in the 1770s. He was to design a number of Regency terraces in Swansea which have now largely disappeared, the Assembly Rooms of 1810 and produced plans for the Swansea Copper works. In the area around Swansea he was responsible for the Marino, which was incorporated into Singleton Abbey, the re-modelled Kilvrough in c. 1785, Stouthall, Reynollston, 1787-9, and Sketty Hall and Sketty Park House. He was responsible for the Mumbles Lighthouse in 1793. He is also thought to have been involved in the design and layout of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear of the}} {{building}} has regularly spaced multi-paned casement windows to both floors, and downpipes with pressed metal <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b> A centrally positioned free-standing two-storeyed masonry structure is located behind {{the building}}, and is linked via a covered walkway on both levels. This structure has a corrugated iron hipped roof, high level multi-paned windows, and houses toilets {{for the use of}} students to both levels. An earlier opening at the rear has been bricked-up.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{red brick}} house is Elizabethan, {{built in the}} 1580s. The house {{is very similar to}} Toseland Hall in Huntingdonshire, built about 20 years later, with an {{identical}} outline, but different details. Further additions were made in the 17th century when it was owned by the Meade family,and the <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> bear the date 1655. In the 1780s Thomas Hawkes owned Berden Hall, and in 1801 it still belonged to the Hawkes family.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{platform}} has tall sash windows, {{some of which}} have been painted out, and timber panelled doors with fanlights open from the adjoining offices and service rooms. <b>Rainwater</b> <b>heads,</b> draining the box gutter between the station building and the carriage shade, protrude into the platform area, with the downpipe inset into the station building wall. The signal box protrudes from the station building on a raised concrete base, and has sliding multi-paned windows to three sides.|$|R
50|$|The Turbot Street {{elevation}} is more {{simple but}} also has {{a high degree of}} symmetry. The corners of the parapet are stepped and scalloped and there is a central semi-circular cut-out in the centre of the parapet. There are three horizontal bands of five windows, at street level they are high level narrow horizontal windows. Two downpipes with prominent <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> are located either side of the central window and the entrance door is located off-centre beneath the second last line of windows, towards the back lane.|$|R
50|$|The {{metal clad}} roof is {{concealed}} by a stepped parapet and engaged piers form shallow decorative panels in the brickwork. The building {{is placed on}} a flush rendered plinth and the high window openings have heads and sills of concrete render. Finely detailed sheet metal <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> and downpipes are prominently placed on {{the north and south}} elevations and contribute to the verticality of the design. The western side, facing Norman Avenue, features a large steel roller shutter protected by a curved metal hood.|$|R

500|$|The {{land that}} Somerhill {{was built on}} {{originally}} formed part of the estate of South Frith, one of two deer parks in the Lowey of Tonbridge. At one time the estate covered [...] Built {{on the site of}} an earlier mansion, and designed by John Thorpe, the house was built between 1611 and 1613, dates which are to be found on the surviving leaden <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b> Somerhill was built for The 4th Earl of Clanricarde, an Anglo-Irish nobleman. The design was based on that of the Villa Valmarana, Lisiera, Italy, which was designed by Palladio.|$|R
50|$|Frieth Church {{was built}} in 1848 as a chapel of ease for Hambleden. It {{is now part of}} the parish of Hambleden with Frieth and Skirmett. Flint from the ruined wing of the Old Rectory (now Kenricks) at Hambleden was used for the new church built to the design of JP Harrison. The South aisle was added later, {{probably}} by Woodyer dated 1872 on the <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b> The church is built of flint with stone mullions and edges, and has an attractive tiled roof but no tower or turret.|$|R
50|$|The present {{house was}} built by Sir Richard Reynell (d.1633), Member of Parliament for Mitchell in Cornwall (1593) and his wife Lucy Brandon and was {{probably}} completed in about 1610, according to the date on the <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads.</b> The {{house was built}} with an E-shaped floor plan, {{which may have been}} in honour of Queen Elizabeth I, who had recently died. The grounds were originally extensive, and included the whole of what is called Decoy (so named, because wildfowl were decoyed there to extend the house's larder), as well as a deer park.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} {{designed}} by Howard Stratton Davies and built in 1933-1934 in a fifteenth century perpendicular Gothic style. It uses local materials such as Coleford red brick laid in Flemish bond, guiting stone dressings, and delabole slate for the roof. Local blacksmith Alfred Bucknell made the cast-iron <b>rainwater</b> <b>heads</b> and other ironwork. The font was a gift of the freemasons of Gloucester. The church was consecrated on the 31 March 1934 and replaced a nineteenth century corrugated iron mission church, known locally as the [...] "tin tabernacle", located nearby.|$|R
