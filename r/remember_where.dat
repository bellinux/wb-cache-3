5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, at {{his home}} in Pulaski, Virginia, Duane Barry (Steve Railsback) is {{abducted}} by aliens. Eight years later, Barry has become a violent patient in a mental institution, refusing to take his medication and insisting that the aliens are coming back for him. He attacks a security guard and steals his gun, taking head psychiatrist Dr. Hakkie hostage before escaping. Barry seeks to return to his original abduction site with Dr. Hakkie, in the hopes that the aliens will take the doctor instead when they return. But since he can't <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> the abduction site is located, Barry heads to a travel agency in Richmond and holds the three clerks hostage along with Dr. Hakkie.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} summer Whitman {{worked for}} another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn. His family {{moved back to}} West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and {{took a job at}} the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the Long-Island Star. While at the Star, Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances, and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the New-York Mirror. At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the Star and Brooklyn. He moved to New York City to work as a compositor though, in later years, Whitman could not <b>remember</b> <b>where.</b> He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district, and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837. In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in Hempstead, Long Island. Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.|$|E

Larry Eyler did not <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> or when he met Brad.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} hide food {{requires}} highly accurate spatial memories. Corvids {{have been recorded}} to recall their food's hiding place up to nine months later. It is suggested that vertical landmarks (like trees) are used to remember locations. There has also been evidence that California scrub jays, which store perishable foods, not only <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> they stored their food, but for how long. This {{has been compared to}} episodic memory, previously thought unique to humans.|$|E

25|$|Members of the corvid {{family have}} been known to watch other birds, <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> they hide their food, then return once the owner leaves. Corvids also move their food around between hiding places to avoid thievery, but only if they have {{previously}} been thieves themselves (that is, they remember previous relevant social contexts, use their own experience of having been a thief to predict the behavior of a pilferer, and can determine the safest course to protect their caches from being pilfered). Studies to assess similar cognitive abilities in apes have been inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|Short-term memory (STM) can be {{described}} as a system allowing one to temporarily store and manage information that is necessary to complete complex cognitive tasks. Tasks which employ short-term memory include learning, reasoning, and comprehension. Spatial memory is a cognitive process that enables a person to remember different locations as well as spatial relations between objects. This allows one to <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> an object is in relation to another object; for instance, allowing someone to navigate through a familiar city. Spatial memories are said to form after a person has already gathered and processed sensory information about her or his environment.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, {{the group}} {{sets out to}} {{retrieve}} the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley, which Everett earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of receiving pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it wasn't her ring, and she doesn't even <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> she put it.|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a personâ€™s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{literature}} {{it has been}} found that certain species of paridae and corvidae (such as the black-capped chickadee and the scrub jay) are able to use spatial memory to <b>remember</b> <b>where,</b> when and what type of food they have cached. Recent studies with rats and squirrels, have also suggested that they are able to use spatial memory to locate previously hidden food. Experiments using the radial maze have allowed researchers to control for a number of variables, such as the type of food hidden, the locations where the food is hidden, the retention interval, as well as any odour cues that could skew results of memory research. In particular, studies have indicated that rats have memory for where they have hidden food and what type of food they have hidden. This is shown in retrieval behaviour, such that the rats are selective in going more often to the arms of the maze where they have previously hidden preferred food than to arms with less preferred food or where no food was hidden.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound effects}} and music for Lost Luggage {{were created by}} Larry Minor. According to Runyon, the game {{was the first to}} {{integrate}} music on the 2600 as opposed to only sound effects. Salvo estimated that Lost Luggage took a total of four weeks to complete. A four-minute advertising jingle was made by Byron Parks for the game. Apollo founder Pat Roper was [...] "fishing for ad material", and Parks belonged to a sound studio which Roper also owned. The jingle was never used, and in a 2013 interview Runyon recalled that he did not [...] "know or <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> it was intended for use." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Slug (Marshall Lancaster), who {{had been}} seen {{on-screen}} dating Becky in her early appearances, returned. The two characters share a backstory, which was partially created by Lancaster and Kelly themselves. During an interview with Digital Spy Kelly spoke the impact Slug has had on Becky stating: [...] "Marshall and I have invented a whole back story between us. It's nice to <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> Becky came from and what a journey she's had. Slug was {{an important part of}} Becky's lifeâ€“ theyâ€™ve got a lot of history. They grew up together and looked out for each other." [...] The storyline progresses into Slug confessing his love for Becky. Kelly points out that Becky has been on a journey, subsequently changing, stating that [...] "Becky and Slug didn't know what love was" [...] and that she proves she has changed by rejecting his advances.|$|E
500|$|In an aside, {{the narrator}} tells {{the reader that}} the couple had great {{quantities}} of nuts because they never lost them, noting that most squirrels lose half their nuts because they cannot <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> they buried them. Silvertail is the most forgetful of squirrels in the wood, and, while trying to find his nuts, digs up another squirrel's hoard. A commotion erupts among the nutting squirrels, and, as ill luck would have it, a flock of birds fly by singing [...] "Who's bin [...] digging-up my nuts?" [...] and [...] "Little bit-a-bread and-no-cheese!" [...] One bird finds a perch in the bush where Timmy is working and continues to sing about digging up nuts. The other squirrels take notice, suspect Timmy of robbing others of their hoards, rush upon him, scratch and cuff him, chase him up a tree, and stuff him with great difficulty through the woodpecker's hole. Silvertail suggests they leave him there until he confesses.|$|E

500|$|In 1941 Holloway took a {{character}} part in Gabriel Pascal's film of Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, {{in which he}} played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including The Way Ahead (1944), This Happy Breed (1944) and The Way to the Stars (1945). [...] After the war, he played Albert Godby in Brief Encounter and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in Laurence Olivier's 1948 film of Hamlet. In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of Alec Guinness. For PathÃ© News, he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called Time To <b>Remember,</b> <b>where</b> he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942. [...] Holloway also starred {{in a series of}} films for Ealing Studios, beginning with Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder. After that he made Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948). [...] He next appeared in three of the most famous Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953).|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of backing tracks {{on the first}} three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. The studio {{was one of the}} first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands-on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it [...] "was the logical place to start," [...] with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head to <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> he was, but [...] "if I would screw up, then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that I had made, because it was easier than going back and fixing it." [...] In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result [...] "sound like a band". He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that [...] "people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact." [...] Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was [...] "mostly working in the dark", and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. [...] "I was never sure exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} mini-studio, the attic {{contained}} two other rooms: a small guest bedroom and a games room used for recreation. Lennon {{filled it with}} three full sets of the model car racing game, Scalextric. When not in the attic, Lennon could usually {{be found in the}} sunroom watching television or reading newspapers. He would also walk in the garden with his black cat on his shoulder (he had ten cats in total). His drug intake, particularly LSD and hashish, but also amphetamine, was high for much of the time he lived at Kenwood. Drugs were taken there in the company of people such as Marianne Faithfull's ex-husband John Dunbar and art dealer Robert Fraser. At one stage, under the influence of transcendental meditation, Lennon renounced both meat-eating and drugs, and buried a huge quantity of LSD in the garden, which had been obtained by representatives of The Beatles at the Monterey Pop Festival from Augustus Stanley Owsley III. He later tried to find the LSD, but could not <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> he had buried it. Although none [...] of the lavish parties they had planned took place - which remained a source of disappointment to Cynthia - various guests (including Monkee Michael Nesmith and his wife Phyllis, Bob Dylan and Peter Cook) stayed or dined at the house, together with old friends like Ivan Vaughan and Shotton from Liverpool, or strangers Lennon had met at a party or nightclub, such as the Ad Lib. Cynthia and Lennon were beginning to lead separate lives by 1967, and it was not uncommon for Cynthia to {{wake up in the morning}} to find the house filled with people in various states of intoxication whom Lennon had met in clubs the night before. Large parts of the house were unused by the Lennons, and visitors remarked that there was frequently a strange atmosphere.|$|E
