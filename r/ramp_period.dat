Description of Fix: Currently, the CMSC portion of the GCG calculation is determined using a proration of Minimum Loading Point (MLP) vs. Allocated Quantity of Energy Injected (AQEI). The approach to calculating this portion of the GCG revenue is being revised to reflect only the CMSC associated with AQEI up to the minimum loading point as previously discussed with stakeholders.

40|$|Abstract—Dielectric {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to analyze Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) or lesser grain borer for microwave heat treatment to Malaysian paddy MR 219. The temperature dependency of the dielectric properties of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) and Malaysian paddy MR 219 were analyzed for the frequency range of 200 MHz – 20 GHz and for the temperature range of 24 0 C – 65 0 C. Four excited temperature points, i. e., 34 0 C, 40 0 C, 48 0 C and 55 0 C showed that these temperature points can absorb more microwave energy, thereby increasing the interior temperature of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) significantly. Predictive model was developed to make relationship between the dielectric properties and related factors (i. e., temperature and frequency). At high temperature, the complex organic constituents of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) were determined to be dielectrically inert. General equations that utilized frequency and temperature were developed to describe the dielectric properties of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). Effects of <b>ramp</b> <b>period</b> and holding time to achieve higher mortality were analyzed. Observation results were analyzed to reach 100 % mortality of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we studied both direct and {{indirect}} impacts of wind energy generation on fossil fueled generator emission rates within the same interconnected region. Specifically, we {{examine the relationship between}} increased levels of wind energy generation and emissions per unit of electricity produced using historical data for electricity output and CO 2, SO 2 and NOx emissions in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Using EPA’s Clean Air Markets hourly emissions data, we calculate the total combustion emissions of CO 2, SO 2 and NOx per MWh of electricity output for the ERCOT system from 2008 – 2011. The EPA database includes CO 2, SO 2 and NOx emissions reported by facility owner and operators on an hourly basis in a manner that incorporates facility inefficiencies during <b>ramping</b> <b>periods,</b> allowing us to fully evaluate the emissions reductions achieved in ERCOT as a result of increased wind generation.

The insects were heated to four temperatures (461 C, 481 C, 501 C, and 521 C) held for predetermined periods followed by 24 h storage at 41 C before mortality evaluation. Thermal death kinetics for fifth-instar codling moths followed a 0. 5 th order of kinetic reaction. Minimum time required to achieve 100 % mortality of a given population decreased with temperature in a semi-logarithmic manner. No larval survival was observed in samples of 600 insects after exposure to 461 C, 481 C, 501 C, and 521 C for 50, 15, 5, and 2 min, respectively. Activation energy for thermal kill of fifth-instar codling moths at the heating rate of 181 Cmin 1 was estimated to be about 472 kJmol 1.

These challenges include: Smoothing intra-hour variability; - Absorbing excess renewable energy during over-generation periods; - Addressing morning and evening <b>ramping</b> <b>periods.</b> In addition, there are technical challenges to integrating retail demand response (DR) triggered by the wholesale conditions into the CAISO markets. The study describes the DR programs available to the consumers through the utilities in California and CAISO's ancillary services market because an integration of the wholesale and retail DR requires an understanding of these different offerings and {{the costs associated with}} acquiring them. Demand-side active and passive storage systems are proposed as technologies that may be used to mitigate the effects of intermittence due to renewable generation. Commercial building technologies as well as industrial facilities with storage capability are identified as targets for the field tests. Two systems used for ancillary services communications are identified as providing the triggers for DR enablement. Through the field tests, issues related to communication, automation and flexibility of demand-side resources will be explored and the performance of technologies that participate in the field tests will be evaluated.

40|$|Stress rupture is {{a failure}} {{mechanism}} where failures can occur {{after a period of}} time, even though the material has seen no increase in load. Carbon/epoxy composite materials have demonstrated the stress rupture failure mechanism. In a previous work, a model was proposed for stress rupture of composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) and similar composite structures based on strength degradation. However, the original model was limited to constant load periods (holds) at constant load. The model was expanded in this paper to address arbitrary loading histories and specifically the inclusions of ramp loadings up to holds and back down. The broadening of the model allows for failures on loading to be treated as any other failure that may occur during testing instead of having to be treated as a special case. The inclusion of ramps can also influence the length of the "safe period" following proof loading that was previously predicted by the model. No stress rupture failures are predicted in a safe period because time is required for strength to decay from above the proof level to the lower level of loading. Although the model can predict failures during the <b>ramp</b> <b>periods,</b> no closed-form solution for the failure times could be derived. Therefore, two suggested solution techniques were proposed. Finally, the model was used to design an experiment that could detect the difference between the strength decay model and a commonly used model for stress rupture. Although these types of models are necessary to help guide experiments for stress rupture, only experimental evidence will determine how well the model may predict actual material response. If the model can be shown to be accurate, current proof loading requirements may result in predicted safe periods as long as 10 (13) years. COPVs design requirements for stress rupture may then be relaxed, allowing more efficient designs, while still maintaining an acceptable level of safety...|$|R
40|$|For {{short-lived}} climate forcers (SLCFs), {{the impact}} of emissions depends on where and when the emissions take place. Comprehensive new calculations of various emission metrics for SLCFs are presented based on radiative forcing (RF) values calculated in four different (chemical-transport or coupled chemistry–climate) models. We distinguish between emissions during summer (May–October) and winter (November–April) for emissions in Europe and East Asia, {{as well as from}} the global shipping sector and global emissions. The species included in this study are aerosols and aerosol precursors (BC, OC, SO 2, NH 3), as well as ozone precursors (NO x, CO, VOCs), which also influence aerosols to a lesser degree. Emission metrics for global climate responses of these emissions, as well as for CH 4, have been calculated using global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP), based on dedicated RF simulations by four global models. The emission metrics include indirect cloud effects of aerosols and the semi-direct forcing for BC. In addition to the standard emission metrics for pulse and sustained emissions, we have also calculated a new emission metric designed for an emission profile consisting of a <b>ramping</b> <b>period</b> of 15 years followed by sustained emissions, which is more appropriate for a gradual implementation of mitigation policies. For the aerosols, the emission metric values are larger in magnitude for emissions in Europe than East Asia and for summer than winter. A variation is also observed for the ozone precursors, with largest values for emissions in East Asia and winter for CO and in Europe and summer for VOCs. In general, the variations between the emission metrics derived from different models are larger than the variations between regions and seasons, but the regional and seasonal variations for the best estimate also hold for most of the models individually. Further, the estimated climate impact of an illustrative mitigation policy package is robust even when accounting for the fact that the magnitude of emission metrics for different species in a given model is correlated. For the ramping emission metrics, the values are generally larger than for pulse or sustained emissions, which holds for all SLCFs. For SLCFs mitigation policies, the dependency of metric values on the region and season of emission should be considered...|$|R

The frequent revision of production capacities {{and the capacity}} loss during this period increase the importance of ramp up duration in evaluating capacity investments. This thesis aims to explore how a firm should optimally allocate its capacity investments among different manufacturing systems considering the capacity evolution in <b>ramp</b> up <b>period.</b> The proposed models in this thesis address a production facility making products that has a specific life cycle pattern. In this study, the duration of reconfiguration period for reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) is modeled {{as a function of}} the amount of capacity change. Through a sensitivity analysis, the impact of reconfiguration on the selection of manufacturing systems has been analyzed with respect to different product life cycle patterns. Through a mixed integer programming model, a various ramp up time patterns are taken into account and a more suitable reconfiguration type for a manufacturer in terms of system layout and response range is analyzed. Finally, the response time of a system is considered in the context of a supply chain network to improve the supply chain responsiveness. The appropriate response speed is selected through a decision tree analysis and based on the expected cost of the supply chain. The results show a faster response speed is a better choice as the failure probability of main supply node increases and/or the recovery of the main supply node decreases. ...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{realization}} of the Vernier spectroscopy setup has five basic components: a frequency comb, a scannable high finesse optical cavity, a diffraction grating, rotating mirror, and a CCD camera. The trace gas to be measured is put between the mirrors of the optical cavity to allow for optical path enhancement. The frequency comb is coupled into the resonator and made to form a Vernier ratio with the response function. The output of the cavity is reflected off a diffraction grating, providing angular separation of the frequency components of the beam. The diffracted beam is then reflected off the rotatable mirror and then focused onto the CCD camera. Three things must then happen in synchronization. The optical cavity scans through a free spectral range of the cavity while the rotating mirror simultaneously scans the direction perpendicular to the diffraction grating's diffraction plane. These two actions can be synchronized {{by means of a}} periodic ramp voltage which controls both the cavity scan (accomplished by a piezoelectric actuator) and mirror rotation (controlled by a stepper motor). If the CCD camera's exposure time is also set equal to the <b>ramp</b> voltage <b>period,</b> the resulting CCD image is a two dimensional matrix of approximately Gaussian peaks. In this manner, an entire spectrum is produced in the <b>period</b> of the <b>ramp</b> voltage. The time it takes to obtain a spectrum is limited by the cavity scan time, rotating mirror response, and minimum camera exposure time. This particular Vernier spectroscopy scheme is capable of producing an absorption spectrum of a trace gas (<1 ppmV) {{with tens of thousands of}} data points in less than a second.|$|R

40|$|Greater {{information}} about subcontractors helping {{to deliver the}} National Broadband Network is required as costs soar to $ 1. 4 billion, writes Charis Palmer The Conversation. NBN Co yesterday released its Corporate Plan for 2012 - 2015, and reaffirmed its commitment to the underlying business case for the network, which it says will deliver a 7. 1 % annual internal rate of return. However the project continues to be delayed, with an additional six months now added to the ten-year construction period. Construction activity is set to peak in 2015, with construction commenced or completed for 3. 5 million premises, {{but by the end}} of June this year construction had only occurred at 305, 000 premises. NBN Co continues to be criticised for the “glacial” pace of the rollout, said Dr Mark Gregory, Senior Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering at RMIT University. “There’s been no massive windup to actually doing the rollout. It would be like the Snowy Mountains Scheme trying to build the whole thing with 1, 000 people. ” Dr Gregory said more scrutiny should be placed on the role of subcontractors doing the fibre installations. “With the Snowy Mountains Scheme people could see the total number of people hired by the Snowy Mountains Scheme and feet on the ground,” Dr Gregory said. “The revised plan provides guidance that the fibre rollout has been delayed and projections are provided that indicate the <b>ramp</b> up <b>period</b> extends through to 2015. “The rate of this <b>ramp</b> up <b>period</b> appears to be very slow prior to 2015 and then the rate of installation is projected to be the no better than the cable rollout that occurred nearly 20 years ago. ” Dr Gregory said it was in the interests of subcontractors to see the project take as long as possible, but that given the project was being seen as a “nation building exercise,” effort should be being made to try to significantly beat the rollout targets. “I would have expected every effort to be made to get the fibre rollout done in record time. ” Utilising subcontractors for the fibre rollout meant there is insufficient transparency about the rate of the rollout, Dr Gregory said. “The projections are heavily back loaded to 2015 so it is possible the rollout could be significantly behind schedule and there would be no way for the public to know this until mid- 2016. ” Dr Gregory also said Australians should be able to see on a map, in real time, every street in Australia as it becomes active on the network. “Active” is where the premise could have a NBN service within a couple of days after signing up with a retail service provider. “This would be great transparency that would allow us to measure the rate of the rollout and to experience it happening,” Dr Gregory said. On the issue of the cost blowout, which amounts to 3. 9 % of the project, University of New South Wales economist Tim Harcourt was unsurprised. “I would expect that with quite a large project you’d have a 3 % increase, that’s quite possible,” Mr Harcourt said. Mr Harcourt said the cost and time blowouts needed to be considered in the context of the entire project. “You make these investments, the roll out seems to take a long time, but then when you look at the benefits over several decades it’s a blink of an eye isn’t it? “What were the benefits of the float of the dollar? Well we saw them in the GFC and that was, what, 25 years after?” Mr Harcourt said the biggest problem he could see for the project was the speed of technology advancement. “Does technology move so fast, does something knock it off and make it obsolete in five years?” This article was originally published at The Conversation.

In the present realization of adaptive DBS we record and stimulate from the DBS electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease in the early post-operative period. Local field potentials are analogue filtered between 3 and 47 Hz before being passed to a data acquisition unit where they are digitally filtered again around the patient specific beta peak, rectified and smoothed to give an online reading of the beta amplitude. A threshold for beta amplitude is set heuristically, which, if crossed, passes a trigger signal to the stimulator.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to obtain {{fundamental}} process-property relationships for the SiGe epitaxial growth and from such knowledge to assemble a tubular hot-wall low pressure chemical vapor deposition system capable of producing selective epitaxial SiGe films. This is the very first report of such an attempt by any research group to produce epitaxial SiGe films using this type of reactor configuration. This reactor is proposed to be a low cost alternative for producing epitaxial SiGe films. The study consists of three milestones. First of all, thermodynamic analyses of the reaction system were conducted through which a fundamental understanding of the process was gained. The amount of oxygen that the system can tolerate for SiO 2 (s) - and GeO 2 (s) -free film growth was examined. Also the optimal chlorine concentration to achieve growth selectivity was investigated. Secondly, process improvements were implemented through such an understanding. Three major improvements proved to be essential for the success of the project: a two-step hydrogen bake to eliminate the germanium outgassing problem, selective growth of a Si buffer layer to obtain a clean surface for epitaxial SiGe growth, and use of a small flow of dichlorosilane for the suppression of oxide formation during the temperature <b>ramp</b> down <b>period</b> prior to the SiGe growth. Growth results from this system are presented and discussed in the context of several aspects such as growth selectivity, film thickness uniformity, system contamination level, electrical properties, and defect density. ^ Finally, modeling and simulations of this system are presented on relating processing conditions to the film growth rate. The model is shown to be capable of simulating other microelectronic processes as well. Relevant to this subject, a study of the oxide regrowth on SiGe surfaces after a chemical clean was done. This was to understand different aspects of the passivation of Si and SiGe surfaces. This study incorporated several surface sensitive techniques like ellipsometry, contact angle measurements, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor the change of the SiGe surface upon oxide regrowth after a chemical clean.

We demonstrated previously that haploinsufficieny for each of these genes led to reduced maternal fertility, and that even a modest genetic reduction of AM peptide caused maternal defects in implantation, placentation, and fetal growth. Here, we further demonstrate that Adm+/− female mice displayed reduced pregnancy success rates that were not caused by defects in folliculogenesis, ovulation, or fertilization. The poor fertility of Adm+/− female mice could not be rescued by transfer of wild-type blastocysts, which suggested an underlying defect in uterine receptivity.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is usually}} very {{difficult}} to identify and quantify the relative influence of tectonics, eustasy and climateon carbonate system evolution from sedimentary records. In order to improve our understanding of these mechanisms, we have traced for the first time, {{the evolution of the}} eastern Paris Basin platform throughout the entire Jurassic period. This carbonate platform underwent eight successive growth and demise phases, with different depositional profiles ranging from ramps to flat-topped geometries. The eight carbonate growth periods are compared with the standard sea-level curves, local tectonic regimes and recently published oxygen-isotope and/or clay mineralogy databases. Prograding heterozoan facies along <b>ramp</b> profiles mark <b>periods</b> dominated by second-order eustatic sea-level rise, relatively cool sea surface temperatures, and mesotrophic and humid conditions (Hettangian, Pliensbachian, late Oxfordian, Tithonian). During these periods, variable detrital contents in the sedimentary succession hampered the efficiency of shallow-marine carbonate factories. Higher sea surface temperatures, oligotrophic and humid conditions associated with either eustatic sea-level rise or very high local subsidence occurred during the early Bajocian and the mid-Oxfordian. These seawater properties seem to have favoured the aggradation of scleractinian corals forming dome-shaped bioherm buildups. An oolitic and lime-mud carbonate system, deposited during the Bathonian second-order eustatic sea-level fall, is characterised by miliolid-rich micritic facies on a rimmed-ramp under stable, cooler and drier conditions. The secondorder maximum flooding associated with a sea surface temperature decline and/or a seawater eutrophication caused at least five carbonate demise periods (i. e. Toarcian, earliest late Bajocian, Callovian/ Oxfordian transition, earliest late Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} an {{appendix}} to the Hawaii WindHUI {{efforts to develop}} and operationalize short-term wind forecasting and wind ramp event forecasting capabilities. The report summarizes the WindNET Phase 1 efforts on the Big Island of Hawaii and includes descriptions of modeling methodologies, use of field validation data, results and recommendations. The objective of the WindNET project {{was to investigate the}} improvement that could be obtained in short-term wind power forecasting for wind generation facilities operating on the island grids operated by Hawaiian Electric Companies through the use of atmospheric sensors deployed at targeted locations. WindNET is envisioned as a multiphase project that will address the short-term wind forecasting issues of all of the wind generation facilities on the all of the Hawaiian Electric Companies' island grid systems. The first phase of the WindNET effort (referred to as WindNET- 1) was focused on the wind generation facilities on the Big Island of Hawaii. With complex terrain and marine environment, emphasis was on improving the 0 to 6 hour forecasts of wind power <b>ramps</b> and <b>periods</b> of wind variability, with a particular interest in the intra-hour (0 - 1 hour) look-ahead period. The WindNET project was built upon a foundation that was constructed with the results from a previously completed observation targeting study for the Big Island that was conducted as part of a project supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and interactions with the western utilities. The observational targeting study provided guidance on which variables to measure and at what locations to get the most improvement in forecast performance at a target forecast site. The recommendations of the observation targeting study were based on the application two techniques: (1) an objective method called ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) (Ancell and Hakim, 2007; Torn and Hakim, 2008; Zack et al, 2010); and (2) a subjective method based on a diagnostic analysis of large ramp events. The analysis was completed for both the wind farm on the southern tip of the Big Island and on the northern tip of the island. The WindNET project was designed to also deploy sensors to validate the Big Island observational targeting study and enhance operator's understanding of predominate causes of wind variability conditions at the wind facilities. Compromises had to be made with the results from the observation targeting study to accommodate project resource limitations, availability of suitable sites, and other factors. To focus efforts, field sensor deployment activities focused on the wind facility on the southern point of Big Island...|$|R
40|$|Equations {{based on}} surface renewal (SR) {{analysis}} {{to estimate the}} sensible heat flux (H) require as input the mean <b>ramp</b> amplitude and <b>period</b> observed in the ramp-like pattern of the air temperature measured at high frequency. A SR-based method to estimate sensible heat flux (HSR-LST) requiring only low-frequency measurements of the air temperature, horizontal mean wind speed, and land-surface temperature as input was derived and tested under unstable conditions over a heterogeneous canopy (olive grove). HSR-LST assumes that the mean ramp amplitude can be inferred from the difference between land-surface temperature and mean air temperature through a linear relationship and that the ramp frequency is related to a wind shear scale characteristic of the canopy flow. The land-surface temperature was retrieved by integrating in situ sensing measures of thermal infrared energy emitted by the surface. The performance of HSR-LST was analyzed against flux tower measurements collected at two heights (close to and well above the canopy top). Crucial parameters involved in HSR-LST, which define the above mentioned linear relationship, were explained using the canopy height and the land surface temperature observed at sunrise and sunset. Although the olive grove can behave as either an isothermal or anisothermal surface, HSR-LST performed close to H measured using the eddy covariance and the Bowen ratio energy balance methods. Root mean square differences between HSR-LST and measured H were of about 55 W m− 2. Thus, by using multitemporal thermal acquisitions, HSR-LST appears to bypass inconsistency between land surface temperature and the mean aerodynamic temperature. The one-source bulk transfer formulation for estimating H performed reliable after calibration against the eddy covariance method. After calibration, the latter performed similar to the proposed SR-LST method...|$|R
40|$|Two {{critical}} assemblies {{have been}} characterized at the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF) {{for use in}} testing nuclear accident dosimeters and related devices. These device, Godiva IV and SHEBA II, have very different characteristics in both operation and emitted neutron energy spectra. The Godiva assembly is a bare metal fast burst device with a hard spectrum. This spectrum can be modified by use of several shields including steel, concrete, and plexiglas. The modified spectra vary in both average neutron energy and in the specific distribution of the neutron energies in the intermediate energy range. This makes for a very favorable test arrangement as the response ratios between different activation foils used in accident dosimeters are significantly altered such as the ratio between gold, copper, and sulfur elements. The SHEBA device is a solution assembly which has both a slow <b>ramp</b> and decay <b>period</b> and a much softer spectrum. The uncertainly introduced in the response of fast decay foils such as indium can therefore be evaluated into the test results. The neutron energy spectrum for each configuration was measured during low power operations with a multisphere system. These measurements were extended to high dose pulsed operation by use of TLDs moderated TLDs, and special activation techniques. The assemblies {{were used in the}} testing of several accident dosimetry devices in studies modeled after the Nuclear Accident Dosimetry Studies that were conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for about 25 years using the Health Physics Research Reactor. It is our intention to conduct these studies approximately annually for the evaluation of the nuclear accident dosimeter systems currently in use within the DOE, alternative systems used internationally, and new dosimeter designs being developed or considered for field application. Participation in selected studies will be open to all participants...|$|R

To date, the major accomplishments of this project include (i) {{the development of a}} complete procedure for constructing and calibrating a microscopic freeway traffic model using the Vissim microsimulator, which was applied successfully to the full I- 210 test site, (ii) a simulation study, using the calibrated Vissim I- 210 model, comparing the fixed-rate, Percent Occupancy, and Alinea local ramp metering schemes, which showed that Alinea can improve freeway conditions when mainline occupancies are measured upstream of the on-ramp (as on I- 210 and most California freeways), as well as when occupancy sensors are downstream of the on-ramp, (iii) development of computationally efficient macroscopic freeway traffic models, the Modified Cell Transmission Model (MCTM) and Switching-Mode Model (SMM), validation of these models on a 2 -mile segment of I- 210, and determination of observability and controllability properties of the SMM modes, (iv) design of a semi-automated method for calibrating the parameters of the MCTM and SMM, which, when applied to an MCTM representation of the full I- 210 segment, was able to reproduce the approximate behavior of traffic congestion, yielding about 2 % average error in the predicted Total Travel Time (TTT), and (v) development of a new technique for generating optimal coordinated ramp metering plans, which minimizes a TTT-like objective function.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY One Line Pitch: A {{boutique}} {{paint and}} textile retailer selling an edited palette of paints and a unique line of textiles to customers having {{a penchant for}} locally produced, environmentally friendly products for the well lived and well loved home. Business Summary: We offer professional architectural color consulting services, specifying our own tested and edited palette of premium paint colors. Our line of paints coordinates directly to a line of modern textiles, screen-­‐printed locally in Portland, Oregon. The paints are sold by the quart or gallon and the textiles are sold by the yard in our Pearl District retail location. Look out for our tote bags, pillows and other textiles for the table as well. Product/Services: Bolt and Brush will offer professional, architectural color consulting services and a premium line of environmentally friendly paints for retail sale. A line of textiles, designed and screen-­‐printed locally, will also be sold by the yard. Other ancillary products made from the same yardage sold in the store like tote bags, pillows and textiles for the dining table will also be made locally and sold both online and in retail stores. Target Market: Bolt and Brush’s targeted customer, both male and female, is design savvy with a strong appreciation for locally produced goods that are also environmentally friendly. Typically these consumers have at least some level of higher education. They {{are in the middle}} to upper middle class income range and despite the economic downturn; these customers are still financially capable of make purchases for premium goods and services. Management: Sarah Miller, Founder and sole employee, having color and textile design experience in multiple industries, a BFA in Textile Design and the near completion of an MBA. Sarah’s natural inclination is towards the arts and design, but steadfast persistence in the practicalities of opening a business makes her a likely candidate for entrepreneurial success in the design field. Sales/Marketing Strategy: Bolt 2 ̆ 6 Brush’s marketing strategy focuses initially on local support, i. e. newspaper and magazine write-­‐ups, radio spots, and word of mouth from satisfied customers of the color consultation process. The company will gain needed brand awareness nationally with a strong on-­‐line presence and personality that taps into the design-­‐centric community. Financial Strategy: We have established a three-­‐year <b>ramp</b> up <b>period</b> of developing brand recognition in the online design community using guerilla-­‐marketing tactics. At the end of the three-­‐year period, once the strength of the brand has been established, we will invest in the overhead of a retail storefront, which will allow for additional avenues for growth. Risk Assessment: The risk involved lies mostly on Sarah Miller and her spouse. 50, 000 in seed money is from their personal funds and Sarah would be compromising other career opportunities by focusing her creative energies on growing the business. The risk of failure, otherwise, at this stage is minimal and will affect few. The worst-­‐case scenario would be that customers would not respond to the patterns and colors brought to market. If this occurred, Sarah would shift the focus of her business and reevaluate the company’s direction...|$|R
40|$|A window target {{unit for}} a LBE cooled primary core {{is one of}} the basic options {{considered}} in the framework of the Preliminary Design Study of eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (PDS-XADS). In the present work, thermal hydraulic analysis has been performed for this option focusing on the window cooling. At first system analysis has been performed for the entire target unit using the one-dimensional system code, HERETA. Then Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has been carried out for lower part of the target to study the cooling capability of the window. The CFX 5. 6 code has been applied using an advanced turbulence model, called Sheer Stress Transport (SST) model, combined with the advanced wall treatment available in the new CFX 5 version. The results of the HERETA calculations show that a stable natural circulation flow, with a steady state flow rate of 192 kg/s, is established. No temperature peak is observed by a start up procedure with beam <b>ramp</b> having a <b>period</b> of 200 s. It is found, however, a start up procedure with beam jump has to be avoided to prevent the overheating of the window. Based on the results of CFX 5. 6 calculations, the window thickness is reduced to 2 mm in the center from the initial proposal of 3 mm in order to satisfy the thermal design limit. The maximum temperature change rate of the window under beam trips is predicted as high as 412 C/s after 0. 1 s of the beam interrupt. It is judged that beam trips with a beam interrupt duration less than 1 s could also be crucial to the integrity of the window. Finally, three postulated accidents (i. e., beam focusing, loss of heat sink, and unexpected beam jump) have been analyzed to find out the time for the beam to be switched off in order to avoid window failure. The present results show that window failure occurs in 0. 1 #propor to# 0. 8 second after the start of the beam focusing and in about 200 seconds after loss of heat sink. However, window failure is not expected for a beam jump scenario during normal operation period with full reactor power. (orig.)

40|$|The {{introduction}} of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the transportation system will provide both {{opportunities and challenges}} for those who own the vehicles and power systems operators. The opportunities {{come in the form}} of the ability to provide vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) services including peak load reduction and frequency regulation. Utilizing these services can provide profits for the vehicle owners, cost savings for the grid operators, and reduced air pollution. The primary goal of this study is to analyze these benefits from the viewpoint of the individual vehicle owner. It is found that there is little financial incentive when V 2 G services are used for peak reduction. There is much greater potential for financial return when V 2 G services are used to provide frequency regulation, likely enough to incentivize many people to participate in such a program. Proposed in this paper is a system that combines these V 2 G services into a single program, which could have the effect of ensuring profits for the individual, while still providing cost-saving opportunities for grid operators, and emission reductions during the times when it is needed most. In addition to the opportunities brought about by increased penetration of PHEVs, there are challenges as well. This comes mainly in the form of increased demand for electricity. The possible effects on electricity load of increased PHEV penetration and V 2 G participation are analyzed in this paper. Furthermore, an econometric model is used to predict the effect of increased electricity load on electricity price at each hour of the day. It is found that increased PHEV penetration can (in a regulated charging scheme) increase electricity loads and prices during the hours when electricity loads and prices are currently lowest. Furthermore, if V 2 G technology is used for peak reduction, electricity loads and prices can be reduced during peak electricity demand hours. The overall effect of this is a flattening of the daily electricity load and price profiles, which is likely to be beneficial for power system operators. The flattening of the daily electricity price profile has the effect of reducing profits when V 2 G technology is used for peak reduction because it raises the price during charging (buying electricity) and lowers the price during discharging (selling electricity). While the analysis presented here works within the framework of the current electricity markets, it is possible that the best use for V 2 G technology could come in a program that allows grid operators to dispatch the stored energy for the optimal purpose (e. g. : peak reduction, regulation, reserves, <b>ramping)</b> at any <b>period</b> of time. This would require a different type of market structure, possibly even a separate market for storage, in which V 2 G services could participate...|$|R
