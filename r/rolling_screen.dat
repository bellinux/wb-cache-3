A <b>rolling</b> <b>screen</b> for game masters was offered at one point, bearing helpful charts and tables necessary during gameplay. A large map of the fictional Kingdom of Alusia was released as well, which provided game masters a variety of habitats, environments and islands on which to place the action.|$|E
5000|$|The worm {{approaches}} the cat, and asks {{him if he}} wants to eat. The cat says that he does; and the worm shows him a plan of action: the bird chases the worm to his hole, the worm hides in it, then the cat will catch the bird and eat it. The worm tells the cat that he'll see him in the morning. The worm pulls down a <b>rolling</b> <b>screen</b> in order to bring in the next morning. The plan goes well until the cat fails to eat the bird. The cat then chases the bird around the tree, and after some time, the bird hops out of the hollow and hits the still-running cat with the club. The cat says [...] "Ouch!" [...] and then goes swearing (that dialogue is muted). The worm, not having seen all of this, thinks that cat has eaten the bird, and then walks away. Then, he sees the bird and runs away, ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{projects}} fuse {{technology and}} multi-media across disciplines, with an immersive approach to theatre - incorporating sound design, organic approaches to lighting, design and movement. In 1999 his experiences with Welfare State International {{led him to}} create two large-scale site specific performances with boys at Birrong Boys High School - one of Sydney’s tougher schools. In his time at Shopfront he has directed CODA (2003) with residents of the Juvenile Justice system; How Sachi Lost His Leg (2004 - a site specific spectacular combining puppetry and Capoeira); Wadya Call Me? (2004 - in a back lane, incorporating a 4 x 4m <b>rolling</b> <b>screen,</b> puppetry, live radio broadcast, and 19m graffiti wall created during the performance). In 2005, he directed Angels in the Architecture - creating an aerial urban ghetto and song cycle with an integrated ensemble of performers with and without disabilities. In 2006 he directed POP UP! an interactive three-dimensional multimedia pop up book, {{in and around the}} Shopfront complex. [...] "A City of Shadows and Ice", was one of Shopfront's largest productions, being performed in August 2007 with the set made from ice and featuring Parkour artists.|$|E

50|$|The {{internal}} millworkings {{and structural}} members installed during the 1933 reconstruction {{were taken from}} an 1818 gristmill located near Front Royal, Virginia. Some of the structural members from Front Royal mill {{are still in the}} building; however, most of the millworkings were replaced between 1997 and 2002. The interior has exposed masonry walls with heavy timber framing. The flooring throughout the building is random-width pine. A masonry fireplace is in the southwest corner of the first floor. The grinding platform is accessed from the second floor. The third level is one large room with <b>rolling</b> <b>screens</b> and other processing equipment. A staircase in the western half of the structure runs from the first floor to attic. The mill’s two grinding stones are powered by a pitch-back water wheel. The mill machinery is enclosed in a hurst frame, built from heavy oak and pine beams. Its frame is built directly on the mill’s foundation, and is not connected to the walls. This protects the structure from the machinery’s potentially damaging vibrations. The hurst frame occupies the eastern half of the first two levels.|$|R

40|$|Most {{existing}} crop scheduling {{models are}} cultivar specific and are developed using academic resources. As such they rarely meet the particular {{needs of a}} grower. A series of protocols have been created to generate effective schedules for a changing product range using data generated on site at a commercial nursery. A screening programme has been developed to help determine a cultivar's photoperiod sensitivity and vernalisation requirement. Experimental conditions were obtained using a cold store facility set to 5 degreesC and photoperiod cloches. Eight and 16 hour photoperiod treatments were achieved at low cost by growing plants in cloches of opaque plastic with a motorised <b>rolling</b> <b>screen.</b> Natural light conditions were extended where necessary using a high pressure sodium lamp. Batches of plants were grown according to different schedules based on these treatments. The screening programme found Coreopsis grandiflora 'Flying Saucers' {{to be a long}} day plant. Data to form the basis of graphical tracks was taken using variations on commercial schedules. The work provides a nursery based approach to the continuous improvement of crop scheduling practises...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{great amount}} of steel slag {{aggregate}} is used to prepare cement concrete and asphalt concrete in road construction However, the steel slag aggregate processed by the traditional aggregate production line is not uniform, which is not conducive to the full-size utilization of steel slag. Therefore, a new method of steel slag aggregate processing was proposed in this study {{in order to obtain}} the high quality steel slag aggregate with different specifications Experimental results indicated that the specifications stability of the steel slag was improved significantly when the steel slag was crushed by the combination equipments of jaw crusher and cone crusher. The screening efficiency and stability of the aggregate can be improved as the multi-level screening equipments were used into the production line. The wet <b>rolling</b> <b>screen</b> was also developed to remove the dust on the surface of aggregates. The specifications stability and pavement performance indexes of the steel slag aggregate produced by the new production line have been improved significantly compared to the steel slag aggregate produced by the traditional production line...|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} is to save all of the bugs <b>rolling</b> round the <b>screen,</b> {{before they reach the}} opening to the Black Bug Empire's underground lair. When one bug reaches the opening, the player loses a life and the other bugs in the line quickly rush underground. The player can save the bugs by firing a coloured bug from Tumble's back towards a group of two or more of the same coloured balls. When three or more of the same colour come in contact with each other, they are set free, possibly triggering other bugs to escape as part of a chain reaction.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} a 1990s manga-based visual style {{loosely based on}} a {{contemporary}} Japanese manga series {{which was based on}} the Shadowrun franchise. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games which are set in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game is set entirely in Japan. In the fictional Shadowrun setting, Japan maintains a practice of exiling all orcs and trolls; thus there are no characters of those races in this game. The combat system is turn-based, and six-sided dice appear <b>rolling</b> on the <b>screen</b> determine the results of combat—the conflict resolution system used in the Shadowrun table-top game.|$|R
5000|$|Ohara's son Koun (小原光雲) (1880-1938) {{invented a}} {{descriptive}} teaching method and moved from individual lessons to group classes. For the first time, teaching certificates were awarded to women. Under Houn's guidance, the school grew. Its headquarters were in Tokyo and Kobe, with other centers in New York and Sao Paulo. He developed the typical landscape style, {{as well as}} the rimpa and bunjin floral arrangements. The inspirations for rimpa came to him from <b>rolling</b> picture scrolls, <b>screens</b> (byōbu) and painted subjects of the 17th century. Chinese poetry became the foundation for bunjin arrangements. Houn (小原豊雲) (1908-1995) followed as the third headmaster in 1938.|$|R
40|$|Leaf rolling is {{considered}} an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf <b>rolling,</b> we <b>screened</b> a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf 1 (oul 1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling. The phenotypes were caused by knockout of Rice outermost cell-specific gene 5 (Roc 5), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene GLABRA 2. Interestingly, overexpression of Roc 5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc 5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling. Bulliform cell number and size increased in oul 1 and Roc 5 cosuppression plants but were reduced in Roc 5 -overexpressing lines. The data indicate that Roc 5 negatively regulates bulliform cell fate and development. Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul 1. The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc 5 -overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc 5 may have a conserved function. These are, to our knowledge, the first functional data for a gene encoding a homeodomain leucine zipper class IV transcriptional factor in rice that modulates leaf rolling...|$|R

They quickly released several home versions under the Tengen brand. Akers created the Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis editions himself. Some 16-bit conversions featured improved graphics. Klax received the Parents' Choice Foundation's seal of approval in 1990, won Best Mind Game at the 1991 European Computer Leisure Awards, and Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune named it the Best Cartridge of 1990.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} of Zuma {{is to eliminate}} all of the balls <b>rolling</b> around the <b>screen</b> along a given path (the path is clearly visible {{in all of the}} levels except for the last level) with other balls before these balls reach the yellow skull structure, which will open to varying degrees as a warning of oncoming balls. The player can carry two balls at a time and can switch at any time. As soon as one ball reaches the skull, the rest follow and the player loses a life. To prevent the balls reaching the skull, the player can eliminate the balls by firing a colored ball from the stone frog idol's mouth towards the chain of balls that will continue to push forward until the player fills the yellow bar, which is when the balls will stop producing off-screen. When three or more of the same color come in contact, they explode, possibly triggering other explosions as part of a chain reaction. The level is completed when after the bar is filled, the player eliminates all of the balls on the screen.|$|R
5000|$|In total, three {{separate}} videos {{were made for}} [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] with the one aired on television being {{the third and final}} version. The third music video was first unveiled before an audience of two hundred guests at the Entertainment Weekly Grammy Award after-party on February 10, 2008. It was intended to premiere on BET on February 13, 2008, but was subsequently pulled from schedule. West decided to premiere the video on his official blog that same day. The video for was co-directed by Spike Jonze along with West himself and produced by Jonathan Becker and Joshua Greenberg of Bucks Boys Productions. Filmed entirely in slow-motion, the video begins with a Ford Mustang Bullit <b>rolling</b> onto the <b>screen</b> and stopping at dusk in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nevada. As the bright, red taillights turn off, the song breaks into its titular refrain and Houston-based Playboy model Rita G. exits the vehicle dressed in a wig, fur coat and large black sunglasses. Walking a distance away from the car, she strips down to her lingerie and lights her clothes on fire. As she walks back towards the car with flames at her back, West's vocals begin. Kanye himself finally makes his appearance when the woman opens the trunk to reveal him lying in it tied up and gagged. She gently strokes his helpless, terrified face and gives him a light kiss, before retrieving a nearby shovel. As the camera dollies out, the woman raises the shovel over her head and repeatedly stabs it into the trunk. The video then abruptly cuts to the words [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] written red letters against a black screen before concluding over a minute earlier than the album version of the song.|$|R

The video was placed on Pitchfork Media's unranked list of The Top Music Videos of 2011, and at number four {{on the list of}} Consequence of Sound's staff, who wrote: [...] "The flawless makeup and choreography coupled (yes, that was intentional) with calculatedly goofy facial expressions and dancing maintain the tenuous balance between idol Sasha Fierce and Bey, the girl next door. It proves to her audience that even though Beyoncé is rapidly ascending the celebrity ladder to an almost untouchable height, she's just like any other girl who secretly wants to be Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face." [...] The writers of Slant Magazine put the music video at number 17 on their list of The 25 Best Music Videos of 2011, writing that [...] "using jolts of pop-art colors, virtuosic editing, and a smile that spans from one tip of her bob cut to the other, Beyoncé pilfers through a very specific musical past with her customarily giddy and sincere sense of spirit." [...] Jesse Skinner	of Toro magazine put the music video at number 14 on his list of Best Videos of 2011 and noted that the video was [...] "the most energetic clip of the year, a utilization of all things – colour, composition, movement, editing – that used to make major label music videos 'events.'" [...] Phoebe Reilly of Spin ranked the video at number nine on Spins 10 Most Innovative Music Videos of 2011 list, writing that Knowles looked [...] "damn adorable" [...] while channeling Audrey Hepburn. NMEs writers included [...] "Countdown"'s music video at number eight on their list of 50 Best Music Videos of 2011 praising the <b>rolling,</b> multiple split <b>screens</b> as its highlight. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E!
