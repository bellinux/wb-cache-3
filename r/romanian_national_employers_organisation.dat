40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has not had}} any noticeable effect on the peak-level associational ‘landscape’: the landscape has remained densely organised. The six peak social partner associations are still in place and are respected parties in consultation. These national organisations have an advisory role in collective labour framework agreements and offer indications for wage development - via the bipartite Labour Foundation, the STAR. Consultation by the authorities is further guaranteed through the tripartite Social Economic Council, the SER. The relationship with the government has in recent years become more difficult. Collective bargaining negotiations have also become tenser. That said, around 80 % of all employees are covered by a collective agreement. These agreements are concluded by the unions and employer associations affiliated to the six national peak organisations. While around 90 % of employers are organised {{by one of the}} three <b>national</b> <b>employer</b> <b>organisations,</b> employee federations organise at present around 20 % of employees...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{collective}} agreement policy of IG BAU is centralized. Many of the national collective agreements have been declared generally binding by the German federal government and so apply to all employers and workers in certain sectors like e.g. construction and the building cleaning trades. Because there is no general legal minimum wage in Germany yet the IG BAU lobbied from 1990 onwards for the introduction of sectoral legal minimum wages based on the loewest categories of sector-wide collective agreements and succeeded in 1996. Since that time IG BAU - together with sectoral <b>national</b> <b>employer</b> <b>organisations</b> - has created legal sectoral minimum wages for general construction http://ecmin.efbww.org/default.asp?issue=emwn&language=EN&CID=DEU, demolition, painting, scaffolding, roofing and building cleaning incl hotel cleaning and janitors by collective agreements, which have been declared generally binding by a federal order of the federal labor ministry. These minimum wages also apply to foreign companies who send their workers temporarily to Germany.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a case study {{focusing}} on <b>employer</b> <b>organisations</b> and business organisations in the Czech Republic. In legal terms, <b>employer</b> <b>organisations</b> are {{a specific type of}} interest group with special regimes of registration and record keeping. Unlike business groups, they are endowed with certain privileges and, in particular, can participate in collective bargaining. This study analyses the relations between these two types of groups. The database originates from a questionnaire-based survey undertaken in 2010 among 91 groups representing businesses and employers. The analysis focuses on the relationship between a group’s registration as an <b>employer</b> <b>organisation</b> and its orientation towards employer and business interests. It also investigates similarities between the two organisation types in terms of secondary organisation and strategies used. The analysis suggests that the differences between these two types are minimal and that the possibility of participating in collective bargaining and in tripartite counselling bodies remains the only relevant distinction. This holds true even when we take into account these groups’ self-perceived primary role, i. e. defending their members as employer or as business organisations...|$|R
