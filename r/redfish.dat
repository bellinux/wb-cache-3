5|$|On average, the Aransas Bay {{system is}} 3 meters deep, and covers {{approximately}} 539 square kilometers. The system {{is made up}} of the bay itself and its extensions. The main extensions include: Saint Charles Bay, to the east of the Lamar peninsula; Copano Bay, to the west of both the Live Oak and Lamar peninsulas, Mesquite Bay to the bay's northeast, and <b>Redfish</b> Bay to the southwest. <b>Redfish</b> Bay is sometimes considered an extension of Corpus Christi Bay.|$|E
5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including <b>Redfish,</b> Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. <b>Redfish</b> Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E
5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the <b>redfish</b> and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E

The investigation revealed that S. marinus has a short, wide L-shaped gasbladder muscle which is generally tricipital. The most frequent pattern of tendons extending posteriorly was attachment of dorsal head tendons to ventral rib 2, passage of central head tendons between ribs 2 and 3, and passage of ventral head tendons between ribs 3 and 4.

50|$|In the North-East Atlantic {{total catches}} {{decreased}} between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons in 2013. Blue whiting reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but {{was down to}} 628,000 tons in 2013. Recovery plans for cod, sole, and plaice have reduced mortality in these species. Arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s-1980s but is now recovered. Arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished; Sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished. Limited data makes the state of <b>redfishes</b> and deep-water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing. Stocks of northern shrimp and Norwegian lobster are in good condition. In the North-East Atlantic 21% of stocks are considered overfished.|$|R
5|$|<b>Redfish</b> and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until the {{construction}} of an embankment reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from the Guadalupe River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E
5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and <b>redfish</b> are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, <b>redfish</b> live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{receives}} {{over one}} million visitors a year. Two visitor centers, one at the SNRA headquarters north of Ketchum and one at <b>Redfish</b> Lake, provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays and are staffed by either forest service interpreters or volunteers. The forest's ranger stations also provide these services, but without interpretive displays. Along the roadways, exhibits showcase key parts of the forest, and there are plentiful day use and picnic areas. There are more than 81 campgrounds in the forest, with 12 in the Fairfield District, 6 in the Ketchum District, 25 in the Minidoka District, and 38 in the SNRA. Most of the campgrounds are on a first come first served basis, while some can be reserved.|$|E
50|$|The Beryciformes are a poorly-understood {{order of}} {{carnivorous}} ray-finned fishes consisting of 7 families, 30 genera, and 161 species. They feed on small fish and invertebrates. Beyond this, {{little is known}} about the biology of most member species because of their nocturnal habits and deepwater habitats. All beryciform species are marine and most live in tropical to temperate, deepwater environments. Most live on the continental shelf and continental slope, with some species being found as deep as 2000 m. Some species move closer to the surface at night, while others live entirely in shallow water and are nocturnal, hiding in rock crevices and caves during the day. Several species are mesopelagic and bathypelagic. Beryciformes' bodies are deep and mildly compressed, typically with large eyes that help them see in darker waters. Colors range from red to yellow and brown to black, and sizes range from 8 - 61 cm. Member genera include the alfonsinos, squirrelfishes, flashlight fishes, fangtooth fishes, spinyfins, pineconefishes, <b>redfishes,</b> roughies, and slimeheads. A number of member species are caught commercially, including the alfonsino, the splendid alfonsino, and the orange roughy, the latter being much more economically important. Some species have bioluminescent bacteria contained in pockets of skin or in light organs near the eyes, including the anomalopids and monocentrids.|$|R
40|$|Bortom trawl {{data from}} the depth {{interval}} 300 - 2050 m on the slope off Norway were analysed to study distribution of fish biomass and the associated species assemblages. It is hypothesised that the pronounced hydrographic front between the warm Atlantic Waterrnass and the cold Norwegian Sea Deep-water, combined with a declining food supply with depth and distance from the shelf, structure the assemblages on the continental slope of the eastem Nmwegian Sea. From a high level at the shelf edge and upper slope, the fish biomass declined abruptly at about 720 m when crossing the 0 "C-isotherm associated with the hydrographic front. Beneath the frontal zone, the fish biornass was only 11 % of that above it and decreased further with increasing depth. In upper slope waters, the fish biornass increased with increasing latitude. Arctic species such as Lycodes frigidus and Paraliparis bathybius were dominant in the deep cold slope waters. The high fish biomass associated with the steep temperature gradient at 600 - 720 m was rnainly attributable to a few large and/or abundant boreo-arctic species, i. e. Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, <b>redfishes</b> Sebastes mentella and S. marinus, roughhead grenadier Macrourus berglax, and Raja hyperborea. In the shallower and warrner upper slope waters a species assemblage occurred which resembled that associated with adjacent deep shelf areas strongly influenced by the Atlantic Watermass...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} cruise {{was made}} in the Irminger Sea west and southwest of Iceland and adjacent waters on the Icelandic vessel Árni Friðriksson, from 03 Jun- 04 Jul 2003. The main purpose was to study distribution and abundance of deepwater <b>redfishes,</b> Sebastes mentella et sp., other pelagic fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton and the hydrography of the area. Part of the cruise was devoted to a special study on community structure at transect over {{the northern part of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Reykjanes Ridge). In this paper, an overview is given on the composition of the pelagic fish community, both vertically and horizontally, over the northern part of the Reykjanes Ridge. In total, nine trawl hauls were made with a “GLORIA” midwater trawl outfitted with a small mesh size (9 -mm) cod-end. Three hauls were made at three different depths west of the Ridge, three above it and three East of the Ridge. A total of 230 nautical miles separated hauls taken west of the Ridge and east of it. A minimum total of 44 species were identified from 23 families. Lanternfishes (Myctophidae), pearlsides (Sternoptychidae), barracudinas (Paralepididae), dragonfishes (Stomiidae) and deep-sea smelts (Microstomatidae) dominated fish catches. Results show that the total number of fishes caught was lowest east of the Ridge, coinciding with warmer deep waters. At all positions both number of species and families increased with depth as the number of individuals decreased with depth...|$|R
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and <b>redfish.</b> Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, <b>redfish,</b> monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the bay {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the <b>redfish</b> as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its <b>redfish</b> quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E

25|$|Saltwater {{fly fishing}} {{is most often}} done from a boat, either a shallow draft flat boat is used to pursue species such as bonefish, <b>redfish,</b> permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger {{offshore}} boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other pelagics and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for bonefish or <b>redfish</b> or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch saltwater fish on a fly rod. Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight fly rod and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet {{if they are going}} to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for bonefish, <b>redfish,</b> permit, tarpon, jacks and more.|$|E

25|$|Fly {{fishing is}} most renowned {{as a method}} for {{catching}} trout, grayling and salmon, {{but it is also}} used {{for a wide variety of}} species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as <b>redfish,</b> snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|E
25|$|Deep sea corals {{together}} with other habitat-forming organisms host a rich fauna of associated organisms. Lophelia reefs can host up to 1,300 species of fish and invertebrates. Various fish aggregate on deep sea reefs. Deep sea corals, sponges and other habitat-forming animals provide protection from currents and predators, nurseries for young fish, and feeding, breeding and spawning areas for numerous fish and shellfish species. Rockfish, Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, sablefish, flatfish, crabs, and other economically important species in the North Pacific inhabit these areas. Eighty-three percent of the rockfish found in one study were associated with red tree coral. Flatfish, walleye pollock and Pacific cod {{appear to be more}} commonly caught around soft corals. Dense schools of female <b>redfish</b> heavy with young have been observed on Lophelia reefs off Norway, suggesting the reefs are breeding or nursery areas for some species.
