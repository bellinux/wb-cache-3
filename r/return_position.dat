40|$|Abstract Since 1995, hydrologists of the HiBAm (Hydrology and Geochemistry of the Amazon Basin) Research Program {{carried out}} several hundred {{discharge}} measurements in the Amazon basin. Implementation of modern discharge measurement techniques using ultrasonic devices (ADCP), give {{evidence of a}} systematic error linked to the displacement of the river bottom due to high water velocity close to the bottom. This error leads to an underestimation of discharge value. It was possible to establish a correlation between the water velocity close to the river bottom and the error between real position and position computed by ADCP when the boat returns to its starting point after a two-way crossing of the river. When there is no bottom displacement, i. e. during low flow period, this <b>return</b> <b>position</b> error is weak (less than 50 m). This has allowed quantification of river bed load speed, or bottom displacement speed. A correction method was developed {{on the basis of}} this correlation. This method, systematically applied to ADCP discharge measurements obtained at Ôbidos hydrometric station, allowed all measured discharges to be corrected, especially for 1997 and 1999 floods. Another method, based on the analysis of real trajectory of th...|$|E
40|$|Robot Reinforcement Learning (RL) {{algorithms}} {{return a}} policy that maximizes a global cumulative reward signal but typically do not create diverse behaviors. Hence, the policy will typically only capture a single solution of a task. However, many motor tasks have a large variety of solutions and the knowledge about these solutions can have several advantages. For example, in an adversarial setting such as robot table tennis, the lack of diversity renders the behavior predictable and hence easy to counter for the opponent. In an interactive setting such as learning from human feedback, an emphasis on diversity gives the human more opportunity for guiding the robot and to avoid the latter to be stuck in local optima of the task. In order to increase diversity of the learned behaviors, we leverage prior work on intrinsic motivation and empowerment. We derive a new intrinsic motivation signal by enriching the description of a task with an outcome space, representing interesting aspects of a sensorimotor stream. For example, in table tennis, the outcome space could be given by the <b>return</b> <b>position</b> and return ball speed. The intrinsic motivation is now given by the diversity of future outcomes, a concept also known as empowerment. We derive a new policy search algorithm that maximizes a trade-off between the extrinsic reward and this intrinsic motivation criterion. Experiments on a planar reaching task and simulated robot table tennis demonstrate that our algorithm can learn a diverse set of behaviors within the area of interest of the tasks...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{transfer}} pricing arises where companies are divisionalised and have responsibility centres operating as strategic business units. This {{kind of situation}} {{is associated with the}} challenge of determining suitable prices for intra-group transactions. The transfer pricing problem becomes even more critical where a company has subsidiaries spread around the world especially in countries that have varying tax rates. Under this situation, it is common for multinational companies to attempt to minimise their tax liabilities by shifting profits from higher tax countries to lower tax regimes. Of course tax authorities {{all over the world are}} not comfortable with this kind of arrangement. Thus efforts are being made like what the FIRS is doing in Nigeria to stop it. The issue of transfer pricing as it relates to financial reporting is usually associated with uncertain tax positions in terms of the extent to which tax reserves may need to be recorded due to uncertainty with respect to tax <b>return</b> <b>position.</b> Transfer pricing has income tax consequences which of course, is more pronounced when the parties to a transaction are taxed in different jurisdictions. So it is really a problem for multinational companies and governments all over the world. Therefore, this study was carried out to examine the impact of transfer pricing on financial reporting. And it was gathered that governments and multinational companies in Nigerian and those of other developing countries world over are constrained by the required resources to be able to effectively implement transfer pricing. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that appropriate transfer prices be established for intra-group and/or intra-firm transfer of goods, intangibles and services...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method for finding the {{enhanced}} heading and position of pedestrians by fusing the Zero velocity UPdaTe (ZUPT) -based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and the kinematic constraints of the lower human body. ZUPT is a well known algorithm for PDR, and provides a sufficiently accurate position solution for short term periods, but it cannot guarantee a stable and reliable heading because it suffers from magnetic disturbance in determining heading angles, which degrades the overall position accuracy as time passes. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is integrating {{the left and right}} foot positions obtained by ZUPTs with the heading and position information from an IMU mounted on the waist. To integrate this information, a kinematic model of the lower human body, which is calculated by using orientation sensors mounted on both thighs and calves, is adopted. We note that the position of the left and right feet cannot be apart because of the kinematic constraints of the body, so the kinematic model generates new measurements for the waist position. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) on the waist data that estimates and corrects error states uses these measurements and magnetic heading measurements, which enhances the heading accuracy. The updated position information is fed into the foot mounted sensors, and reupdate processes are performed to correct the position error of each foot. The proposed update-reupdate technique consequently ensures improved observability of error states and position accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method provides all the information about the lower human body, {{so that it can be}} applied more effectively to motion tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified via experimental results, which show that a 1. 25 % <b>Return</b> <b>Position</b> Error (RPE) with respect to walking distance is achieved...|$|E
