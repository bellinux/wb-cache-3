25|$|The key {{financial}} ratio used {{to analyze}} fractional-reserve banks is the cash <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is the ratio of cash reserves to demand deposits.

25|$|It is {{important}} how the term 'reserves' is defined for calculating the <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio,</b> as different definitions give different results.

40|$|We {{apply the}} theory of clubs to bank {{decisions}} on choosing membership in the national system and being subject to federal regulations, or remaining outside the system and opting instead for state regulation. Although costs to national membership are typically higher, member banks can use their influence to reduce these costs. This {{is expected to be}} more prominent for the larger banks, which retain greater influence on the regulators. Thus, the theory predicts that membership depends on costs, which in turn depend on membership. We test these relationships in a system of simultaneous equations for the periods 1875 – 1913, 1914 – 34, and 1935 – 80. Our results are consistent with the notion of large bank memberships responding to changes in <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios,</b> and <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> responding to membership rates for large banks. In addition, we find bank sensitivity to national <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> to be the lowest when the Fed was given additional discretion in setting <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> post- 1935, and federal regulator responsiveness to large bank membership was the greatest during this time as well.

25|$|The {{required}} <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} tool in monetary policy, influencing the country's borrowing and interest rates by changing the amount of funds available for banks to make loans with. Western central banks rarely increase the reserve requirements because it would cause immediate liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use open market operations (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy. The People's Bank of China uses changes in reserve requirements as an inflation-fighting tool, and raised the reserve requirement ten times in 2007 and eleven times {{since the beginning of}} 2010.|$|E
25|$|The reserve {{requirement}} (or cash <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio)</b> {{is a central}} bank regulation employed by most, but not all, of the world's central banks, that sets the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank. The minimum reserve is generally determined by the central bank to be no less than a specified percentage {{of the amount of}} deposit liabilities the commercial bank owes to its customers. The commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the commercial bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank.|$|E

25|$|The Can of Worms at ICI was the {{headline}} in Business & Finance magazine on 8 November 1984. The Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI) was a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB when it collapsed in 1985 with losses of over £200 million. When {{it was discovered}} in November 1984 that ICI was operating below the statutory <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio,</b> a request for further capital was made to AIB— ICI had returned a profit of more than £80 million the previous year. This collapse occurred {{at a time of}} deep economic recession in Ireland. The level of Government debt at that time was 116% of GDP. But the Irish taxpayer bailed ICI out of its difficulties. The Irish Government did so to ensure a continuation of the insurance business and to protect policyholders. AIB claimed that it could not resolve the problems of ICI without putting its core banking business in jeopardy. The investment of £85 million by AIB in ICI was written off and the cost to the Irish taxpayer was £400 million.|$|E

40|$|A key {{rationale}} {{offered by}} the Federal Reserve for the payment of interest on reserves was to remove the incentive for banks to operate sweep accounts. Sweeping shifts funds from transactions deposits subject to reserve requirements to non-reservable deposits. This paper extends a conventional banking model to analyze sweeping behavior. Sweeping responds positively to increases in bank loan rates and <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> and negatively to increases in the interest rate on reserves or exogenous increases in bank equity. Sweeping generates greater responsiveness in lending to changes in loan rates or the interest rate on reserves and lower responsiveness to changes in <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> or equity than in its absence. Empirical analysis of an explicit condition that we derive suggests that, with an unchanged reserve requirement, the Fed could eliminate sweeping by setting the interest rate on reserves to no less than approximately 4 % points below the market loan rate.
