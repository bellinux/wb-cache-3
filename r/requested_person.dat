30|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} project supported by the Federal Environment Agency an electronic tool has been developed using the barcode of a product to generate a request via email. This request is directly forwarded to the responsible producer or importer of the product. Currently, for every request the contact data of the <b>requesting</b> <b>person</b> need to be entered in the electronic request tool, because an individual response has {{to be sent to}} the <b>requesting</b> <b>person.</b> The electronic tool is available via internet (e.g. [19]). As a next step it is intended to generate the request automatically using a personal smartphone by scanning the barcode of the article. This seems to be a promising way forward to involve the public, and retail in the SVHC in articles issue.|$|R

5000|$|Many folks {{inside of}} {{corporate}} situations are often left puzzled {{why they do}} not get the , traction or respect from certain people within prospective clients or organizations.

Business stature can be analogous to class snobbery or hierarchy in the non business society.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the manner}} in which the arrest of a person the subject of an EAW is not {{specified}} in the Framework Decision, once arrested, he or she has the right to be informed of the warrant, its contents, and the person's right to consent to his or her surrender to the member state that issued the warrant.

5000|$|Torture, inhuman or {{degrading}} treatment or punishment: Many countries will not extradite {{if there is}} a risk that a <b>requested</b> <b>person</b> will be subjected to torture, inhuman or {{degrading treatment}} or punishment. In the case of Soering v United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held that it would violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to extradite a person to the United States from the United Kingdom in a capital case. This was due to the harsh conditions on death row and the uncertain timescale within which the sentence would be executed.|$|E

50|$|Under the Framework Decision, {{member states}} are precluded from refusing the {{surrender}} of their own nationals wanted {{for the purposes of}} prosecution, but they may condition {{the surrender of}} a <b>requested</b> <b>person</b> on his or her being returned to the issuing state to serve any sentence ultimately imposed. The Netherlands which requires issuing states to return both Dutch nationals and permanent residents, also requires issuing states to agree that any sentences imposed will be converted into those applicable under Dutch law using the 1995 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This has the effect of re-introducing the double-criminality requirement for Dutch nationals and permanent residents, as the conversion of a sentence imposed in an issuing state could not be converted into a comparable sentence by a Dutch court if the conduct constituting the criminal offence in the issuing state does not constitute a criminal offence in the Netherlands.|$|E

Furthermore, it brings its two-tier ‘systemic deficiencies’ test closer to the standards used by the ECtHR and encourages dialogue between the issuing and executing judicial authorities. Nevertheless, the scope of application of the new ground of postponement is not entirely clear and it is not yet sure what happens after the executing judicial authority postpones its decision due to evidence of a real risk that the <b>requested</b> <b>person</b> will be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the issuing Member State...|$|E
