5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to survive.

5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of ‘emotion & design’ <b>researches</b> <b>had</b> {{been developed for}} more than a decade and different <b>researches</b> <b>had</b> focused on the application of emotions in design outcomes. Researches focus on the influence of emotions to design processes is insufficient. Although some <b>research</b> <b>had</b> investigated the role of emotion in the design process, some designers still experience issues relating to the ‘emotion influence’ in their design processes; even they adopted the cognitive design managing approaches. <b>Researches</b> <b>had</b> identified that emotion can enhance designers’ abilities to make decisions and optimise their design processes. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to highlight how emotion affects the decision making and how it further influencing in the design process. It <b>had</b> been conducted <b>research</b> studies to understand whether designers understand the relationships between design and emotion, and how emotion influences them to adopt different research methods and analytical methods. Hence, a new perspective on the way to optimise the design process could be realised...|$|R
