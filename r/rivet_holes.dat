40|$|In this article, {{ultrasonic}} {{guided wave}} propagation and {{interaction with the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> cracks has been formulated using closed-form analytical solution while the local damage interaction, scattering, and mode conversion have been obtained from finite element analysis. The <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> cracks (damage) in the plate structure {{gives rise to the}} non-axisymmetric scattering of Lamb wave, as well as shear horizontal (SH) wave, although the incident Lamb wave source (primary source) is axisymmetric. The damage in the plate acts as a non-axisymmetric secondary source of Lamb wave and SH wave. The scattering of Lamb and SH waves are captured using wave damage interaction coefficient (WDIC). The scatter cubes of complex-valued WDIC are formed that can describe the 3 D interaction (frequency, incident direction, and azimuth direction) of Lamb waves with the damage. The scatter cubes are fed into the exact analytical framework to produce the time domain signal. This analysis enables us to obtain the optimum design parameters for better detection of the cracks in a multiple-rivet-hole problem. The optimum parameters provide the guideline of the design of the sensor installation to obtain the most noticeable signals that represent the presence of cracks in the <b>rivet</b> <b>hole...</b>|$|R
500|$|Inglis {{conducted}} {{research into the}} problem of fracture in the metal plates of ships' hulls and noticed that the <b>rivet</b> <b>holes</b> along {{the path of a}} crack were often deformed into an elliptical shape. [...] This phenomenon led him to investigate the magnification of stress caused at the edges of an elliptical defect; in 1913 he published a paper of his theories that has been described as his most important contribution to engineering and the first serious modern work on the fracturing of materials. Alan Arnold Griffith later drew on Inglis' paper for his work on the apparent discrepancy between calculated and actual strengths of materials. [...] Inglis's 1913 paper has been cited by around 1,200 subsequent works.|$|E
500|$|On 19 October 1954, the Cohen Committee was {{established}} to examine {{the causes of the}} Comet crashes. [...] Chaired by Lord Cohen, the committee tasked an investigation team led by Sir Arnold Hall, Director of the RAE at Farnborough, to perform a more detailed investigation. [...] Hall's team began considering fatigue as the most likely cause of both accidents, and initiated further research into measurable strain on the aircraft's skin. With the recovery of large sections of G-ALYP from the Elba crash and BOAC's donation of an identical airframe, G-ALYU, for further examination, an extensive [...] "water torture" [...] test eventually provided conclusive results. This time, the entire fuselage was tested in a dedicated water tank that was built specifically at Farnborough to accommodate its full length. Stress around the window corners was found to be much higher than expected and stresses on the skin were generally more than previously expected or tested. The windows' square shape caused stress concentration by generating levels of stress two or three times greater than across the rest of the fuselage. In 2012 a finite element analysis was carried out to find the stress values in a digital model of the Comet's cabin window loaded to a pressure differential of 8.25 psi. In this model the maximum stress level at the margin of one of the outer row of <b>rivet</b> <b>holes</b> near the corner of the window was almost five times greater than in the areas of skin remote from the windows.|$|E

It’s {{a problem}} of how to {{correctly}} express the complex products riveted joint information on product drawing, but the appearance of MBD technology would change it and provide an effective solution. The connotation of MBD technology using the text parameter and the flag note to express product non-geometric information was briefly elaborated, and the specific methods to express and manage the riveted joint geometric and non-geometric information was put forward. Through the analysis on the different express way and condition, the three elements such as <b>riveting</b> <b>hole</b> position, fastener installation direction and <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> direction was conveyed to express riveted joint geometry definition information. The flag note was used to identify and classify different riveting features, while the text parameter to express non-instantiated fastener, punching requirements, fastener installation requirements, number of holes and other types of non-geometric information. Additional, the flag note number was used to classify and manage all the non-geometric information in the structure specification tree.

2500|$|Evolutionary Squadron {{was engaged}} in what became {{the first of the}} Victorian Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres. When the Leander joined on 17 June, she was {{attached}} to the ships blockading Berehaven. On 18 June [...] "the weather was so stormy that all exercises were suspended... After sunset, the Conquest, Mercury, Leander, Racer, Cormorant and Mariner with the torpedo boats attached to them got under way top take up their position of observation outside the haven. The weather proved so boisterous that the blockading division returned before it had reached the open water outside. In returning... the Leander, while manoeuvring to keep clear of the Conquest, struck on the Hornet rock, and was seriously injured. As soon as the accident occurred the engines were stopped, the watertight doors closed, the pumps were set going, and collision mats and sails were passed under the ship's bottom. After some time it was found that e pumps failed to gain on the leak. On the following day the ship was moved nearer the shore, so as to be ready to beach in case of necessity. Early, however on the 21st the divers succeeded in finding the leak and stopping it with the patent leak-stopper. The ship's hold was thereupon cleared of water." [...] It was not until 24 June that Leander was ready to go to sea again. [...] On 26 June, the Leander, escorted by the Mercury, arrived at Devonport, where she was placed in dock. [...] The damage to the Leader was described as follows: [...] "The sea entered through numerous <b>rivet</b> <b>holes</b> where rivets had been sheared, but the compartment kept the ship afloat in a working condition."

2500|$|Work on the {{foundations}} was complete by 30 June and the erection {{of the iron}} work was started. Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved {{in the design and}} the degree of precision required: the positions of <b>rivet</b> <b>holes</b> were specified to within 0.1mm (0.04in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54° to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on the anchoring bolts in the masonry foundation blocks. Eiffel had calculated that this would be satisfactory until they approached halfway to the first level: accordingly work was stopped for the purpose of erecting a wooden supporting scaffold. This gave ammunition to his critics, and lurid headlines including [...] "Eiffel Suicide!" [...] and [...] "Gustave Eiffel has gone mad: he has been confined in an Asylum" [...] appeared in the popular press. At this stage a small [...] "creeper" [...] crane was installed in each leg, designed to move up the tower as construction progressed and making use of the guides for the elevators which were to be fitted in each leg. After this brief pause erection of the metalwork continued, and the critical operation of linking the four legs was successfully completed by March 1888. In order to precisely align the legs so that the connecting girders could be put into place, a provision had been made to enable precise adjustments by placing hydraulic jacks in the footings for each of the girders making up the legs.|$|E

40|$|The {{improvement}} of static properties of combined rivet and adhesive bonded joints {{have been proven}} by several authors [1, 2]. On the other side, dynamic properties of joints (for example fatigue and corrosion) significantly affect final function of structures during their service life.

Complex description of dynamic properties of this particular combined joining technology has not been publicised, yet. Description of sealant layer influence on stress concentration in <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> regions {{is one of the}} main goal of this work. The next stage of the thesis is focused on the influence of above mentioned sealant layer on fatigue properties of combined blind rivet and solid countersunk rivet joints.
