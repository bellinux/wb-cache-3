Nonetheless, William was able to <b>reconstitute</b> the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests.

Methods: Kinevac was <b>reconstituted</b> with either sterile wa-ter or 0. 9 % sodium chloride. Triplicate high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on each vial of <b>reconstituted</b> sample at time zero and at time zero plus 8 h. The concentration of each sample, as measured by the peak area, was recorded at each time point. The process was repeated over 4 consecutive days. Results: Kinevac <b>reconstituted</b> with sterile water resulted in the recovery of 89. 73 % of the time zero concentration after 8 h. Kinevac <b>reconstituted</b> with 0. 9 % sodium chloride resulted in chemical stability of the injection, with 80. 05 % recovery of the time zero value after 8 h. Conclusion: Kinevac is more stable when <b>reconstituted</b> with sterile water than when <b>reconstituted</b> with 0. 9 % sodium chloride.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that the {{mechanical}} behavior of the natural intact soft clay is usually quite {{different from that of the}} <b>reconstituted</b> counterpart. Hence, how to predict the influences of soil structure on the mechanical behavior of natural clays is an important issue in geotechnical engineering．The mechanical behavior of structured soils can usually be quantitatively assessed based on the mechanical behavior obtained from corresponding <b>reconstituted</b> clays. The preparing method for <b>reconstituted</b> soils will affect the quality of <b>reconstituted</b> samples greatly, and therefore, affect their mechanical parameter. To guarantee the quality of <b>reconstituted</b> soil samples, a large diameter oedometer apparatus is developed. Also, an oedomer-based method for preparing <b>reconstituted</b> clay samples is proposed. Typical soft Lianyungang city clay from China is chosen to testify the methods and corresponding procedures. The feasibility of the improved method is confirmed by comparing its results with those of the normal oedometer test...|$|R

5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to <b>reconstitute</b> themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E

Sailing in pursuit, Duckworth encountered Willaumez on 25 December but refused battle and instead sailed for the West Indies to replenish his supplies before making the journey back to European waters.

The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E
5|$|Preceded by mixed Universal Carrier and {{motorcycle}} reconnaissance detachments, the 192nd and 193rd Regiments {{began moving}} to their designated areas after noon, and arrived there at nightfall. At this point, 192nd Regiment could muster only 295 men, while another 241 {{could not be}} moved by vehicle—presumably due to {{the large number of}} breakdowns and the lack of spare parts—and were ordered to proceed to Kilkis. Shortly after 17:00, about 45 German planes bombed the 192nd Regiment at the village of Theodorovo. Two officers and 15 men were killed, over 50 personnel were wounded, while two Carriers, ten Austins and ten motorcycles were destroyed, effectively destroying the 2nd Open Tank Company as a combat formation. Col. Sionidis' command, which was also in the village, suffered 13 dead and 45 wounded. Despite these losses, the 192nd Regiment reached its assigned positions, where it divided in two Resistance Centres: left, with the Tank Battalion and one of the 47mm anti-tank troops, and the right, with the Foot Battalion and a 20mm anti-tank troop. First German probing attacks during the night were successfully repelled. 193rd Regiment was more fortunate; it reached its deployment area without major obstacles, although a reconnaissance patrol clashed with the Germans near Kato Sourmena, and returned with a German prisoner. On the same evening, the division's 3.7cm Flak shot down a German reconnaissance plain over Krisia railway station, and reconnaissance patrols reported German infiltration along the entire line of the railway track between Mouries and Rodopoli. During the night, the division was allocated reinforcements from the 1st Security Battalion of Thessaloniki in the form of two infantry companies (one for each of the 192nd and 193rd Regiments), two MG squads and a 75mm battery. In order to <b>reconstitute</b> the 192nd Regiment's 2nd Open Tank Company, divisional command ordered the crews of the two Italian-equipped Closed Tank Companies to abandon their vehicles and help man the Universal Carriers. The Italian tanks were hence abandoned and took no part in the fighting, but the reorganization of the 2nd Open Tank Company was not completed until April 8. 191st Regiment was also ordered to send a squadron of its Tank Company to the Rupel Pass.|$|E

The properties of <b>reconstituted</b> poplar replicating wenge were compared with those of poplar and wenge veneer tested in the same conditions. The results show a slightly lower MOE and MOR for the particleboard veneered with <b>reconstituted</b> veneer compared to the classic veneer, in spite of a higher veneered panel density. The reason may be a discontinuous structure of the engineered veneer compared to the traditional veneer. However, the addition of veneer to particleboards has increased their MOE app. 1. 4 - 1. 7 times and doubled their MOR. Smaller standard deviation values of the MOE, MOR and density were recorded for the particleboard veneered with <b>reconstituted</b> poplar replicating wenge compared with the ones veneered with poplar or natural wenge, which may indicate a more homogenous structure for the <b>reconstituted</b> veneer compared with the natural veneers.
