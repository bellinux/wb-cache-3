5|$|In June 1940, the Soviet Union {{forcibly}} annexed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and {{the disputed}} Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Hertza. Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet political <b>rapprochement</b> and economic co-operation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war.|$|E
5|$|Mao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's {{attempts}} {{to reach a}} <b>rapprochement</b> with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising {{the standard of living}} in communist-bloc countries.|$|E

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a <b>rapprochement</b> with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
5|$|In February 1972, Nixon {{announced}} a stunning <b>rapprochement</b> with Mao's China by traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the Vietnam War both weakened America's {{influence in the}} Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe. Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.|$|E

5000|$|The RDA {{maintained}} {{ties with}} a number of parties in France and in West Africa. Brief <b>rapprochements</b> with African parties never formed into solid coalitions, but the relationships with some French political parties lasted for many years. These included formal coalitions, brief partnerships, and loose affiliations. In addition, a number of parties opposed the RDA and worked against the party.|$|R
5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European security arrangements. In the 1930s France started to fear the rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a <b>rapprochement</b> with the Soviet Union, which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate {{what was left of}} the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at <b>rapprochement</b> with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E
5|$|The Sino-Soviet split {{was one of}} the {{key events}} of the Cold War, equal in {{importance}} to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American <b>rapprochement.</b> The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.|$|E

50|$|Reviewing the TIFF début of the film, Rocchi writes: Emotional Arithmetic {{plays out}} {{in a series of}} fairly {{predictable}} scenes — resentments simmer, past pain comes to light, <b>rapprochements</b> are formed. Emotional Arithmetic tries to paint a picture of the long-term emotional effects of political atrocities, which is certainly an important topic. But, again, it feels like a film that was made to be about an important topic — it's a little too obvious, a little too on-the-nose, a little familiar. Emotional Arithmetic has the best of intentions; it's just that its whole is far less than the sum of the parts.|$|R
5|$|The Yugoslavs re-launched Split in March 1950 {{to free up}} the slipway, but {{no other}} work was done. In 1953 there was a <b>rapprochement</b> with the NATO powers and the American and the British agreed to help {{complete}} the ship. The Tosi machinery ordered earlier had been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship's armament, fire-control equipment and electronics.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rapprochement</b> {{was not to}} last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'état removed Tombalbaye and {{replaced}} him with General Félix Malloum. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT. In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum, {{and in the same}} year Libyan troops started making forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's <b>rapprochement</b> with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
40|$|The Ottoman Empire and Spain {{had survived}} through similar {{historical}} experiences and had confronted {{each other since}} {{the early years of}} the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman-Spanish struggle intensified as the Spanish kingdoms extended military aids to the Byzantine Empire and Albania while the Ottomans sent help to Muslims in Spain. The minor clashes in the earlier periods between these two states were followed by major wars in the 16 th century. Although there had been <b>rapprochements</b> and peace negotiations between the two states, none of the peace attempts were completed successfully because both the Ottoman Empire and Spain had a desire to establish world political domination. Eventually, the struggle period between the Ottoman Empire and Spain ended with a truce in 1581...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} an {{adequate}} description, a conceptual formulation and a theological {{interpretation of the}} gift of the Lord’s Supper, has been a concern of Christianity since ancient times. The circumspect observation in the Charta Oecumenica (2001) reads: ‘Fundamental differences in faith are still barriers to visible unity’. In the light of those difficulties, attempts have been made in recent years to work on a ‘Joint Declaration on the Lord’s Supper’. All churches and denominations face the challenge to bring that which they learn of Jesus Christ’s sacramental presence from the New Testament. Some <b>rapprochements</b> have been achieved in the last decades. Some of those results are discussed in this essay. This article is translated from the German article ‘Realpräsenz. Skizze einer ökumenischen Bestandsaufnahme‘ by Klaudia Ringelmann. [URL] History and Church Polic...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{tentative}} {{plans for}} a joint German-Japanese approach against the USSR were hinted on in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact, the years 1938 and 1939 were already decisive for Japan's decision to not expand northward (i.e., against the USSR) but to the south. The Empire decisively lost two border fights against the Soviets, the Battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkin Gol, thereby convincing itself that the Imperial Japanese Army, lacking heavy tanks and the like, would be {{in no position to}} challenge the Red Army at that time. Nevertheless, Hitler's anti-Soviet sentiment soon led to further <b>rapprochements</b> with Japan, since he still believed that Japan would join Germany in a future war against the Soviet Union, either actively by invading southeast Siberia, or passively by binding large parts of the Red Army, which was fearing an attack of Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, numbering ca. 700,000 men as of the late 1930s.|$|R
5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a <b>rapprochement</b> with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a <b>rapprochement</b> that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a <b>rapprochement</b> with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts {{were made to}} clarify that the {{movement}} did not seek to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E
50|$|Her {{husband was}} only {{fourteen}} at the time. Unfortunately, he tired of her rather quickly after only six months. Despite little contact, their periodic <b>rapprochements</b> eventually {{allowed her to}} give birth to their only son named Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon. The scandal of her husband's adultery came out in 1778, and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders. The couple separated in 1780. As a separated spouse, she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life in the gilded solitude of the Château de Chantilly. Later, she also lived for a time with her father and his second wife, Madame de Montesson, at their château at Saint-Assise. When her father died, in 1785, her brother Philippe, became the Duke of Orléans. It was around this time that Bathilde bought a house in Paris called the Hôtel de Clermont and the château de Petit-Bourg.|$|R
50|$|Obama {{served as}} the first African American President of the United States for two terms, first elected in 2008 and reelected in 2012. During his presidency, his {{administration}} addressed the 2007-2008 global financial crisis (including a major stimulus package), oversaw the passage {{and implementation of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, partially extended Bush tax cuts, took executive action on immigration reform, and took steps to combat climate change and carbon emissions. Obama also authorized the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, signed the New START treaty with Russia, signed the Paris Agreement, and negotiated <b>rapprochements</b> with Iran and Cuba. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. Republicans took control of the Senate after the 2014 elections, and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.|$|R
50|$|An ideologically {{heterogeneous}} coalition, the FG {{has been}} described as a communist, left-wing, radical left, anti-liberal left, anti-capitalist left or far-left party. Jean-Luc Mélenchon himself has said that he does not consider himself of the far-left, and the far-left label has primarily been used for strategic reasons by the right. Marc Dolez, a former PG deputy who left Mélenchon's party in December 2012 while remaining active in the FG, claimed that Mélenchon and the FG's strategy of attacking the PS has 'cornered' the FG on the far-left. Political journalists and analysts including Vincent Tiberj and Laurent de Boissieu recused the far-left label for the FG, although some far-left parties are part of the alliance. Some political analysts believe that the 'far-left' is used by the right-wing UMP for strategic reasons - for the purposes of attacking the PS and justifying potential <b>rapprochements</b> between the UMP and the FN.|$|R
5|$|Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} <b>rapprochement</b> between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations {{for the end of}} the secession and the formation of a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.|$|E
5|$|When Michael II died in c. 1268, however, his realm was divided, with Nikephoros {{receiving}} the metropolitan territories of Epirus proper and John {{taking over the}} Epirote domains in Thessaly and Central Greece. According to Gregoras, his realm extended from Mount Olympus in the north to Parnassus in the south, with the Achelous River serving as his border with Epirus proper; his capital was at Neopatras. Michael VIII seized {{the opportunity for a}} <b>rapprochement</b> with the two brothers. He gave Nikephoros his niece Anna in marriage, and arranged a marriage between his nephew Andronikos Tarchaneiotes and a daughter of John, who in addition received the high title of sebastokratōr.|$|E
5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain was attempting to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was attempting to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for <b>rapprochement,</b> Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E
40|$|When Cahiers d’Art first {{appeared}} in Paris in 1926, the new publication was quickly prized among the international cognoscenti for the diversity of its contents {{and the quality of}} its photographic reproductions. Founding editor Christian Zervos deftly intermixed a diverse range of subjects and approaches in the pages of his review. This essay examines how, why, and to what lasting effect the editor and his contributors interlaced European modern art with objects from non-Western cultures. Such <b>rapprochements</b> began as a formalist strategy, where objects met in opposition to aesthetic constraints imposed since the Renaissance; they evolved to emphasize a spiritual affinity or kinship between European artists and their cultural others. While focusing upon texts and images from the interwar period, the height of the review’s global influence and distribution, my intention is to suggest the wider cultural legacy of this visual and discursive space, in which the works of temporally and geographically distant cultures conversed across time and space. status: publishe...|$|R
