40|$|A {{method for}} sizing <b>remotely</b> <b>powered</b> {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles {{is presented to}} augment the conventional design process. This method allows for unconventionally powered aircraft to become options in trade studies during the initial design phase. A design matrix is created that shows where, and if, a <b>remotely</b> <b>powered</b> vehicle fits within the design space. For given range and power requirements, the design matrix uses historical data to determine whether an internal combustion or electrical system would be most appropriate. Trends in the historical data show that the break in the design space between the two systems is around 30 miles and 1 kW. Electrical systems are broken into subcategories of onboard energy sources and remote power sources. For this work, only batteries were considered as an onboard energy source, but both lasers and microwaves were considered for remote power transmission methods. The conventional sizing method is adjusted to {{so that it is}} based on energy consumption, instead of fuel consumption. Using the manner in which microwaves and laser propagate through the atmosphere, the weight fraction of a receiving apparatus is estimated. This is then used with the sizing method to determine the gross takeoff weight of the vehicle. This new sizing method is used to compare battery systems, microwave systems, and laser systems...|$|E

Intelligent power {{can be used in}} environments of varying sizes, with solutions available {{for a wide range of}} applications—from control of a few outlets in a small office/home office (SOHO) environment or standalone kiosk to integrated vertically mounted solutions for medium to large-sized datacenters.
