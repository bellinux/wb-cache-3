40|$|This {{research}} formulates a LANDSLIDE <b>RISK</b> <b>RATING</b> SYSTEM for the Greater Baguio {{area in the}} Philippines. It {{is hoped}} that the tool will be made {{a part of the}} physical/urban planning process when used by engineers and planners and used to address risks posed by landslides given the rapidly increasing concentration of population and the development of infrastructure and industry in the Baguio area. Reports and studies of individual landslides in the area are reviewed in order to discover the causal factors of mass movements and their interactions. The findings of these research works are discussed in the first portion of this paper. A description of the LANDSLIDE <b>RISK</b> <b>RATING</b> SYSTEM, remedial measures, and recommendations form the rest of the paper. This SYSTEM integrates different hazard (bedrock geology, slope gradients, vegetation) and risk (population, land use) factors. The selection of hazard factors takes into account the results of the analysis of causal factors of mass movements in the area. This analysis is based on the specific attributes of the subject study area, namely: a relatively extreme topographic relief, variable bedrock geology, and no significant differences in rainfall from one zone to another. The study assumes that the entire Greater Baguio area is subject to a uniform amount of rainfall during any given precipitation event. Although this study is area-specific it can have wider application. (cont.) Finally, the paper recommends that in future research work on this subject matter, soil and rock samples from various slopes be subjected to geomechanical testing to facilitate a mathematical analysis of slope failures. This can be the basis for a comprehensive database which can be used to create a Landslide Hazard Map where each slope in the Greater Baguio area can be rated. In addition, it would be beneficial to conduct an analysis of how Hazard Ratings may be reduced when particular remedial measures are in place. A site-specific preventive and remedial slope safety system for every slope in the Greater Baguio area would be the ultimate goal of future work. by Artessa Niccola D. Saldivar-Sali. Thesis (M. Eng.)

In a Supplier Financing model there is a heavy administrative burden caused by the need to negotiate Receivables Purchase Agreements with each individual Supplier, whereas in Factoring (finance) programs only one RPA is required with the Vendor. In addition, traditionally there was a larger effort involved in calculating the Funders credit risk exposure in a Receivables-based program due to the many Buyers which needed to be credit evaluated on an ongoing basis. Technology has now automated much of the credit evaluation process allowing program Funders access to real-time Buyer <b>risk</b> <b>ratings</b> across their portfolio. This transparency generates increased credit appetites from program Funders and Credit Insurers and benefits the Vendor through attractive rates and increased program credit limits on their Buyers. Vendors can also use the receivables-based approach to increase competitiveness by extending payment terms to their Buyers Off-balance-sheet.

40|$|The {{wind power}} {{development}} in Greece {{has been rising}} the last decade, aiming to exploit the country's excellent wind resources. Though the project developers' experience in the wind energy industry has been expanded, wind power project risks are always present, having the potential {{to have a major}} impact on the project outcome. Thereafter, the question generated is “which are those risks, and how can they effectively be addressed?”. This Thesis is aiming to identify those risks, specifically for the Greek wind energy sector, present the results of a quantitative risk analysis, and propose risk response strategies for each of the identified risks. For that purpose, a case-study in S. Euboea region was applied; a typical 8 MW onshore wind farm was designed inside a Wind Priority Area. The risk data were collected by a panel of experts, chosen to identify and quantify the potential risks through the implementation of the Delphi and the Project Risk FMEA (RFMEA) methods. The results showed 21 risks that should be considered when developing a wind power project in Greece, and also presented their response priority ranking, based on each <b>risk's</b> <b>ratings</b> inprobability, impact and detection factors. Afterwards, the risk response strategies, for each risk, were proposed, as those were collected by the experts panel group-interviewing.

40|$|The {{number of}} people {{affected}} by natural hazards is growing, as many {{regions of the world}} become subject to multiple hazards. Although volume of geophysical, sociological and economic knowledge is increasing, so are the losses from natural catastrophes. The slow transfer from theory to practice might lay in the difficulties of the communication process from science to policy-making, including perceptions by stakeholders from disaster mitigation practice regarding the usability of developed tools. As scientific evidence shows, decision-makers are faced with the challenge of not only mitigating against single hazards and risks, but also multiple risks, which must include the consideration of their interrelations. As the multi-hazard and risk concept is a relatively young area of natural risk governance, {{there are only a few}} multi-risk models and the experience of practitioners as to how to use these models is limited. To our knowledge, scientific literature on stakeholders' perceptions of multirisk models is lacking. In this article we identify perceptions of two decision-making tools, which involve multi-hazard and multi-risk. The first one is a generic, multi-risk framework based on the sequential Monte Carlo method to allow for a straightforward and flexible implementation of hazard interactions, which may occur in a complex system. The second is a decision-making tool that integrates directly input from stakeholders by attributing weights to different components and constructing <b>risks</b> <b>ratings.</b> Based on the feedback from stakeholders, we found that interest in multi-risk assessment is high but that its application remains hampered by the complexity of processes involved...|$|R

Another noteworthy result was the fact that a unidirectional causality between economic risk and share prices were found for India and China (and the BRICS countries as a group), but not for the other countries under review. This indicates the important role that the stock market plays in the economies of India and China and hence provides an extra caution for prospective investors in these countries. [URL]...|$|E
