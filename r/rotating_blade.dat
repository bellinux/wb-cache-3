500|$|Reaching {{the grand}} final meant {{defeating}} the axe-wielding robot Terrorhurtz. Razer avoided the axe and lowered its arm into Terrorhurtz's polycarbonate armour panels. Terrorhurtz {{lined up for}} another strike, but Razer slid its wedge underneath Terrorhurtz's chassis. It buried the arm into its opponent, carried Terrorhurtz to the pit release button, and dropped it into the pit. Only Tornado stood between Razer and a successful title defence. After twice losing to Razer that year, the developers of Tornado had constructed a large metal frame equipped with a <b>rotating</b> <b>blade.</b> Controversially qualifying as an [...] "interchangeable weapon", {{the size of this}} framework prevented Razer's claw from reaching Tornado's chassis. Team Razer responded by attaching a lifting hook {{to the front of the}} arm before the fight. Although Razer would still not be able to pierce Tornado, it could lift it by the framework. In the battle, Tornado used its superior pushing power to slam Razer into the arena wall and the house robots. Near the end of the fight, Razer managed to lift Tornado up and push it over the pit, but the size of the additional framework prevented Tornado from falling in. After a 45 minute discussion, the judges ruled in favour of Tornado becoming the new UK champion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rotated</b> <b>blades</b> are key {{mechanical}} components in turbomachinery and high cycle fatigues often induce blade cracks. Accurate detection of small cracks in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> is very significant for safety, reliability, and availability. In nature, a breathing crack model is {{fit for a}} small crack in a <b>rotated</b> <b>blade</b> rather than other models. However, traditional vibration displacements-based methods are less sensitive to nonlinear characteristics due to small breathing cracks. In order to solve this problem, vibration power flow analysis (VPFA) is proposed to analyze nonlinear dynamic behaviors of <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> with small breathing cracks in this paper. Firstly, local flexibility due to a crack is derived and then time-varying dynamic model of the <b>rotated</b> <b>blade</b> with a small breathing crack is built. Based on it, the corresponding vibration power flow model is presented. Finally, VPFA-based numerical simulations are done to validate nonlinear behaviors of the cracked blade. The results demonstrate that nonlinear behaviors of a crack can be enhanced by power flow analysis and VPFA is more sensitive to a small breathing crack than displacements-based vibration analysis. Bifurcations will occur due to breathing cracks and subharmonic resonance factors can be defined to identify breathing cracks. Thus the proposed method can provide a promising way for detecting and predicting small breathing cracks in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the flow characteristics of the laminar and the turbulent boundary layers on <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> of an axial-flow turbomachine, a theoretical analysis was performed taking the chord-wise pressure gradient into account with the aid of the rotating helical coordinates.

Next, a breathing crack model is adopted and eigenvalue analysis is used in coupled lumped-parameter model.

The results show that a crack causes natural frequency decease and vibration amplitude increase of cracked blade. Bifurcations will occur due to a breathing crack.
