25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and <b>resonant</b> <b>current</b> excites the LC circuit. This <b>resonant</b> <b>current</b> directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a zero-current-switched voltage-fed inverter equipped with resonant circuits on the AC side. The current flowing through a switching device, i. e., an IGBT is a {{sum of the}} load current and the <b>resonant</b> <b>current.</b> If the amplitude of the <b>resonant</b> <b>current</b> is larger {{than that of the}} load current, the current in a switching device becomes zero at an instant in each resonant cycle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} a new multi-oscillated <b>current</b> <b>resonant</b> type DC-DC converter. <b>Current</b> <b>resonant</b> converters have several remarkable features such as high efficiency, small size, low cost and low noise, and are frequently employed in many portable electronic systems such as personal computers, cellular phones and flat panel displays. The <b>current</b> <b>resonant</b> type converter generally employs pulse frequency modulation for constant voltage control in the output. For this reason, the magnetizing current through the converter not only causes a power loss under a light load, but also a loss during stand-by. Therefore, this type of converter has a problem in that the required smaller size cannot be achieved, because an auxiliary source is necessary for stand-by. In order to solve these problems, a new <b>current</b> <b>resonant</b> type power supply is proposed in which two driving methods are employed. In these driving methods, one MOSFET as a main switch is driven by an auxiliary winding of the transformer and another MOSFET as a main switch {{is driven by the}} driving IC with a low withstand voltage.

The physical implementation of the prototype includes the use of silicon carbide—SiC—semiconductors, which provide better switching capabilities than their traditional silicon—Si—counterparts.

Two techniques can be distinguished in X-ray medical imaging: fluoroscopy and radioscopy. The former involves low power radiation with a long exposure time, while radioscopy requires large power during short radiographic exposure times. Since the converter has to be designed by taking into account the maximum power specification, it will exhibit a poor efficiency when operating at low power levels. Such a problem can be solved by using a new multilevel LCC topology. This topology is based on a classical series-parallel resonant topology, but includes an additional low-voltage auxiliary transformer whose function depends on the X-ray technique considered. When radioscopy operation is selected, the transformer will allow the power to be shared between two full-bridges.
