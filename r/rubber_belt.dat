5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a <b>rubber</b> <b>belt.</b> A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed â€“ it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
25|$|The Challenger {{ultralight}} {{is a high}} wing, tricycle gear kit aircraft with a {{frame structure}} built from 6061-T6 aluminum alloy tubing fastened with aircraft grade AN bolts and rivets and covered with either presewn Dacron envelopes or standard aircraft fabric. The engine is mounted in pusher configuration and turns the propeller through a reduction drive that uses a cogged tooth <b>rubber</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s a Speedwalk {{system of}} people mover {{consisting}} of a continuous <b>rubber</b> <b>belt</b> system, was implemented in certain American cities. After considerable delay considering this and alternatives, British Railways let a contract on 4 July 1957 for the civil engineering works in driving a new sloping access tunnel, in which a pair of travolators (at the time often written Trav-O-Lator) would be installed by Waygood Otis. Otis did not, at this stage, get a contract.|$|E

Each camshaft has five bearings and is turned by individual cam gears on the front end. The camshafts, water pump and fan are driven by a fiberglass cord-reinforced neoprene <b>rubber</b> <b>belt,</b> much like the Vega [...] engine. The cylinder head has sintered iron valve seats and iron cast valve seats. Race-bred forged aluminum pistons with heat-treated forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods enhance durability.|$|E

Besides connecting the engine to a sprocket, the engine can also be connected directly to the crank.

50|$|Belts are {{calendered}} sheets {{consisting of}} a layer of rubber, a layer of closely spaced steel cords, and a second layer of <b>rubber.</b> <b>Belts</b> give the tire strength and dent resistance while allowing it to remain flexible.

50|$|Simple <b>rubber</b> <b>belt</b> (non-stretching fixed {{circumference}} manufactured using various highly {{durable and}} flexible materials) CVTs {{are commonly used}} in small motorized vehicles, where their mechanical simplicity {{and ease of use}} outweigh their comparative inefficiency. Nearly all snowmobiles, utility vehicles, golf carts and motor scooters use CVTs, typically the <b>rubber</b> <b>belt</b> or variable pulley variety. Many small tractors and self-propelled mowers for home and garden also use simple <b>rubber</b> <b>belt</b> CVT.

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} M7 was the track system (halftrack). The M7â€™s track ran on two <b>rubber</b> <b>belts</b> with four steel cables inside.

50|$|The St. Nicholas Breaker was {{constructed}} using 3,800 {{cubic yards of}} steel and 10,000 cubic yards of concrete. It contained 1.5 mi of conveyor lines, 20 mi of pipes, 25 mi of conduits, 118 mi of wire, and 26241 sq ft of <b>rubber</b> <b>belting.</b> The construction required half of the village of Suffolk to be relocated.|$|R
5000|$|Noise: Front-loaders tend {{to operate}} more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise, {{and because there}} {{is less of a}} {{tendency}} to imbalance. Top-loaders usually need a mechanical transmission, which can generate more noise than the <b>rubber</b> <b>belt</b> or direct drive found in most front loaders.|$|E
50|$|Dummy {{heads or}} pick-up headers feature spring-tined pickups, usually {{attached}} to a heavy <b>rubber</b> <b>belt.</b> They are used for crops {{that have already been}} cut and placed in windrows or swaths. This is particularly useful in northern climates such as western Canada where swathing kills weeds resulting in a faster dry down.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a design}} process for {{embedded}} UHF RFID tags for <b>rubber</b> transmission <b>belts,</b> {{based on a}} 3 D simulation approach is presented.

Additionally, various RFID tag structures were evaluated by embedding tests, concerning their chemical and mechanical compatibility to the rubber material, to determine a suitable fabricating technology. Furthermore, a life cycle test of the embedded tag in the physical belt is also carried out to determine the implementation of RFID technology in considered <b>rubber</b> <b>belts...</b>|$|R
