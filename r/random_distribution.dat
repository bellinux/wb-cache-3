As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that <b>random</b> <b>distribution</b> will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E

25|$|Michell was {{the first}} person to apply the new {{mathematics}} of statistics to the study of the stars, and demonstrated in a 1767 paper that many more stars occur in pairs or groups than a perfectly <b>random</b> <b>distribution</b> could account for. He focused his investigation on the Pleiades cluster, and calculated that the likelihood of finding such a close grouping of stars was about one in half a million. He concluded that the stars in these double or multiple star systems might be drawn to one another by gravitational pull, thus providing the first evidence for the existence of binary stars and star clusters. His work on double stars influenced Herschel’s research on the same topic.|$|E

In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, timed Petri nets have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the stochastic Petri nets that add nondeterministic time through adjustable randomness of the transitions.

The mechanical properties of any material with a discontinuous second phase dispersed in a matrix are recognized {{to be influenced}} by the distribution of the second-phase particles. Current models for the prediction of material properties from particle distributions are based on the assumption of a <b>random</b> particle <b>distribution.</b> Through computer simulation, nearest-neighbor particle spacings have been calculated for <b>random</b> and non-random <b>distributions.</b> For low fractions, <b>random</b> <b>distributions</b> approach the theoretical spacing predicted from consideration of random, infinitesimal points. For finite sized particles, increasing fraction results in larger spacings than predicted for infinitesimal points.

40|$|This is a pre-print. A new {{analytical}} {{theory for}} multiple scattering of cylindrical acoustic waves by {{an array of}} finite impedance semi-cylinders embedded in a smooth acoustically hard surface is derived by extending previous results for plane waves [Linton and Martin, J.

Although the computational demands of the new theory increase {{as the number of}} the semi-cylinders in the arrays and/or the frequency increases, the theory offers an improvement on analytical boss theories since the latter (i) are restricted to non-deterministic (infinite) <b>random</b> <b>distributions</b> of semi-cylinders with spacing/radii small compared to the incident wavelength and (ii) are derived only for plane waves. The influence on prediction accuracy of truncation of the infinite system of equations introduced by the new theory is explored empirically. Laboratory measurements have been made over deterministic random arrays of identical varnished wooden semi-cylinders on a glass plate. The agreement between predictions and measured relative sound pressure level spectra is very good both for single deterministic <b>random</b> <b>distributions</b> and for averages representing non-deterministic <b>random</b> <b>distributions.</b> The analytical theory is found to give identical results to a boundary element calculation but is much faster to compute...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{formulation of}} fiducial probability employed {{in this paper}} is an improvement over the usual pivotal quantity formulation. For a single parameter and single observation, the new formulation {{is based on the}} geometric properties of an ordinary two variable function and its surface representation. The following theorem is proved: A fiducial distribution for the continuous parameter θ exists if and only if (i) the continuous <b>random</b> probability <b>distributions</b> of x for different θ's are non-intersecting, and (ii) the <b>random</b> <b>distributions</b> are complete, i. e. at the extreme values of θ the limiting probability distributions are zero and one for all x. The proof yields also a complete characterization of <b>random</b> <b>distributions</b> that lead to fiducial distributions.

The latter, which are frequently encountered in a null hypothesis, are shown to be associated with intersecting "composite" distributions.

2500|$|The nest, {{consisting}} of a single comb, {{is the heart of}} the colony, where [...] food is stored and the immature brood reared. It is also the central spatial reference where the majority of individuals spend their time. P. dominula does not occupy the comb in <b>random</b> <b>distribution.</b> Each wasp spends the majority of its time on the comb in a relatively small area, around 12% of the comb. This small use of space is the norm, regardless of the number of wasps on the nest. However, this area could occasionally cover up to 50% of the comb. Dominant females occupy a smaller area than do subordinate foundresses and workers. Superimposition rates are low, which suggests that wasps limit each other's spaces. Workers prefer to overlap areas with other workers, while foundresses prefer to overlap areas with other foundresses. Around 70% of workers are active and occupy a small area of the comb, while the rest do not have particular fidelity areas and spend most of their time away from the nest or remaining motionless behind the nest. Alpha females are affected by cell content, resting more frequently on capped cells and avoiding empty ones.|$|E

2500|$|Aché foragers {{living in}} the forest share food extensively, and animal prey are divided up communally among band members. [...] Social norms proscribe men from eating {{anything}} from their own prey, and {{emphasize the importance of}} band-wide distributions. In essence, wild game is cooked and redistributed in equal portions to resident families, taking into account the size of each family that receives a portion. [...] This means that successful hunters and their families obtain no more meat from their own captured prey than would be expected by a <b>random</b> <b>distribution</b> to resident families. Palm starch produced in large batches is shared {{in a manner similar to}} meat (but with no overt taboo against women consuming some of the starch they have extracted). Honey is somewhat less widely shared, but large portions are saved for members absent at the time of extraction. [...] Collected fruits and insect larva are even less widely shared but are still redistributed to those not present at a collection site. A hunter's nuclear family usually consumes about 10% of the game brought in by the male head of the household. [...] For most other resources the nuclear family of the acquirer keeps less than 50% for their own consumption, but only 10-20% of small collected fruits are shared outside the family. More recent analyses show that high acquisition variance resources are shared more widely, that the amount of most foods shared is contingent on amount received across dyads of potential sharing partners, and that needy families consistently receive more than they give. Reservation food sharing patterns show that people who are more generous are more likely to receive help and support when they become sick or injured.|$|E

The distribution of the adipose tissue IS thickest close to the body wall. This thick layer of adipose tissue at close to the body wall is believed to provide a [...] "safety factor" [...] for the structural elements of the skin ( [...] i.e. collagen fibers) near the body wall. The thick layer of adipose tissue is more compliant than the structural elements of the body wall (i.e. ribs, muscles), therefore will more readily deform(absorb force) before the structural elements of the skin experience a force. The layer of adipose tissue also [...] aids {{in the creation of the}} domed and cambered shape of the patagia. With regards to the {{structure of}} the dermal layer of the patagia, there is a thick layer of collagen fibers oriented parallel to the axis of the patagial ribs.
