The impact of corrosion on hydraulic systems and its components is well understood; however, the protection provided by different hydraulic fluids is not equal 1. Review of military vehicle hydraulic systems identified the most common occurrences of critical corrosion are found in hoses, hose end fittings, actuator arms, pistons, cylinders, and rams 1. To prevent corrosion in hydraulic systems, the U. S. Army has specified the use of hydraulic fluids with corrosion preventing and <b>rust</b> <b>inhibiting</b> characteristics for ground vehicles. Currently, the Army uses three different types of fluids in the hydraulic systems of military ground vehicles and equipment; MIL-PRF- 46170, MIL-PRF- 6083, and MIL-PRF- 2104.

40|$|The {{action of}} various alloys: 440 C steel, M- 50 steel, Pyrowear 675, Cronidur 30 and Ti(4 Al, 4 Mn); {{the effect of}} decradation inhibitors: mono- and diphospha-s-triazines, di{{phosphate}}traazacyclooctatetraene, phosphate esters, phosphate/ diester <b>rust</b> <b>inhibiting</b> mixtures, and a phosphine were evaluated in two poly(hexafluoropropene oxide) fluids (143 AC and 16256). The degradation promoting action of the ferrous alloys in 16256 fluid were comparable; Ti(4 Al, 4 Mn) alloy was significantly more detrimental. The overall rating of the additives was: phosphates (greater than) phosphate/diester mixture (greater than) phosphine (greater than or equal to) phospha-s-triazines. The 16256 fluid was less responsive to additive inhibition than 143 AC. Phosphate esters were fully effective over 24 hour exposure in the 16256 / 440 C steel and the 16256 /Ti(4 Al, 4 Mn) systems at 330 C.

It was widely spread in almost all soybean {{production}} areas in the world. Yield losses can reach 85 %. One of the control measured was sprayed {{with a mixture of}} clove oil and neem extract. The objective of the research was found the information of the clove oil and neem extract effectivity control soybean rust. The research consisted of two phases as followed: 1) the efficacy of clove oil and neem extract dilution control soybean rust disease. 2) the efficacy of clove oil, neem extract and soap berry (Sapindus rarak) extract control soybean rust disease. The research was conducted at Kendalpayak Experimental Station and the green house of Indonesian Legumes and Tuber Crops Research Institute, Malang District, in dry season of 2012 and 2013 respectively. The research was arranged in randomized block design. Treatments were various comparison between clove oil, neem extract and soap berry. Parameters observed were rust disease intensity and yield components.

50|$|However, {{there has}} been a {{simultaneous}} revival in the fortunes of old-style hand-forged ironmongery, with strong interest in the authentic restoration of period homes leading to demand for items such as traditional iron door handles, door knobs, door knockers, letter plates, locks, hinges, hooks, cabinet fittings and window furniture. There has even been renewed use of “blacksmith nails” - four-sided hand-made rosehead nails. This is typical of a trend that has seen greater appreciation of designs that have stood the test of time, that has allowed hand-forged ironmongery to find a much wider application than use in property restoration - although the practice of incorporating traditional ironmongery into contemporary housing has been helped by thoroughly modern techniques like galvanising and powder coating to <b>inhibit</b> <b>rust.</b>|$|R

40|$|Populus cathayana Rehd., a {{dioecious}} tree species, {{is widely}} {{distributed in the}} northern, central and southwestern regions of China. In poplars, Melampsora larici-populina Kleb. is mainly responsible for rust disease, which {{is considered to be}} the world's most important disease of poplars. Yet, little is known about sex-related responses to rust disease in poplars. The purpose of this work was to determine whether sexually different responses occur in the antioxidant system of poplars after infection by rust disease. Three-month-old male and female P. cathayana individuals were inoculated with M. larici-populina in a greenhouse. After 12 days of incubation, we investigated the changes in physiology, biochemistry, enzyme activities and isozyme profiles. It was discovered that (i) leaf <b>rust</b> disease <b>inhibited</b> photosynthesis, caused oxidative stress and cellular membrane damage and changed antioxidant enzyme activities and isozyme profiles in poplar leaves; (ii) male poplars suffered from lower infection levels and less negative effects of leaf rust disease than did females; (iii) males showed higher antioxidant activities and less H 2 O 2 accumulation than did females after being infected by leaf rust. Thus, our results indicate that leaf rust disease is more severe in female poplars, and they suffer from greater negative effects than do males. This is the first report about sexually different responses of poplars in the antioxidant reactions to rust disease. It offers some useful information about the effect of leaf rust on dioecious plants, especially on dioecious woody plants.

40|$|The {{effects of}} exposing 23 {{specimens}} of optical and thermal control materials to space at 120 km altitude for over 40 hrs during the STS- 8 mission are discussed. Ten samples of paint targeted for the Space Telescope (ST) and the Tethered Satellite were exposed, and included polyurethane, oxide, silicone, and glossy {{black and white}} samples which were scanned for alterations in the optical properties after being retrieved. Nine mirror-type materials were also investigated, along with silver specimens typical of solar cell interconnects. The oxygen flow at the orbital altitude was 3. 5 x 10 to the 20 th atoms/cu cm. The exposures caused no degradation of the magnesium fluoride mirror coatings, while the Kapton coating for the ST solar cell panels showed evidence of losing thickness. The Ag solar cell contacts will require coatings to extend their lifetimes. Overcoatings were also proven necessary for <b>inhibiting</b> degradation of <b>painted</b> surfaces...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} paper, {{the effect on}} Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) of two {{commercial}} acrylic-based paints were compared: one (Paint A) for indoor applications, the other (Paint B) for indoor/outdoor applications. Both were applied on an inert and on a real mortar substrate. The possibility of Paint B to passively improve IAQ was also investigated when adding highly porous adsorbent fillers, both as addition or as total replacement of a conventional siliceous one. The obtained results show that all paints have high capacity to <b>inhibit</b> biological growth. <b>Paint</b> A is more breathable {{and it has a}} higher moisture buffering capacity. Paint B negatively modifies the beneficial properties of the mortar substrate for IAQ. However, the use of unconventional fillers, especially as addition to the formulation, allows the recovery of the same properties of the substrate or even the enhancement of about 20 % of the ability to adsorb volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under the current test conditions...|$|R
40|$|On a Continuous Hot-Dip-Galvanizing Line,steel strip is {{coated with}} a thin film of zinc to <b>inhibit</b> <b>rusting.</b> The zinc coating has to meet quality {{standards}} relating to thickness (coating mass) and uniformity (mass distribution). This thesis details {{the implementation of a}} computer based control system, to control the coating mass and distribution of zinc on steel strip, on the No. 3 Continuous Galvanizing Line at John Lysaght (Australia) Limited 2 ̆ 7 s Port Kembla plant. Computer control is used to overcome transport lag problems which occur because it is necessary to place the coating mass gauge some sixty metres downstream. from the coating mass control equipment. A static mathematical model of the process, which has been developed at Lysaghts, is adapted continuously on-line. Model prediction is used for feedforward control, which corrects for process and reference changes, while steady state accuracy of coating mass is maintained by feedback control. The latter is a pulse-andwait system,based on a linear incremental model, which is adapted to maintain optimum response. A ten percent saving in zinc usage resulted from the installation of the coating mass gauge and the mechanisation of the mass control equipment. Computer control added a further three percent in zinc savings and a considerable improvement in product quality (uniformity) This thirteen percent reduction in zinc usage represents a monetary saving in excess of 0. 5 million per annum, giving a pay back period of less than twelve months...|$|R
40|$|Phenolic {{secondary}} metabolites {{are often}} thought to protect plants against attack by microbes but {{their role in}} defense against pathogen infection in woody plants has not been comprehensively investigated. We studied the biosynthesis, occurrence and anti-fungal activity of flavan- 3 -ols in black poplar (Populus nigra L.), which include both monomers, such as catechin, and oligomers known as proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified and biochemically characterized three leucoanthocyanidin reductases (LAR) and two anthocyanidin reductases (ANR) from P. nigra involved in catalyzing the last steps of flavan- 3 -ol biosynthesis leading {{to the formation of}} catechin [2, 3 -trans-(+) -flavan- 3 -ol] and epicatechin [2, 3 -cis-(-) -flavan- 3 -ol] respectively. Poplar trees that were inoculated with the biotrophic rust fungus (Melampsora larici-populina) accumulated higher amounts of catechin and PAs than uninfected trees. The de novo synthesized catechin and PAs in the rust infected poplar leaves accumulated significantly at the site of fungal infection in the lower epidermis. In planta concentrations of these compounds strongly <b>inhibited</b> <b>rust</b> spore germination and reduced hyphal growth. Poplar genotypes with constitutively higher levels of catechin and PAs as well as hybrid aspen overexpressing the MYB 134 transcription factor were more resistant to rust infection. Silencing PnMYB 134, on the other hand, decreased flavan- 3 -ol biosynthesis and increased susceptibility to rust infection. Taken together, our data indicate that catechin and PAs are effective anti-fungal defenses in poplar against foliar rust infection...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} biofilm {{growth on}} paints under field conditions, {{we developed a}} modified approach enabling subsequent Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) for the three-dimensional analysis of undisturbed samples. Painted polycarbonate slides were glued on polycarbonate panels mounted on a test raft in a harbour, and one slide per paint and depth was used {{on each of the}} five sampling dates over three months. On seven out of ten paints, biomass dry weight and chlorophyll a of biofilms increased nearly linearly over time whereas biofilm development was <b>inhibited</b> on three <b>paints.</b> Quantitative CLSM results revealed that extracellular polymeric substances were the dominating component of the biofilms. Since top-view CLSM did not enable the complete observation of thick biofilms, cryosections were prepared to determine biofilm thickness. Results of biofilm thickness were comparable to those of biomass and chlorophyll. The vertical extension of CLSM top-view images was not related to biomass dry weight and to biofilm thickness from cryosections and was, therefore, no suitable measure for biofilm characterisation. In contrast, biofilm thickness measured from cryosections was positively related to biomass dry weight indicating the need of cryosections for thick biofilms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Surfaces {{submerged}} {{in the sea}} are rapidly covered by biofilm and later macrofouling. Biofouling on ship hulls spread exotic species to new habitats and are {{at the same time}} an economical burden. In the past paints with TBT has had great effect against fouling but also had have grave consequences for the marine life leading to an international ban in 2010 and a demand for environmentally friendly antifouling coatings has arisen. In the present project coatings with different active compounds was prepared on microscope slides. The coatings, with both experimental and commercial paints, were submerged for 22 days in the Bay of Oman. The commercial paints had copper and a mixture of copper and zinc pyrithione as active compounds. The experimental paints had zinc oxide, zinc sulphide and aerogel with active compound x, zinc sulphide and aerogel without active compound, zinc sulphide without aerogel, zinc sulphide with commercial protease, zinc oxide without aerogel and titandioxide as active compounds. To harmonize the surfaces black nitrocellulose filters were attached on the slides for bacterial counts with DAPI staining. The filters were collected over time to determine bacterial and macrofouling succession. The bacterial density increased over time for all treatments and most for the treatments with commercial paints. The lowest counts were observed in the Control samples and the engineered paints had counts in between. The commercial <b>paints</b> <b>inhibited</b> quorum sensing in reporter strain C. violaceum CV 017. Community analysis of microfouling by fatty acid analysis, in the first experiment, revealed when statistical analyzed by ANOSIM that the Control differed from most of the other treatments and that the commercial paint also differed from one of the engineered treatments. The statistically analysis SIMPER revealed that the fatty acid community was dominated by few fatty acids present in all the treatments. Differences between treatments were determined by the density among the dominating fatty acids. At the same time a temporal succession in fatty acids was observed. Contrary general assumptions and results the commercial antifouling paints with the highest fouling inhibition had the highest bacterial counts which must result from biofilm development of bacteria resistant to the active compounds copper and zinc pyrithione used in these treatments. The poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) C 18 : 2 ω 9, 12 was found in samples the Control, treatment MUZ and treatments T 40 and T 44 which have been connected to the groups of Cytophagales or Proteobacteria. Fatty acid profiles from several treatments had similarities to fatty acids profiles extracted from fluorescent Pseudomonas. The surfaces with commercial paints had the lowest abundance of macrofouling recorded. The Control samples had the highest algae and invertebrate density and the engineered paints had fouling abundances within the range of the Controls and the commercial paints. The treatments with zinc sulphide without aerogel and zinc sulphide and aerogel with enzyme x had the poorest antifouling activity against macrofouling along with the Control. The commercial paints demonstrated both a broad fouling inhibition against all macrofouling organisms encountered.
