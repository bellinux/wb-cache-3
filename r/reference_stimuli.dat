50|$|In {{this more}} general {{form of the}} Rasch model for dichotomous data, the score on a {{particular}} item {{is defined as the}} count of the number of threshold locations on the latent trait surpassed by the individual. It should be noted, however, that {{this does not mean that}} a measurement process entails making such counts in a literal sense; rather, threshold locations on a latent continuum are usually inferred from a matrix of response data through an estimation process such as Conditional Maximum likelihood estimation. In general, the central feature of the measurement process is that individuals are classified into one of a set of contiguous, or adjoining, ordered categories. A response format employed in a given experimental context may achieve this in a number of ways. For example, respondents may choose a category they perceive best captures their level of endorsement of a statement (such as 'strongly agree'), judges may classify persons into categories based on well-defined criteria, or a person may categorise a physical stimulus based on perceived similarity to a set of <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of tactile stimuli presented on a moving hand is systematically suppressed. Such suppression has {{been attributed to}} the limited capacity of the brain to process task-irrelevant sensory information. Here, we examined whether humans do not only suppress movement-irrelevant but also enhance in parallel movement-relevant tactile signals when performing a goal-directed reaching movement. Participants reached to either a visual (LED) or somatosensory target (thumb or index finger of their unseen static hand) and discriminated two simultaneously presented tactile stimuli: a <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> on the little finger of their static hand and a comparison stimulus on the index finger of their moving hand. Thus, during somatosensory reaching the location of the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> was task-relevant. Tactile suppression, as reflected by the increased points-of-subjective-equality (PSE) and just-noticeable-differences (JND), was stronger during reaching to somatosensory than visual targets. In experiment 2, we presented the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> at a task-irrelevant location (sternum) and found similar suppression for somatosensory and visual reaching. This suggests that participants enhanced the sensation of the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> at the target hand during somatosensory reaching in experiment 1. This suggestion was confirmed in experiment 3 using a detection task in which we found lower detection thresholds on the target hand during somatosensory but not during visual reaching. We postulate that humans can flexibly modulate their tactile sensitivity by suppressing movement-irrelevant and enhancing movement-relevant signals in parallel when executing a reaching movement...|$|R

As has been pointed out by Lages and Treisman (1998 Vision Research 38 557 - 572), the usual measure of performance depends only {{on the effect of}} test variations on the responses. The Weber fraction characterizing performance is more properly called the test stimulus Weber fraction. We measure the relative contribution of the test and reference to the response by the ratio of the test Weber fraction to the reference Weber fraction.

Interstimulus intervals (ISI) of 50, 200 and 2000 msec and intertrial intervals (ITI) of 500 and 2500 msec were investigated. When the ISI was short (50 or 200 msec), for both ITIs, responses were determined equally by the test and reference.

40|$|To study prelexical {{processes}} {{involved in}} visual word recognition a task is needed that only operates {{at the level of}} abstract letter identities. The masked priming same-different task has been purported to do this, as the same pattern of priming is shown for words and nonwords. However, studies using this task have consistently found a processing advantage for words over nonwords, indicating a lexicality effect. We investigated the locus of this word advantage. Experiment 1 used conventional visually-presented <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli</b> to test previous accounts of the lexicality effect. Results rule out the use of different strategies, or strength of representations, for words and nonwords. No interaction was shown between prime type and word type, but a consistent word advantage was found. Experiment 2 used novel auditorally-presented <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli</b> to restrict nonword matching to the sublexical level. This abolished scrambled priming for nonwords, but not words. Overall this suggests the processing advantage for words over nonwords results from activation of whole-word, lexical representations.

The original reference images, Standard <b>Reference</b> <b>Stimuli</b> (SRS), were in the form of photographic prints, to be viewed under controlled lighting and fixed viewing conditions. This method was then extended for scenes presented on computer monitors as Digital <b>Reference</b> <b>Stimuli</b> (DRS). This softcopy ruler method was developed as part of the Camera Phone Image Quality (CPIQ) Initiative and has now been adopted as an updated ISO 20462 method (ISO 20462 - 3 : 2012). This extended method of using the softcopy rulers was validated by CPIQ using two systems of laboratory lighting and display. That effort, while successful, required significant effort and resources to accomplish.

In our study, we investigate whether and to what extent the ISO 20462 softcopy ruler method can be adapted to Internet-based subjective evaluations. Our objective is to develop and test a method that uses a commercial online survey service. We describe several limitations to be overcome, including image file size, and a static interface rather than one allowing dynamic updating of the reference image.

40|$|Visible {{persistence}} {{refers to}} the continuation of visual perception after the physical termination of a stimulus. We studied an extreme case of visible persistence by presenting two matrices of randomly distributed black and white pixels in succession. On the transition from one matrix to the second, the luminance polarity of all pixels within a disk- or annulus-shaped area reversed, physically creating a single second-order transient signal. This transient signal produces the percept of a disk or an annulus with an abrupt onset and a gradual offset. To study {{the nature of this}} fading percept we varied spatial parameters, such as the inner and the outer diameter of annuli (Experiment I) and the radius and eccentricity of disks (Experiment III), and measured the duration of visible persistence by having subjects adjust the synchrony of the onset of a reference stimulus with the onset or the offset of the fading percept. We validated this method by comparing two modalities of the <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli</b> (Experiment I) and by comparing the judgments of fading percepts with the judgments of stimuli that actually fade in luminance contrast (Experiment II). The results show that (i) irrespective of the reference modality, participants are able to precisely judge the on- and the offsets of the fading percepts, (ii) auditory <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli</b> lead to higher visible persistence durations than visual ones, (iii) visible persistence duration increases with the thickness of annuli and the diameter of disks, but decreases with the diameter of annuli, irrespective of stimulus eccentricity. These effects cannot be explained by stimulus energy, which suggests that more complex processing mechanisms are involved. Seemingly contradictory effects of disk and annulus diameter can be unified by assuming an abstract filling-in mechanism that speeds up with the strength of the edge signal and takes more time the larger the stimulus area is...|$|E

When judging noise and vibration, there is no basis for deciding whether magnitude estimation should be performed with a <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> (i. e., relative magnitude estimation, RME) or without a <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> (i. e., absolute magnitude estimation, AME). Twenty subjects rated the discomfort caused by thirteen magnitudes of whole-body vertical vibration and 13 levels of noise, by both RME and AME on three occasions. There were high correlations between magnitude estimates of discomfort and the magnitudes of vibration and noise. Both RME and AME provided rates of growth of discomfort with high consistency over the three repetitions. When judging noise, RME was more consistent than AME, with less inter-subject variability in the exponent, ns. When judging vibration, RME was also more consistent than AME, but with greater inter-subject variability in the exponent, nv.

Such biases have been reported in the common two-alternative forced choice (2 AFC) experiments, where participants are instructed to compare two consecutively presented stimuli. However, the principles underlying these biases are largely unknown and previous studies have typically used ad-hoc explanations to account for them. Here we consider human performance in the 2 AFC tone frequency discrimination task, utilizing two standard protocols. In both protocols, each trial contains a <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus.</b> In one (Reference-Lower protocol), the frequency of the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> is always lower than that of the comparison stimulus, whereas in the other (Reference protocol), the frequency of the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> is either lower or higher than that of the comparison stimulus. We find substantial interval biases. Namely, participants perform better when the reference is in a specific interval. Surprisingly, the biases in the two experiments are opposite: performance is better when the reference is in the first interval in the Reference protocol, but is better when the reference is second in the Reference-Lower protocol. This inconsistency refutes previous accounts of the interval bias, and is resolved when experiments statistics is considered. Viewing perception as incorporation of sensory input with prior knowledge accumulated during the experiment accounts for the seemingly contradictory biases both qualitatively and quantitatively. The success of this account implies that even simple discriminations reflect a combination of sensory limitations, memory limitations, and the ability to utilize stimuli statistics...|$|R

When participants {{were asked to respond to}} the appearance of a simple stimulus such as a luminance blob, the perceptual latency measured against a standard <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> was up to 40 [*]ms longer for a larger stimulus. In other words, the smaller stimulus was perceived to occur earlier than the larger one. RT on the other hand was hardly affected by size.

Equal sensation contours in terms of seat acceleration showed data similar to those in the literature.

In adaptation conditions the index finger that explored the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> had previously been adapted to another rubber stimulus.

We conclude that recent sensory experience causes a shift of haptically perceived softness away from the softness of the adaptation stimulus. The finding that perceived softness is susceptible to adaptation suggests that there might be neural chan-nels tuned to different softness values and softness is an independent primary perceptual quality.

Twelve subjects were exposed to sinusoidal continuous vibrations at five frequencies (3. 15 – 8. 0 Hz) and at three magnitudes (0. 5 – 2. 0 m s? 2 rms). They were also exposed to transient vibrations that were modulated one-and-half cycle sinusoidal waveforms at the same frequencies as the continuous vibrations and at three magnitudes corresponding to the magnitudes used for the continuous vibrations. Discomfort was measured by the method of magnitude estimation with <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli</b> having frequency components {{in the middle of the}} frequency range used in this study. The driving-point dynamic responses (the ratio between the force and the motion, i. e., acceleration and velocity, at the driving point) were also measured and divided by the responses to the <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli</b> used in the measurement of discomfort so as to allow the comparison of the dynamic responses with the discomfort responses. Both the discomfort estimates and the normalised driving-point dynamic responses were influenced by the stimuli magnitudes, especially with the continuous vibration. At 3. 15 and 4. 0 Hz, the discomfort estimates and the normalised mechanical impedance and apparent mass increased significantly with increases in vibration magnitude from 0. 5 – 2. 0 m s? 2 rms. Magnitude estimates for discomfort were correlated with the normalised mechanical impedance and apparent mass in the frequency range investigated. For the transient vibrations, the discomfort estimates and the driving-point dynamic responses were interpreted as responses in frequency bands around the fundamental frequency of the input motion. The results indicate similar nonlinearities in discomfort and driving-point dynamic responses associated with the principal body response within the range 3. 15 – 8 Hz. The nonlinearity in discomfort at these frequencies may be partially caused by the nonlinear dynamic response of the body and is sufficient to require consideration in methods of predicting discomfort caused by vertical whole-body vibration...|$|E
40|$|International audienceConjugated {{forms of}} odorants {{contributing}} to sweat odor occur {{not only in}} human sweat but also in amniotic fluid, colostrum, and milk. However, {{it is unclear whether}} the released odorants are detected and hedonically discriminated by human newborns. To investigate this issue, we administered highly diluted solutions of (R) /(S) - 3 -methyl- 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol (MSH), (R) /(S) - 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol (SH), (E) /(Z) - 3 -methylhex- 2 -enoic acid (3 M 2 H), and (R) /(S) - 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylhexanoic acid (HMHA) to 3 -d-old infants while their respiratory rate and oro-facial movements were recorded. Adult sensitivity to these odorants was assessed via triangle tests. Whereas no neonatal stimulus-specific response was found for respiratory rate, oro-facial reactivity indicated orthonasal detection of MSH and SH by male neonates, and of HMHA by the whole group of neonates. Dependent on the dilution of odorants, newborns evinced neutral responses or longer negative oro-facial expressions compared with the <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Finally, newborns appeared to be more sensitive to the target odorants than did adults...|$|E
40|$|In the {{synchrony}} judgment paradigm, observers {{judge whether}} a click precedes or follows {{the onset of}} a light flash and, on other trials, {{whether or not a}} click precedes light termination. The interclick interval defines the duration of visible persistence. An elaboration of this method consists of two phases: In Phase 1, the luminance of a reference stimulus is psychophysically matched to the peak brightness of the test flash. Five luminance values between. 1 and 1. 0 of the reference stimulus are used subsequently. In Phase 2, a random one of the five <b>reference</b> <b>stimuli,</b> a test flash, and a click are presented; the observer judges whether the click occurred before or after the brightness of test flash reached the reference value (on onset trials) or decayed below it (on termination trials). This method was validated on 3 subjects with test stimuli whose luminance rises and decays slowly in time, and then was used to trace out the precise subjective rise and decay (temporal brightness response function) of brief flashes.

40|$|Purpose. Magnussen and Dyrnes (1994) {{claimed that}} Ss {{presented}} with a reference grating can employ a long-term visual memory of up to 50 hrs to discriminate differences in spatial frequency between the reference {{and a set of}} test stimuli. We investigated whether Ss performing this task use the spatial frequency information provided by the test stimuli rather than a long-term memory. Methods. A sinusoidal grating with spatial frequency of 2. 5 cpd in one condition, and 5. 0 cpd in another, served as a <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus.</b> This was presented for 10 secs on a calibrated CRT display linearized in luminance. After a 30 sec retention interval, stimuli from a set of 11 spatial frequencies were presented in random order for 200 msecs each. On each trial Ss judged whether the test grating was higher or lower in spatial frequency than the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Three sets of test gratings were generated each ranging from - 0. 5 to + 0. 25 octave around the midpoint. The midpoints were 2. 25, 2. 5 and 2. 75 cpd in one condition and 4. 5, 5. 0 and 5. 5 cpd in the other. Ss received the different sets of test stimuli in three sessions on consecutive days. Results. Psychometric functions (Weibull) were fitted to the individual data and analyses of variance were performed on the parameters of these functions. Thresholds shifted to the midpoints of the test sets without change in the shapes of the functions, with one exception. Conclusions. The results suggest that long-term storage and retrieval of spatial frequency information is not necessary to perform this task. An explanation can be offered in terms of criterion setting theory (Treisman &# 38; Williams, 1984) in which the information provided by the test stimuli determines the location of the midpoint. These findings are supported by a second experiment involving gratings with different orientations...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} how a community sample {{of young women}} perceives and judges size. The main aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether individual characteristics, in particular disordered eating characteristics, affected performance on a perceptual size judgement task. A final sample of 79 participants ranged in age from 17 to 38 years (M = 19. 77, SD = 3. 79) and was recruited from introductory courses and the general community of the University of Queensland. All participants completed a perceptual task followed by an online survey. An outline resembling a door frame of a fixed size was presented as the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> followed by the target stimulus: a silhouette of a female’s body that was narrower than, equal to, or wider than the <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The participants were instructed to determine whether the silhouette would fit through the door frame on each trial, and accuracy and response times were recorded in a baseline condition and priming condition. The online survey consisted of demographic questions and psychological measures, including the Eating Disorder Inventory- 3, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales- 21, and the Space Relations subscale of the Differential Aptitude Tests. Results of the perceptual task revealed that the task was being performed as expected, however the accuracy of responses for the priming condition did not significantly differ from the baseline condition. Individuals considered low on the eating disorder risk composite score (EDRC) did not significantly differ from the high EDRC group for accuracy of responses in either task condition. The results suggest that misperceptions of body size and shape, which are often associated with individuals with disorder eating characteristics, do not extend to external objects. Accordingly, this supports the notion that body size overestimations are an outcome of distorted cognitions, rather than an underlying perceptual abnormality...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{experiments}} {{are described in}} which brightness constancy was studied in a Ganzfeld environment. Luminance variation by means of neutral density filters was applied to stimuli consisting of a Ganzfeld with superimposed disks. To this end, a special-purpose apparatus was constructed. Sequential dichoptical brightness matches with a <b>reference</b> <b>stimulus</b> were carried out for the disks {{as well as the}} homogeneous surround. The results of these measurements indicate that (1) besides a clear tendency toward brightness constancy, small but systematic effects of the average luminance level are present and (2) the brightness of the Ganzfeld is hardly affected by the presence of the disks. Finally, it is shown that the experimental results can be modeled adequately in terms of a concept that involves an accumulation of contrast information...|$|R
