40|$|This {{contribution}} to the Re-thinking of Belgium attempts to share our position on the current and future regulation of utilities in our country. We deliberately opt not to offer an exhaustive list of regulatory challenges based on thorough economic analysis. Our main goal is {{to participate in a}} welcomed open reform debate. The main messages are that we need (i) more stable and thought- through policy visions resulting from sound economics, clearer roles for all actors involved, more coordination between regulators and (ii) less dependent regulators, less <b>regulatory</b> <b>creep</b> and fewer unnecessary low-powered incentive schemes.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a first {{assessment}} of the so-called Significant Market Power regime in the European electronic communications sector nearly two years after its implementation. It details the substantive rules and the institutional design of the regime. It shows that, out of the six governance principles that the regime was deemed to achieve, two principles (flexibility and transparency) are broadly met, two principles (objectivity and harmonisation) are much better achieved than before, but still insufficiently met, and two principles (proportionality and legal certainty) may not be achieved. The paper submits that these shortcomings are {{due to the fact}} that the regime did not sufficiently take into account the incentives of regulatory agencies, was partly based on false assumptions, and did not arbitrate enough between different policy choices. Yet the paper suggests that the Significant Market Power regime should not be substantially reformed in the near future, but instead that regulators should change their attitudes: national regulators should take the principle of proportionality much more seriously and adopt a clearer strategy, while other regulatory agencies should ensure the absence of <b>regulatory</b> <b>creep</b> and greater harmonisation more actively. Key words: Regulation, Electronic communications, European Union, Governance principles and Institutional design. � The challenges of the electronic communications sector The re-launch of the Lisbon strategy was accompanied by widespread acknowledgement that achieving policy objectives depends on the quality of the governance principles for regulatory actions, which, in turn, depends on underlying institutional design 1. In electronic communications, this three factor relationship was clearly recognised in the definition of the Ne...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the potential for the}} application of competition law in the banking sector to eclipse financial regulation. Financial regulation has changed in response to the global financial crisis. Competition law acts to promote the interests of consumers, whereas finance regulation at best only protects the interests of consumers. Successful use of leniency provisions means that competition law is achieving successes in punishing financial institutions that have engaged in cartel conduct. This success may lead to <b>regulatory</b> scope <b>creep</b> and the application of abuse of market power provisions in the financial sector unless financial regulation can be seen to be for the benefit of consumers, rather than the regulated...|$|R
40|$|Tesis (magister en derecho internacional) The recent globalized economy, and the {{substantial}} number of bilateral and multilateral agreements that have been signed, have become a constant incentive to foreign investors willing {{to invest in a}} host State. For its part, the host State is also concerned with investments, specifically with the restraint on its regulatory powers when it is in compliance with its treaties. Many countries today receive a great amount of foreign direct investment (FDI). It is this substantial level of FDI {{that is part of the}} source of the rapid development of countries we see these days. The idea of State expropriation is an act which is recognized in the international plane, which it is established pursuant the public interest and its requirements. The problem arises when the act does not regard a direct taking which is “more noticeable”, but appears certain conducts of the State disguised as “measure pursuant the public interest”, when actually is trying to control or deprive the investor form its peaceful enjoyment of its assets without the proper compensation. I will deal with the different concepts of expropriation, indirect expropriation in its different forms, such as <b>regulatory</b> takings, <b>creeping</b> expropriation, and measures tantamount to expropriation in order to establish how government’s measures take place and harm private owners. I will analyze the current treaties on investment, the principles that can be extracted in today’s BIT and Regional Agreements such as NAFTA, and the main problem of the lack of a concrete definition of expropriation, which today is saved by the principles of international customary law. Then I will analyze the denominator problem, which deals with the dilemma Courts face when determining the extent of damage to the property owner’s assets, which may regard a compensable act of expropriation, the way courts try to define the relevant parcel affected by the government’s measure, and if that harm amounts a damage to the investment, great enough to be compensable, or simply regards a burden, the investor must bear, in order for the State to fulfill the public interest. Finally I will analyze the recent jurisprudence regarding foreign investor claims against outright deprivations by the host State, and the evolution of the diverse concepts and principles extracted of those awards. To summarize I will establish when the State has the legitimacy to affect foreign private property, under what circumstances can do so, when privates have been affected in their property, in a way that entitles them to compensation for the harm caused by the State, when can we talk about expropriation or indirect expropriation of investment (affectation of property at its core and to its periphery), and finally what are the principles that can be extracted through the different treaties signed, the diverse concepts regarding indirect expropriation and of the recent jurisprudence on these muddied matters judges are somewhat reluctant to address in the international plane...|$|R
