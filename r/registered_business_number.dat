30|$|Improve {{regulations}} for (innovative) enterprises and implement reforms: As of 2012, {{according to the}} World Bank (2012) report, regulations are still very high for new firms in Greece, hindering or imposing substantial cost to both innovators and researchers who are seeking to commercialize their invention through new business ventures. Administrative efforts for start-up activities need to be substantially reduced. This should include {{reducing the number of}} days needed to <b>register</b> new <b>businesses,</b> the <b>number</b> of bureaucratic steps involved in this process, as well as the number of regulations, fees and reporting duties. As a benchmark, Greece should aim to realize permanent business registration within one day. To become a fast and efficient public administration, Greece must implement state of the art e-administration for all <b>businesses,</b> (e.g. <b>registering</b> online new <b>businesses,</b> tax declaration, each within one hour). Instead of relaxing on its improvement from the 109 th to 78 th place, Greece needs to become one of World Bank’s top 20 when it comes to “Ease of doing business”, as a couple of EU-countries recently succeeded to do. Moreover, all reforms already approved by legislation (mentioned before) and those reforms that still need to pass parliament will only become effective once implemented and enforced by courts. To support the necessary adjustment processes, administrative officials need to be appropriately trained.|$|R
