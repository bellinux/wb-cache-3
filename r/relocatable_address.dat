50|$|The HLA Back Engine (HLABE) is a {{compiler}} {{back end}} that translates an internal intermediate language into low-level Portable Executable (PE), Common Object File Format (COFF), Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), or Mach-O object code. An HLABE program mostly consists of data (byte) emission statements, 32-bit <b>relocatable</b> <b>address</b> statements, x86 control-transfer instructions, and various directives. In addition to translating the byte and <b>relocatable</b> <b>address</b> statements into the low-level object code format, HLABE also handles branch-displacement optimization (picking the shortest possible {{form of a}} branch instruction).|$|E
50|$|The {{assembler}} for the System/360 Model 67 Time Sharing System had {{a number}} of differences in directives to support unique TSS features. The PSECT directive generated a Prototype Control Section containing <b>relocatable</b> <b>address</b> constants and modifiable data used by the program.|$|E
5000|$|A adcons {{normally}} store a four byte <b>relocatable</b> <b>address,</b> {{however it}} is possible to specify the length of the constant. For example, [...] defines a one-byte adcon, useful mainly for small constants with relocatable values. Other adcon types can similarly have length specification.|$|E
25|$|The {{references}} being resolved may be addresses for {{jumps and}} other routine calls. They {{may be in}} the main program, or in one module depending upon another. They are resolved into fixed or <b>relocatable</b> <b>addresses</b> (from a common base) by allocating runtime memory for the memory segments of each module referenced.|$|R
25|$|Some assemblers, such as NASM, provide {{flexible}} symbol management, letting programmers manage different namespaces, automatically calculate offsets within data structures, and assign labels that {{refer to}} literal values or {{the result of}} simple computations performed by the assembler. Labels {{can also be used}} to initialize constants and variables with <b>relocatable</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the {{earliest}} implementations of this OS, the UCBs (foundations and extensions) were assembled during SYSGEN, and were {{located within the}} first 64 kB of the system area, as the I/O device lookup table consisted of 16-bit Q-type (i.e. <b>relocatable)</b> <b>addresses.</b> Subsequent enhancements allowed the extensions to be above the 64-kilobyte line, thereby saving space for additional UCB foundations below the 64-kilobyte line and also thereby preserving {{the architecture of the}} UCB lookup table (converting a CUu to a UCB foundation address).|$|R
50|$|In IBM System/360 {{mainframe}} environments such as OS/360, including z/OS for the z/Architecture mainframes, {{this type}} of program {{is known as a}} linkage editor. However, a linkage editor, as the name implies, has the additional capability of allowing the addition, replacement, and/or deletion of individual program sections. Operating systems such as OS/360 have a different format for executable load-modules, in that they contain supplementary data about the component sections of a program, so that an individual program section can be replaced, {{and other parts of the}} program updated so that <b>relocatable</b> <b>addresses</b> and other such references can be corrected by the linkage editor, as part of the process.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the screen}} {{address on the}} C64 and C128 was <b>relocatable,</b> the screen <b>address</b> could be {{detected}} and used by the loader program when BLoading these split files.|$|R
