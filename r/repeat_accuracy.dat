There {{are still a lot}} of experiments that need to be done to improve their performance and explore new uses, but experiments using UAVs are limited by many conditions like weather and location and the time it takes to prepare for a flight. To promote UAV remote sensing, a near ground remote sensing platform was developed. This platform consists of three major parts: (1) mechanical structures like a horizontal rail, vertical cylinder, and three axes gimbal; (2) power supply and control parts; (3) onboard application components. This platform covers five degrees of freedom (DOFs) : horizontal, vertical, pitch, roll, yaw. A stm 32 ARM single chip was used as the controller of the whole platform and another stm 32 MCU was used to stabilize the gimbal. The gimbal stabilizer communicates with the main controller via a CAN bus. A multispectral camera was mounted on the gimbal. Software written in C++ language was developed as the graphical user interface. Operating parameters were set via this software and the working status was displayed in this software. To test how well the system works, a laser distance meter was used to measure the slide rail’s <b>repeat</b> <b>accuracy.</b> A 3 -axis vibration analyzer was used to test the system stability. Test results show that the horizontal <b>repeat</b> <b>accuracy</b> was less than 2 mm; vertical <b>repeat</b> <b>accuracy</b> was less than 1 mm; vibration was less than 2 g and remained at an acceptable level.

40|$|The present thesis {{addresses}} {{two major}} fields. First, the dynamic measurement of displacement with {{a resolution of}} micrometers is considered. Second, {{the development of a}} new class of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (cMUT) is performed. Within the first scope, an exemplary field of application, i. e. the gripper of a robotic handling system, has been chosen. The commonly employed sensor principles for these purposes are reviewed. In addition, a number of three sensor principles has been selected for an experimental investigation. These distance sensors work within a measuring range of 200 µm up to 3 mm and a resolution of a few micrometers was targeted. Their usability has been specified in terms of <b>repeating</b> <b>accuracy</b> (2 ̆ 2 Wiederholpräzision 2 ̆ 2). Going on from this preselection of sensor principles, the ultrasonic transducer has been chosen for further development. The state-of-the-art of ultrasonic transducers for air-borne ultrasound is outlined. The given drawbacks of the prevailing thickness mode resonators motivate the development of different transducer principles. One alternative is given by membrane resonators. Here, the ultrasound is generated by the electrostatic stimulation of the membrane, whereas the detection of ultrasound is performed by the measurement of changes in the capacitance of the transducer. Within this thesis it is shown that the microsystem technology offers advantageous possibilities to manufacture ultrasonic transducers with a number of new distinctive features. In particular, the technologies of surface micromachining were employed to develop a novel transducer set-up Since the fabrication of cMUT by means of microsystem technology emerged in 1994, two varying set-ups have been realized that differ from the present one. In contrast to those, the present set-up of a cMUT is particularly suitable for low voltage applications...|$|R

40|$|Pneumatic {{cylinders}} {{and systems}} {{have dominated the}} majority of industrial plants as two-position actuators due to that they are light-weight, clean, non-flammable; available {{in a wide range}} of sizes, have high cycle rates, can be installed with ease and have payload-to-weight ratios much higher than their other actuator counterparts. These advantages encouraged researchers to develop the performance of pneumatic cylinders and encompass mid-position control to broaden their applications for robotic manipulation. This thesis introduces a novel design, construction, control and analysis of a pneumatically driven reconfigurable modular manipulator system (PRMMS). The focus lies on a hypothesis of encompassing a hybrid electro-pneumatic manipulator while providing a low cost, lightweight, modular and reconfigurable system that can be of great assistant to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). The proposed system is mainly pneumatic actuated, for gross movements, with an electrical wrist that should compensate for errors and provide fine motions at the manipulator end effector. This thesis is only involved with the pneumatic actuated modules as part of this hybrid electro-pneumatic proposed system. A general review on modular systems did not encompass pneumatic actuated modular systems. Therefore, an exploration of the validity of pneumatic actuation in these modular systems and a proposed fuzzy logic PD + I controller was set for a passive damped pneumatic system capable of controlling and tracking the movement of a pneumatic cylinder to <b>repeated</b> <b>accuracy</b> of less than ± 0. 1 mm with small displacement capabilities of the same order. Furthermore, a general simulation based methodology for robotic systems is studied. This methodology is based on an iterative process of system modifications leading to improved successful designs of robotic systems. Performance tuning criteria for the system was made possible through experimentations and modifications of the controller and the examination of different valves and cylinder combinations, all within the simulator. In addition, a combined Cartesian-joint control algorithm using low cost microcontrollers was established. Each joint module is controlled via an integrated local microcontroller while a global task controller computes and sets the path motions and control requirements to the modules through communication processes. Further benefiting from the properties of pneumatic cylinders, a proposed compliance control algorithm is applied to achieve safe interactions with humans at the work place by disabling modules which exceed a predefined amount of compliance. This issue of disabled modules opened an investigation for fault tolerance in redundant manipulators for assuring the completion of a task in structured and unstructured environments...|$|R
40|$|Laughter is a socioemotional cue that is {{characteristically}} {{positive and}} historically served to facilitate social bonding. Like other communicative gestures (e. g., facial expressions, groans, sighs), however, {{the interpretation of}} laughter is no longer bound to a particular affective state. Thus, an important question is how basic psychological mechanisms, such as early sensory arousal, emotion evaluation, and meaning representation, contribute to the interpretation of laughter in different contexts. A related question is how brain dynamic processes reflect these different aspects of laughter comprehension. The present study addressed these questions using event-related potentials (ERP) to examine laughter comprehension within a cross-modal priming paradigm. Target stimuli were visually presented words, which were preceded by either laughs or environmental sounds (500 ms versions of the International Affective Digitized Sounds, IADS). The study addressed four questions: (1) Does emotion priming lead to N 400 effects? (2) Do positive and negative sounds elicit different neurocognitive responses? (3) Are there laughter-specific ERPs? (4) Can laughter priming of good and bad concepts be reversed under social anxiety? Four experiments were conducted. In all four experiments, {{participants were asked to}} make speeded judgments about the valence of the target words. Experiments 1 - 3 examined behavioral effects of emotion priming using variations on this paradigm. In Experiment 4, participants performed the task while their electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. After six experimental blocks, a mood manipulation was administered to activate negative responses to laughter. The task was then <b>repeated.</b> <b>Accuracy</b> and reaction time showed a small but significant priming effect across studies. Surprisingly, N 400 effects of emotion priming were absent. Instead, there was a later (~ 400 – 600 ms) effect over orbitofrontal electrodes (orbitofrontal priming effect, OPE). Valence-specific effects were observed in the early posterior negativity (EPN, ~ 275 ms) and in the late positive potential (LPP, ~ 600 ms). Laughter-specific effects were observed over orbitofrontal sites beginning approximately 200 ms after target onset. Finally, the OPE was observed for laughs before and after the mood manipulation. The direction of priming did not reverse, contrary to hypothesis. Interestingly, the OPE was observed for IADS only prior to the mood manipulation, providing some evidence for laughter-specific effects in emotion priming. These findings question the N 400 as a marker of emotion priming and contribute to the understanding of neurocognitive stages of laughter perception. More generally, they add to the growing literature on the neurophysiology of emotion and emotion representation...|$|R
