40|$|The somatotopically {{organized}} rubrospinal pathway is {{the major}} component of the laterally descending brainstem pathways, and is especially involved in steering of fractionated movements of the distal parts of the limbs. Electrophysiological studies in cat showed that this fiber system, {{in contrast to the}} medially descending pathways, has a limited degree of collateralization in the spinal cord (Abzug et al., 1973 and 1974; Shinoda et al., 1977). The red nucleus projects also to the contralateral cerebellum (Brodal and Gogstad, 1954; Courville and Brodal, 1966). The collateralization of the rubrospinal neurons to the contralateral cerebellar interpositus nucleus is relatively high as indicated by anatomical and electrophysiological findings (Anderson, 1971; Brodal and Gogstad, 1954). Thus, the findings in these studies suggested that almost all rubrocerebellar fibers are collaterals from rubrospinal neurons. In view of the above data it appears that the rubrospinal pathway represents a focussed system, which distributes its fibers to specific groups of spinal segments. On the other hand, the rubrocerebellar pathway probably represents a direct, tightly coupled <b>return</b> <b>projection</b> to the interpositus nucleus, which is the main source of afferents to the rubrospinal neurons (Courville, 1966 b; Dekker, 1981; Flumerfelt et al., 1973; King et al., 1973; Tsukahara et al., 1967). In the present anatomical study an attempt has been made to demonstrate anatomically the existence of collaterals in the rubrospinal pathway and to compare quantitatively the degree of this collateralization in rat, cat and monkey. This was done with the aid of the multiple retrograde fluorescent tracer technique. This technique will be described in chapter II. In this anatomical study one fluorescent tracer was injected in the cervical grey and another in more caudal segments of the cord. In these experiments the distribution of sin 3 le and double labeled neurons in red nucleus was studied. The descending pathways from the ventrolateral pontine tegmentum and from the raphe magnus, including the adjoining ventral reticular formation, also descend in the dorsolateral funiculus in rat, cat and monkey and also terminate in the dorsal grey (Basbaum and Fields, 1978, 1979; Holstege et al., 1979; Kuypers and Maisky, 1977; R. F. Martinet al., 1978; G. F. Martinet al., 1979 and 1981 a; Tohyama et al., 1979 a+b). Therefore, in these retrograde fluorescent double labeling studies the degree of the collateralization n these descending tracts was compared to that of the rubrospinal pathway n each of three mammalian species (i. e. rat, cat and monkey). In addition, in cat an attempt was made to determine the location of the rubro-olivary neurons in relation to the rubrospinal ones and to establish whether the rubro-olivary neurons give collaterals to the spinal cord. These studies will be presented in Chapter III and IV. In these studies attention was also paid to the rubrocerebellar connections. Specifically an attempt has been made to determine whether these connections are established by collaterals of rubrospinal neurons. These findings will be presented n Chapter V. Electron microscopic studies in rat, combining the anterograde and retrograde intra-axonal transport techniques, showed that many rubrospinal neurons receive afferents from the cerebellar interpositus nucleus (Dekker, 1981). Some of the fluorescent tracers {{used in the present study}} can be employed both retrogradely to demonstrate parent cell bodies as well as anterogradely to demonstrate the fiber terminals. Using the fluorescent tracers in this fashion it could be demonstrated in light microsc 0 py that the cerebellar interposito-rubral fibers establish contact with rubrospinal neurons. These data are also presented n Chapter V...|$|E

However, the functional role of the PoS projection to LMN has not been tested. The present study recorded HD cells from LMN after bilateral PoS lesions to determine whether the PoS provides landmark control to LMN HD cells. After the lesion and implantation of electrodes, HD cell activity was recorded while rats navigated within a cylindrical arena containing a single visual landmark or while they navigated between familiar and novel arenas of a dual-chamber apparatus. PoS lesions disrupted the landmark control of HD cells and also disrupted the stability of the preferred firing direction of the cells in darkness. Furthermore, PoS lesions impaired the stable HD cell representation maintained by path integration mechanisms when the rat walked between familiar and novel arenas. These results suggest that visual information first gains control of the HD cell signal in the LMN, presumably via the direct PoS → LMN projection. This visual landmark information then controls HD cells throughout the HD cell circuit...|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{two main}} {{issues of the}} standard Kernel Entropy Component Analysis (KECA) algorithm: the optimization of the kernel decomposition and the optimization of the Gaussian kernel parameter. KECA roughly reduces to a sorting {{of the importance of}} kernel eigenvectors by entropy instead of by variance as in Kernel Principal Components Analysis. In this work, we propose an extension of the KECA method, named Optimized KECA (OKECA), that directly extracts the optimal features retaining most of the data entropy by means of compacting the information in very few features (often in just one or two). The proposed method produces features which have higher expressive power. In particular, {{it is based on the}} Independent Component Analysis (ICA) framework, and introduces an extra rotation to the eigen-decomposition, which is optimized via gradient ascent search. This maximum entropy preservation suggests that OKECA features are more efficient than KECA features for density estimation. In addition, a critical issue in both methods is the selection of the kernel parameter since it critically affects the resulting performance. Here we analyze the most common kernel length-scale selection criteria. Results of both methods are illustrated in different synthetic and real problems. Results show that 1) OKECA <b>returns</b> <b>projections</b> with more expressive power than KECA, 2) the most successful rule for estimating the kernel parameter is based on maximum likelihood, and 3) OKECA is more robust to the selection of the length-scale parameter in kernel density estimation.

In a self-excitatory network the excitation of a part spreads to all the others, just like a memory fragment awakens an entire recorded experience.

At question {{then is the}} mechanism that serves to minimize leukocyte pseudopod formation in the circulation. We tested the hypothesis that fluid shear stress acts to prevent pseudopod formation. When individual human leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes) spreading on glass surfaces in vitro were subjected to fluid shear stress (≈ 1 dyn/cm 2), an instantaneous retraction of pseudopods was observed. Removal of the fluid shear stress in turn led to the <b>return</b> of pseudopod <b>projection</b> and cell spreading. When steady shear stress was prolonged over several minutes, leukocyte swelling occurs together with an enhanced random motion of cytoplasmic granules and a reduction of cytoplasmic stiffness. The response to shear stress could be suppressed by K+ channel blockers and chelation of external Ca 2 +. In rat mesentery microvessels after occlusion, circulating leukocytes project pseudopods in free suspension or when attached to the endothelium, even though immediately after occlusion only few pseudopods were present. When flow was restored, pseudopods on adhering leukocytes were retracted and then the cells began to roll and detach from the endothelium.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is able {{to escape}} from the phagolysosome and grow within the host cell cytoplasm. By 3 h after {{initiation}} of infection, actin filaments begin to concentrate {{at one end of the}} bacterium. Polarization of F-actin is associated with intracellular bacterial movement, long projections of actin filaments forming directly behind the moving bacteria. New actin monomers are added to the region of the projection in proximity to the bacterium. The rate of new actin filament growth correlates closely with the speed of bacterial migration. This actin structure is anchored within the cytoplasm, serving as a fixed platform for directional expansion of the actin filament network. The actin projection progressively lengthens as the bacterium migrates. Cytochalasin blocks both elongation of the projection and bacterial movement but does not result in complete depolymerization of the bacterially induced actin structure, residual actin and alpha-actinin persisting in proximity to one end of the bacterium. Bacteria initially migrate within the cortical cytoplasm but later move to the peripheral membrane, where they form filopodiumlike structures which pivot and undulate in the extracellular medium. In the filopodia, bacteria are occasionally seen to abruptly change direction, turn 180 degrees, and move back into the medullary region of the host cell.

40|$|At a {{time when}} {{requirements}} {{on the quality of}} the built environment are increasingly becoming explicit and specific, computer technology promises the ability to analyse and evaluate buildings during the design process. The computer can extract the necessary information from conventional geometric representations, generate comprehensive descriptions of the aspects to be analysed and use these to arrive at precise and accurate results that can be represented visually. Visual representations facilitate comprehension of the analyses and of their results because of their agreement with our predominantly visual perception of the built environment. The consequent close correspondences between geometric design representations and the visual representation of analyses and evaluations allow direct correlation of the results with the design as a whole. Such correlation is instrumental for imposing explicit and justifiable constraints on the further development of a design. One good example of visual analyses is daylighting. In many drafting and modelling programs a viewing point can be set on the basis the sunis height and azimuth. The <b>projection</b> <b>returned</b> reveals the surfaces that are directly lit by the sun. In other programs the sunis height and azimuth can be used to position a light source with parallel rays. This source gives rise to shading and shadows that correspond to the ones produced by the sun. In addition, several programs can calculate the position of the sun and hence the viewing point or the light source on the basis of the date, the time and the geographic coordinates of the place. The availability of computer-aided daylighting analysis has obvious advantages for practice. Efficiency and reliability of the analysis increase, while flexibility is superior to analog simulations. Unfortunately automation of daylighting analysis may also impede understanding of underlying principles, that is, of the issues at the focus of architectural education. Explaining how the analysis is performed and why becomes thus a necessity for computer-aided design education. Exercises that aim at more than just learning and using a computer program can enrich the studentis understanding of the analysis and its results. The efficiency and flexibility of the computer facilitate the study of aspects such as the comparison of local apparent time, local mean time, standard time and daylight saving time and their significance for daylighting, solar heating and cooling patterns and possibilities. Sundials with their explicit correspondence to solar movement can be instrumental in this respect. The efficiency and flexibility of the computer also support the investigation of the techniques by which the daylighting analysis is performed and explain the relationships between projective theory, sciagraphy and computer graphics. A better understanding of the principles and techniques for daylighting analysis has a generally positive influence on the studentsi learning of the daylighting analysis software and more significantly on their correlation of daylighting constraints with their designs. This leads in turn to increased flexibility and adaptability of the designs with respect to daylighting and to a conscious and meaningful exploration of variations and alternative solutions...|$|R
40|$|The report {{presents}} {{a review of}} methods used in Europe for trend analysis, climate change projections and non-stationary analysis of extreme precipitation and flood frequency. In addition, main findings of the analyses are presented, including a comparison of trend analysis results and climate change projections. Existing guidelines in Europe on design flood and design rainfall estimation that incorporate climate change are reviewed. The report concludes {{with a discussion of}} research needs on non-stationary frequency analysis for considering the effects of climate change and inclusion in design guidelines. Trend analyses are reported for 21 countries in Europe with results for extreme precipitation, extreme streamflow or both. A large number of national and regional trend studies have been carried out. Most studies are based on statistical methods applied to individual time series of extreme precipitation or extreme streamflow using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test or regression analysis. Some studies have been reported that use field significance or regional consistency tests to analyse trends over larger areas. Some of the studies also include analysis of trend attribution. The studies reviewed indicate that there is some evidence of a general increase in extreme precipitation, whereas there are no clear indications of significant increasing trends at regional or national level of extreme streamflow. For some smaller regions increases in extreme streamflow are reported. Several studies from regions dominated by snowmelt-induced peak flows report decreases in extreme streamflow and earlier spring snowmelt peak flows. Climate change projections have been reported for 14 countries in Europe with results for extreme precipitation, extreme streamflow or both. The review shows various approaches for producing climate projections of extreme precipitation and flood frequency based on alternative climate forcing scenarios, climate projections from available global and regional climate models, methods for statistical downscaling and bias correction, and alternative hydrological models. A large number of the reported studies are based on an ensemble modelling approach that use several climate forcing scenarios and climate model projections in order to address the uncertainty on the projections of extreme precipitation and flood frequency. Some studies also include alternative statistical downscaling and bias correction methods and hydrological modelling approaches. Most studies reviewed indicate an increase in extreme precipitation under a future climate, which is consistent with the observed trend of extreme precipitation. Hydrological projections of peak flows and flood frequency show both positive and negative changes. Large increases in peak flows are reported for some catchments with rainfall-dominated peak flows, whereas a general decrease in flood magnitude and earlier spring floods are reported for catchments with snowmelt-dominated peak flows. The latter is consistent with the observed trends. The review of existing guidelines in Europe on design floods and design rainfalls shows that only few countries explicitly address climate change. These design guidelines are based on climate change adjustment factors to be applied to current design estimates and may depend on design <b>return</b> period and <b>projection</b> horizon. The review indicates a gap between the need for considering climate change impacts in design and actual published guidelines that incorporate climate change in extreme precipitation and flood frequency. Most of the studies reported are based on frequency analysis assuming stationary conditions in a certain time window (typically 30 years) representing current and future climate. There is a need for developing more consistent non-stationary frequency analysis methods that can account for the transient nature of a changing climate...|$|R
