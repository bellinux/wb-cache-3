Part of these changes {{is due to the}} enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF), which created strict rules for <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone.</b> Analyzing public finance standards that set limits and conditions to achieve fiscal management responsibility, particularly regarding the concession of benefits through <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone,</b> is highly relevant as a social contribution. The aim in this study is to reflect on the doctrine and jurisprudence of the Brazilian Federal Court of Auditors (TCU) and of the State of Minas Gerais, which establish restrictive conditions for <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone.</b> The research is characterized as exploratory and the documentary sources include legislation, doctrine and jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Auditors and the Minas Gerais State Court of Auditors, with a view to supporting inferential observations about the theme.

40|$|Tax policy {{instruments}} {{are often used}} to stimulate private investment in developing countries. But researchers have not explored how well such policies have met stated policy objectives. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tax incentives for industrial and technological development, the authors specify a dynamic production structure model with endogenous capacity utilization. Taxes and incentives {{are part of the}} user cost of capital, and thereby affect producer decisions about choice of inputs, technology, and capital accumulation. Empirical estimates of this model allow one to infer both the impact of investment incentives and their implications for <b>revenues</b> <b>foregone</b> by the government. The model results yield an objective, empirically derived cost-benefit ratio that is superior to standard cost-benefit analysis and King-Fullerton type marginal effective tax rate analysis.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{examines the}} gaps in health care financing in Malawi and how foregone taxes could fill these gaps. It begins with {{an assessment of the}} disease burden and government health expenditure. Then it analyses the tax <b>revenues</b> <b>foregone</b> by the government of Malawi by two main routes • Illicit financial flows (IFF) from the country • Tax incentives. We find that there are significant financing gaps in the health sector; for example, government expenditure is United States Dollars (USD) 177 million for 2013 / 2014 while projected donor contribution in 2013 / 2014 is USD 207 million and the total cost for the minimal health package is USD 535 million. Thus the funding gap between the government budget for health and the required spending to provide the minimal package for 2013 / 2014 is USD 358 million. On the other hand we estimate that almost USD 400 million is lost through IFF and corporate utilization of tax incentives each year. The <b>revenues</b> <b>foregone</b> plus the current government health spending would be sufficient to cover the minimal public health package for all Malawians and would help tackle Malawi’s disease burden.

40|$|Governments have {{resource}} {{impacts on}} the economy and society in many ways. While taxation and direct expenditure impacts have been studied and form the basis of much of the fiscal impact assessments of government, the issue of tax expenditures has been largely ignored. Tax expenditures (concessions granted to individuals and companies) have existed since the early C 2 oth but were really only acknowledged and counted since the early 1980 s. The impacts of tax expenditures are not widely reported or known - although there is a technical economic literature (largely driven by the US) which has attempted to define and classify them. In Australia and Canada these measures (as <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone)</b> are substantial and yet they do not go through any semblance of a budgetary process. Central economic or budgetary agencies can review tax expenditures at any time but they often do not chose to re-open these concessionary schemes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{opportunity}} returns forgone to cotton producers in the lower Mid-South region of the United States for growing cotton, compared to alternative commodities. We calculate the actual net returns per acre for selected cotton-producing counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. In addition, we calculate the opportunity returns per acre if the acres planted in cotton were planted in the highest net return commodity per acre between corn and soybeans during the period 1997 through 2008. Our results find that producers in these cotton producing-counties faced sizeable opportunity <b>revenues</b> <b>foregone</b> averaging 43 % between 2003 and 2008. Most observers of the cotton industry would argue that these <b>foregone</b> <b>revenues</b> are a function of historical cotton producers not planting a higher proportion of their acreage in the more-profitable corn enterprise in 2007 and 2008. However, opportunity <b>revenues</b> per acre <b>foregone</b> averaged 37 % in the 2007 - 08 period. This finding suggests that cotton producers recognized a few years prior to the corn price spike in 2007 that alternative commodities, such as corn and soybeans, would generate greater returns on their land. Our research suggests that the higher corn price helped push cotton producers over the edge into planting a greater percentage of their acreage in alternative commodities. cotton ginning, returns above variable costs, cotton, corn, soybeans, Production Economics, Q 10,...|$|R

The examination of recent and earlier data indicates that employment benefits are widespread throughout industry but their distribution favours considerably higher level employees. Recent changes {{in the structure of the}} labour market, e. g. the increase in part-time work in certain sectors of industry, further accentuate the inequalities in this distribution. The findings of the study raise a number of issues for social welfare policy. For while employment benefits are received, and perceived, as rewards for contribution to economic production, a significant proportion of their cost is borne by the State through taxation <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone,</b> and by the community through higher prices of goods and services. Occupational welfare is therefore a ‘hidden’ part of the overall social welfare system.

In addition, carbon prices can result in modified management practices in new and existing planted forests. Hale et al.

40|$|In {{agricultural}} production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, {{the increase in}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which {{would need to be}} paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO 2 e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone</b> varies widely from 9. 3 to 196. 3 US$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions > 5 tCO 2 e ha− 1 yr− 1 resulting in net emissions > 8 tCO 2 e ha− 1 yr− 1 for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could {{play a major role in}} increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture...|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of mining to {{economic and social}} development in Sub-Saharan Africa is under increased scrutiny and criticism. Minerals are non-renewable resources, and production represents a transformation from a subsoil to a financial asset. Unless the gains are efficiently captured, saved and invested by the ultimate owner of the resource, the country in question could experience a net reduction in its national wealth. Preliminary empirical evidence indicates that effective benefit-sharing in mining has been notoriously difficult to achieve. In this paper, we present a simple method to benchmark the degree of revenue-sharing in some major mining countries. This is utilised to estimate the amount of mining <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone</b> due to ineffective mining revenue-sharing in our case countries of Tanzania and Zambia during the period 1998 - 2011. Using company-level data from the recently published Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) reports in the two countries, we find that profit-based corporate tax made a very modest contribution to mining revenue, despite 5 - 10 years of operations under the current owners and a global mineral super cycle since 2005 / 6 (TEITI 2011; TEITI 2012; ZEITI 2011; ZEITI 2012). Gross value-based corporate taxes, together with employee-based taxes, dominate the tax revenue collected from the mining sector. The principal elements needed to secure improved revenue-sharing in mining are: i) robust fiscal design, including a progressive element to capture windfalls while encouraging costsaving and production; ii) specialised tax administration for extractive industries and mining, to minimise the erosion of the tax base and to establish and enforce correct tax assessments; and iii) political will and accountability, together with government consistency, in order to secure the expected tax collection from mineral extraction over time with increased transparency of mining-related revenues.

The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify the costs of swine diseases at producer level in order to understand swine disease priority for monitoring at local level. Financial impacts of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), foot and mouth disease (FMD), and epidemic diarrhoea were assessed for 162 pig holders in two Red River Delta provinces and in one Mekong River Delta province, using data on pig production and swine disease outbreaks at farms. Losses incurred by swine diseases were estimated, including direct losses due to mortality (100 % market value of pig before disease onset) and morbidity (abortion, delay of finishing stage), and indirect losses due to control costs (treatment, improving biosecurity and emergency vaccination) and <b>revenue</b> <b>foregone</b> (lower price in case of emergency selling). Financial impacts of swine diseases were expressed as percentage of gross margin of pig holding. The gross margin varied between pig farming groups (P < 0. 0001) in the following order: large farm (USD 18 846), fattening farm (USD 7014) and smallholder (USD 2350). The losses per pig holding due to PRRS were the highest: 41 % of gross margin for large farm, 38 % for fattening farm and 63 % for smallholder. Cost incurred by FMD was lower with 19 %, 25 % and 32 % of gross margin of pig holding in large farm, fattening farm and smallholder, respectively. The cost of epidemic diarrhoea was the lowest compared to losses due to PRRS and FMD and accounted for around 10 % of gross margin of pig holding in the three pig farming groups. These estimates provided critical elements on swine disease priorities to better inform surveillance and control at both national and local level. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits {{discrimination on the basis of}} disability and applies to, among other things, public transit systems. It requires transit agencies to provide accessible fixed-route service and facilities for use by disabled individuals, including hydraulic wheelchair lifts. In addition, paratransit service of comparable quality, must be provided for those individuals who are unable to use accessible fixed-route service. Many U.

There are disabled individuals presently using paratransit service, whether ADA qualified or not, who are functionally capable of using accessible fixed-route transit for most trip purposes. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (Houston METRO) has instituted the Freedom Passport Program to encourage disabled individuals who are functionally capable to use fixed-route transit. The Program entitles users of METROLift, Houston METRO's specialized paratransit service, to obtain a "Passport" allowing them to travel on regular-route buses at no cost. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the Freedom Passport Program and its effectiveness in mainstreaming disabled transit users.
