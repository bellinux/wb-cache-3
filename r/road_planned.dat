5|$|The {{government}} sees Taunton's {{traffic congestion}} problems {{as a serious}} obstacle to its continuing economic growth. An {{important part of the}} government's growth strategy for the town is new road infrastructure consisting of a new link road (Taunton's Third Way) which was completed 27 September 2011 at a cost of £7.5 million. A second link road, (the Northern Inner Distributor <b>Road)</b> <b>planned</b> for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future. The road would link Staplegrove Road with Priory Avenue, running across Station Road.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. line in 1939, while MD 637 {{was designated}} along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border. Between 1939 and 1949, the route continued into Washington, D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 (DC 5), which followed Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, 11th Street SE, and DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House. MD 5 was realigned {{to head to the}} Washington, D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950. During the course of the 1950s and 1960s, most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington, D.C. border was widened into a divided highway. In 1993, the route bypassed Leonardtown; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) before it was decommissioned in 2012. In 1997, MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989. The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301. In Prince George's County, multiple interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 and the Capital Beltway in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, a four-lane, divided bypass of Hughesville was completed, alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of MD 231. The former alignment through Hughesville became MD 5 Bus. The portion of MD 5 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway, with an interchange at MD 373 (Accokeek Road)/Brandywine <b>Road</b> <b>planned</b> and the remainder still in the planning stages.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the North-South Axis {{would have}} cut a giant swathe passing {{just to the}} west of Potsdamer Platz, some 5km long and up to 100 m wide, and lined with Nazi {{government}} edifices on a gargantuan scale. The eastern half of the former Millionaires' Quarter, including Stüler's Matthiaskirche, would have been totally eradicated. New U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines were planned to run directly beneath almost the whole length of the axis, and the city's entire underground network reoriented to gravitate towards this new hub (at least one tunnel section, around 220 metres in length, was actually constructed and still exists today, buried some 20 metres beneath the Tiergarten, despite having never seen a train). This was in addition to the S-Bahn North-South Link beneath Potsdamer Platz itself, which went forward to completion, opening in stages in 1939. In the event, a substantial amount of demolition did take place in Potsdamer Straße, between the platz itself and the Landwehrkanal, and this became the location of the one Germania building that actually went forward to a state of virtual completion: architect Theodor Dierksmeier's Haus des Fremdenverkehrs (House of Tourism), basically a giant state-run travel agency. More significantly, its curving eastern facade marked the beginnings of the Runden Platz (Round Platz), a huge circular public space {{at the point where the}} North-South Axis and Potsdamer Straße intersected. Additionally, the southern edge of the Tiergarten was to be redefined, with a new <b>road</b> <b>planned</b> to slice through the built-up area immediately to the north of Columbushaus (although Columbushaus itself would remain unscathed); this road would line up with Voßstraße, one block to the north of Leipziger Platz. Here Albert Speer erected Hitler's enormous new Reichskanzlei building, and yet even this was little more than a dry run for an even larger structure some distance further away.|$|E

40|$|A <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> process {{runs through}} several phases, takes several years, {{incorporates}} many decision-making procedures and includes numerous experts {{and interest groups}} from different areas. Today, Virtual Reality (VR) systems can benefit this process. By simulating different future alternatives, together with their possible environmental impact, a common understanding {{of the consequences of}} the respective alternatives can be obtained. Furthermore, since many of the models are obtainable from the Internet, a wider public can be reached already in the early phases of the planning process. The goal of the paper is to provide {{a better understanding of the}} use of VR models for supporting involvement and collaboration in the <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> process. The background data are from two large <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> projects through cultural heritage areas in Sweden. Observations on using VR models to support public participation, and facilitate communication between different interested parties, are presented. The results argue for the benefits of using VR models during the whole <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> process and shed further light on a range of social issues associated with using this technology...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The incremental change and gradual deterioration of road capacity and transport efficiency is a common problem faced by road authorities, world wide. One of the effective approaches {{to address this problem}} is the integration of <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> and land use planning. Land use planning measures relevant to <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> will be discussed in this paper including their implementation aspects. The experience of integrating land use <b>planning</b> and <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> in Australia will be discussed with particular reference to the State of Queensland. Queensland recently introduced an Act of Parliament which facilitates the effective integration of land use <b>planning</b> and <b>road</b> <b>planning.</b> This Act contains legal mechanisms to implement effective land use measures beneficial to roads. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} discuss the Integrated Planning Act 1997 on its usefulness in integrating <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> and land use planning.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the change in}} the technical standards for <b>planned</b> <b>roads</b> in Japan and their systematization. The idea of a <b>planned</b> <b>road</b> network in city areas was introduced in the early Meiji period. In this study the authors analyze the technical standards for <b>roads</b> <b>planned</b> from the Meiji period up to the present and the transformation of the road system with reference to the historical background and the planning theory behind these early roads. Moreover, this study clarifies the following with regard to the revision of city <b>road</b> <b>plans</b> undertaken nationwide: the conditions for <b>planned</b> <b>road</b> revision, problems concerning the revision guidelines, the present state of regional coordination between municipalities, and issues handled subsequent to <b>planned</b> <b>road</b> revision. In addition, the review may lead to plans for a new road and not simply the changes to a <b>planned</b> <b>road</b> or its cancellation. Therefore, this study clarifies both the effectiveness of introducing the Land Use Control Method and the Contingent Valuation Method into a planned decision process and related problems. The results suggest that the prefecture initiate regional coordination between municipalities, a change in the city planning process that involves holding public hearings, the consideration of public opinion in city planning through information sharing, and the implementation of environmental evaluations {{to assess the impact of}} <b>road</b> <b>planning</b> on neighboring areas when <b>planning</b> a new <b>road.</b> 倉根 明徳 博士学位論文, 学位授与年月日: 2011 年 9 月, 学位授与大学: 金沢大学(2010 年度) / 金沢大学大学院自然科学研究科 環境科学専攻 環境計画講座 / Doctor thesis of Akinori Kuran...|$|R
