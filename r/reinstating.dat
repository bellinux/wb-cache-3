5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider <b>reinstating</b> ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor <b>reinstating</b> Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again <b>reinstating</b> the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again ultra vires and unreasonable, and that the British {{government}} had violated legitimate expectation by passing the second Order after giving {{the impression that the}} Chagossians were free to return home.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, from 1882, Arthur Blomfield {{and his son}} Charles made further {{additions}} and modifications, including restoring and <b>reinstating</b> the Shrine of StWerburgh. More {{work was}} carried out in the 20thcentury by Giles Gilbert Scott between 1891 and 1913, and by F.H.Crossley in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Malaquias et al. (2009) rearranged the {{taxonomy}} of the Cephalaspidea sensu lato: <b>reinstated</b> Architectibranchia, <b>reinstated</b> Runcinacea, <b>reinstated</b> Scaphandridae as a valid family, {{but they did}} not use superfamilies.|$|R

5|$|Further, {{the earth}} goddess Bhudevi {{falls in love}} with her rescuer Varaha. Vishnu - in his Varaha form - marries Bhudevi, making her one of the consorts of Vishnu. In one narrative, Vishnu and Bhudevi indulge in {{vigorous}} embraces and as a result, Bhudevi becomes fatigued and faints, sinking a little in the primordial ocean. Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, <b>reinstating</b> her in her original position above the waters. Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha's son, an asura called Narakasura.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the {{combined}} Hard Rock/Metal category returned following a major overhaul of Grammy Award categories. The separate Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance categories were merged into the slightly renamed Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category. However, in June 2013, {{it was announced}} that {{the combined}} category was being discontinued in favor of <b>reinstating</b> Best Metal Performance. Beginning in 2014, quality hard rock performances were recognized under the category Best Rock Performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{preserve}} Episcopalian control of the Kirk, the Scottish Bishops backed a proposal for Union between England and Scotland but this was dropped due to opposition by the English Parliament. On 11th April, with only five dissenting votes, the Convention declared James' reign in Scotland ended and adopted the Claim of Right Act and the Articles of Grievances. The result {{was consistent with the}} English Bill of Rights in making Parliament the primary legislative power in Scotland but then went further by <b>reinstating</b> Presbyterian control of the Kirk.|$|E
50|$|However this {{decision}} does not <b>reinstate</b> him, {{nor does it}} suggest that any tenure {{he may have had}} in the past be <b>reinstated.</b> Mr Breish could have sought to be <b>reinstated</b> and made himself available to the Board of Trustees, but he has not yet done so.|$|R
50|$|On 2 November 2010, the Brisbane Broncos <b>reinstated</b> Te Reo {{into their}} playing stocks. They are the second club (after the Sydney Roosters with Jake Friend) {{in recent history}} to <b>reinstate</b> a player after being sacked by the same club. However, he is yet {{to play a game}} since being <b>reinstated.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 18 December, the {{two doctors}} were still not <b>reinstated.</b> The {{authorities}} {{also refused to}} <b>reinstate</b> five nurses, and three hundred nurses walked out again. The government {{said they would not}} be <b>reinstated</b> and tried to stop them getting jobs in local health institutions. Nurses who went back to work reported victimisation.|$|R
5|$|In early 1919, Churchill was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air. While Churchill was preoccupied with implementing post-War defence cuts and the demobilization of the Army, the Chief of the Air Staff, Major-General Frederick Sykes, submitted a paper with what {{were at the}} time unrealistic proposals for a large air force of the future. Being dissatisfied with Sykes, Churchill began to consider <b>reinstating</b> Trenchard whose recent performance at Southampton had once more brought him into favour with Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, <b>reinstating</b> Luongo in the {{starting}} position for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy of the United Kingdom {{continues}} {{to use a}} variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union Scotland, including: the Royal Standard of Scotland, the Royal coat of arms used in Scotland together with its associated Royal Standard, royal titles including that of Duke of Rothesay, certain Great Officers of State, the chivalric Order of the Thistle and, since 1999, <b>reinstating</b> a ceremonial role for the Crown of Scotland after a 292-year hiatus.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared {{between himself and}} his supporter Rangnath Paudel. This aroused resentment and jealousy among Sher Bahadur Shah (Rana Bahadur's step brother) and his faction, since they did not receive any portion of this confiscated property, despite their help in <b>reinstating</b> Rana Bahadur to power. They were also wary of Bhimsen's growing power. By this time, Rana Bahadur was a nominal figure and Kaji Bhimsen Thapa was single-handedly controlling the central administration of the country, being able to implement even unpopular reforms like Baisathi Haran.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of <b>reinstating</b> it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Ford ran {{to succeed}} Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election. His {{platform}} included <b>reinstating</b> video poker {{to the state}} to generate returns from taxes on the gaming industry {{in an effort to}} balance the state budget, something he has proposed since the late 1990s. A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban. Ford faced state senator Vincent A. Sheheen of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in a primary election. Sheheen's campaign has raised $33,000 as of January 2009, while Ford's campaign raised $6,000. On June 8, 2010, Ford finished in third place in the primary election with 18percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|The Palace Writers (Zhongshu 中書) were {{originally}} palace eunuch secretaries (Zhongshu guan 中書官) from Emperor Wu's reign until 29 BC, {{when they were}} staffed by regular officials. They usurped much of the Chancellor's powers {{by the end of}} the Western Han. The position of Chancellor was abolished for much of Eastern Han and replaced by the Excellency over the Masses. However, in 208 AD the Excellency of Works Cao Cao (155–220 AD) assumed the revived post of Chancellor while acting as the de facto ruler over the court of Emperor Xian (r. 189–220 AD). Cao Cao also abolished the Grand Commandant and Excellency of Works while <b>reinstating</b> the Imperial Counselor.|$|E
5|$|When Empress Dowager Gao died in 1093, Emperor Zhezong of Song {{asserted}} {{himself at}} court by ousting the political conservatives led by Sima Guang, <b>reinstating</b> Wang Anshi's reforms, and halting all {{negotiations with the}} Tanguts of the Western Xia. This resulted in continued armed conflict between the Song dynasty and the Western Xia. In 1099, the Northern Song launched a campaign into Xining and Haidong (in modern Qinghai province), occupying territory that was controlled by the Tibetan Gusiluo regime since the 10th century. By 1116, Song managed to acquire all of its territory and incorporated it into prefectures; the area became the westernmost frontier against the Western Xia.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively <b>reinstating</b> the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E

50|$|On November 2, 1981, the Senate Ethics Committee {{recommended}} that Sisitsky be <b>reinstated</b> {{only if he}} issued a formal apology to the Senate. That same day, attorneys for Sisitsky filed suit in the Supreme Judicial Court seeking to overturn his removal. On November 9, the Court refused to issue an injunction to <b>reinstate</b> Sisitsky. On November 16, Sisitsky issued an apology and was <b>reinstated.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of <b>reinstating</b> the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, <b>reinstating</b> them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for {{a day and a half}} in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E
5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering to provide aid to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was willing to provide financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, <b>reinstating</b> electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 as {{a result}} of a finding of the California Supreme Court, Sanford was <b>reinstated</b> at Berkeley with back pay. Once <b>reinstated,</b> he {{immediately}} quit. In 1961 he moved to become a professor at Stanford.|$|R
