She then traveled to Afghanistan for the Kabul Conference on the situation there, during which President Hamid Karzai vowed to implement much-promised legal, political, and economic reforms in exchange for a continued Western commitment there. Clinton said that despite the scheduled U.S. drawdown there in 2011, the U.S. has [...] "no intention of abandoning our long-term mission of achieving a stable, secure, peaceful Afghanistan. Too many nations – especially Afghanistan – have suffered too many losses to see this country slide backward." [...] She then went on to Seoul and the Korean Demilitarized Zone where she and Defense Secretary Robert Gates met with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan and Minister of National Defense Kim Tae-young in a '2+2 meeting' to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There she said that the U.S. experience in staying in Korea for decades had led to a successful result, which might also be applicable to Afghanistan. Finally, she went to Hanoi, Vietnam, for the ASEAN <b>Regional</b> <b>Forum,</b> wrapping up what The New York Times termed [...] "a grueling trip that amounted to a tour of American wars, past and present". There she injected the U.S. into the long-running disputes over the sovereignty of the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands, much to the displeasure of the Chinese who view the South China Sea as part of their core interests, by saying [...] "The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Chinese-led <b>regional</b> <b>forums</b> {{in the developing}} world where the Chinese preponderance of economic power is self-evident, its financial largesse is readily utilised to sustain these endeavours, its bureaucracies are empowered to guide the conduct of institutional activities, and its normative intentions and interests are given fullest expression. This assessment of two such Chinese-instigated <b>regional</b> <b>forums</b> {{in the developing world}} suggests that despite the professed norms on ‘political equality’ and ‘mutual benefit’ and efforts to ensure the maintenance of Chinese interests over time, China’s stance is increasingly contested by developing country member states. These challenges invariably take the form of struggles over the structuring of key administrative organs and the decision-making process and as such are reflective of norms, interests and expectations held by developing country members. In other words although China holds a preponderance of structural power within these <b>regional</b> <b>forums</b> there is an ongoing process of socialisation—driven by developing country member states—aimed at reshaping China’s behaviour to bring it more closely in line with the other members’ interests...|$|R
