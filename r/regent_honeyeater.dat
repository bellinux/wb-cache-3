Males advertising territorial display will similarly, fly singing vertically into the air (Chapman, pers comm. 2014). Actions in the air appear similar to the black honeyeater (Burgess 1946) and flight is said to resemble that of the critically endangered <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (Anthochaera phrygia) (North 1909).|$|E
25|$|The hillsides {{have largely}} been cleared of {{woodland}} for fruit growing and other agriculture and the urban growth of Adelaide particularly on the lower slopes, leading to loss of habitat and local extinction of wildlife species including all species of bettong and quoll marsupials and birds including <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (Xanthomyza phrygia), swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), king quail (Coturnix chinensis), brown quail (C. ypsilophora), and azure kingfisher (Alcedo azurea). Clearance and agriculture are ongoing and livestock grazing continues to cause damage to habitats while introduced cats, foxes and rabbits are a threat to habitats and wildlife. Protected areas tend to be small and fragmented. Kangaroo Island has been less affected and also does not have rabbits or foxes, although koalas have been introduced from the Australian mainland and are causing damage to habitats.|$|E

[...] Flowering occurs throughout the year with seven small flower buds in umbels appearing in the axils of mature leaves. Small fruits measuring [...] appear approximately one month after flowering.

5000|$|The {{endangered}} swift parrot (Lathamus discolour) {{has been}} recorded in the park during their migration from Tasmania between March and October. This species returns to foraging sites depending on food availability and available habitat in tree hollows.

The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2010, compiled by researchers from Charles Darwin University and published in October 2011 by the CSIRO, added the <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeater</b> to the [...] "critically endangered" [...] list, giving habitat loss as the major threat.|$|E
50|$|The IBA {{consists}} of, and {{is defined}} by, woodland remnants used by <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeaters.</b> It includes the Goulburn River National Park and the Munghorn Gap Nature Reserve {{as well as}} private land.

5000|$|The remnant and {{fragmented}} eucalypt forests on {{the southern}} margins of the lake have been identified by BirdLife International as a 121 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support significant numbers of endangered swift parrots and <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeaters</b> in years when the swamp mahoganies and other favoured trees are flowering.

50|$|The <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeater</b> (Anthochaera phrygia) was {{formerly}} placed {{in its own}} genus Xanthomyza but was moved to Anthochaera based on phylogenetic analysis using DNA sequence data.|$|E
50|$|First {{described}} by the naturalist George Shaw in 1794, the <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeater</b> was moved to Anthochaera in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield.

The ancestor of the <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeater</b> split from a lineage {{that gave rise to}} the red and yellow wattlebirds. The little and western wattlebirds arose from another lineage that diverged earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports a small, regularly breeding population of endangered <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeaters,</b> as well as significant populations of diamond firetails at the northern end of their range.

It lies in the upper Murray-Darling basin not far from the state border with New South Wales. The two state forests contain areas of selectively logged eucalypt forest and woodlands with spotted gum and box-ironbark plant communities. Geologically, the area is mostly rocky, metamorphosed sedimentaries and interbedded volcanics with infertile soils that are not suitable for agriculture. Over 500 km2 of the land in the IBA is owned by a few major private landowners, with the remainder being state forest.|$|R

50|$|Wattlebirds (Anthochaera) is a genus {{of birds}} in the honeyeater family.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that nectar-feeding birds more easily learn to avoid a {{previously}} rewarding location (to win-shift) than to return to such a location (to win-stay). This pattern has been interpreted as evidence of an evolved adaptation {{to the fact that}} nectar is a depleting resource; however, such a conclusion requires ruling out the possibility that this tendency is a consequence of the experience of individual birds, and is more compelling if performance in the memory task reveals sensitivity to detailed features of the spatiotemporal distribution of nectar in the environment. We tested the tendency of captive-reared <b>Regent</b> <b>honeyeaters,</b> Xanthomyza phrygia, a species of nectar-feeding bird, to win-shift or win-stay at different intervisit intervals. The birds generally avoided rewarding locations after a short retention interval (10 min), but returned to these locations after a long retention interval (3 h). This behaviour tracks the replenishment rate of the flowers exploited by this species in the wild, even though the subjects were born and reared in captivity. 7 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{communities of}} the reserves provide a range of habitats for native fauna. Seventeen animal species listed under the Threatened Species Act 1995 have been recorded on the reserves. Known resident species include the Gilbert’s whistler (Pachycephala inornata), barking owl (Ninox connivens), superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), turquoise parrot (Neophema pulchella) and diamond firetail (Stagonopleura guttata).A number of declining eastern woodland birds also occur, including the hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata cucullata), grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis temporalis) and black-chinned honeyeater (Melithreptus gularis gularis). The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) is often present in spring. Autumn and winter flowering eucalypts, especially mugga ironbark, occasionally attract the endangered swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), and on rare occasions <b>regent</b> <b>honeyeaters</b> (Xanthomyza phrygia). Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) were once present at Ingalba and Big Bush Nature Reserves, but individuals or active breeding mounds have not been observed for over twenty years and it {{is considered to be}} locally extinct.
