Home's premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year.

500|$|In Britain {{there was}} {{economic}} prosperity; exports [...] "zoomed", according to The Times, {{and the economy}} was growing {{at an annual rate}} of four per cent. Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: [...] "The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible." [...] On another occasion he said, [...] "When I have to read economic documents I have to have a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself." [...] He left Maudling in charge at the Treasury, and promoted Heath to a new business and economic portfolio. The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas-Home's premiership, the abolition of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurposeThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a novel {{perspective}} on <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchising, i. e. from a franchisee perspective, by combining legal and managerial considerations in the European context. The objective is to assess franchisee perceptions regarding <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in their chains. Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopt a qualitative approach and use 46 in-depth interviews with franchisees covering retail and service industries in the French market. FindingsMany of the interviewed franchisees believe that joining a franchise chain involves respecting the recommended <b>resale</b> <b>prices.</b> For some of the franchisees, in link with the chain uniformity, imposing uniform <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> throughout the chain represents a strength, because customers who visit different stores within the franchise chain expect to find consistent pricing. Moreover, many franchisees consider that their franchisors have some know-how that they use to set correct <b>resale</b> <b>prices,</b> taking into account the profit margin. Research limitations/implicationsThis research contributes to the literature on <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchising, as well as the franchising literature in general, by combining legal and managerial considerations, adopting a franchisee perspective, covering retail and service industries and focusing on French and European markets. Practical implicationsThis research can be viewed by franchise experts, franchisors, franchisees and franchisee candidates as a synthesis of resale price-related legal aspects, adopted practices and potential conflicts in franchise chains in the French market. It also highlights price-related practices to be avoided to prevent potential conflicts. Originality/valueThe subject of <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> in franchise chains is a hot topic, because of its link with customer attraction, chain uniformity, franchisor know-how, franchisee autonomy and the legal dimension...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurposeThe {{subject of}} <b>resale</b> <b>pricing</b> {{is a hot}} topic in franchising, due to its links with chain {{homogeneity}} and franchisee autonomy. The franchisee is bound by current legislation and regulations, in addition to respecting the franchise contract clauses, {{to the extent that}} they are lawful, and potentially opposing contentious professional practices. Focusing on <b>resale</b> <b>prices,</b> we cover these three perspectives, that is, legal, contractual, and professional constraints, using a dual approach based on managerial and legal perspectives and illustrating our arguments using examples from European and French cases. Methodology/approachWe illustrate our arguments using examples from European and French cases. FindingsWe pointed out that the ban on the practice of imposed <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> presents several advantages (e. g., integrity of franchise chains, chain’s commercial dynamism).

5000|$|The Resale Rights Directive {{created a}} {{right for the}} creators {{of works of art}} to {{participate}} in the proceeds of the resale of their work. This right, which is sometime known by its French name droit de suite, is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance. It is calculated as a proportion of the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> (net of tax), which varies between 4 and 5 percent for the portion of the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> up to EUR 50,000 and 0.25% for the portion of the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> above EUR 500,000. The total royalty is limited at EUR 12,500, equivalent to a <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> of EUR 2,000,000. Member States may choose to exempt sales of less than EUR 3000 from royalty. Works of art which are covered by this resale right are [...] "works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority." ...|$|R
