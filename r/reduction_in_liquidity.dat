This market collapse seems particularly acute for derivative markets where traders rely heavily on a specific empirical model. Asset pricing and trading, in these cases, are intrinsically model dependent. Moreover, observed behavior of traders and institutions suggests that attitudes toward "model uncertainty" may be qualitatively different than Savage rationality would suggest. For example, a large emphasis is placed on "worst-case scenarios" through the pervasive use of "stress testing" and "value-at-risk" calculations. In this paper we use Knightian uncertainty to describe model uncertainty, and use Choquet-expected-utility preferences to characterize investors aversion to this uncertainty.

Recent events have cast doubt on how well monetary policy works in this respect, particularly during financial crises. In addition, issues have been raised {{about the role of}} banks in creating asset bubbles that burst and lead to crises. In this paper, we address these issues by focusing on bank liquidity creation, which is a comprehensive measure of bank output that accounts for all on- and off-balance sheet activities. Specifically we formulate and test hypotheses that address the following questions: (1) How does monetary policy affect total bank liquidity creation and its two main components, on- and off-balance sheet liquidity creation, during normal times? (2) Does monetary policy affect bank liquidity creation differently during financial crises versus normal times? (3) Is high aggregate bank liquidity creation an indicator of an impending financial crisis? We identify five financial crises and use data on virtually all U.

First, during normal times, monetary policy tightening is associated with a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidity</b> creation by small banks, with much of the impact driven by a reduction in on-balance sheet liquidity creation.

40|$|My {{research}} lies at {{the intersection}} of international trade and industrial economics. I contribute to the firms and trade literature, both empirically and theoretically, focusing on the impact of the financial crisis of 2008 - 09 on various dimensions of firms' activities. In particular, I study the response of international trade to the shock, focusing on the reaction of importers to the reduction in demand. Additionally, I explore the impact of the crisis on firms' innovation decisions, together with the implications of this for firms' export participation. I pursue these avenues of research as the Great Recession constituted a large shock, impacting severely various aspects of firms' operations. This allowed me to study the impacts of the fall in demand on trade, and the effects of liquidity scarcity on innovation and exporting. In Chapter 2 I exploit detailed Slovenian custom data to explore the product dimension of the trade crisis. I find that imports of inputs accounting for a larger share of firms' costs underwent an enhanced reaction during the event. This finding is explained with an inventory adjustment model which predicts a more than proportionate adjustment for high cost-share inputs because of their higher storage costs. In the Chapter 3 and 4, I concentrate on the effects of the 2008 crisis on firms' innovation decisions and selection into exporting. I augment the Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) framework to include process innovation subject to liquidity constraints, and show that a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidity</b> for innovation has opposing outcomes on innovators and exporters: innovative activity is reduced but entry into exporting is stimulated by a reduction in the industry-wide degree of competition.

40|$|The turbulences in the {{international}} financial markets {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1998 put the price formation and liquidity provision mechanism in many markets under severe strain. As part of the large-scale portfolio rebalancing that took place, investors shifted a large part of their holdings into cash and into instruments that were perceived as having a low risk and being highly liquid. One of these “safe havens ” was the market for German government securities. The paper examines the liquidity of the secondary market for four German benchmark government bonds during this period. The analysis is based on a unique dataset provided by the German securities ’ regulator, which covers every single transaction of the four bonds in Germany. This feature is particularly attractive for the bond market, where OTC transactions account for most trading. The volatility of yields of the four bonds more than doubled {{in the wake of the}} Russian devaluation on 17 August 1998, and experienced a further peak in early October. It was accompanied by a widening in the yield spread between the individual bonds, which soared to more than twenty basis points from less than five basis points during the first half of the year. The cost of trading, as measured by the effective spread, increased even in a “safe ” haven like the market for ten year German government bonds, indicating a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Nevertheless, the market was able to handle a statistically significantly higher than usual number of transactions and turnover. In this sense, liquidity provision has been remarkably effective in dealing with the turbulences. Effective bid-ask spreads are positively related to unexpected trading volume, which should reflect the amount of private information in the market. Nevertheless, surprises volume cannot explain the surge in spreads that occurred during the turbulences. 1...|$|E

40|$|Fraud in the {{securities}} markets {{has been a}} focus of legislative reform in recent years. Corporations-especially those in the high-technology industry-have complained {{that they are being}} unfairly targeted by plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 lawyers in class action securities fraud lawsuits. The corporations 2 ̆ 7 complaints led to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (2 ̆ 2 Reform Act 2 ̆ 2). The Reform Act attempted to reduce meritless litigation against corporate issuers by erecting a series of procedural barriers to the filing of securities class actions. Plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 attorneys warned that the Reform Act and the resulting decrease in securities class actions would leave corporate fraud unchecked and deprive defrauded investors of compensation, thereby undermining investor confidence in the markets. Despite these dire predictions, however, after a brief initial decline securities fraud class actions are now being filed in greater numbers than before the passage of the Reform Act. Reform efforts thus continue. The President recently signed legislation preempting state securities class actions, which were thought to be avenues for circumventing the Reform Act 2 ̆ 7 s restrictions. The principal target of reform has been class action lawsuits against corporations. Such lawsuits are based on misstatements by corporate officers that distort the secondary market price of the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s securities. In these so-called 2 ̆ 2 fraud on the market 2 ̆ 2 cases, plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 attorneys sue the corporation and its officers under Rule 10 b- 5 of the Securities Exchange Act. They sue on behalf of classes of investors who have paid too much for their shares or (less frequently) sold their shares for too little because of price distortion caused by the misstatements. In the typical case, the corporation has neither bought nor sold its securities, and, accordingly, has not benefited from the fraud. Investors can nonetheless recover their losses from the corporation based on its managers 2 ̆ 7 misstatements. Given the volume of trading in secondary trading markets, the damages recoverable in such suits can be a substantial percentage of the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s total capitalization, reaching the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Advocates of reform contend that risk-averse managers are too anxious to settle such suits, even when the suits have little merit. Settlement is attractive because it allows managers to avoid personal liability by paying the claims with the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s money. My argument is that we should stop attempting to reform fraud on the market class actions and instead replace them with organizations better suited to the task of antifraud monitoring. In this Article I analyze the social costs created by fraud on the market and the roles of compensation and deterrence in reducing the costs of fraud. I argue that compensation does not {{play an important role in}} controlling those costs. Accordingly, a rational investor would not willingly pay for the compensation provided by the class action regime if deterrence could be achieved at a lower cost through alternative means. The lower-cost alternative that I propose is antifraud enforcement by {{the securities}} exchanges where the trading affected by the fraud took place. The primary social cost of fraud on the market is less trading by investors who seek to avoid being on the losing end of a trade that occurs at a fraudulently distorted market price. The <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidity</b> caused by lower trading volume most directly harms broker-dealers, who depend on trading and trading commissions for a substantial portion of their revenues. Broker-dealers hold a property right in their exchange memberships, which effectively makes them the residual claimants of the exchanges. Thus, the incentives of the exchanges 2 ̆ 7 members should push exchanges to enforce vigorously prohibitions against fraud on the market. 9 Part I analyzes the causes of fraud in secondary trading markets and the social costs produced by fraud. Part II discusses the roles of compensation and deterrence in controlling those costs and concludes that deterrence, not compensation, should be the primary objective of an antifraud regime. Part II then looks at the compensatory class action regime and shows how the goal of compensation undermines the deterrent value of class actions. Part III assesses the organization and regulation of the exchanges and how they affect the exchanges 2 ̆ 7 potential role as enforcement monitors. Part IV outlines an alternative enforcement regime administered by the securities exchanges where the trading affected by fraud took place. Instead of paying money damages to investors, corporations [...] along with their managers and outside professionals [...] would pay civil penalties and disgorge fraudulently obtained benefits to the exchanges. Corporations and their affiliates would also be subject to injunctive relief. Part V discusses potential criticisms of my proposal based on the NYSE 2 ̆ 7 s historical enforcement record and the implications of that history for exchange antifraud enforcement. Part VI evaluates potential alternatives to my proposal. Finally, a brief Conclusion summarizes the main advantages of exchange antifraud enforcement...|$|E

With a mortgage comes {{the possibility of a}} default, the financial demands of maintenance, the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> alternate investment opportunities, an increased exposure to fluctuations in local economic conditions, and a drastic <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>liquidity</b> of personal wealth. In this paper we examine the role of the owner-occupied house in the asset allocation decision of a family living in an area characterized as a low income neighborhood. We find that the current subsidies are likely to be too low relative to the costs. In particular, the tax law makes home ownership relatively less attractive to low-income families. This may explain a lack of home-ownership and thus, mortgage lending in low-income neighborhoods. ...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{liquidity}} is {{one possible}} motivation for stock splits but empirical research frequently documents declines <b>in</b> <b>liquidity</b> following stock splits. Despite {{almost thirty years}} of inquiry, {{little is known about}} all the changes in a stock 9 ̆ 2 s trading activity following a stock split. We examine how liquidity measures change around more than 2, 500 stock splits and find a pervasive decline in most measures. Large stock splits exhibit a more severe liquidity decline than small stock splits, especially on Nasdaq. We also examine a longer time period around stock splits and find that the differences between small and large stocks may be short-lived. Following the 1997 changes in order handling rules and <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> tick size, <b>liquidity</b> declines following stock splits continue, however, the declines are not as severe on Nasdaq, suggesting the change in order handling rules may have been effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{seriousness}} of the Asian financial crises and difficulties in explaining its spread have led to fears of irrational contagion. This paper studies rational channels through which contagion might have spread and highlights those factors which make a country susceptible to contagion. The rational channels studied in the paper are contagion via real sector linkages, financial market linkages, financial institution linkages, and through the interaction of financial institutions and financial markets. The latter channel is suggested as a possible factor <b>in</b> the <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> financial market <b>liquidity</b> and the flight to quality following news of significant losses at the hedge fund Long Ter...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} the time variation of the common component of FX market liquidity across developed and emerging market currencies. We study the impact of funding liquidity constraints, which proxy for supply considerations, and capital flows, which proxy for demand considerations of liquidity on transaction costs. Our results show that (i) funding liquidity constraints measured by the availability of outstanding repos reduce FX market liquidity, and their impact is stronger when they are associated {{with an increase in}} the costs of funding and a shortening of their maturity; (ii) increasing capital flows at the global level increase liquidity; (iii) both of these effects were stronger during the recent financial crisis, when liquidity dry-ups were severe; and (iv) the analysis of individual currencies with diverse riskiness confirms that a shock to speculator capital would lead to a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> market <b>liquidity</b> through a spiral effect that is stronger for more volatile currencies. Furthermore, we find a similar effect related to capital flow...|$|R
