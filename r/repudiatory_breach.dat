50|$|An {{employer}} {{could avoid}} a redundancy payment by dismissing for misconduct during the notice period, {{but only for}} a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach,</b> which effectively means the employee would have acted as if he has torn up the employment contract, e.g. by going on strike, emptying the company safe or punching out the managing director.|$|E
50|$|At {{common law}} the {{requirement}} is {{acceptance of a}} <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach,</b> which means the employer has indicated it no longer considers itself bound by an essential term of the contract, e.g. the requirement to pay wages or the requirement not to destroy the mutual bond of trust and confidence. It matters not if the employer {{did not mean to}} repudiate the contract.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords {{held that}} the {{transaction}} was effected at an undervalue, was voidable under section 238. The computer rental agreement was taken as consideration for the deal, but when assessing its value, reality and not speculative values {{should not be taken}} into account. The collateral agreement was precarious, and worthless because the headlessors had immediately declared the transaction to be a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach,</b> and it therefore had no value to Brewin Dolphin.|$|E
5000|$|Lewis v Motorworld Garages Ltd 1986 ICR 157, 167, ‘repudiatory conduct may {{consist of}} a series of acts or incidents, some of them perhaps quite trivial, which cumulatively amount to a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> of the implied term of the {{contract}} of employment that the employer will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct himself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between the employer and employee.’ ...|$|E
50|$|Wrongful {{dismissal}} {{does not}} terminate the contract - it is a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach,</b> i.e. one entitling the employee to consider himself no longer bound {{on the basis}} of the employer no longer considering itself bound. The employer's <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> (wrongful dismissal) forces the employee to accept it as he is prevented from earning from the employer and required to mitigate by working for someone else, thus terminating the contract. This does not follow contract law and is an invention by judges, disliked by others, designed to reflect the reality of employment, using the dual fictions that because the right to wages depends on the obligation to work, there is no right to wages if the employer tells the employee not to work (forgetting that the employer is not able to terminate the obligation to work other than in accordance with the contract) and that the employee has accepted the repudiation by not working for the employer even though he is willing and able. Otherwise the employee would be entitled to stay at home at the employer's request yet sue for unpaid wages as a debt.|$|E
50|$|Wimpey Construction UK Ltd {{contracted}} to buy land from Woodar Investment Development Ltd for £850,000. On {{completion of the}} purchase, Wimpey was meant to pay a further £150,000 to a third party, Transworld Trade Ltd. Wimpey terminated the contract alleging they were allowed where statutory authority had started a compulsory purchase. Woodar {{said this was a}} <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> and claimed the full £1m. The claimants argued that Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd should be followed so they could claim for a benefit to be given to a third party.|$|E

5000|$|The House of Lords {{held by a}} {{majority}} (Lord Salmon and Lord Russell dissenting) that there had in fact been no <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach.</b> But as obiter dicta they discussed where the Court of Appeal was right that if Woodar did have a good claim for breach of contract, they could claim damages on behalf of Transworld Trade Ltd. Lord Wilberforce said that Jackson could be supported on its special facts, {{as a type of}} contract including family holidays, ordering meals in restaurants and hiring a taxi for a group. But here the ‘factual situation is quite different.’ ...|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords {{held that}} there had been a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> of {{contract}} by the employer and so Mr Rigby was entitled to claim his shortfall in wages. If the employee continued to work, this did not necessarily imply he accepted the change, nor was it the case that the contract was automatically brought to an end. Moreover, because Ferodo Ltd had not in fact terminated the contract the damages that Mr Rigby received could be beyond the 12-week notice period in which the contract could legitimately have been terminated, and a notice of unilateral variation could not be implicitly construed as giving notice of termination.|$|E
50|$|Once the world's largest {{offshore}} {{crude oil}} terminal {{and the principal}} sea terminal for Iranian oil, the Kharg Island facilities were put out of commission {{in the fall of}} 1986. Heavy bombing of the Kharg Island facilities from 1980 through 1988 by the Iraqi Air Force during the Iran-Iraq War all but destroyed most of the terminal facilities. Kharg Island was situated {{in the middle of the}} Darius Oilfield, also destroyed by the intensive bombing. Repair to all facilities has been very slow, even after the war ended in 1988. The events experienced by this island gave rise to the dispute in the English contract law case The Kanchenjunga 1990 1 Lloyd's Rep 391, regarding the conditions for <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract and a claimant's right to elect to accept repudiation.|$|E

40|$|Under general {{contractual}} principles, if {{one party}} commits a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract, {{the other party}} is entitled to either terminate or affirm the contract. 1 However, {{there has been a}} long-standing debate as to whether the same elective principles apply in relation to the employment contract or whether the law ought to prefer a theory based on automatic termination which posits that one party’s unilateral <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> operates automatically to bring the contract of employment to an end. Different approaches have been tried and tested in England and Scotland which have resulted in the common law being in an unsatisfactory state as it currently stands. The Supreme Court has the opportunity to bring clarity to this area of the law in the upcoming case of Geys v Société Générale, London Branch which was decided by the Court of Appeal on 30 March 2011. 2 Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted on 1 November 2011...|$|E

40|$|The Commercial Court’s recent {{decision}} in Progress Bulk Carriers Ltd v Tube City IMS LLC (The Cenk Kaptanoglu) {{is an interesting}} example of economic duress founded (in part) on a lawful threat. The claimants in this case were the disponent owners of the vessel Cenk Kaptanoglu. On 2 April 2009, they chartered the vessel to the respondent-charterers for the carriage of shredded scrap but delivered the vessel to a third party shortly thereafter. This constituted a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> of the charterparty, which was not accepted by the charterers {{even though there was}} then no realistic chance of the Cenk Kaptanoglu’s fulfilling the charter. Conceding their error, the owners promised to provide an alternative vessel and compensate the charterers for their loss. A substitute vessel (the Agia) was subsequently identified, but by that time it was clear that a delay in shipment could not be avoided. The charterers then sought, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a discount on the freight as a condition for accepting the Agia and the late shipment. On 28 April 2009, the owners made a “take it or leave it” offer, requiring the charterers to accept the Agia at a $ 2 per metric ton discount and waive all claims connected to the owners’ <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach.</b> The charterers eventually agreed under protest...|$|E
40|$|In {{construction}} contracts, a programme {{is usually}} produced {{to record the}} sequence of work. Most standard forms of contract neither state it {{to be part of}} the contract document nor give guidelines of how to prepare a work programme and the form it should take. The form does not clearly defined the programme’s role and it does not state that there is a clear obligation to proceed in accordance with the programme. The aim of this research is to identify the legal status of a work programme and whether it is contractually binding or not and whether it can be used as an evidence in establishing variations, assessing extension of time and in determining a contractor’s employment. The research is based on literature information about construction work programme, its provisions for international and local standard forms of contract and the legal implications in court cases where work programme was considered an important document in the judgment. From the research, it is found that a contractor has to have at least an updated documents about its project’s progress, minimally in the form of critical path analysis and logical link for a causative event of delay to be proven. If the programme includes a method statement then that stated method may become the specified method of working. This entitles the contractor to a variation if the specified method is required to be changed. It is also found that the subcontract programme had no contractual effect as to original main programme. But non-performance under its obligations may be treated as a <b>repudiatory</b> <b>breach</b> and claims for damages is liable due to parties determination. Lastly the research found that his entitlement to recover losses due to the delay or awardment of an extension of time can be considered the compensation under the contract. All the existence and extent of these obligations are determined by the terms of the contract...|$|E
