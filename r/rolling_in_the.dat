5|$|Inspired by {{the mundane}} sight of pebbles <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer}} of 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript {{in the summer of}} 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year.|$|E

25|$|Topography {{is mostly}} gently <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Springfield and Salem Plateaus, whereas the Saint Francois Mountains are more rugged. Although the Springfield formation's surface is {{primarily}} Mississippian limestone and chert, the Salem Plateau is older Ordovician dolostones, limestones, and sandstones. Both are rife with karst topography and form long, flat plains. The formations {{are separated by}} steep escarpments that dramatically interrupt the rolling hills. Although much of the Springfield Plateau has been denuded of the surface layers of the Boston Mountains, large remnants of these younger layers are present throughout {{the southern end of}} the formation, possibly suggesting a peneplain process. The Springfield Plateau drains through wide, mature streams ultimately feeding the White River.|$|E
25|$|By this time, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 27,000 to 30,000 Franco-Italian {{troops in the}} bridgehead. Assembling the available troops, Eugène planned to hurl MacDonald's corps, elements of Durutte's division, and Sahuc's division at the Piavisella line. Off to the right, the viceroy ordered Grenier to pin the left wing of IX Armeekorps at San Michele and Cimadolmo with Pully's and Guérin's cavalry and Abbé's infantry. The French attack got <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late afternoon. Abbé's advance was counterattacked by squadrons of the Archduke Josef Hussar Regiment, the last unbroken Austrian horsemen on the field. Pully and Guérin quickly repulsed the gallant Austrian riposte and Kalnássy evacuated San Michele and Cimadolmo before Grenier's pressure. Kalnássy fell back to Tezze where he sturdily held his ground until evening, suffering 1,200 casualties during the battle.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1929, the {{aircraft}} was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Croydon to Amsterdam. The aircraft departed at 09:54. The weather {{at the time}} was poor. It was reported that the pilot may have been attempting to return to Croydon when {{the aircraft}} crashed into some trees at Marden Park, Godstone in thick fog. The aircraft burst into flames; three of the crew and three of the four passengers were killed in the crash. Passenger Glen Kidston escaped from the wreckage on fire, and extinguished the flames himself by <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass, sustaining minor injuries. Second pilot Prince Eugen of Schaumburg-Lippe also escaped from the wreckage, but he was seriously injured. Kidston raised the alarm and reported the accident to Croydon Airport. He was treated at Caterham Cottage Hospital. The fire was eventually extinguished by firemen from Caterham. Personnel from RAF Kenley assisted the local police in collecting the remains of the deceased and transporting them to a mortuary in Caterham. Von Schaumburg-Lippe died the day after the accident from injuries sustained in the crash.|$|E

25|$|Pitts enjoyed her {{greatest}} fame {{in the early}} 1930s, often starring in B movies and comedy short films, teamed with Thelma Todd. She played secondary parts in many films. Her stock persona (a fretful, flustered, worried spinster) made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films. She starred {{in a number of}} Hal Roach short films and features, and co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with Slim Summerville. Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she was relegated to comedy roles. A bitter disappointment was when she was replaced in the classic war drama All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) by Beryl Mercer after her initial appearance in previews drew unintentional laughs, despite her intense performance. She had viewers <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aisles in Finn and Hattie (1931), The Guardsman (1931), Blondie of the Follies (1932), Sing and Like It (1934) and Ruggles of Red Gap (1935). In 1936 and 1937 she portrayed Hildegarde Withers in two movies, succeeding Edna May Oliver as the spinster sleuth, but they were not well received.|$|E
25|$|Format in {{this tournament}} was {{same as the}} first one: four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. This {{competition}} was played in London, Lord's and Oval, and Nottingham. Out of the 10 full members, Zimbabwe withdrew its participation. Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland qualified for the tournament. It was full of surprise victories, as favourites fell {{at the hands of}} underdogs. The hosts, England, set the ball <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first match of the tournament as they were embarrassed by Netherlands in a final-ball thriller. Australia were dominated by West Indies, largely thanks to a thunderous innings by Chris Gayle, as he hit 88 off 50 balls, including some of the largest sixes seen in England. Australia were then defeated by Sri Lanka, who bowled tightly and batted with dominance, including quick-fire half centuries from Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Ireland beat Bangladesh in the Group stage to qualify for the Super Eight. Previous champions, India, lost all its matches of the Super Eight Stage. South Africa hadn't lost a group stage match going into the semi-finals against Pakistan, but Shahid Afridi produced a match winning performance with both bat and ball. He blasted his way to 51 and bagged two wickets for 16 runs to secure victory. The final at Lord's was a repeat of a group stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan; the latter lost the previous encounter. Pakistan managed to remove Dilshan, the Player of the Series for his 317 runs, without scoring, which had a big impact on the Sri Lanka innings. Sangakkara put up a fight scoring an unbeaten 64, but a target of 138 wasn't going to be easy to defend. Afridi proved this to be correct, hitting an unbeaten 54, which helped Pakistan win the trophy with 8 balls to spare.|$|E

500|$|After several {{recording}} {{sessions with}} writers and producers like Paul Epworth, Fraser T Smith and Rick Rubin, Adele got enough material {{for creating a}} full LP. She released her second studio album on 19 January 2011 under the title 21. Adele first intended to title the album <b>Rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Deep, her adaptation of the slang phrase [...] "roll deep", which summarises how she felt about her relationship; in her loose translation, the phrase refers to having someone [...] "that has your back" [...] and always supports you. However, the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences. Although {{she had wanted to}} avoid the number motif of her debut, Adele considered [...] "21" [...] the most fitting title as it represented her age {{at the time of the}} album's composition, serving as an autobiographical period piece, [...] and symbolised the personal maturity and artistic evolution since her debut.|$|E
500|$|AOL TV's Jason Hughes {{was more}} negative, criticizing the episode {{for taking a}} [...] "soft approach" [...] to the {{television}} industry when it [...] "had a chance for some sharp satire". He elaborated that the writers [...] "had {{a little bit of}} fun talking about networks meddling in shows – as well as agents trying to control content as when Joan Rivers booted Janeane Garofalo for being funnier than Krusty – and the differences between cable original programming and broadcast programming. But they had the potential they had to make some bold statements about television and how the industry works throughout, and simply didn't." [...] Hughes did, however, like the King of the Hill appearance, which he described as a [...] "fun nod". Further criticism came from the conservative Parents Television Council (PTC), which named The Simpsons the [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] because [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] contains [...] "content inappropriate for the Family Hour". The group wrote that the [...] "frank sexual dialogue warranted a TV-14 rating, but the episode was rated TV-PG. Fox network executives surely know that almost nothing that comes out of Joan Rivers’ mouth is rated PG; but they chose to rate the program inappropriately anyway, thus blindsiding parents and children with crude content." [...] PTC cited examples such as Annie saying that every night in his early days, Krusty [...] "had [...] <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aisles, followed by a roll in the hay with me," [...] and that [...] "Today's kids are less sensitive than an Army condom. They see more on TV than my mother did on her wedding night. And they don't complain about it for the next 50 years." ...|$|E
500|$|Döblin {{wrote the}} novel between fall 1921 and summer 1923. According to the author, the novel {{set out to}} explore the question: [...] "What will become {{of the human being}} if he keeps living like he lives now?" [...] Döblin would later write that the {{original}} inspiration for the novel was the sight of pebbles <b>rolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surf on the Baltic Sea coast during a family vacation in the summer of 1921; this epiphanic vision provoked a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in nature for Döblin, who began taking extensive notes in various Berlin museums and libraries on natural history and science, geology, geography, climatology, ethnography, and other fields. If he had originally conceived of the novel as a [...] "hymn to the city" [...] and to technology, as he got into the project it increasingly became an encomium to nature. In early 1922 he closed his medical practice for a month to further his research for the novel. The section on Iceland and Greenland, which occurs {{towards the end of the}} published novel, was one of the first sections Döblin envisioned and drafted, and an advance publication of this section appeared in the Vossische Zeitung on New Year's Day 1922 with the title Die Enteisung Grönlands im Jahre 2500. Das Zauberschiff (The Melting of Greenland's Ice in the Year 2500: The Magical Ship). In May 1922 Döblin rented a villa in Zehlendorf to complete the draft of the novel, a setting explicitly referenced in the novel's unusual [...] "Dedication". The exertions of drafting the novel provoked a sort of nervous breakdown: as he would later write, [...] "the fantasy was too wild and my brain would not release me." [...] In a 2011 biography, Wilfried Schoeller has suggested that there was an additional reason for Döblin's breakdown—namely, that the temporary move to Zehlendorf was also his unsuccessful attempt to leave his wife in favor of his lover Charlotte Niclas. According to Schoeller, this personal dimension left its mark on the novel, especially on the novel's dedication.|$|E
