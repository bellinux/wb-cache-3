Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English. There are sixty-five funded independent schools in Manitoba, including three boarding schools. These schools must follow the Manitoban curriculum and meet other provincial requirements. There are forty-four non-funded independent schools, which are not <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> those standards.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army Reserve is a {{collective}} name {{given to the}} reserve units of the Australian Army. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, the reserve military force has been known by many names, including the Citizens Forces, the Citizen Military Forces, the Militia and, unofficially, the Australian Military Forces. In 1980, however, the current name—Australian Army Reserve—was officially adopted, and it now consists {{of a number of}} components based around the level of commitment and training obligation that its members are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> certain levels.|$|E
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the increased consumption.|$|E

5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, {{and in recent}} years high-tech companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard {{based on the}} number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an open-ended sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E

5|$|The first submarine, , {{was laid}} down in February 1990. Collins launch was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings were not installed, the components of the combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, Collins was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that the submarine was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the extra effort <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Collins launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. Collins was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.|$|E
5|$|Today, the MLB commissioner's office {{directly}} {{employs the}} official scorers {{who are responsible}} for producing score reports, but most scorers are hired on the recommendation of the public relations directors of baseball teams. Official scorers are typically retired writers, coaches, and umpires. Unlike umpiring teams, MLB official scorers do not typically travel between stadiums. Each official scorer is assigned to a stadium for the season, with each stadium having one or more scorers. Scorers now have access to replay video from different angles which they can review before making a decision. As of 2012, MLB official scorers earned $150 per game. Official scorers are not <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the old BBWAA requirements, and are also no longer required to pass a written test, which was once administered by the National League before it was phased out in the mid-1990s. Potential scorers are generally required to briefly apprentice under an existing scorer before they are allowed to work alone.|$|E
