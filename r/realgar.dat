5|$|After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around 300) {{spoke of}} a mineral that when mixed with natron {{produced}} a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either <b>realgar</b> or orpiment, due to {{the relation between the}} unidentified mineral and his other writings.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} documented a {{wide range}} of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine <b>realgar,</b> its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E

25|$|A broad {{variety of}} sulfur {{compounds}} of arsenic are known. Orpiment (As2S3) and <b>realgar</b> (As4S4) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In As4S10, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As4S4 which features As-As bonds {{so that the}} total covalency of As is still 3. Both orpiment and <b>realgar,</b> as well as As4S3, have selenium analogs; the analogous As2Te3 {{is known as the}} mineral kalgoorlieite, and the anion As2Te− is known as a ligand in cobalt complexes.|$|E
25|$|Orpiment {{is found}} in {{volcanic}} environments, often together with other arsenic sulfides, mainly <b>realgar.</b> It is sometimes found in low-temperature hydrothermal veins, together with some other sulfide and sulfosalt minerals.|$|E
25|$|The second {{method of}} Wu Chengzi 務成子 expels the Three Worms, works miracles, and {{provides}} virtual immortality. The complex instructions involve melting mercury and lead {{in a special}} crucible – made from heating <b>realgar,</b> earthworm excreta, and cinnabar inside iron and copper tubes – {{in order to produce}} 1500 pounds of gold.|$|E
25|$|Minerals {{with the}} formula MAsS and MAs2 (M = Fe, Ni, Co) are the {{dominant}} commercial sources of arsenic, together with <b>realgar</b> (an arsenic sulfide mineral) and native arsenic. An illustrative mineral is arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is structurally related to iron pyrite. Many minor As-containing minerals are known. Arsenic also occurs in various organic {{forms in the}} environment.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{known to}} be {{potentially}} dangerous include Aconitum, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata), certain fungi, Aristolochia, Aconitum, Arsenic sulfide (<b>Realgar),</b> mercury sulfide, and cinnabar. Asbestos ore (Actinolite, Yang Qi Shi, 阳起石) is used to treat impotence in TCM. Due to galena's (litharge, lead(II) oxide) high lead content, it is {{known to be}} toxic. Lead, mercury, arsenic, copper, cadmium, and thallium have been detected in TCM products sold in the U.S. and China.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} waidan derives from wai (outside, exterior) and dan {{referring}} to alchemical operations, {{such as the}} preparation of chemical elixirs, made from cinnabar, <b>realgar,</b> and other substances generally involving mercury, sulfur, lead, and arsenic or else the animal and botanical products which are found in Chinese herbology and Traditional Chinese medicine. Waidan refers to practices relating {{to the process of}} making an elixir often containing herbal or chemical substances found outside of the body. This process involves esoteric oral instructions, building a laboratory, kindling and sustaining the special fires used in the production process, rules of seclusion and purification for the alchemist to follow, and various practices including the performance of ceremonies to protect the self and the ritual area. Waidan can also include following a dietary regimen which prescribes or proscribes certain foods. Preparing medicines and elixirs can be referred to as outer practices or waidan as these practices occur outside of the body until they are verified by the ingestion of medicines, herbs, and pills to bring about physical changes within the body, separate to the soul.|$|E

500|$|Citing {{evidence}} from an ancient work by Zheng Xuan (127–200), Su believed that physicians {{of the ancient}} Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC) used <b>realgar</b> as a remedy for ulcers. As believed in Su's day, the [...] "five poisons" [...] used by Zhou era physicians for this purpose {{were thought to be}} cinnabar, <b>realgar,</b> chalcanthite, alum, and magnetite. Su made systematic descriptions of animals and the environmental regions they could be found, such as different species of freshwater, marine, and shore crabs. For example, he noted that the freshwater crab species Eriocher sinensis could be found in the Huai River running through Anhui, in waterways near the capital city, as well as reservoirs and marshes of Hebei. Su's book was preserved and copied into the Bencao Gangmu of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) physician and pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518–1593).|$|E

2500|$|The word arsenic has {{its origin}} in the Syriac word [...] (al) zarniqa, from the Persian word [...] zarnikh, meaning [...] "yellow" [...] (literally [...] "gold-colored") and hence [...] "(yellow) orpiment". It was adopted into Greek as arsenikon (...) , a form that is folk etymology, being the neuter form of the Greek word arsenikos (...) , meaning [...] "male", [...] "virile". The Greek word was adopted in Latin as arsenicum, which in French became arsenic, from which the English word arsenic is taken. Arsenic sulfides (orpiment, <b>realgar)</b> and oxides have been known and used since ancient times. Zosimos (circa 300 AD) {{describes}} roasting sandarach (<b>realgar)</b> to obtain cloud of arsenic (arsenic trioxide), which he then reduces to metallic arsenic. As the symptoms of arsenic poisoning were somewhat ill-defined, it was frequently used for murder until {{the advent of the}} Marsh test, a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the Reinsch test.) Owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the [...] "poison of kings" [...] and the [...] "king of poisons".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{reference to}} {{what can be}} considered gunpowder in China occurred {{more than three hundred}} years later during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue (太上聖祖金丹秘訣) in 808, and then about half a century later in a Taoist text known as the Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe (真元妙道要略). The first formula was a combination of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb, and the Taoist text warned against an assortment of dangerous formulas, one of which corresponds with gunpowder: [...] "Some have heated together sulfur, <b>realgar</b> (arsenic disulphide), ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{reference}} to the incendiary properties of such mixtures is {{the passage of the}} Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe, a Taoist text tentatively dated to the mid-9th century: [...] "Some have heated together sulfur, <b>realgar</b> and saltpeter with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down." [...] The Chinese word for [...] "gunpowder" [...] is [...] , which literally means [...] "Fire Medicine"; however this name only came into use some centuries after the mixture's discovery. In the following centuries a variety of gunpowder weapons such as rockets, bombs, and land mines appeared before the first metal barrel firearms were invented.

Amongst these are the iodide of sulphur, per-iodide of zinc, per-chloride of tin, chloride of arsenic, hydrated chloride of arsenic, acetic acid, orpiment, <b>realgar,</b> artificial camphor, &c.; and from these it might perhaps be assumed that decomposition is dependent upon conducting power, and not the latter upon the former. The true relation, however, of conduction and decomposition in those bodies governed by the general law which it is the object of this paper to establish, can only be satisfactorily made out from a far more extensive series of observations than those I have yet been able to supply[A].|$|E
5000|$|Although practiced {{for many}} centuries, the {{drinking}} of <b>realgar</b> wine and {{the painting of}} children with <b>realgar</b> have come under scrutiny in modern times. <b>Realgar</b> itself has low toxicity when ingested since its poor solubility hampers its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, but the minerals used in <b>realgar</b> wine may contain substantial amounts of other inorganic arsenic compounds, such as arsenate and arsenite, which can be absorbed by the body. [...] Arsenic is a potent poison and a causal factor in urinary bladder, skin, liver and lung cancers. There {{have been a number}} of poisonings associated with <b>realgar</b> ingestion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Realgar</b> wine can {{be bought}} ready-made, but it is often {{prepared}} from homemade yellow wine and <b>realgar</b> mineral powder bought from drugstores, markets, or street vendors.

50|$|In realgar's crystal structure, each arsenic atom is {{bonded to}} two sulphur atoms {{and one other}} arsenic atom. The As-As bonds are 30% weaker than the As-S bonds and certain {{wavelengths}} of lights interact with the crystal structure of <b>realgar,</b> breaking the weaker bonds between arsenic atoms.
