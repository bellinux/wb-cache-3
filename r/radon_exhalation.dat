40|$|Radon and thoron {{emissions}} from lithophysae‐rich tuff under increasing deformation are measured {{to determine how}} mechanical damage affects gas emission levels in tuffs. Mechanical properties of rocks under stresses should be carefully considered to properly interpret data from geochemical field monitoring. Two samples are uniaxially loaded up to failure, while two others are unloaded {{at the end of}} the elastic phase, in order to achieve the highest compaction of existing pores. Changes in the porosity of deformed samples are evidenced by helium pycnometer and microscopy analyses. <b>Radon</b> and thoron <b>exhalation</b> rates are measured on groups of two samples by alpha spectrometer technique. Results show that tuff samples are characterised by a dual porosity consisting of a macroporosity, given by isolated large pores with sizes from mm‐ up to cm‐scale and a microporosity ranging between microns to hundreds of microns. At the end of the elastic phase pervasive pore collapse is observed, due to the closure of the cm‐scale macropores. This is mirrored by a significant decrease of radon and thoron release. After failure, a further reduction of porosity in the rock adjacent to the fault planes is observed due to extensive closure of both macropores and micropores. At this stage radon and thoron emissions increase. The formation of new exhaling surfaces is the main carrier of the bulk increase of <b>radon</b> and thoron <b>exhalations,</b> strongly prevailing over the densification carried out from the compaction mechanisms.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{identify}} the potential sources of <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> and its measurement in underground uranium mines to control the radiation levels within safe limits and protect miners from radiation hazards. Methods: An extensive literature review on <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> in underground uranium mines from various sources such as uranium ore, backfill tailings and mine water has been carried out. The influence of different important factors, viz. ore grade, porosity, grain size and moisture content on <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> has been discussed in depth. Different methods for the measurement of <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> from various sources in mines have also been presented in this paper. Results: The review of literature revealed that the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate in porous uranium bearing rocks is less affected by the ore grade than in non-porous rocks. The exhalation of radon from backfill tailings is quantitatively more significant than from the uranium ore itself due to higher bulk porosity and enhanced surface area.

30|$|Unlike {{the case}} in El-Khiam along Profile-A, <b>radon</b> {{temporal}} <b>exhalation</b> rates and concentrations in Profile-B remained approximately at the same levels during the measurements, except those times during which thunder occurred, which produced maximal levels of radon emission as shown in Figs.  9 and 10.

Thus, a comparison between the results obtained in both profiles located at different locations (segment) leads us to conclude that Rn concentrations showing high rates obtained at the fault in Profile-A are due to seismic activity along the fractured segment boundaries of the Yammouneh Fault.

The ratios are 5, 13, 15, and 9 for the boreholes AW 2, A 4, A 10, and A 15, respectively. Borehole AW 2 produced a factor of 5 due to its location just outside the damaged zone of the fault. The higher factors produced within the damaged zone {{with respect to the}} zone surface, as seen in Fig.  4, indicate anomalous high Rn emission, which is outside the Rn emission anticipated under natural normal conditions for homogenous soil.

The ratio of C [...] x [...] h/C [...] x [...] s is 5, 9, and 9 for boreholes AW 2, A 10, and A 15, respectively. The ratio of 5 is consistent with the above result for the AW 2 top surface, while the higher ratios 9 and 9 for A 10 and A 15 show Rn anomalous emission due to the presence and the dynamics of the fault trace line. These results are supported also by the averaged C [...] x [...] h obtained from the boreholes in the range 12 A– 15 A located close to the fault trace line, where this average is 12 times higher than C [...] x [...] s obtained at soil surface far from the surface area of the damaged zone. These results confirm that the increase in the Rn concentrations and exhalation rates at the fault trace line and the anomalous variation of <b>radon</b> concentrations and <b>exhalation</b> rates are due to the dynamics of the Yammouneh Fault boundary at the studied segment. These results show also that the boreholes methodology is more appropriate for monitoring radon anomalies related to fault tectonic events. This conclusion on the anomalous behavior of radon emission at the fault location is also confirmed by the results of the radium Ra- 226 measurements in the soil (Sect.  6).|$|R
40|$|Aims: Due to {{increasing}} occurrences of lung cancer, <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rates, radon concentrations, and lung cancer risks in {{several types of}} commonly used granite stone, samples used for flooring in buildings, have been investigated. Subjects and Methods: We measured the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rates due to granite stones {{by means of an}} AlphaGUARD Model PQ 2000 in a cube container with changeable floor by various granite stones. The lung cancer risk and percentage of lung cancer deaths (LCRn) due to those conditions were calculated using Darby's model. Results: The <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rates ranged from 1. 59 ± 0. 41 to 9. 43 ± 0. 74 Bq/m 2 /h. The radon concentrations in the standard room with poor and normal ventilation were calculated 20. 10 – 71. 09 Bq/m 3 and 16. 12 – 47. 01 Bq/m 3, respectively. Conclusions: The estimated numbers of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon due to granite stones in 2013 were 145 (3. 33 %) and 103 (2. 37 %) for poor and normal ventilation systems, respectively. According to our estimations, the values of 3. 33 % and 2. 37 % of lung cancer deaths in 2013 are attributed to <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> of granite stones with poor and normal ventilation systems, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The strict {{correlation}} between indoor radon exposure and potential health hazard to occupants is well known. The indoor radon concentrations mainly depend on <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> from surrounding soil, {{but also on}} exhalation from building materials and radon in domestic water supply. The radon emanating from building materials achieves a larger relevance {{in some areas of}} the world, where rocks enriched in radon precursors, are used in construction industry, either as cut-stone or in a granular form to prepare cements. The parameter that better expresses the indoor accumulation of radon released by geological materials is the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate. With a view to this, {{it is very important to}} study factors that influence the phenomenon and to standardise the experimental procedure to measure <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rates. An experimental set-up to measure simultaneously 222 Rn and 220 Rn release from building material is presented. The method makes use of a continuous monitor equipped with a solid-state alpha detector, in-line connected to a small accumulation chamber. Parameters controlling exhalation rates are discussed: temperature, air mixing, humidity and particle size. Guidelines for a standard experimental protocol are advanced and a tentative classification of building materials is proposed on the basis of <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rates required to reach legal indoor radon action level...|$|E
40|$|The Nuclear Engineering Section of the National Technical University of Athens {{undertook}} {{the organisation}} of a European building material <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate intercomparison {{exercise in the}} framework of the European Research into Radon In Construction Concerted Action (ERRICCA). The intercomparison started in June 1998 and it was concluded in February 1999. Twenty participants from 13 countries took part. The exercise focused on the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate determination from a concrete slab, specially constructed to produce radon surface flux well below 10 mBqm(- 2) s(- 1). This paper describes the measurement results obtained using different instruments and methods in order to assess 'state-of-the-art' low-level <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> measurements, being performed around Europe. Results are compared to each other and they provide an indication of the collective precision of such measurements fur low exhalation rates. The agreement, with a few exceptions, is satisfactorily good. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Geological {{materials}} usually {{contaminated with}} naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) {{have become a}} focus of great attention. These NORM under certain conditions can reach hazardous contamination levels. Some contamination levels may be sufficiently severe that precautions must be taken. Sixteen commonly market available building materials, which nowadays are used in Ramsar, were analyzed for their natural radioactivity and <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate. Natural radionuclides concentration in building material samples {{vary according to the}} type and origin of the building materials. Most building materials contain small amounts of NORM. The obtained results indicate that the mean of specific activities in collected samples are less than the world average of 35, 30, and 400 Bq.kg− 1 for 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K, respectively, as reported by UNSCEAR [14]. <b>Radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rates in concrete, in some granite, and in block are more than other samples. However, marble and travertine samples indicate low <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate.|$|E
40|$|A special laboratory, the Radioisotope Unit Radon Analysis Laboratory, {{has been}} built {{for the study of}} radon {{mitigation}} in high-rise buildings. Reduction of <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate from concrete walls as a result of depressurizing the interior of the wall was studied by embedding tunnels in a wall and pumping away the radon in the wall. The reduction in exhalation rate was quantified against the applied depressurization, the separation of the tunnels, the depth of the tunnel, and the thickness of the wall. Results show that <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate from a wall embedded with tunnels can be reduced significantly by applying depressurization. For example, the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate from a wall of 20 cm thickness containing tunnels separated by 0. 7 m can be reduced by 60 % at a depressurization of 67 kPa (20 in Hg). This paper summarizes the effect of depressurization and suggests practical ways of applying the technique in radon mitigation in high-rise commercial buildings. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} radioactive, colorless and odorless gas {{emitted from}} natural radium existing in the ground, radon {{is an element}} of the U 238 chain. Based on conducted studies, Ramsar has been {{recognized as one of the}} most polluted areas in the world as far as the exhalation of radon is concerned. The most important resources of radon in Ramsar are soil resources, water resources, groundwater, surface water and hot springs. In this study, 50 stations in high radioactivity areas of Ramsar were selected and the position of each station in terms of latitude and longitude was recorded with a GPS device; then, <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> and gamma dose rates were measured using an AlphaGuard device and a portable gamma spectroscopy system, respectively. Furthermore, some environmental parameters such as temperature, pressure, relative humidity, the distance of each station from the mineral hot springs, the time interval between the rainfall and the day of measurement, soil moisture status and also weather conditions at the time of measurement were recorded, and the effect of measured environmental parameters on the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate was subsequently evaluated using Spss software and finally modeled by linear regression method. The gamma dose rate was around 58 - 7100 n. sv/hr and the <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate was about 9 - 15370 mBq/m 2. s. In this study, only the variables of gamma dose rate and soil moisture were effective on exhalation rate. The correlation between gamma dose and <b>radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate was significant and higher than the other variables. Results indicate that the estimated average annual effective <b>Radon</b> <b>exhalation</b> rate for the study area is much higher than the worldwide average figure of 16 mBq/m 2. s reported by UNSCEAR. It can therefore be concluded that an assessment of the radiological hazard of living these area is crucial...|$|E
