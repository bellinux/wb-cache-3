5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.

He would, however, <b>resign</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E

5|$|After the season, it {{was rumored}} that the Redskins were {{interested}} in promoting him to replace head coach Turk Edwards, but the franchise denied it and Shaughnessy {{would not comment on}} his plans. In January 1947, he quit as Maryland coach, stating {{that he did not want}} to remain athletic director or <b>resign</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Washington Redskins, both of which the school wanted. Shaughnessy said he would work full-time for the Redskins for the remaining year on his contract, and might return to coach only college football at the end of his term, possibly with Maryland. President Byrd affirmed that Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record was not related to his departure. He was replaced by split T proponent Jim Tatum.|$|E

He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a British subject.

5|$|Blaine {{had always}} {{believed}} his health to be fragile, {{and by the}} time he joined Harrison’s cabinet he truly was unwell. The years at the State Department also brought Blaine personal tragedy as two of his children, Walker and Alice, died suddenly in 1890. Another son, Emmons, died in 1892. With these family issues and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and announced that he would <b>resign</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine’s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party’s nomination for president.|$|E

On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would <b>resign</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was {{in position to}} not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to <b>resign</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria. During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal {{was rejected by the}} White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.|$|E
