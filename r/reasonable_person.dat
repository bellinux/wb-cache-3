50|$|Most recently, it {{has been}} argued that the SCC erred in affirming the FCAs {{application}} of a <b>reasonable</b> business <b>person</b> test for the purpose of s.69(2), and that the SCC infused additional uncertainty as to which arm’s length test applies (i.e., an empirical arm’s length test or a <b>reasonable</b> business <b>person</b> test).

5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a <b>reasonable</b> <b>person</b> would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any <b>reasonable</b> <b>person</b> must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|The New York State legal {{standard}} for the self-defense justification use of deadly force shifted after rulings in the case.

On appeal, it was argued that he should have directed the jury to consider a <b>reasonable</b> <b>person</b> suffering from 'battered woman syndrome'.

25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different.

The test is what the <b>reasonable</b> <b>person</b> would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the <b>reasonable</b> <b>person</b> would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|Calculable loss: There are two {{elements}} {{that must be}} at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an intellectual}} biography of American political philosopher John Rawls [1921 - 2002] from {{his early years}} to {{the publication of his}} classic work, A Theory of Justice [1971]. I focus the historical narrative on Rawls's changing conceptions of philosophy: his ways of raising ethical and political questions and justifying answers to them. I pay particular attention to two aspects of the conception of philosophy found in A Theory of Justice : its claim that ethical and political positions are defended by showing that all <b>reasonable</b> <b>persons</b> endorse them in their political judgments, and its aspiration to explicate all of these political judgments in terms of principles of justice. This conception of philosophy was very influential for Anglophone political thought, contributing to the resurgence of analytic political theory in the 1950 s and 1960 s. I aim to understand the intellectual origins of this influential philosophical approach and thereby shed light on A Theory of Justice and contemporary political thought. Taking this historical approach, I follow the development of Rawls's thought, contextualizing him in contemporary traditions and analyzing his numerous private papers recently deposited in the Harvard University Archives. I argue that, much to our surprise, Rawls's conception of philosophy originated in logical positivism, the very tradition that is thought to have foreclosed the possibility of political thought in the 1940 s. Inspired by logical positivists, Rawls modeled ethics on the "method of science," and, taking ethical judgment as "data," tried to formulate principles, or laws, to explicate them. This analogy between reasoning in ethics and reasoning in science provided Rawls with a conception of objectivity: principles of justice were objective if they explicated the considered political judgments of all <b>reasonable</b> <b>persons.</b> This notion of objectivity made possible reasoned discussion on ethical and political issues and required attention to actual political questions. Yet it also committed Rawls to a contestable view that all <b>reasonable</b> <b>persons</b> agree on a sufficient number of political judgments to yield a conception of justice. This conception of philosophy changed over the following two decades, but, I argue, it remained positivist. In the early 1950 s, Rawls drew on linguistic philosophy's conception of ethical reasoning as a practice, and in the late 1950 s he was led on the Wittgensteinian path of considering political questions against the background of seeing morality as a form of life. Nevertheless, the influence of his Harvard colleague W. V. O. Quine in the 1960 s brought to light Rawls's positivist conception of philosophy. Rawls continued to justify political principles by the fact that all <b>reasonable</b> <b>persons</b> endorse them in their political judgments. My historical narrative contests and supplements the traditional interpretations of Rawls as a Kantian or a theorist in the social contract and rational choice theory traditions. It therefore paints a different picture of 20 th century Anglophone political thought. But, as I argue in Epilogue, my narrative also helps to illuminate Rawls's shift to Political Liberalism. Doing so, I hope it opens new questions about contemporary attempts to define shared political reasons...|$|R
25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a <b>reasonable</b> <b>person,</b> with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E
25|$|The New York Court of Appeals, in People v. Goetz, {{reversed}} Judge Crane's dismissal, {{affirming the}} prosecutor's charge {{to the grand}} jury that a defendant's subjective belief that he is in imminent danger does not by itself justify the use of deadly force. The court agreed with the prosecutor that an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical <b>reasonable</b> <b>person,</b> is also required. The appeals court further held that Judge Crane's opinion that the testimony of Canty and Ramseur was perjurious was speculative and inappropriate. All charges were reinstated, and the case was sent to trial.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a <b>reasonable</b> <b>person</b> would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} recent {{attempts in}} rational choice theory {{to take account}} of the opportunity aspect of freedom, i. e., the value of alternatives, in measuring freedom.

Furthermore, we argue that differences between measures of opportunity freedom reflect different moral standards for the quality of alternatives, not different conceptions of freedom as such. Hence, we propose to separate discussions about the meaning of the concept of freedom from the issue of determining the value of opportunity sets...|$|R
