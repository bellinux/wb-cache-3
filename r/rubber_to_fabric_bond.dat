5000|$|In 1836, Edwin M. Chaffee, of the Roxbury India Rubber Company, {{patented}} a four-roll calender <b>to</b> make <b>rubber</b> sheet. Chaffee {{worked with}} Charles Goodyear {{with the intention}} to [...] "produce a sheet of <b>rubber</b> laminated <b>to</b> a <b>fabric</b> base". Calenders were also used for paper and fabrics long before later applications for thermoplastics. With {{the expansion of the}} rubber industry the design of calenders grew as well, so when PVC was introduced the machinery was already capable of processing it into film. As recorded in an overview {{on the history of the}} development of calenders, [...] "There was development in both Germany and the United States and probably the first successful calendering of PVC was in 1935 in Germany, where in the previous year the Hermann Berstorff Company of Hannover designed the first calender specifically to process this plastic".|$|R
50|$|For {{industrial}} applications and in power transmission, technical textiles {{are used in}} conveyor belts.

50|$|Dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used durable-press finish. In this process, the chemical is first applied <b>to</b> the <b>fabric.</b> Then the <b>fabric</b> is heated <b>to</b> allow the chemicals to react with the cellulose molecules. In the reaction, the molecules of the <b>fabric</b> are <b>bonded</b> together <b>to</b> keep them from moving and causing wrinkles. For this reason, durable-press treated garments behave as synthetics. However, almost all the wrinkle resistant garments are made with poly/cotton blends fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Modern mousepads are {{typically}} made of lesser density rubber composites (open cell styrene, butadiene rubber or open cell SBR) with <b>fabric</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> the upper surface. However, many {{other types of}} material have been used, including fabric, plastics, recycled rubber tires, neoprene, silicone rubber, leather, glass, cork, wood, aluminum, stone and stainless steel. High-quality gaming mats are usually made from plastic, glass, aluminum or high-tech fibers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Carboxy Terminated Liquid Natural Rubber (CTNR) was {{prepared}} by photochemical reaction using maleic anhydride and masticated natural rubber (NR). The use of CTNR as an adhesive in bonding <b>rubber</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubber</b> and <b>rubber</b> <b>to</b> metal was studied. The peel strengths and lap shear {{strengths of the}} adherends which were bonded using CTNR were determined. The effect of using a tri isocyanate with CTNR in <b>rubber</b> <b>to</b> metal bonding was also studied. It is found that CTNR can effectively be used in bonding <b>rubber</b> <b>to</b> <b>rubber</b> and <b>rubber</b> <b>to</b> mild steel...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of the textile bonded seams was analyzed. Two or more fabric layers joining are based on use of base layers structural properties and thermoplastic properties of adhesive film used for bonding. Five commercial produced fabrics of different structure (woven, knitted, laminate) and fiber content (polyester, cotton, flax) were used in this experiment. Thermoplastic polyurethane film was transferred {{from the base of}} silicone <b>to</b> <b>fabric</b> using 160 °C temperature and 10 seconds pressing duration. <b>Fabric</b> layers were <b>bonded</b> using 180 °C temperature and 30 seconds pressing duration. The {{strength of}} textile bonded seams was investigated using four different bond types, in order to determine method suitable for the analyzes of bonded seams of knitted fabrics and method suitable <b>to</b> analyze woven <b>fabrics.</b> DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
