40|$|A novel {{modelling}} {{approach to}} predict the influence of road texture on the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> of car tyres is presented where the large static tyre deformations and the small texture induced tyre vibrations are treated separately. The energy dissipation due to the large continuous cyclic deformation of the tyre cross section for a treadless tyre subject to nominal load on a smooth road is determined in a non-linear steady-state rolling analysis on an FEM tyre model. The additional energy dissipation resulting from the contact forces and tyre vibrations due to the combined effect of the tread profile and the road texture, are determined based on a modal representation of the deformed tyre. The predicted <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> are compared to experimental data.

40|$|Tyre-road <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> is a {{major factor}} in the {{performance}} of a vehicle. By investigating the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance,</b> a better understanding of the efficiency of different wheel diameters will develop. A major issue in the mountain biking world is the relative merits of using 26 in. versus 29 in. wheels and the resultant effect on cyclist performance. As <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> is indicative of the behaviour of a vehicle over specific terrain, it can be viewed as an objective parameter to compare the relative performance of these two wheel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> of four mountain bikes as affected by wheel diameter and terrain type, cyclist mass, tyre inflation pressure and suspension type using coast-down tests. The following major conclusions were drawn: average <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> of the 26 in. diameter wheel was higher than that of the 29 in. diameter wheel; a sand surfacing had the highest <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> coefficient; terrain surface showed the largest effect on <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured, followed by the cyclist mass, wheel diameter and tyre inflation pressure; and the best combination for maintaining momentum after traversing over an obstacle was high tyre inflation pressure, low cyclist mass and full suspension 29 in. wheel diameter option.

However, underground mining {{electric vehicles}} (UMEVs) require more stable, reliable and robust vehicle system compared with traditional EVs due to their special working conditions and the complex road conditions. Thus, a proper controller needs to be designed. This paper first presents the modeling of an UMEV for both acceleration and braking. Then, the controller based on the sliding mode control (SMC) is designed to track the longitudinal velocity and keep the longitudinal slip ratio in a desired stable region {{in the presence of the}} bounded system uncertainties.

Based on the terramechanical studies of wheel-soil interactions, the authors have developed a method for the determination of wheel-grass friction and <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which are of critical importance for the ground performance of an airplane. Moreover, a mobile application has been created for use by pilots, controllers or airfield administration crew. The application connects online with a weather service to gather atmospheric data as inputs for a mathematical model that produces a real-time cone index (CI) value for a given airfield.

5000|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Crr, {{significantly}} decreases as {{the weight}} of the rail car per wheel increases. For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same [...] "economy of scale" [...] shows up in testing of mine rail cars. The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.|$|E
50|$|Rolling {{resistance}} can {{be expressed}} by the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> (RRC or Crr), which {{is the value of}} the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. A lower coefficient means the tires will use less energy to travel a certain distance. The coefficient is mostly considered as independent of speed, but for precise calculations it is tabled at several speeds or an additional speed-dependent part is used. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) are usually performed on new tires.|$|E
5000|$|For {{pneumatic}} tires, {{the direction}} of change in Crr (<b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient)</b> depends {{on whether or not}} tire inflation is increased with increasing load. It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) [...] "schedule", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.|$|E
50|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is a complex}} function of the materials and construction methods used and the inflation pressure, with higher pressure (up to a limit), thinner casing layers, wider tires (compared to narrower tires {{at the same pressure}} and of the same material and construction), larger-diameter wheels, and more-elastic tread material all tending to have less <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b> Rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> may vary from 0.002 to 0.010, and have been found to decrease with inflation pressure and increase with vertical load. A study at the University of Oldenburg found that Schwalbe Standard GW HS 159 tires have a Crr of 0.00455 for the ISO size 47-406 (20 in x 1.5 in) and, for the same model tire, a Crr of 0.00336 for the ISO size 37-622 (700C): a size to resistance ratio of about −1.8.|$|R
40|$|Coast-down {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} on bicycles and motorized vehicles in order to estimate retarding forces and respective coefficients. The mathematical model behind coast-down data analysis is usually {{based on the assumption}} that both drag and <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> do not depend on the vehicle speed. This assumption restricts the model validity to the specifically tested range of speeds and provide averaged values for the force coefficients. In the attempt to overcome this limit, the proposal of a complete polynomial equation of motion is developed, evaluated and discussed on a human powered vehicle case study. The analysis points out that the extended model is adequate for experimental data fitting and could potentially provide a more reliable power-speed prediction outside the testing range. However, the expressions included in the model in order to account for speed dependent coefficients is a first approximation with limited capability to represent these complex phenomena. As a consequence, further experimental testing is needed in order to achieve a validation. Advantages and side effects of both the classical and the complete polynomial models are discussed, concluding that the two approaches could be complementary and could answer different needs that specifically depend on the purpose of the coast-down analysis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractROSANNE is a collaborative {{project in}} the Seventh EU Framework Programme which aims at developing/harmonising {{measurement}} methods for skid resistance, noise emission and <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> of road pavements as a preparation for standardization. To achieve this, the project is following the recommendations of key predecessor projects like TYROSAFE, HERMES, SILVIA, SILENCE and MIRIAM as well as considering the ongoing work in CEN and ISO groups. Work package 1 deals with skid resistance and aims at the harmonization of skid resistance measurement following the TYROSAFE Roadmap, by deriving conversion factors for friction indices based on similar groups of devices, namely longitudinal and sideways skid resistance measurement devices. During the first project year a first round robin test {{was carried out in}} Nantes, ten different devices participated to the test. The results of this test are collected in report D 1. 2 “Analysis of data from the first round of tests and initial development of the common scale”. Work package 2 is dealing with the pavement influence on road traffic noise emission: the main objective of this work package is to combine the existing measurement methods of SPB (ISO 11819 - 1) and CPX (ISO/DIS 11819 - 2) into a stable and reliable harmonised pavement noise emission characterisation method. The project is validating procedure incorporating correction mechanisms for temperature influence and investigating its potential use for noise calculation methods like the one proposed by the CNOSSOS-EU project. Work package 3 is dealing with <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance,</b> where the ROSANNE project is mainly building on the results obtained in the MIRIAM project and is considering standardized trailer measurements of <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of road surfaces. After a first report D 3. 1 “State of the art on <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement devices including draft standard outline” the following main report was produced “Parameters influencing <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> and possible correction procedures”. In the frame of work package 4 the project is also exploring the potential for developments in the measurement of surface texture in order to find out parameters that better reflect the physical process of tyre/road interaction and that may improve the understanding of how the texture influences noise emission, skid <b>resistance</b> and <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b> In addition to that this work package is also investigating the performance of reference tyres and pavements which are necessary for the measurement of all three road surface properties.

5000|$|When {{measured}} by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014. In {{the case of}} bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved. These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with coast-down tests. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.In 2009 The CEC used a rating called Rolling Resistance Force RRF. RRF and RRC, <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> are very similar. Difference is taking the RRF and dividing it by the load(weight) to get RRC.

40|$|A current {{application}} in {{a collaboration between}} Chalmers University of Technology and Volvo Group Trucks Technology concerns the global optimization of a complex simulation-based function describing the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a truck tyre. This function is crucial for the optimization of truck tyres selection considered. The need to explicitly describe and optimize this function provided the main motivation for the research presented in this article. Many optimization algorithms for simulation-based optimization problems use sample points to create a computationally simple surrogate model of the objective function. Typically, not all important characteristics of the complex function (as, e. g., non-negativity) —here referred to as expert knowledge—are automatically inherited by the surrogate model. We demonstrate the integration of several types of expert knowledge into a radial basis function interpolation. The methodology is first illustrated on a simple example function and then applied to a function describing the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of truck tyres. Our numerical results indicate that expert knowledge can be advantageously incorporated and utilized when creating global approximations of unknown functions from sample points...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a method to {{estimate}} the current <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a four-wheeled electric bicycle. We derived linear regression models between the velocity of the bicycle and the vibrations at the handlebars {{to be able to}} classify the current road surface and consequently the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> To derive the models, we performed experiments on three different surfaces typical for cycling - asphalt, fine gravel and coarse gravel. A cyclist performed five test rides on each surface on different days at varying velocities. During the experiments power output at the pedals and velocity were measured. Additionally, vibrations at the handlebars were measured using a smartphone. Then, a curve consisting of the mathematical representation of rolling and air resistance was fitted to the experimental data and the rolling resistance coefficients of the surfaces and the effective frontal area of bicycle and cyclist were estimated. The magnitude of the vibrations at the handlebars was calculated for each test ride and each surface. From this data the linear regression models for each surface were derived using velocity as the predictor. Analyzing the data yielded rolling resistance coefficients of 0. 01221, 0. 01468 and 0. 01832 for asphalt, fine gravel and coarse gravel, respectively, and showed significant difference. The magnitude of vibrations increases significantly with velocity and is higher for surfaces with higher rolling resistance. To validate the model the outdoor experiments were repeated with a similar prototype of a four-wheeled electric bicycle. The results can be used to classify the current surface and therefore estimate the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> We believe that this system can help improve the estimation of the residual range of electric bicycles by providing more detailed information about the environment and consequently enhance their operating distance and the usage of the bicycle...|$|E

Experimental data acquisitioning was carried out using a soil bin facility with single-wheel tester at seven inflation pressures of tire (i. e. 100 – 700 kPa) and seven different wheel loads (1 – 7 KN) with two soil textures and two tire types. The experimental datasets were used to develop a feed-forward with back propagation ANN model. Four criteria (i. e.

40|$|Abstract—Skid-steered {{vehicles}} {{are often used}} as outdoor mobile robots due to their robust mechanical structure and high maneu-verability. Sliding, along with rolling, is inherent to general curvi-linear motion, which makes both kinematic and dynamic modeling difficult. For the purpose of motion planning, this paper devel-ops and experimentally verifies dynamic models of a skid-steered wheeled vehicle for general planar (2 -D) motion and for linear 3 -D motion. These models are characterized by the <b>coefficient</b> of <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance,</b> the <b>coefficient</b> of friction, and the shear deforma-tion modulus, which have terrain-dependent values. The dynamic models also include motor saturation and motor power limitations, which enable correct prediction of vehicle velocities when travers-ing on hills. It is shown that the closed-loop system that results from inclusion {{of the dynamics of}} the [proportional–integral–derivative (PID) ] speed controllers for each set of wheels does a much bet-ter job than the open-loop model of predicting the vehicle linear and angular velocities. For a vehicle turning with small linear and angular accelerations, the model provides accurate predictions of velocities and reasonable predictions of torques. Hence, the closed-loop model is recommended for motion planning.

5000|$|Wheels are {{nowadays}} {{almost universally}} made of polyurethane (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or {{have too much}} rolling resistance.In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity. Wheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see Durometer) and usually ranges between 72A-93A (higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but {{tend to be more}} durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. In the 1990s, wheel <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> (CRR - <b>coefficient</b> of <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance)</b> tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A durometer range, with <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> dramatically increasing below 75A durometer and above 85A durometer. In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> in the 82A-84A durometer range. Wheel profiles and thicknesses again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an ice blade. More rounded profiles provided lower <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> due to the greater [...] "belly" [...] or tire that increased resilience (or [...] "rebound"); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an ice blade), but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased amount rubber on the tire. To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels. [...] This advantage of more wheels having less <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> has been largely negated by the 100-110mm diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} in road vehicle is a demand in today’s {{society in the}} view of rising fuel cost and emission regulation. An important source for losses in road vehicles is tyre rolling resistance. For tyres with <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 012, the fuel consumption due to tyre rolling resistance losses can amount to 20 % - 30 % of total consumption depending on the drive cycle, according to the study ‘the tyre: rolling resistance and fuel savings’ by Michelin, 2003. This study investigates mathematical models based on physical understanding and literature reviews of tyre rolling resistance phenomena. The work aims to develop a tyre model that explains the influence of tyre inflation pressure, tyre size, velocity and normal load on the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The model is based on free rolling condition without taking the longitudinal slip into account. The consideration of the model developed includes vertical tyre stiffness with geometrical belt constraint accounting for tyre vertical deflection and counter-deflection, tyre viscous and coulomb damping effect and rotational aerodynamic drag effect. The vertical stiffness model accounts for tyre geometry indirectly by means of constants in the model. The stiffness model and the simple lumped damping model together takes into account various hysteresis losses. The tyre model developed for rolling resistance gives results which are in very good agreement with the experimental data. For example an 8. 3 % increase in tyre outer radius from 60 cm to 65 cm, the proposed model predicts a reduction of 4. 8 % in tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> compared to 5 % suggested by experimental data. Furthermore, a change to low rolling resistance tyre in LeanNova’s energy simulation model corresponds to a reduction in the average energy consumption by 3. 8 % for a NEDC run in an electric vehicle and a reduction of 1. 3 % in average fuel consumption for a NEDC run in a conventional vehicle. Through these findings and the proposed tyre model that calculates rolling resistance by taking a limited number of tyre parameters into consideration, a foundation for physical understanding of tyre rolling resistance phenomena is established...|$|E
