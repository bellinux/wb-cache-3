Mental retardation in some cases involves malformation of the dendritic spines, which form the post-synaptic connections between neurons.

After the cloning of various genes implicated in X-linked mental retardation, three genes that have effects on Rho signaling were identified, including oligophrenin-1 (a GAP protein that stimulates GTPase activity of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA), PAK3 (involved {{with the effects of}} Rac and Cdc42 on the actin cytoskeleton) and αPIX (a GEF that helps activate Rac1 and Cdc42).

Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a largely hydrophilic protein with two potential hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The N-terminal half of CNF 2 showed striking homology (27 % identity and 80 % conserved residues) to the N-terminal portion of Pasteurella multocida toxin. Methylamine protection experiments and immunofluorescence studies suggested that CNF 2 enters the cytosol of the target cell through an acidic compartment and induces the reorganization of actin into stress fibers. Since the formation of stress fibers in eukaryotic cells involves <b>Rho</b> <b>proteins,</b> we radiolabeled these small GTP-binding proteins from CNF 2 -treated and control cells with a Rho-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase.

In this work, using in vivo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation, we show that hCNK 1 interacts with the active form of Rho A (G 14 V) proteins. The domain of hCNK 1 that allows binding to <b>Rho</b> <b>proteins</b> involves the C-terminal PH domain. Overexpression of hCNK 1 {{does not affect the}} actin cytoskeleton and does not modify the appearance of stress fibers in cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of RhoA. In contrast, hCNK 1 was able to significantly decrease the RhoA-induced transcriptional activity of the serum response element (SRE) without effect on the Ras-induced SRE activation.

Next, the growing mass can invade across its normal boundaries through the alteration of adhesion proteins potentially caused by <b>Rho</b> <b>proteins.</b> Finally, after inhibition of apoptosis, cell polarity and adhesion molecules, the cancerous mass is free to metastasize and spread to other regions of the body.|$|R

5000|$|Much of what {{is known}} about {{cellular}} morphology changes and the effects of Rho proteins comes from the creation of a constitutively active mutated form of the protein. Mutation of a key amino acid can alter the conformation of the entire protein, causing it to permanently adopt a conformation that resembles the GTP-bound state.

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the formation of}} lamellipodia and filopodia, intracellular concentration and cross-talk between different Rho proteins drives the extensions and contractions that cause cellular locomotion. Sakumura et al. proposed a model based on differential equations that helps explain the activity of Rho proteins and their relationship to motion. This model encompassed the three proteins Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac. Cdc42 was assumed to encourage filopodia elongation and block actin depolymerization. RhoA was considered to encourage actin retraction. Rac was treated to encourage lamellipodia extension but block actin depolymerization. These three proteins, although significantly simplified, covered the key steps in cellular locomotion. Through various mathematical techniques, solutions to the differential equations that described various regions of activity based on intracellular activity were found. The paper concludes by showing that the model predicts that there are a few threshold concentrations that cause interesting effects on the activity of the cell. Below a certain concentration, there is very little activity, causing no extension of the arms and feet of the cell. Above a certain concentration, the <b>Rho</b> <b>protein</b> causes a sinusoidal oscillation much like the extensions and contractions of the lamellipodia and filopodia. In essence, this model predicts that increasing the intracellular concentration of these three key active Rho proteins causes an out-of-phase activity of the cell, resulting in extensions and contractions that are also out of phase.|$|E

40|$|Toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile are {{responsible}} for pseudomembranous colitis, a disease that afflicts {{a substantial number of}} hospitalized patients treated with antibiotics. A major effect of these proteins is the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, I. Just, G. Fritz, K. Aktories, M. Giry, M. R. Popoff, P. Boquet, S. Hegenbarth, and C. von Eichel-Streiber (J.

Chem. 269 : 10706 - 10712, 1994) implicated <b>Rho</b> <b>proteins</b> as cellular targets of C. difficile toxin B, since pretreatment of cells or purified Rho with toxin prevented subsequent ADP-ribosylation of Rho by exoenzyme C 3.

50|$|Alan Hall {{showed the}} {{specificity}} of Rho in the stimulation of focal adhesions and stress fibers formation in fibroblasts {{in the presence of}} extracellular factors in 1992. He first realized that the addition of bovine fetal calf serum (FCS) to Swiss 3T3 cells increased the polymerization of actin and assembly of stress fibers. The immunofluorescence following the increase of vinculin and talin, two cytoskeletal proteins, at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane with Val14rhoA microinjection showed the association of focal adhesions {{with the end of the}} new stress fibers. After size fractionation of FCS and analysis of the lipids that bound to serum albumin, the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was found to be responsible for the serum activity that induced stress fiber formation. The inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase ribosylation resulted in an inhibition of focal adhesion and stress fiber assembly, but had no effect on membrane ruffling. These findings were published in Cell and cited over 4000 times. In parallel with this experiment, Hall showed that the presence of Rac, another Ras-related GTP-binding protein, is implicated in the regulation of the actin organization in presence of extracellular growth factors. Immunofluorescence and antibody techniques were used in order to localize the mutant V12rac1 protein after being microinjected into the cytoplasm of confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. The comparison with the normal cells showed that Rac1 stimulates actin filament production at the membrane, pinocytosis, and membrane ruffling. The inhibition of endogenous Rac function by mutants N17rac and V12rac1 prevented growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. In addition, the inactivation of <b>Rho</b> <b>protein</b> by ADP-ribosylation in Rac1 microinjection reduced the formation of actin stress fibers. Hall concluded that Rac and Rho are complementary for polymerized actin organization. Indeed, Rho-dependent response is stimulated by the action of growth factors on Rac protein.|$|E
50|$|At the {{cytokinesis}} furrow, {{it is the}} actin-myosin contractile {{ring that}} drives the cleavage process, during which cell membrane and wall grow inward, which eventually pinches the mother cell in two. The key components of this ring are the filamentous protein actin and the motor protein myosin II. The contractile ring assembles equatorially (in {{the middle of the}} cell) at the cell cortex (adjacent to the cell membrane). <b>Rho</b> <b>protein</b> family (RhoA protein in mammalian cells) is a key regulator of contractile ring formation and contraction in animal cells. The RhoA pathway promotes assembly of the actin-myosin ring by two main effectors. First, RhoA stimulates nucleation of unbranched actin filaments by activation of Diaphanous-related formins. This local generation of new actin filaments is important for the contractile ring formation. This actin filament formation process also requires a protein called profilin, which binds to actin monomers and helps load them onto the filament end. Second, RhoA promotes myosin II activation by the kinase ROCK, which activates myosin II directly by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and also inhibits myosin phosphatase by phosphorylation of the phosphatase-targeting subunit MYPT. Besides actin and myosin II, the contractile ring contains the scaffolding protein anillin. Anillin binds to actin, myosin, RhoA and CYK-4, and thereby links the equatorial cortex with the signals from the central spindle. It also contributes to the linkage of the actin-myosin ring to the plasma membrane. Another protein, septin, has also been speculated to serve as a structural scaffold on which the cytokinesis apparatus is organized. Following its assembly, contraction of the actin-myosin ring leads to ingression of the attached plasma membrane, which partitions the cytoplasm into two domains of emerging sister cells. The force for the contractile processes is generated by movements along actin by the motor protein myosin II. Myosin II uses the free energy released when ATP is hydrolysed to move along these actin filaments, constricting the cell membrane to form a cleavage furrow. Continued hydrolysis causes this cleavage furrow to ingress (move inwards), a striking process that is clearly visible through a light microscope.|$|E
40|$|Rho-dependent terminators {{constitute}} one of {{two major}} classes of terminators in Escherichia coli. Termination at these sites requires the concerted action of RNA polymerase and <b>rho</b> <b>protein.</b> We present evidence that the efficiency of termination at these sites is governed by kinetic coupling of the rate of transcription of RNA polymerase {{and the rate of}} action of <b>rho</b> <b>protein.</b> Termination experiments in vitro indicate that termination efficiency at a rho-dependent terminator is an inverse function of the rate of elongation of RNA polymerase, and each of the mutant phenotypes can be accounted for by the altered rate of elongation of the mutant RNA polymerase. Experiments in vivo show that fast-moving mutant RNA polymerases are termination deficient, while slow-moving mutant RNA polymerases are termination proficient and can suppress the termination deficiency of a slow-acting mutant <b>rho</b> <b>protein.</b> Because of the close coupling of rho action with RNA polymerase, small changes in the elongation rate of RNA polymerase can have very large effects on termination efficiency, providing the cell with a powerful way to modulate termination at rho-dependent terminators...|$|E
40|$|IQ motif-containing GTPase {{activating}} protein 1 (IQGAP 1) plays {{a central}} role in the physical assembly of relevant signaling networks that are responsible for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, polarity and transmigration. The <b>RHO</b> family <b>proteins</b> CDC 42 and RAC 1, have been shown to mainly interact with the GAPrelated domain (GRD) of IQGAP 1. However, the role of its RASGAP C-terminal (RGCT) and C-terminal (CT) domains in the interactions with <b>RHO</b> <b>proteins</b> has remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that IQGAP 1 interactions with <b>RHO</b> <b>proteins</b> underly a multiple-step binding mechanism: (i) a high-affinity, GTPdependent binding of RGCT to the switch regions of CDC 42 or RAC 1, and (ii) a very low-affinity binding of GRD and CT adjacent to the switch regions. These data were confirmed by phosphomimetic mutation of serine 1443 to glutamate within RGCT, which led to a significant reduction of IQGAP 1 affinity for CDC 42 and RAC 1, clearly disclosing the critical role of RGCT for these interactions. Unlike CDC 42, an extremely low affinity was determined for the RAC 1 -GRD interaction, suggesting that the molecular nature of IQGAP 1 interaction with CDC 42 partially differs from that of RAC 1. Our study provides new insights into the interaction characteristics of IQGAP 1 with <b>RHO</b> family <b>proteins</b> and highlights the complementary importance of kinetic and equilibrium analyses. We propose that the ability of IQGAP 1 to interact with <b>RHO</b> <b>proteins</b> is based on a multiple-step binding process, which is a prerequisite for the dynamic functions of IQGAP 1 as a scaffolding protein and a critical mechanism in temporal regulation and integration of IQGAP 1 -mediated cellular responses...|$|R

Furthermore, leukotriene-dependent stress fiber formation requires <b>Rho</b> <b>proteins.</b> We have therefore identified elements of a pathway from growth factor receptors that includes Rac, arachidonic acid production, arachidonic acid metabolism to leukotrienes, and leukotriene-dependent Rho activation.
