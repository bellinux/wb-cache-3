25|$|During {{the last}} century several changes have taken place {{with respect to the}} most planted varieties. Until the early 20th century, Elbling was Germany's most planted variety, after which it was eclipsed by Silvaner {{during the middle of the}} 20th century. After a few decades in the top spot, in the late 1960s Silvaner was {{overtaken}} by the high-yielding Müller-Thurgau, which in turn started to lose ground in the 1980s. From the mid-1990s, Riesling became the most planted variety, a position it probably had never enjoyed before on a national level. Red grapes in Germany have experienced several ups and downs. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there was a downward trend, which was reversed around 1980. From mid-1990s and during the next decade, there was an almost explosive growth of plantation of <b>red</b> <b>varieties.</b> Plantings was shared between traditional Spätburgunder and a number of new crossings, led by Dornfelder, while other traditional German <b>red</b> <b>varieties</b> such as Portugieser only held their ground. From around 2005, the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>varieties</b> has stabilized around 37%, about three times the 1980 level.|$|E

2500|$|Today {{there are}} over 80 grape {{varieties}} grown in Washington state, but the primary grapes used {{in the production of}} wine are from the Vitis vinifera family of grapes. The main grapes used in wine production in Washington are Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling, Chardonnay, Merlot, and Syrah. There are also plantings of Cabernet Franc, Grenache, Malbec, Pinot gris, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon, Tempranillo, Viognier, Barbera, Chenin blanc, Gewürztraminer, Nebbiolo, Petite Sirah, Pinot noir, Sangiovese, and Zinfandel.

2500|$|Early in {{the modern}} wine {{industry}} (late 1970s early 1980s), the comparatively low annual sunshine hours {{to be found in}} NZ discouraged the planting of <b>red</b> <b>varieties.</b> But even at this time great hopes were had for Pinot noir (see Romeo Bragato). Initial results were not promising for several reasons, including the mistaken planting of Gamay and the limited number of Pinot noir clones available for planting. [...] One notable exception was the St Helena 1984 Pinot noir from the Canterbury region. This led to the belief for a time that Canterbury might become the natural home for Pinot noir in New Zealand. While the early excitement passed, the Canterbury region has witnessed the development of Pinot noir as the dominant red variety. The sub-region Waipara has some interesting wines. Producers include Waipara Hills, Pegasus Bay, Waipara Springs, Muddy Water, Greystone, Omihi Hills and Black Estate.|$|E

2500|$|Controguerra DOC - Created in 1996 {{and located}} in the hills and valleys around the commune of Controguerra (whose name means [...] "anti-war" [...] in the local dialect) in the Teramo province. Until its creation, the Trebbiano d'Abruzzo DOC was the only {{permitted}} white wine DOC in Abruzzo. [...] Reds are made predominately from the Montepulciano grape (minimum 60% of the wine) with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet franc permitted to make up to 15% and other local <b>red</b> <b>varieties</b> the remaining 25%. Whites are a blend of Trebbiano Toscano (60-70%) and Passerina (15%) with other local white varieties permitted up to 25%. A sparkling spumante style is produced from Trebbiano Toscano (60%) and at least 30% combine of Chardonnay, Verdicchio and Pecorino with other local white varieties permitted up to 10%. Passito and vino novello styles of wine can also be produced in this DOC as well as varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Merlot, Chardonnay, Ciliegiolo and Pinot nero.|$|E
2500|$|Like many Washington wineries and vineyards, the 1991 60 Minutes {{special on}} the [...] "French paradox" [...] saw {{a surge of}} {{interest}} for Red Willow—particularly for red wine varieties such as Merlot. Columbia Winery introduced a special [...] "Milestone Merlot" [...] bottling of vineyard designated wine from Red Willow that would become a staple of Columbia's lineup until David Lake's retirement. Eventually the [...] "Merlot boom" [...] would die down and many <b>red</b> <b>varieties</b> were hard hit in the 1996 vintage {{by a series of}} arctic blasts that severely reduced the yields of that year. The one exception were the Syrah vines planted at Red Willow and younger Syrah vines planted from Red Willow cuttings on Red Mountain and many other vineyards in the Columbia Valley AVA. These demonstration of the winter hardiness of Syrah, as well as the critical acclaim for Syrahs made from Red Willow and other vineyard, would usher in a period of heighten interest for the variety.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the broad}} {{expanse of the}} Malvasia family, generalizations about the Malvasia wine are {{difficult}} to pin point. Most varieties of Malvasia are derived from Malvasia bianca which is characterized by its deep color, noted aromas {{and the presence of}} some residual sugar. The <b>red</b> <b>varieties</b> of Malvasia tend to make wines with pale, pinkish to light red color. In their youth, Malvasia wines are characterized by their heavy body that is often described as [...] "round" [...] or [...] "fat" [...] and soft texture in the mouth. Common aroma notes associated with Malvasia include peaches, apricots and white currants. Red Malvasia wines are characterized by a richness and chocolate notes. Fortified Malvasia, such as Madeira, are noted for their intense smokey notes and sharp acidity. As Malvasia ages, the wines tend to take on more nutty aromas and flavors though many Malvasia have a short life span of only a few years after vintage.|$|E

2500|$|By the 18th century, Chianti {{was widely}} {{recognised}} as a red wine, but the exact composition and grape varieties {{used to make}} Chianti {{at this point is}} unknown. Ampelographers find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of Italian writer Cosimo Villifranchi who noted that Canaiolo was widely planted variety in the area along with Sangiovese, Mammolo and Marzemino. It was not until the work of the Italian statesman Bettino Ricasoli that the modern [...] "Chianti recipe" [...] as a Sangiovese-based wine would take shape. Prior to Ricasoli, Canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the Chianti blend with Sangiovese and Malvasia playing supporting roles. In the mid-19th century, Ricasoli developed a recipe for Chianti that was based primarily on Sangiovese. His recipe called for 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo, 10% Malvasia (later amended to include Trebbiano) and 5% other local <b>red</b> <b>varieties.</b> In 1967, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulation set by the Italian government firmly established the [...] "Ricasoli formula" [...] of a Sangiovese-based blend with 10–30% Malvasia and Trebbiano.|$|E

60|$|As {{the plants}} {{of the two}} lots are few in number, they may be run {{together}} for the general average; but I may first state that {{the height of the}} seedlings from the cross between two individuals of the <b>red</b> <b>variety</b> is to that of the self-fertilised plants of the <b>red</b> <b>variety</b> as 100 to 73; whereas the height of the crossed offspring from the two varieties to the self-fertilised plants of the <b>red</b> <b>variety</b> is as 100 to 66.
