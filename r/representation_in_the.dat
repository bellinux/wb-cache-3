Particular attention {{is devoted to}} the unramified unitary <b>representations</b> ([MuT]). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> unramified case, we study relation between the property of being automor-phic (and isolated there), and intrinsic properties of <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of split classical groups we give combinatorial formulas for the number of isolated <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unramified unitary duals (these representations are also isolated <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> automorphic duals), and for the number of so called strongly negative representations, which can be expected to be sets of isolated <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unramified automorphic duals. For the difference of special linear groups, we have plenty of both of these representations. We also discuss the case of automorphic duals of general linear groups...|$|R

40|$|Both {{computer}} vision and human visual system target the same goal: to accomplish visual tasks easily via {{a set of}} <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> this thesis, we study to what extent representations from {{computer vision}} models align to human visual representations. To study this research question we used an interdisciplinary approach, integrating methods from psychology, neuroscience and computer vision. Such an approach is aimed to provide new insight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> understanding of human visual <b>representations.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> four chapters of the thesis, we tested computer vision models against brain data obtained with electro-encephalography (EEG) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). The main findings can be summarized as follows; 1) computer vision models with one or two computational stages correlate to visual representations of intermediate complexity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human brain, 2) models with multiple computational stages correlate best to <b>the</b> hierarchy of <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human visual system, 3) computer vision models do not align one-to-one to the temporal hierarchy of <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visual cortex and 4) not only visual but also semantic representations correlate to <b>representations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human visual system...|$|R

Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House since 1906.

5|$|Hong Kong {{soon became}} a major entrepôt thanks to its free port status, {{attracting}} new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe. The society, however, remained racially segregated and polarised under early British colonial policies. Despite {{the rise of a}} British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas such as Victoria Peak. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no political <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population.|$|E
