Position-velocity diagrams of the HI distribution reveal an unusual `hole' feature which, when previously observed in CO, has been interpreted as an expanding superbubble contained within a ring of gas in solid body rotation.

50|$|The Australian {{academic}} Thomas Alured Faunce {{has argued}} that by expressly applying Annex 2C on pharmaceuticals, the NVNB claim in article 21.2(c) of the AUSFTA may {{have been responsible for}} lobbying by United States negotiators around the constructive ambiguity of reward of innovation (through the Medicines Working Group established by article 2C of the AUSFTA) that influenced Australian legislative changes impacting on reference pricing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He maintains that such pressure from NVNB claims is most likely to arise from 'behind doors' lobbying using threats of cross-retaliation (threatening a trade dispute in one trade area to obtain a result in a different sector) if a planned or existing domestic policy is perceived to breach the 'spirit' of the relevant bilateral trade agreement. Formal dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>proceedings</b> may never be initiated or be intended to commence if such lobbying is persuasive. If this hypothesis is correct, it represents a disturbing example of regulatory capture and has worrying implications for democratic sovereignty.

To each constraint is associated a valuation representing the "cost to pay" when this constraint will be violated by a solution. Our method (VNS/LDS+CP) uses principles of VNS (Variable Neighborhood Search) and combines a partial tree search (Limited Discrepancy Search) with Constraint Propagation in order to compute local optima. Experiments on the CELAR benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements on other competing methods: LNS/CP/GR [Lobjois, L., Lemaitre, M., Verfaillie, G., 2000.

40|$|The WTO law of {{remedies}} for violation appears incoherent. States {{that fail to}} comply with their obligations are subject to WTO-authorized retaliation. First, this retaliation takes the inefficient form of blocked trade by the complaining state. This remedy {{is unlikely to be}} useful to developing countries. Second, the amount of trade blocked by the violation is often used as the measure of authorized retaliation. This measure is not necessarily incentive compatible, as it is not necessarily linked to welfare. Thus, its use may result in inefficient breach, or inefficient compliance, with WTO law. Third, only states that engage in dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>proceedings</b> are authorized to retaliate, artificially reducing the possible incentives to comply. Fourth, authorization to retaliate is granted only prospectively, and there are generally no formal {{remedies for}} damages accruing before adjudication and the passage of permitted time for compliance.

40|$|Athletes in a {{professional}} sports league in the United States are members of players unions, which assist their athletes in obtaining representation when {{they are involved in}} dispute <b>resolution</b> <b>proceedings</b> associated with disciplinary actions. However, individual athletes who participate in international competitions do not enjoy the same benefits. When these athletes are required to submit to mandatory drug testing, with attendant potential criminal liability, and to mandatory arbitration, they should be provided meaningful access to competent legal representation when their athletic careers are in jeopardy. This article considers the legal framework, process, and recourse for athletes in international competition to address sporting eligibility and disciplinary actions. Particular attention is paid to the perspective of the accused athlete facing ineligiblity sanction from sporting competition. The article describes the rules and governing bodies in Olympic and international sporting competition pursuant to the Olympic Charter, which provides the regulatory framework for international sports, mandating subjection of the athletes’ eligibility and disciplinary cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland, and charging the World Anti-Doping Program (WADP) with administering mandatory drug testing of athletes. The article also examines the interplay between the doping arbitration rules and an athlete’s right to a fair hearing, identifying the signficant procedural barriers in the designated arbitral process. In addition, it considers options for providing athletes with improved access to justice through procedural changes and access to legal advice and representation, including expert scientific evaluation, as well as other forms of legal assistance and insurance programs when contesting liability and jeopardy...|$|E

40|$|Spoken {{conversation}} between two present interlocutors {{is the foundation}} of natural language interaction and the source for child language acquisition (Fillmore, 1981; McCune, 2008). This research aims to model this natural system using the words-as-classifiers (WAC) model of grounded lexical semantics (Kennington and Schlangen, 2015), to test if a replicated environment can produce similar acquisition results in a machine robot (Anki’s Cozmo). The main question is whether meaning can be acquired and represented using the semantic grounding provided through the WAC model. The results of this research will expand our understanding of lexical meaning and language interaction, which has implications in all areas of data science and natural language processing.
