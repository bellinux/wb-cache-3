5|$|From early November, chicks begin {{moulting}} into juvenile plumage, {{which takes}} {{up to two}} months and is often not completed {{by the time they}} leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December or January and spend the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> feeding there.|$|E
5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> Garbage performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, {{leading to the}} cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E
5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was working up for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After {{the threat of violence}} subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Malkot is a mountainous area, {{with lots}} of pine, plum, orange and apple trees. Like Abbottabad District as a whole it has ideal climate conditions.

5000|$|Yahoo! Music's Simon Ward {{reviewed}} the single positively, awarding it 7 stars out of 10, though he criticized the song for being [...] "an indie anthem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind Ash {{used to make}} ten years ago." [...] He praised the song's [...] "nagging 'do-doo harmonies and driving guitars" [...] though said that it wasn't [...] "going to rewrite rock history." [...] He still felt [...] "it's competent indie-pop that will doubtless signal skies full of water and bouncing moshpits at <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer's</b> festivals. Which is, frankly, all that's asked of it." ...|$|R
25|$|Some {{more good}} {{performances}} in <b>the</b> early part <b>of</b> 2003 brought Clarke his England debut, for the One Day International against Pakistan at Old Trafford. Although {{he took a}} wicket with his first ball in ODIs (the first Englishman to achieve this feat for three decades) he had a poor match overall, being bowled behind his legs for a duck after playing a totally misjudged sweep and conceding 41 runs from his 7.2 overs. He was retained for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer's</b> ODIs despite a total of just three wickets and a high score of only 37.|$|R
5|$|In June 2008, Johnson {{was offered}} a two-year {{contract}} by fellow League Two side Chester City, but two weeks later, he turned down the deal. Instead he returned to Crewe Alexandra on trial after {{he and his mother}} went to see coach Dario Gradi, and scored twice in a 4–1 pre-season friendly victory over Quorn on 16 July 2008. Despite spending the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> with Crewe, the club decided not to offer Johnson a full-time contract, because coach Steve Holland felt he was not better than the club's other forwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{spent the}} following {{winter and spring}} near Charleston, Virginia (present-day West Virginia), out of contact with the enemy. Hayes saw little action until July 1863, when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan's cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island. Returning to Charleston for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer,</b> Hayes spent the fall encouraging {{the men of the}} 23rd Ohio to re-enlist, and many did so. In 1864, the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized, and Hayes's division was assigned to George Crook's Army of West Virginia. Advancing into southwestern Virginia, they destroyed Confederate salt and lead mines there. On May 9, they engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd's Mountain, where Hayes and his men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field. Following the rout, the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and again successfully skirmished with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E

25|$|His first {{appearance}} for England was in June 1992, against Pakistan at Lord's, {{and he did}} not rise to the occasion well enough, though in the third Test he made an important half-century in the first-innings.

25|$|In mid-summer Paige {{returned}} to Birmingham, where he pitched well the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer,</b> going 7–4.

Paige won one and lost one in the series and then {{returned to}} Birmingham.|$|E
50|$|On 29 April 1916, {{following}} the Tigris Corps' failure {{to break the}} Turkish siege and <b>the</b> sinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steamer Julnar as it attempted to steam upriver past the Turkish defenders, the Kut garrison surrendered. The 13th Division spent <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring, <b>summer,</b> and early fall recovering from the fighting, and preparing for further operations to capture Baghdad.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>Summer</b> Palace, <b>the</b> Xiyang Lou was {{destroyed}} in a fire laid by the Anglo-French allied forces in 1860 during the Second Opium War {{in response to the}} imprisonment and torture of their peace delegation by the Chinese. However, since the masonry work was not consumed by the fire, significant ruins <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings can still be found on the site.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, he {{had made}} his Hampshire debut, against Oxford University in May 1988. He did not take a wicket in that match, and he spent <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English <b>summer</b> in Hampshire's second team. A more {{productive}} time followed back in Australia in 1988/89 as he took 23 first-class wickets, including seven in an innings victory in an MG Kailis-Kemplast Trophy game against Tamil Nadu at Perth.|$|R
25|$|Whilst {{there was}} some initial hope with the mobile phone {{messages}} (Ann Nicholl went to both locations to search for her daughter), police still maintained an active search for Nicholl which lasted for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 2005 and involved searching over 150 areas, septic tanks at farms and also utilised soldiers from Catterick Garrison to help out.|$|E

25|$|General Yudenich {{received}} {{the keys to}} the city and citadel after his arrival. He confirmed the Armenian provisional government. Aram Manukian was appointed the governor of Van province.

Upon the arrival of the Russians the Ottomans retreated west of Lake Van in the direction of Bitlis.|$|E
25|$|He {{played the}} first half of the 1975 season, but was then relegated to the Second XI for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> However, with Cass having been {{released}} by the county, Wilcock was a regular throughout the record-breaking hot summer of 1976. In 1977, he took until mid-season to establish himself in the team, and he managed very few dismissals, though he did score his only first-class half-century when he made 74 in Worcestershire's two-day innings victory over Yorkshire in August.|$|E
25|$|For the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer,</b> York {{held the}} king prisoner, either in Hertford castle or in London (to be enthroned in Parliament in July).

York resumed the office of Protector; although he surrendered it when the king recovered in February 1456, it seemed that this time Henry was willing to accept that York and his supporters would play a major part in the government of the realm.|$|E

25|$|His first {{experience}} with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center {{when he was in}} high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran.

On June 30, he beat Doink the Clown for the APWF Television Championship in Big Run, Pennsylvania, then gave the title to Jimmy Cicero. He also successfully defended NWA Virginia heavyweight title against Hot Property and Buddy Landel during the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The victory did {{not bring}} {{strategic}} advantages to Hannibal. Judging {{that in the long}} run he could not retain Herdonia, the Carthaginian general decided to resettle its population in Metapontum and Thurii to the south and destroy the city itself. Before that he set an example to other eventual traitors by executing some of the distinguished citizens who had conspired to betray Herdonia to Centumalus. For the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> he was forced to fight off the second Roman army.
