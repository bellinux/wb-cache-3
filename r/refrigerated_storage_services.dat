GouldEquipment {{to store}} foods at proper {{temperatures}} {{is critical to}} serving safe and nutritious meals in schools yet {{little is known about}} the amount or the adequacy of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> in school nutrition programs. The purposes of this study were to identify the types and capacity of refrigeration equipment used in schools, determine the perceived adequacy of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> capacity to meet new meal pattern requirements, and examine differences in adequacy and capacity. A modified Delphi technique, site observations, pilot study, and electronic survey were used for data collection. School nutrition directors in the USDA/FNS Southwest Region (N= 2392) served as the population. Respondents provided an inventory of refrigeration equipment for one of the schools in their district and information about perceived adequacy of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage,</b> barriers to purchasing refrigeration equipment, resources used to develop specifications, and practices to compensate for inadequate <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> in their program. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, regression, and ANOVA. Over a third of directors indicated that refrigerated equipment was inadequate to meet new meal pattern requirements. Directors with more experience rated adequacy higher than directors with less experience. Milk coolers (n= 212, 88. 3 %) and walk-in freezers (n= 180, 75. 0 %) were the types of refrigeration equipment found most often in schools. Walk-in freezers and refrigerators provided over 95 % of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> space. The mean average cubic feet of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> per school was 1423 ± 1152. School enrollment is a significant predictor of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> is a concern for school nutrition directors who reported practices to compensate for inadequate storage including maintaining low inventory and decreasing the number of items purchased. School nutrition professionals may use the results of this study to implement practices to compensate for inadequate <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage.</b> Results cannot be generalized due to the regional nature of the survey and low response rate and possible non-response bias...|$|R
40|$|Recent trends towards {{extending}} the shelf-life of fresh eel during <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> have rendered {{the control of}} lipid oxidation increasingly important. Eel fat is very sensitive to oxidative deterioration because of its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. To delay or minimise oxidative deterioration of fresheel fat during <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage,</b> the use of vacuum packaging was investigated.

40|$|Preservation {{conditions}} may affect internal organs thus influencing {{the results of}} protracted biomechanical tests. The influence of the freeze–thaw cycle on the mechanical behaviour of porcine abdominal organs was reported in our previous work. Here we further investigate the effects of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> on the mechanical properties of porcine spleen and liver. Twenty-seven swine were chosen for tensile testing. To simulate the conservation conditions before biomechanical experimentation, the total sample was divided into three groups of nine individuals each and tested in a fresh state, after a freeze–thaw cycle, and after <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> (+ 4 °C). Fitted stress–stretch curves for each tissue type were obtained by employing a modified Fung model for isotropic behaviour. The results suggest statistically significant effects of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> on the spleen but negligible influence on the liver. Similarly {{to the impact of}} the freeze–thaw cycle, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> caused a decrease in the mechanical properties of the spleen. This again supports the hypothesized cause of the altered behaviour of spleen due to the autolysis of elastin by elastolytic enzymes during and after the cooling period.

After 120 days storage, mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contents were decreased by 24. 89 % and 33. 70 %, respectively. While, saturated fatty acids (SFA) content was found to be increased by 26. 82 %, against the actual value. The change in polyunsaturated fatty acids during <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> was measured by the PI value. The PI decreased during storage due to lipid oxidation, but remained nearly constant after 90 th day of storage.

However, during the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> of yoghurt {{it is extremely difficult}} to count this microorganism due {{to the size of the}} colonies, which are so small they require the aid of a stereoscope to count them. Another agar, MRS-LP, has been also recommended for counts of Bifidobacterium in the presence of yoghurt bacteria. This study evaluated the supplementation of RCPB pH 5 agar with dehydrated liver extract and the salts KH 2 PO 4, K 2 HPO 4, FeSO 47 H 2 O, MnSO 4 H 2 O and MgSO 47 H 2 O, aiming at improving the differentiation of Bifidobacterium in yoghurt after <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage,</b> and also evaluated the selective count of Bifidobacterium in yoghurt using the agar MRS-LP.

The progressive and significant increase of crude protein content upon storage up to 10  days {{might be due to}} significant decrease in moisture content in the sausages during storage and this decreased moisture content reflected in yielding higher percent crude protein content. Dewi and Ismail (2010) in duck sausages and Vanitha et al.

The decrease in percent crude protein content during the later stage of storage might be due to protein decomposition in the stored product. This correlates with the concurrent increase pH and decreased water holding capacity of duck meat sausages in refrigeration up to 14  days.
