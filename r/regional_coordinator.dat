40|$|Background: A {{new project}} on {{education}} in family medicine training was implemented {{last year in}} Slovenia by establishing <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> in the specialist training programme. They are responsible for conducting regular small-group meetings with family medicine trainees. This study wanted to explore the attitudes and opinions of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine trainees concerning this new method. Methods: This was a qualitative study based on focus groups. The participants were <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine specialist trainees. The data were analysed based {{on the principles of}} thematic content analysis with inductive technique. Results: The study revealed five themes which were the same for the analysis of transcripts of both <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine trainees: 1) Meetings with trainees 2) Coordination 3) Characteristics of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> 4) Position of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators,</b> and 5) Evaluation of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators.</b> Conclusion: Participants of the study have many expectations for this new programme. They expect progress in trainees 2 ̆ 7 clinical knowledge through experience-based group learning {{and with the help of}} the tutorship role of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators.</b> The role of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> represents a new possibility for solving problems in the training programme in their coordinating role. In future, they have the potential to develop into an expert body that supervises the quality of training. A close follow-up is necessary to see if the position of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> is adequate and if they meet the expectations of the trainees as well as their own goals. Administrative and financial support for the programme is necessary. The project is important also in enabling the adaptation of the training programme 2 ̆ 7 s needs and the regional characteristics of medical care...|$|R

500|$|In 1961, a {{group of}} twenty-two conservatives {{including}} Congressman John M. Ashbrook of Ohio, lawyer William A. Rusher and scholar F. Clifton White met privately in Chicago to discuss {{the formation of a}} grassroots organization to secure the nomination of a conservative at the 1964 Republican National Convention. They budgeted $65,000 for the first year of activities and split the U.S. into nine geographic regions, appointing a director for each to build an organization and influence the local Republican Party. The main headquarters for the organization were established at Suite 3505 of the Chanin Building in New York City, leading members to refer to themselves as the [...] "Suite 3505 Committee". They decided to wait until after the 1962 mid-term elections to choose a favored candidate. Following the election, they formally backed Goldwater, who upon hearing the news after a leak in January 1963, notified the group that he did not wish to begin a campaign. As a result, three months later, they established the [...] "Draft Goldwater Committee" [...] headed by Texas Republican Party Chairman Peter O'Donnell of Dallas. The committee helped to win over state delegations [...] by filling caucuses with supporters in the American West and negotiating with party leaders in the Midwest. The group also laid the foundation for the Southern strategy by essentially creating the Republican parties of the Deep South and overthrowing the Democratic patronage system. John Grenier, the former Alabama Republican Party chairman and the committee's southern <b>regional</b> <b>coordinator,</b> was responsible for the Republican organization in the South.|$|E

He explained his motivation for volunteering: [...] "Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too." [...] Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilisation, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities.

2500|$|As Condell's {{first term}} ended, {{he promised to}} push for [...] "substantial" [...] pay raises in the union's {{upcoming}} contract negotiations even as his opponents attacked him for concentrating authority in staff hands and for poor leadership. Nonetheless, he was challenged for the SCDU endorsement by Michael Keenan, president of PEF's largest division. Condell defeated Keenan, 388 to 275. Nonetheless, a new political party, the Committee for Independent Officers, arose and successfully contended for {{four of the six}} seats for state vice president, <b>regional</b> <b>coordinator,</b> and trustee (including among its winning candidates future PEF presidents Howard Shafer and Roger Benson). To firm up his political position, Condell called for a two- rather than three-year contract, with a 7 percent pay rise in each year. Even when CSEA settled for a three-year agreement with salary increases of 5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 5.5 percent in each of its three years, Condell continued to push for 7 percent. But health insurance, not pay, ended up being the biggest stumbling block. The state declared an impasse in mid June (10 weeks after PEF's contract had expired), and mediators were called in. Without the mediators' help, however, Condell reached a three-year agreement on July 11 with the same pay structure achieved by CSEA and no improvements in health benefits.|$|E
