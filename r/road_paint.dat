50|$|Paint Creek {{originates}} {{in a small}} marsh south of Ellsworth Road in Pittsfield Township. It runs parallel to Ellsworth Road going east, turns north and enters a culvert under Ellsworth Road, exiting the culvert into Montibeller Park. From Montibeller Park, it enters a culvert near the intersection of Cole Boulevard and Hillside Drive, and exits the culvert east of the intersection of Golfside Road and Packard Street, entering a golfcourse where its channel has been artificially widened into a pond. After exiting this pond the creek enters another culvert in {{the northeast corner of}} the golfcourse, flowing east along Packard Street, turning south along Hewitt Road, turns back East to flow roughly parallel to Valley Drive, before turning south to Congress Road east of Hewitt Road, where it exits the second culvert. Paint Creek continues roughly south parallel to Stevens Drive, then turning southeast to go under Michigan Avenue north east of Michigan Avenue's intersection with Ellsworth <b>Road.</b> <b>Paint</b> Creek continues southeast crossing under Interstate 94 after which it roughly follows Huron Street south, turning southeast under Stony Creek Road toward Whittaker Road, which it follows west of.

5000|$|Thermoplastic {{markings}} {{are applied}} using specially designed vehicles. Usually thermoplastic marking mode should apply with equipment called a road marking machine to coat traffic lines, and the <b>road</b> <b>paint</b> needs preheating by a device commonly called a preheater. The thermoplastic mix is heated in trucks to about [...] before being fed {{to the application}} apparatus. This is often a screed box or ribbon gun. Immediately after the thermoplastic has been applied, glass beads are laid onto the hot material so that they embed before the plastic hardens. These beads provide initial retroreflection. As the marking wears during use and the initial beads are lost, the beads mixed with the binder are uncovered, providing long term retroreflectivity. These can be made exceptionally thick to produce a rumble strip effect.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the period}} 2000-2010, the state {{underwent}} a massive road building programme {{which included the}} construction of a national motorway network. Many sections of this [...] "motorway network" [...] such as the N6 from Kinnegad to Kilbeggan were originally built to high quality dual carriageway standard. The Roads Act, 2007 enacted in July 2007 made a provision for the redesignation of dual carriageways to motorway. This meant the hard shoulder of the high quality dual carriageways chosen to be redesignated, had to be changed from a broken yellow line to a continuous yellow line. Green signage also had to be changed to blue. In some instances the cost of this retrofit ran to millions of euro as it involved the replacement of existing gantry and large panel signage as well as the application of hundreds of kilometres of thermoplastic <b>road</b> <b>paint.</b> In September 2008, the Cahir to Cashel stretch of the M8 had its gantry signage changed and hard shoulder re-painted.

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{reports on}} a fast multiresolution scan matcher for vehicle {{localization}} in urban environments for self-driving cars. State-of-the-art approaches to vehicle localiza-tion rely on observing road surface reflectivity with a three-dimensional (3 D) {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) scanner to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. However, these approaches can often fail when faced with adverse weather conditions that obscure the view of the <b>road</b> <b>paint</b> (e. g., puddles and snowdrifts) or poor road surface texture. We propose a new scan matching algorithm that leverages Gaussian mixture maps to exploit the structure in the environment; these maps are a collection of Gaussian mixtures over the z-height distribution. We achieve real-time performance by developing a novel branch-and-bound, multiresolution approach that makes use of rasterized lookup tables of these Gaussian mixtures. Results are shown on two datasets that are 3. 0 km: a standard trajectory and another under adverse weather conditions. I...|$|E
40|$|This chapter explores colour as a {{differentiating}} medium between products, places or processes. Architectural {{and product}} {{design in the}} Twentieth and early Twenty-first Centuries {{has been marked by}} clear periods where colour has had variable roles within the designers toolkit. We suggest that both cultural understanding and physiological determinants motivate the use of particular coloured or tonal schemata. The context for our exploration of colour knowledge and attitudes to signification in the fields of architecture and urbanism is recent work looking specifically at urban design and place-making. To develop the discussion on colour in urban space, we focus on the work of Maccreanor Lavington Architects (Rotterdam), who use <b>road</b> <b>paint</b> as a transformative medium, and Dashing Tweeds, who sample urban colour as the development palette for traditional tweed fabrics. We ask at what level might conscious engagement with colour knowledge and theory be present in contemporary design, in virtual environments, and in design education, and what barriers might there be to using colour to add to the legibility and live-ability of urban environments...|$|E
40|$|In 2012 {{architectural}} design and research collective Rotor {{was invited to}} make the inaugural exhibition for a new open air cultural event space in a former part of Ghentâ€™s sea harbour that is being redeveloped.

Their most striking intervention was to paint over the entire surface of the obsolete harbour infrastructure with white <b>road</b> <b>paint.</b> Rotor in turn produced a site-specific architectural exhibition by intervening during the painting works: they covered specific zones of interest to keep them from being overpainted. These zones were then exhibited as fragments inside the newly whitened spaces. The exhibition produced at once a powerful aesthetic valorisation and a careful archaeological analysis of an unassuming piece of infrastructure, as well as a conceptual critique of the architectural reconversion upon which Rotorâ€™s exhibition nevertheless depended in many ways.

40|$|Fig. 1 Our {{system uses}} many {{asynchronous}} heterogeneous sensor streams to detect <b>road</b> <b>paint</b> and road edges (yellow) and estimate the centerlines of multiple travel lanes (cyan). Received: date / Accepted: date Abstract This paper describes {{a system for}} detecting and estimating the properties of multiple travel lanes in an urban road network from calibrated video imagery and laser range data acquired by a moving vehicle. The system operates in real-time in several stages on multiple processors, fusing detected road markings, obstacles, and curbs into a stable non-parametric estimate of nearby travel lanes. The system incorporates elements of a provided piecewise-linear road network as a weak prior. Our method is notable in several respects: it detects and estimates multiple travel lanes; it fuses asynchronous, heterogeneous sensor streams; it handles high-curvature roads; and it makes no assumption about the position or orientation of the vehicle {{with respect to the}} road. We analyze the systemâ€™s performance {{in the context of the}} 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. With five cameras and thirteen lidars, our method was incorporated into a closedloop controller to successfully guide an autonomous vehicle through a 90 km urban course at speeds up to 40 km/h amidst moving traffic.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve our {{understanding}} of what controls the isotope composition of Cu, Zn and Pb in particulate matter (PM) in the urban environment and to develop these isotope systems as possible source tracers. To this end, isotope ratios (Cu, Zn and Pb) and trace element concentrations (Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Sb, Ba, Pb, Cr, Ni and V) were determined in PM 10 collected at two road sites with contrasting traffic densities in central London, UK, during two weeks in summer 2010, and in potential sources, including non-combustion traffic emissions (tires and brakes), road furniture (<b>road</b> <b>paint,</b> manhole cover and road tarmac surface) and road dust. Iron, Ba and Sb were used as proxies for emissions derived from brake pads, and Ni, and V for emissions derived from fossil fuel oil. The isotopic composition of Pb (expressed using 206 Pb/ 207 Pb) ranged between 1. 1137 and 1. 1364. The isotope ratios of Cu and Zn expressed as Î´ 65 CuNIST 976 and Î´ 66 ZnLyon ranged between âˆ’ 0. 01 â€° and + 0. 51 â€° and between âˆ’ 0. 21 â€° and + 0. 33 â€°, respectively. We did not find significant differences in the isotope signatures in PM 10 over the two weeks sampling period and between the two sites, suggesting similar sources for each metal at both sites despite their different traffic densities. The stable isotope composition of Pb suggests significant contribution from road dust resuspension and from recycled leaded gasoline. The Cu and Zn isotope signatures of tires, brakes and road dust overlap with those of PM 10. The correlation between the enrichments of Sb, Cu, Ba and Fe in PM 10 support the previously established hypothesis that Cu isotope ratios are controlled by non-exhaust traffic emission sources in urban environments (Ochoa Gonzalez et al., 2016). Analysis of the Zn isotope signatures in PM 10 and possible sources at the two sites suggests significant contribution from tire wear. However, temporary additional sources, likely high temperature industrial emissions, need to be invoked to explain the isotopically light Zn found in 3 out of 18 samples of PM 10...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous ground vehicles, or {{self-driving}} cars, {{require a}} high level of situational awareness in order to operate safely and eciently in real-world conditions. A system able to quickly and reliably estimate the location of the roadway and its lanes based upon local sensor data would be a valuable asset both to fully autonomous vehicles as well as driver assistance technologies. To be most useful, the system must accommodate a variety of roadways, a range of weather and lighting conditions, and highly dynamic scenes with other vehicles and moving objects. Lane estimation can be modeled as a curve estimation problem, where sensor data provides partial and noisy observations of curves. The number of curves to estimate may be initially unknown and many of the observations may be outliers and false detections (e. g., due to tree shadows or lens are). The challenge is to detect lanes when and where they exist, and to update the lane estimates as new observations are received. This thesis describes algorithms for feature detection and curve estimation, as well as a novel curve representation that permits fast and ecient estimation while rejecting outliers. Locally observed <b>road</b> <b>paint</b> and curb features are fused together in a lane estimation framework that detects and estimates all nearby travel lanes. (cont.) The system handles roads with complex geometries and makes no assumptions about the position and orientation of the vehicle with respect to the roadway.

40|$|In {{the context}} of urban diffuse {{pollution}} a suburban road acts as a potential source of toxic pollutants among which heavy metals are very common, are found at elevated concentrations and are generally persistent. With a lack of detailed understanding of metal emission patterns on suburban roads, a detailed study is therefore essential for gaining an improved understanding to plug the knowledge gap in terms of urban diffuse pollution management. The present understanding of pollutant build-up and wash-off processes on road surfaces elucidates that these processes are highly site specific and are hard to generalise in certain aspects. Therefore, this study aimed to characterise heavy metal emissions and associated pollution levels at several road sites on the Riccarton Campus road network using road sediment collected during dry and wet weather periods. The heavy metal concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, {{are believed to be}} greatly toxic and are highly abundant in road traffic environments, were determined by strong nitric acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry. The study revealed that the pollutant build-up and wash-off processes were site specific and so also were the derived local build-up and wash-off parameters, as expected. However, these derived parameters were very different from those used in common urban drainage models suggesting that the default values are (significantly) inappropriate for the studied road network. The quantification of heavy metals in road sediments displayed significantly higher concentrations than local background concentrations. Their concentrations between weather types were found in the order of runoff, snow and dry road sediment, and also varied between sampling sites according to site-specific attributes, such as road lay-out inured traffic movement pattern, road surface condition and presence of <b>road</b> <b>paint</b> rather than due to traffic volume alone. The concentrations of all metals except Pb were significantly higher in finer sediment sizes than in larger sediment sizes. Correlation analyses revealed a similar pattern showing a greater number of statistically significant associations between metals in finer sediment sizes. An assessment of heavy metal contamination indicated that road sediment may likely pose a moderate to considerable level of ecological risk, if transported to the nearby water environment in the study area. The assimilation of the knowledge gained in this study should help to improve current understanding of environmental pollution from suburban roads and to provide better guidance for selecting appropriate control measures under the framework of sustainable urban drainage systems...|$|E
