5000|$|Vortex ring {{state is}} a hazard induced by a {{combination}} of low airspeed, high power setting, and high descent rate. Rotor-tip vortices circulate from the high pressure air below the rotor disk to low pressure air above the disk, so that the helicopter settles into its own descending airflow. Adding more power increases the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> and aggravates the situation. It is sometimes confused with settling with power, but they are aerodynamically different.|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigations}} have been initiated with {{the object of}} studying the air circulation and relation between â€¢ the air movement and the drying of the timber in timber seasoning kilns. The work has been divided into five separate experiments, {{each of which is}} summarised separately as follows :- Experiment 1 - The Measurement of the Flow of Air Through 'Timber Stacks. - A method of measuring the air velocity through timber stacks by means of vane anemometer p has been established. Correction factors, which, for ar 49 ne size and type of anemometer depend on the thickness of the timber and of the separating strips, on the velocity, and on the position in which the anemometer is held, have been determined for a number of cases. These have been plotted against record- ed anemometer readings on a number of graphs. Experiment 2 - The Effect of the <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Circulation</b> on the rate of Drying. - A number of kiln runs has been made with narrow stacks of matched material using the same temperature and humidity in each run but different rates of air circulation. The object has been to determine the effect of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> on the rate of drying timber apart from the question of change of drying rate from one side of a wide stack to the other due to fall in temperature and increase in humidity of the air. The results indicate that with the same air conditions the rate of drying is independent of the rate of air flow provided that this rate is greater than some minimum value which is probably in most cases less -than 140 feet per minute. Experiment 3 - The Relation Between the Quantity of Air Circulate* and the La in Dr in From the Enterin to the Leaving Air Side of a Kiln Charge of Timber. - A number of tests has been carried out in an experimental kiln to determine the change in air conditions and the lag in the drying rate from the entering to the leaving air side of a stack of timber 5 feet wide. Different sized separating strips and different quantities of circulating air have been used. The theoretical relation between the quantity of air circulated, the amount of moisture evapdrated, and the change in air conditions has also been established; the results so calculated have been compared with those determined experimentally. Experiment 4 - The Relation Between Air Flow and Fall in Pressure Across a Timber Stack. - The flow of air through a rectangular duct consisting of boards and separating strips and similar to the openings through a timber stack has been investigated. Curves showing the relation between static pressure change and rate of flow have been prepared for different sized strips and for board surfaces of different degrees of roughness. Equations for the pressure loss during flow through the duct and for the entrance pressure loss have been determined. Experiment 5 - The Effect of Various Features of Kiln Design on the distribution of the Air over the Side of a Stack of Timber in a Commercial Kiln. - A series of tests has been carried out in commercial kilns of the cross shaft internal fan type to determine the effect of various distances between the kiln walls and the sides of the stack on the distribution of the circulating air {{over the side of the}} stack The results of the tests are shown diagrammatically. The conclusion:: is reached that the 16 inch wide space commonly adopted for the particular design of kiln tested is reasonably satisfactory although more comprehensive tests on an experimental kiln of commercial proportions appear desirable...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} functional sportswear such as F/W mountain climbing wear, which requires adaptability at different temperature and humidity from top {{to the foot of}} the mountain, thermodynamic analysis for the ventilation effect is necessary. The effective slit design is also important for running wear to remove body heat and sweat as the wearers are exposed to various environment conditions. As Shivers et al. (1977) showed that the slit location, openings and closures in the clothing have a significant effect on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> exchange and <b>circulation</b> through ventilation. Lim et al. (2009) also pointed out that the slit position has a significant influence on the microclimate temperature and humidity of the areas localized around the slits. This is due to emission of heat and moisture through the exchange <b>of</b> <b>air</b> at the areas closest to the slits. Assessment of the movement of heat and moisture between the human body and its environment has been carried out through wear tests. However, a lack of reproducibility and its time-consuming and expensive costs are problems and hamper the scientific analysis of the ventilation effects. The earlier studies mainly showed the effects <b>of</b> ventilation on <b>air</b> exchange rates by using trace gas technique. Crockford et al. (1972) developed a method to measure air exchange rates in the clothing microclimate using a trace gas technique. Birnbaun and Crockford (1978) used trace gas to measure the air exchange rate and proposed a ventilation index to describe the performance of protective clothing assemblies. Since then, other devices and theoretical models have been used to evaluate the effects of ventilation under various conditions. Havenith et al. (1990) derived the values of the permeability index from change due to posture, movement and wind using the trace gas diffusion method. Chu and Nakajima (1997) investigated the effects of environmental temperature and the position of the opening on the clothing on ventilation of a thermal manikin by the trace gas method. Satsumoto et al. (2000) examined the effect of bellows action on heat transfer in the clothing system by using a device that consisted of a simulated skin and a clothing material plate. Satsumoto and Havenith (2010) developed a device to evaluate the distribution of ventilation in diapers and investigated the effect of the design and material factors of diapers on heat and water vapor transfer through ventilation.|$|R

While lack <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter {{in contact with the}} skin, were the two main causes of these problems.|$|R

The data showed that the air velocity (between 0. 8 - 1. 2 mâ€¢s - 1) is significantly lower than the one that is optimal for timber drying of coniferous species (3 - 4 mâ€¢s- 1). This results in a reduction in the capacity of installations for drying, increased energy (thermal and electrical) consumption and thereby increase in the cost of drying.

40|$|The closed {{greenhouse}} is a {{new development}} in protected cultivation. As air is not ventilated to the outside environment, CO 2 -concentrations are higher than in conventional greenhouses, causing 15 Â¿ 20 % increased production. The question remained as to whether increased air flow rates in a closed greenhouse cause photosynthetic adaptation. This was evaluated in a tomato crop that was planted {{in the summer of}} 2005 in The Netherlands in regular greenhouse compartments, in which air tubes were placed low and high in the canopy. Photosynthesis light-response curves were established at these two heights at 400, 700 and 1000 ppm <b>of</b> <b>air</b> CO 2. Increased CO 2 concentration and a higher position in the canopy caused an increase of the maximum photosynthetic rate, confirming earlier knowledge. However, the pattern <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> did not change the photosynthesis light-response curve. This corresponded with the absence of differences in total dry matter production and cumulative fruit growth. The INTKAM tomato model adequately simulated growth and development. It is therefore concluded that the pattern <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> did not cause adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus, and that yield increases are attributable to the instantaneous effects of elevated CO 2 -concentrations...|$|R

Fundamentals of airflow impact on cave microclimate were developed by Wigley (1967) and Wigley & Brown (1971, 1976). Previous works were focused on (1) both direct and indirect airflow monitoring (e. g., de Freitas & Littlejohn, 1982; DueÃ±as et al., 1999; Pfl itsch & Piasecki, 2003; FernÃ¡ndez-CortÃ©s et al., 2009) and (2) impact <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> on (i) cave microclimate (Luetscher et al., 2008; Russell & MacLean, 2008), (ii) cave CO 2 (Kowalczk & Froelich, 2010), or (iii) speleothem growth (Boch et al., 2011).
