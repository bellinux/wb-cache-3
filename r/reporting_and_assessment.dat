5000|$|As Vice-Chairman of the Commission {{in charge}} of the {{administrative}} and financial management of the AU, I drew on my experience, experience that taught me an invaluable truth: inertia is not king. An administration that is supposed to be competitive must evolve and adhere to an ongoing quest of modernity. The quality of its performance depends on the level of its technicity. The calling into question of its manner of serving and the plan for its organisation is the key to success.But to establish its credibility and inspire trust in others, an administration must prove efficient in its work and adhere to equally important values. It must opt for a good governance regime. And good governance requires the establishment or implementation of standards both rigorous and transparent, and rules offering more fluidity and traceability in their means of application. And this dual preoccupation will haunt me during the fulfilment of my duties which I will willingly place {{under the aegis of the}} cult of <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>assessment.</b> Hence, I will ensure that the Heads of State and Government are aware that their taxpayers’ money served honestly and efficiently the cause for which they were dedicated. I will do what it takes for each outcome to be assessed based on its objective and that each action undertaken remains true to the aims of Agenda 2063. No diversion of resources will be tolerated and hereafter any hindrance to the principles of good governance will be prohibited.Thus, it would be with great enthusiasm and dignity that I modestly participate in the realisation of the Pan-African dream and a just cause for which a number of our valorous brothers and sisters have been known to give up their lives.To this end, please accept the assurances of my highest esteem, ...|$|E

Without sufficient knowledge of these, opportunities for prevention and intervention may be missed. To develop, implement and evaluate an online tool called SIGNAAL for <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>assessment</b> of new work-related health risks by occupational health physicians and experts in the Netherlands and Belgium. Development and implementation of SIGNAAL to allow both easy and sufficient detailed reporting by occupational health physicians and structured and transparent assessment by occupational health experts. A new work-related health risk {{is defined as a}} work-related disease due to specific exposure in a specific work setting not described in the literature before. The online <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>assessment</b> tool proved to be a feasible means of reporting possible new combinations of health problems and exposures in the work situation. Eleven of the 15 cases reported until October 2014 were fully assessed: one was an entirely new work-related disease, four were known but uncommon work-related diseases, five were known but new in the reported work situation and one was a well-known work-related disease. An online reporting system used in an occupational health setting can provide insight into new work-related health risks by creating a structured way to gather, report and assess new combinations of health problems and exposure in the workplac...|$|E

The curriculum and assessment framework of the Australian Curriculum: Science is evaluated and aspects of its structure are found to lack some cohesion and definition. These flaws have consequences for school curriculum leaders and teachers of science, in particular those teachers who are less experienced. A flexible model of curriculum interpretation together with assessment criteria and standards is proposed which should facilitate the planning of coherent science programs and allow teachers to make and validate assessment judgements. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—At a time {{of growing}} market {{turbulence}} and a strong shifts towards increasingly complex risk models and more stringent audit requirements, it is more critical than ever to maintain the highest quality of financial and credit information. IFC implemented an approach that helps increase data integrity and quality significantly. This approach is called “Screening”. Screening is based on linking information from different sources to identify potential inconsistencies in key financial and credit data. That, in turn, can help to ease the trials of portfolio supervision, and improve overall company global <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>assessment</b> systems. IFC experience showed that when used regularly, Screening led to improved information...|$|E

Therefore, traditional techniques for managing resource allocation, topology and systems need urgent revision.

Our building methodology involves the employment of new types of clustered systems based on large application groupings, each having a master cluster controller. Each controlling engine consists of self-healing intelligent entities that can compensate for a variety of software or hardware problems. We also present evaluation results of extensive experiments in a production environment, which demonstrate the advantages of our approach...|$|E
40|$|My {{position}} is that improving evaluation for visualization re-quires more than developing more sophisticated evaluation methods. It also requires improving the efficacy of evalu-ations, which involves issues such as how evaluations are applied, reported, and assessed. Considering the motiva-tions for evaluation in visualization offers a way to explore these issues, but it requires us to develop a vocabulary for discussion. This paper proposes some initial terminology for discussing the motivations of evaluation. Specifically, the scales of actionability and persuasiveness can {{provide a framework for}} understanding the motivations of evaluation, and how these relate to the interests of various stakeholders in visualizations. It can help keep issues such as audience, <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>assessment</b> in focus as evaluation expands to new methods...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{present an}} {{evidence-based}} framework {{to improve the}} quality of occupational therapy expert opinions on work capacity for litigation, compensation and insurance purposes.
