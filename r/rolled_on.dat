5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or <b>rolled</b> <b>on</b> logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E

The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of {{the outbreak}} touched down around 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was <b>rolled</b> <b>on</b> its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado blew out the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used.

The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is <b>rolled</b> <b>on</b> the surface rather than being wiped.

40|$|In 2012 and 2013, was {{studied the}} occurrence, biology and {{harmfulness}} of Byctiscus betulae (L.) (Rhynchitidae) on forest woody {{plants in the}} Brno region. Leaf <b>rolls</b> were found <b>on</b> 13 species (and 10 genera) of woody plants. Most frequently, they occurred on Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp. (namely on T. cordata), Salix caprea and Populus tremula. The beetles hibernate in ground pupal chambers and appear on woody plants {{in the last decade}} of April. After hibernation, females live on average seven (males five) weeks, and damage on average 40 (males 25) cm 2 of leaves. The females create leaf <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> annual shoots they have gnawed, exceptionally (in 2 %) on leaves with damaged petioles. In the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> F. sylvatica, they <b>roll</b> <b>on</b> average 5. 6 leaves whose total average area is 49. 5 cm 2 and lay on average 5. 1 eggs. In the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> Tilia spp., they <b>roll</b> <b>on</b> average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 63. 2 cm 2 and lay on average 4. 9 eggs. In the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> S. caprea, they <b>roll</b> <b>on</b> average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 38. 3 cm 2 and lay on average 3. 5 eggs. The maximum number of laid eggs (on average 8. 0) was observed in the leaf <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> Vitis vinifera. The average number of eggs in the leaf rolls was decreasing from May to July. The number of eggs was increasing with the increasing total leaf area rolled. The females lay on average 50 eggs. On P. tremula, S. caprea and Pyrus pyraster they create about 15 leaf <b>rolls,</b> <b>on</b> F. sylvatica and Tilia spp. about 10 leaf <b>rolls</b> and <b>on</b> V. vinifera ca. 8 leaf rolls. Embryogenesis lasts from 8 to 9 days. Larvae develop over 3 instars and damage ca. 300 mm 2 of leaves. Coming of age within 4 − 7 weeks, they leave the leaf rolls from mid-June to the beginning of September...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to these findings, some detractors {{have pointed out that}} the Davis–Bacon Act requirements were rendered moot by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). At the time that Davis–Bacon Act was passed, legal scholars were divided on the question about whether the federal government could regulate labor costs and conditions. The Davis–Bacon Act was seen as a legitimate way to control labor wages and conditions on federal projects since there was clear jurisdiction on those. However, as the Depression <b>rolled</b> <b>on,</b> especially after the West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ruling in 1937, the Roosevelt Administration succeeded in establishing a federal authority to dictate wages, including a federal, universal minimum wage. In the view of some reviewers, this superseded the need for a prevailing wage law specific to federal contracts.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of the gun and other technology. The introduction of firearms was important, but guns on African battlefields were often of indifferent quality, and traditional weapons and tactics sometimes compared favorably with them. Indeed, Africans {{were well aware of}} the deficiencies of trade muskets and often demanded better quality than that offered. Most guns imported from Europe had not been test fired by the manufacturer to check for imperfections in bore and breach, although this was essential in the era of hand-forged barrels. Proven guns had proof-marks, and counterfeits flourished in the Africa trade. Firearms were thus a mixed bag on the ground, and the success of consolidating native powers like the Merina in Madagascar or the Zulu were due more to changes in indigenous organization, leadership and tactics, than to firearms. As the decades <b>rolled</b> <b>on</b> however, improvements to firearms, and other technology such as disease control (the cinchona bark to suppress malaria for example), and steamships were to give Europeans a decisive military edge on the continent.|$|E

25|$|Terry Nation's {{original}} plan {{was for the}} Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks <b>rolled</b> <b>on</b> nylon castors, propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios, for The Dalek Invasion of Earth Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed {{on the streets of}} London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature tricycles with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base. The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and {{it was not possible to}} remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on static electricity drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the silicon}} ring tourniquet, or elastic ring tourniquet, was {{developed}} by Dr. Noam Gavriely, {{a professor of medicine}} and former emergency physician. The tourniquet consists of an elastic ring made of silicone, stockinet, and pull straps made from ribbon that are used to roll the device onto the limb. The silicone ring tourniquet exsanguinates the blood from the limb while the device is being <b>rolled</b> <b>on,</b> and then occludes the limb once the desired occlusion location is reached. Unlike the historical mechanical tourniquets, the device reduces the risk of nerve paralysis. The surgical tourniquet version of the device is completely sterile, and provides improved surgical accessibility due to its narrow profile that results in a larger surgical field. It {{has been found to be}} a safe alternative method for most orthopedic limb procedures, but it does not completely replace the use of contemporary tourniquet devices. More recently the silicone ring tourniquet has been used in the fields of emergency medicine and vascular procedures. Recently, Feldman et. al. reported 2 cases of pulmonary embolism after silicon ring tourniquet application in patients with traumatic injuries. The serious and potentially fatal complication was reported involving procedures performed on the lower limb when silicone ring tourniquet was used for exsanguination on the affected limb.|$|E
25|$|Joan Miró {{was one of}} {{the first}} and most {{successful}} stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Miró's example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally cotton duck. The paint could also be brushed on or <b>rolled</b> <b>on</b> or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of acrylic paint. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.|$|E
