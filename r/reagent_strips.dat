5000|$|False-positive {{reactions}} due to menstrual contamination may be seen. They {{also occur}} if strong oxidizing detergents {{are present in}} the specimen container. Vegetable peroxidase and bacterial enzymes, including an Escherichia coli peroxidase, may also cause false-positive reactions. Therefore, sediments containing bacteria should be checked closely for the presence of red blood cells. Traditionally, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been associated with false-negative reagent strip reactions for blood. Both Multitistix and Chemstrip have modified their <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> to reduce this interference to very high levels of ascorbic acid, and Chemstip overlays the reagent pad with an iodate-impregnated mesh that oxidizes the ascorbic acid prior to its reaching the reaction pad. False-negative reactions can result when urine with a high specific gravity contains crenated red blood cells that do not lyse when they come in contact with the reagent pad. Decreased reactivity may also be seen when formalin is used as a preservative or when the hypertension medication captopril or high concentration of nitrite are present. Red blood cells settle {{to the bottom of the}} specimen container, and failure to mix the specimen prior to testing causes a falsely decreased reading.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{characterize}} {{the numbers of}} <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> dispensed for self-monitoring of blood glucose to patients with Type 2 diabetes in Tayside, Scotland, in 1993, 1999 and 2009. Methods: A diabetes clinical information system in Tayside, record-linked to electronic dispensed prescribing records, was used to collate all dispensed prescribing records for three cross-sectional samples of patients with Type 2 diabetes in 1993 (n = 5728), 1999 (n = 8109) and at 1 January 2009 (n = 16450). The numbers of <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> dispensed during the relevant calendar year were calculated and patients stratified by treatment. We also explored whether age, sex or material and social deprivation were associated with whether a patient received strips. Results: Proportions of people who received self-monitoring <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> increased from 15. 5 % in 1993, to 24. 2 % in 1999 to 29. 8 % in 2009, as did numbers of strips dispensed. While the proportion of diet-treated patients who received <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> was still very low in 2009 (5. 6 %), the proportion among those treated with oral agents tripled from 9. 4 to 27. 4 % between 1993 and 2009. Over 90 % of patients treated with insulin received <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> and, among non-insulin-treated patients, this was more common among women, younger people and less deprived groups. Conclusions: The numbers of <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> dispensed for self-monitoring of blood glucose has increased and almost all insulin-treated patients receive strips. While few diet-treated patients receive strips, they are more extensively dispensed to those treated with oral agents. Given that self-monitoring of blood glucose is no longer routinely recommended in non-insulin treated patients, strategies to reduce unnecessary dispensing of <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> are needed...|$|E

MethodsA total of 1 124 urine samples were collected, screened for microhaematuria and proteinuria using <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> (Combi 9) and results were compared to filtration technique, the gold standard method. ResultsA significant correlation was observed between microhaematuria (rho= 0. 66, P< 0. 01), proteinuria (rho = 0. 71, P< 0. 01) and intensity of S. haematobium eggs. Proteinuria had sensitivity of 95. 7 % and specificity of 67. 2 %, while microhaematuria had sensitivity of 64. 8 % and specificity of 89. 6 %. The proportion of false positive diagnoses was higher in proteinuria (19. 2 %) than microhaematuria (6. 0 %).

40|$|The {{specific}} gravity of urine (SG) indicates {{the number and}} weight of solute particles in urine; its measurement is helpful in interpreting proteinuria detected by dipstick tests and in monitoring adequate hydration in patients with nephrolithiasis. Four methods for measuring SG or osmolality of urine are currently available (depression of the freezing-point, urometry, refractometry, cation exchange on a <b>reagent</b> <b>strip).</b> Using a recently developed <b>reagent</b> <b>strip,</b> we have measured SG in morning urines of 340 non-selected outpatients and compared the results with SG measurements by refractometry of the same urines. In 86. 2 % of all urines, a good positive correlation between SG measured by <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> and refractometry was noted (r = 0. 913, p = 0. 0001). In 13. 8 % of the urines, however, the SG measured by <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> deviated by more than +/- 5 from the value obtained by refractometry; in 90 % of these urines, glucosuria (<b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> values too low or too high), proteinuria (values too high), or bacteriuria/leukocyturia (values too low or too high) could be found.

A combined result of stool samples processed by Kato and formol-ether concentration methods was used as gold standard. The results showed that detection of CCA in urine using <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> test was slightly higher than the combined results of the stool techniques (65. 2 % vs 42. 4 %, p > 0. 05) in suggesting the prevalence of the disease. The sensitivity, specificity, {{positive and}} negative predictive values of the <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> test were 76. 9 %, 43. 4 %, 50 % and 71. 9 %, respectively. The result of egg counts using Kato method suggested that detection of urine CCA {{could be used to}} indicate the intensity of infection.

40|$|For {{the rapid}} and simple {{diagnosis}} of schistosomiasis, a <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> assay for detection of circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine was developed. The test {{was based on}} a previously developed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of two anti-CCA monoclonal antibodies. For the <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> assay, as the capture matrix, monoclonal antibody was coated onto a nitrocellulose membrane and mounted on polyvinyl chloride strips. Urine samples were then tested in an assay consisting of a combined incubation step of the urine sample and biotinylated detecting antibody followed by incubation in streptavidin peroxidase and a subsequent staining. The specificity and the sensitivity of the assay, as determined with urine samples of 61 uninfected controls and 67 Schistosoma mansoni-infected individuals, were 96. 7 and 95. 5 %, respectively. The results of the <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> assay compared very well with microscopical parasitological diagnosis by the standard Kato-Katz method for the same individuals.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{patterns of}} self monitoring of blood glucose concentration in diabetic patients who use insulin {{and to determine}} whether frequency of self monitoring is related to glycaemic control. Setting: Diabetes database, Tayside, Scotland. Subjects: Patients resident in Tayside in 1993 ­- 5 who were using insulin and were registered on the database and diagnosed with insulin dependent (type 1) or non­insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes before 1993. Main outcome measures: Number of glucose monitoring <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> dispensed (reagent strip uptake) derived from records of prescriptions. First recorded haemoglobin A 1 c concentration in the study period, and <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> dispensed in the previous 6 months. Results: Among 807 patients with type 1 diabetes, 128 (16 %) did not redeem any prescriptions for glucose monitoring <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> in the 3 year study period. Only 161 (20 %) redeemed prescriptions for enough <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> to test glucose daily. The corresponding figures for the 790 patients with type 2 diabetes who used insulin were 162 (21 %; no strips) and 131 (17 %; daily tests). Reagent strip uptake was influenced both by age and by deprivation category. There was a direct relation between uptake and glycaemic control for 258 patients (with recorded haemoglobin A 1 c concentrations) with type 1 diabetes. In a linear regression model the decrease in haemoglobin A 1 c concentration for every extra 180 <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> dispensed was 0. 7 %. For the 290 patients with type 2 diabetes who used insulin {{there was no such}} relation. Conclusions: Self monitoring of blood glucose concentration is associated with improved glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. Regular self monitoring in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes is uncommon...|$|E
40|$|Four {{indirect}} approaches, {{based on}} inquiry into a past history of haematuria, visual inspection for {{blood in the}} urine specimens, {{and the use of}} <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> to detect haematuria and proteinuria, were evaluated to identify persons with Schistosoma haematobium infection. These approaches were applied individually and in three different screening sequences on two populations in Ghana and Zambia in order to identify infected children and adults for subsequent treatment in both areas. Detection of haematuria using <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> was the single approach with the highest sensitivity and specificity. The observation of gross haematuria (bloody urine), followed by detection of blood by <b>reagent</b> <b>strips,</b> identified 87 % of infected children in both areas.

METHODS: Nineteen studies were analysed (Medline search), comparing <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> in cirrhotic ascites vs. cytobacteriological methods. Diagnostic grades (G) were: GO = 0 leucocytes/mm 3; G 1 = 15; G 2 = 70; G 3 = 125; G 4 = 500 for Multistix, GO = 0; G 1 = 25; G 2 = 75; G 3 = 500 for Nephur, Combur, UriScan, and GO = 0; G 1 = 25; G 2 = 75; G 3 = 250; G 4 = 500 for Aution. RESULTS: Medians per study were: 75 patients (range: 31 - 1041), 136 ascites (47 - 2123), 17 SBP (5 - 117). For Multistix (12 studies), the sensitivities fell within the ranges 64. 7 - 100 % (G > or = 1), 45. 7 - 83 % (G > or = 2) and 45. 3 - 89 % (G > or = 3). For Nephur (n = 2), Combur (n = 6), UriScan (n = 1), sensitivities ranged 80. 4 - 100 % (G > or = 1), 63 - 100 % (G > or = 2) and 67. 7 - 97 % (G > or = 3). For Aution (n = 3), sensitivities ranged 93 - 96 % (G > or = 2) and 89 % (G > or = 3). Nephur, Combur, UriScan displayed higher sensitivities than Multistix.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of this semi-quantitative measurement of glucosuria compared to laboratory measurements of glucose concentrations in urine. Methods. Reagent test strips (Combur(3) Test (R) Roche) from 375 artificially supplemented samples of urine, covering a wide range of glucose concentrations, were independently read by three different observers. Scores of the strips were categorized as 0, 1 +, 2 +, 3 + or 4 +, in ascending degree of glucosuria. Results of the test-strips were compared to the quantitative measurement of urinary glucose concentration in the laboratory. Results. 21. 7 % of <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> readings were discordant with the laboratory measurements (p < 0. 001).

In the presence of free hemoglobin/myoglobin, uniform colour ranging from a negative yellow through green to a strongly positive green-blue appears on the pad. In contrast, intact red blood cells are lysed {{when they come in}} contact with the pad, and the liberated hemoglobin produces an isolated reaction that results in a speckled pattern on the pad. <b>Reagent</b> <b>strip</b> tests can detect concentrations as low as five red blood cells per microliter; however, care must be taken when comparing these figures with the actual microscopic values, because the absorbent nature of the pad attracts some of urine. The terms trace, small, moderate, and large or trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ are used for reporting.|$|R

METHODS: In a prospective single-center 12 -month study of joint fluid specimens, leukocyte esterase <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> testing (LERST) {{was compared to}} leukocyte counts used as the reference standard. Leukocyte counts greater than 2000 /mm(3) were taken to indicate inflammation. Reproducibility of LERST was evaluated by testing 73 specimens twice and computing Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Ninety-eight joint fluid specimens (26 with mechanical and 72 with inflammatory characteristics) were evaluated. LERST had 79. 2 % sensitivity, 92. 3 % specificity, 96. 6 % positive predictive value, 61. 5 % negative predictive value, a positive likelihood ratio of 10. 3, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 23. The kappa coefficient was 0. 70 (0. 53 - 0. 87). Two negative LERSTs a few minutes apart had 80 % negative predictive value and a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 08. CONCLUSION: LERST of joint fluid is a rapid means of satisfactorily separating mechanical from inflammatory joint fluids...|$|R

40|$|Elimination of {{schistosomiasis}} as {{a public}} health problem and interruption of transmission in selected areas are key goals of the World Health Organization for 2025. Conventional parasitological methods are insensitive for the detection of light-intensity infections. Techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are required for an accurate diagnosis in low-transmission settings and verification of elimination. We determined the accuracy of a urine-based up-converting phosphor-lateral flow circulating anodic antigen (UCP-LF CAA) assay for Schistosoma haematobium diagnosis in low-prevalence settings in Zanzibar, Tanzania. A total of 1, 740 urine samples were collected in 2013 from children on Pemba Island, from schools where the S. haematobium prevalence was < 2 %, 2 - 5 %, and 5 - 10 %, based on a single urine filtration. On the day of collection, all samples were tested for microhematuria with <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> and for the presence of S. haematobium eggs with microscopy. Eight months later, 1. 5 ml of urine from each of 1, 200 samples stored at - 20 °C were analyzed by UCP-LF CAA assay, while urine filtration slides were subjected to quality control (QCUF). In the absence of a true 'gold' standard, the diagnostic performance was calculated using latent class analyses (LCA). The 'empirical' S. haematobium prevalence revealed by UCP-LF CAA, QCUF, and <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> was 14 %, 5 %, and 4 %, respectively. LCA revealed a sensitivity of the UCP-LF CAA, QCUF, and <b>reagent</b> <b>strips</b> of 97 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 91 - 100 %), 86 % (95 % CI: 72 - 99 %), and 67 % (95 % CI: 52 - 81 %), respectively. Test specificities were consistently above 90 %. The UCP-LF CAA assay shows high sensitivity for the diagnosis of S. haematobium in low-endemicity settings. Empirically, it detects a considerably higher number of infections than microscopy. Hence, the UCP-LF CAA employed in combination with QCUF, is a promising tool for monitoring and surveillance of urogenital schistosomiasis in low-transmission settings targeted for elimination...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{carry out}} a {{comparative}} cost-effectiveness analysis of screening methods for urinary schistosomiasis; terminal haematuria, unqualified haematuria, dysuria, visual urine examination and chemical <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> technique, in a school-based control programme. Design Estimation of costs and determination of cost-effect ratios of the screening methods applied in a school-based screening and treatment programme, {{from the perspective of}} a programme manager. Setting A junior secondary school in Ibadan, Nigeria. Main outcome measures Cost per number of cases correctly diagnosed. Results Unqualified haematuria was found to be the most cost-effective method costing N 51. 06 (US$ 2. 16) to diagnose a case correctly, followed by terminal haematuria N 58. 91 (US$ 2. 50) and dysuria N 84. 24 (US$ 3. 57). Despite the relatively high input costs of chemical <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> technique over visual urine examination (N 22. 12 (US$ 0. 94) per student vs. N 6. 44 (US$ 0. 27) per student), it was found to be more cost effective costing N 304. 56 (US$ 12. 91) to diagnose a case correctly than visual examination of urine cost of N 317. 58 (US$ 13. 46) per correct case diagnosed. Conclusion From the viewpoint of a programme manager, interview method of screening by asking for blood in the urine remains the most efficient means of screening for urinary schistosomiasis in school-based control programmes in our environment.

40|$|Part 1 : Information & Communication Technology-EurAsia Conference 2014, ICT-EurAsia 2014 International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{an intelligent}} method for helping people {{to maintain their}} healthy by doing a self urinalysis utilising a smartphone camera. A color sensing method using a smartphone camera is designed to determine {{the value of a}} <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> in a urinalysis dipstick. In the dipstick urinalysis, a color change in each <b>reagent</b> <b>strip</b> is examined. This color change {{is a result of the}} reaction of dipstick to the chemical contents of urine including pH, Protein, Glucose, Ketones, Leucocyte, Nitrite, Bilirubine, and Urobilinogen. Performing disptick urinalysis can be done in almost any places even on the very remote area where medical laboratory cannot be found, and it is much easier and cheaper than medical lab visit. The proposed intelligent method includes a framework for color acquisition using a smartphone camera which covers the color management system, color correction, color matching, and quantification. The usage of RGB and CIELAB color space is discussed in the color management part. An automated color constancy approach is introduced to provide a better color correction, and a step-wise linear interpolation is introduced to better estimate the urinalysis value. To implement this proposed method, a closed acquisition box does not required. Disptick capturing can be done directly with a smartphone camera in almost any normal lighting condition...|$|R
