No commercially available technology complies with all the required specifications for an efficient and reliable EES system. Reversible solid oxide cells (ReSOC) working in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes could be a cost effective and highly efficient EES, but are not yet ready for the market. In fact, using the system in fuel cell mode produces high temperature heat that can be recovered during electrolysis, when a heat source is necessary. Before ReSOCs can be used as EES systems, many problems have to be solved. This paper presents a new ReSOC concept, where the thermal energy produced during fuel cell mode is stored as sensible or latent heat, respectively, in a high density and high specific heat material and in a phase change material (PCM) and used during electrolysis operation. The study of two different storage concepts is performed using a lumped parameters ReSOC stack model coupled with a suitable balance of plant. The optimal <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> calculated for both of the configurations studied is not far from 70 % and results from a trade-off between the stack <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the energy consumed by the auxiliary power systems...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{energy storage}} {{technologies}} represent {{one of the}} key elements to solving the growing challenges of electrical energy supply of the 21 st century. Several energy storage systems are available, from ones that are technologically mature to others still at a research stage. Each technology has its inherent limitations that make its use economically or practically feasible only for specific applications. The present paper aims at integrating hydrogen generation into compressed air energy storage systems to avoid natural gas combustion or thermal energy storage. A proper design of such a hybrid storage system could provide high <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiencies</b> together with enhanced flexibility thanks to the possibility of providing additional energy outputs (heat, cooling, and hydrogen as a fuel), in a distributed energy storage framework. Such a system could be directly connected to the power grid at the distribution level to reduce power and energy intermittence problems related to renewable energy generation. Similarly, it could be located close to the user (e. g., office buildings, commercial centers, industrial plants, hospitals, etc.). Finally, it could be integrated in decentralized energy generation systems to reduce the peak electricity demand charges and energy costs, to increase power generation efficiency, to enhance the security of electrical energy supply, and to facilitate the market penetration of small renewable energy systems. Different configurations have been investigated (simple hybrid storage system, regenerate system, multistage system) demonstrating the compressed air and hydrogen storage systems effectiveness in improving energy source flexibility and efficiency, and possibly in reducing the costs of energy supply. Round-trip efficiency up to 65 % can be easily reached. The analysis is conducted through a mixed theoretical-numerical approach, which allows the definition of the most relevant physical parameters affecting the system performance...|$|R

40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{continuously}} increasing its penetration {{in the energy}} supply network around the world. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, storage of excess energy during its availability is vital. Energy storage, especially on the large scale, has recently {{received a lot of}} attention from the scientific world and ammonia has been identified as a promising energy storage medium suitable for this application. Factors like high energy density, potential to have minimal carbon footprint and ready existence of suitable infrastructure for handling and transport especially make it an attractive choice. Moreover, ammonia is a bulk feedstock in the chemical and fertiliser industry making it a valuable commodity. A generic model has been developed in MATLAB to assess the economic feasibility of producing ammonia from varying availability of electric power. The model estimates the optimum plant capacity at which levelised production cost is minimum thereby resulting in minimum energy storage cost. Steel industries like Tata Steel produce electric power to satisfy the plant’s operational demand using by-product gases (termed as work arising gases) evolved during the steel making process. An intermittent availability of surplus electric power has been reported at Tata Steel, IJmuiden. The economic feasibility of utilising ammonia to store the surplus available electric power using the developed MATLAB model has been assessed in this study. It has been found that the variable cost due to electric power consumption, the fixed cost of the system and capital cost of the electrolyser significantly influence the production cost of ammonia. The minimum levelised production cost estimated in this study is € 997 /ton which is almost three times the current market price of ammonia. The system shows potential to produce ammonia at a competitive price when sufficient electric power is continuously available at an electricity price of € 10 /MWh or lower. Utilising part of the hydrogen produced from the work arising gases in the ammonia production process helps to lower the levelised production cost to around € 913 /ton. Availability of sufficient hydrogen simplifies the system and {{it may be possible to}} produce ammonia at a competitive price when hydrogen price is lower than € 1. 26 /kg. The power to ammonia process shows an efficiency of around 50 %. Using gas turbines to produce electricity from ammonia are expected to result in <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of around 15 %- 25 %. Research and pilot plants have shown good potential of using ammonia as a fuel in combustion engines and commercial applications are expected to be realised in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{storage of}} {{hydrogen}} in activated carbon (aC) electrodes {{as part of}} a reversible fuel cell offers a potentially attractive option for storing surplus electrical energy from inherently variable solar and wind energy resources. Such a system - which we have called a proton flow battery - promises to have a <b>roundtrip</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> comparable to lithium ion batteries, while having higher gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. Activated carbons with high internal surface area, high pore volume, light weight and easy availability have attracted considerable research interest as a solid-state hydrogen storage medium. This paper compares the physical characteristics and hydrogen storage capacities of four activated carbon (aC) electrodes made from brown coal. The fabrication methods for these samples are explained. Their proton conductivity was measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and their hydrogen storage capacity by galvanostatic charging and discharging in a three-electrode electrolytic cell with 1 mol sulphuric acid as electrolyte at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The highest hydrogen storage capacity obtained was 1. 29 wt%, which compares favourably with metal hydrides used in commercially available solid-state hydrogen storages. Finally, the relation between the hydrogen storage capacity of the samples and their Dubinin-Radushkevich surface area (calculated by the CO 2 adsorption method) was investigated. The results point the way towards selecting high-performing electrodes for proton flow batteries and signal the potential competitiveness of this energy storage technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current {{increase}} in the deployment of new renewable electricity generation systems is making energy storage more and more important at small and large scales in order to guarantee and secure supply of electricity. An ideal energy storage technology would have a high power rating, a large storage capacity, high efficiency, low costs and no geographic constraints. The use of air as energy carrier has been studied since the 20 th century with the first {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) systems. This technology is still recognized to have potential but it is geographically constrained where suitable geological tanks are available unless compressed air is stored in pressurized tanks with significant costs. Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) represents an interesting solution due to his relatively large volumetric energy density and ease of storage.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} assessment of a novel and efficient EES (electric energy storage) system based on ReSOC (reversible solid oxide cell) technology. The ReSOC is an electrochemical energy conversion device working at high temperature (600 - 1000 °C) that can operate reversibly either as a fuel cell (SOFC) or as an electrolyser (SOEC). In this study, an ReSOC unit fed by mixtures of CH 4, CO, H 2 O and H 2 is proposed and analyzed. In particular, in the SOFC mode, where electricity is generated, the reactant gas, mainly formed by CH 4 and H 2, is converted into a mixture of H 2 O and CO 2. The exhausts from the SOFC are used as the reactant gas for the SOEC operation. During the electrolysis process, CH 4 can be also produced thanks to the methanation reaction that, under proper operating conditions, occurs in the cathode of the solid oxide cell. The ReSOC unit behavior is investigated by developing a system-level model, able to predict its performance (i. e. <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency,</b> polarization curve, thermally self-sustaining conditions) under different operating conditions. The ReSOC model, built with a modular architecture, is performed through thermodynamic, thermochemical and electrochemical sub-models taking into account mass and energy balances, chemical reactions (reforming, shifting reactions and methanation) and electro-chemical relationships. Available literature data {{have been used for}} the model validation and a calibration procedure has been performed in order to evaluate the best fitting values for model parameters. Furthermore, in order to estimate the thermoneutral conditions in SOEC operating mode, the ReSOC thermal behavior has been analyzed under different operating temperatures. Results pointed out that, by feeding the cell with a syngas mixture (CH 4, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, H 2), the reforming reaction (in the SOFC mode) and the methanation reaction (in the SOEC mode) allow to simplify the cell thermal management. Moreover, the best performance in terms of stack <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> (about 70...|$|E

This new concept {{has the potential}} to increase <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efﬁciency</b> compared to the conventional hydrogen-based electrical energy storage system by eliminating the intermediate steps of hydrogen gas production, storage, and recovery. As only an inﬂow of water is needed in the charge mode, and air in discharge mode, the system is called a &# 039;proton ﬂow battery&# 039;. A hydrogen storage electrode was fabricated from a novel composite metal hydrideenaﬁon material, and found to have acceptably high proton and electron conductivities.

40|$|A Unitised Regenerative Fuel Cell (URFC) is {{a single}} cell that can {{function}} both as a fuel cell and electrolyser. URFCs have mass and volume savings compared to conventional hydrogen systems employing a separate electrolyser and fuel cell. Hence they have potential applications in electrical energy storage systems {{for a wide range}} of terrestrial and space applications. This paper reviews the current state of art of this promising technology and identifies the main technical challenges to overcome to make the URFC system more technologically and economically viable. The review reveals that the oxygen-side catalyst layer in a URFC is typically more challenging to design and construct, since a bifunctional catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer (GDL) must be made that functions equally well in electrolyser and fuel cell modes. The prime goal in URFC development is to obtain a <b>roundtrip</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> very close that of a system with a separate electrolyser and fuel cell. It is important to develop light weight, long-lived cells resistant to corrosion or other degradation, and retention of structural integrity and strength after repeated cycling and mode switching. There is still a lack of practical designs and operating experience for URFC stacks scaled up to multi-cell stacks with supply power in the kW range. In addition, development of URFC stacks able to deliver hydrogen at elevated pressure up to 20 bar in E-mode is essential. So that hydrogen can be stored directly as compressed gas or in metal hydride cylinder to reduce the cost of external compressor and parasitic power in standalone power supply systems. If these challenges can be overcome, URFC based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology has potential for reducing the cost of overall hydrogen fuel cell system and can offer clean, reliable and onsite hydrogen and power generation...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{of climate}} change and {{sustainable}} energy policy are driving the deployment of wind and solar energy towards the goal of reducing fossil fuel emissions. In liberalized (deregulated) markets, the large-scale deployment of wind or solar energy results in electricity price collapse at times of high wind or solar output to below the price of fossil fuels. This revenue collapse limits economic large-scale use of wind and solar and reduces the revenue for nuclear plants. The current electrical energy storage options are too expensive to be deployed in sufficient quantity to prevent the price collapse. A less expensive approach to energy storage is required to enable a low carbon-energy grid. This thesis explores the potential of a new energy storage technology to address the challenges of a low-carbon energy grid: FIrebrick Resistance-heated Energy Storage (FIRES). FIRES is a storage technology that takes in surplus electricity, stores the energy as high temperature sensible heat (1200 °C- 1700 °C) in a firebrick storage medium, and outputs the stored heat as hot air when the energy is desired. The stream of hot air {{can be used to}} (1) provide heat to high temperature industries in place of natural gas, or (2) be added to a power cycle to produce electricity when it is in demand. FIRES heat storage is nearly two orders of magnitude less expensive than the current energy storage options (on the order of dollars per kilowatt-hour capital cost). Cheap electricity transferred to the heating market by FIRES reduces heating costs and carbon emissions by offering industries cheaper energy than that of the competing fossil fuel, while ensuring revenue to the solar, wind and nuclear power plants. FIRES has "unlimited" storage capacity. If the firebrick is fully charged, FIRES electric resistance heaters will provide hot air to furnaces as long as electric prices are less than fossil-fuel prices. In the long term, FIRES stored heat may be used for peak electricity production in advanced nuclear plants with air-Brayton power cycles, with <b>roundtrip</b> storage <b>efficiencies</b> (electricity-to-heat-to-electricity) near 70 %, in class with that of existing electrical energy storage options. Conceptual designs of FIRES heat storage on the megawatt-hour scale were found to be chargeable and dischargeable over periods of several hours or several days as needed. FIRES technology is ready for applications under 1200 °C using existing technologies; research is required for higher temperature and high pressure (Brayton power cycle) applications. The applications, conceptual designs, system modeling and preliminary performance and economic evaluations are detailed in the following study. by Daniel Christopher Stack. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{compressed}} air {{energy storage system}} (CAES) and the pumped hydroelectric storage systems (PHES) are the two matured technologies for storing utility-scale bulk energy. This thesis presents the thermal model for the CAES with energy recovery system, which include the results of the exergy analysis for the components of the system and its performance and related economic issues compared to that of the PHES. 	The results show that CAES with energy recovery unit can provide <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> close to 71 percent compared to the 80 percent for PHES.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{framework for}} the economic valuation of current energy storage systems coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems is presented. The solar-with-storage system's operation is optimized for two different rate schedules: (1) Time-of-use (TOU) for residential systems, and (2) Real-time wholesale rates for centralized generators. Nine storage technologies are considered for PV coupling, including six different battery chemistries, hydrogen electrolysis with a fuel cell, compressed air, and pumped-hydro energy storage. In addition, these technologies are assessed in the capacity of enabling a solar energy generator to provide a set service requirement. Concentrating solar thermal power (CSTP) with thermal storage {{is presented as a}} comparison for this final baseload scenario. Some general insights were gained during the analysis of these technologies. It was discovered that there is a minimum power rating threshold for storage systems in a residential TOU market that is required to capture most of the benefits. This is about 1. 5 kW for a 2 kWP residential PV system. It was found that <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> is extremely important for both TOU and real-time markets, but low self-discharge rates are even more critical in real-time rate schedules. It was also estimated that large storage systems for centralized generation would capture the most revenue with a power rating twice that of the storage capacity (2 hours of discharge). However, due to cost limitations, actual optimal ratios were calculated to be about 3 to 7 hours of discharge for operation in a real-time market. None of the current technologies considered are able to economically meet the requirements for a residential TOU rate schedule; and only CSTP with thermal storage, pumped-hydro, and potentially compressed air storage are able to offer value in a centralized real-time market or a baseload scenario. Recommendations for future research and development (R&D) on the various storage technologies are given. For many of the electrochemical batteries, the key focus areas include cycle lifetime as well as energy and power costs. <b>Roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> was identified as the weak-point of hydrogen systems; the energy cost of lithium-ion batteries was found to be prohibitively expensive for energy arbitrage applications; and the balance of system (BOS) and power costs were identified as the main focus areas for the larger pumped-hydro and compressed air storage systems. by Trannon Mosher.

40|$|Power to heat {{technologies}} {{are becoming more}} and more important due to the extreme need of energy storage solutions to help manage the mismatch between supply and demand of electric power in grids with a large penetration of intermittent renewable energy systems. Several Electric Energy Storage (EES) technologies have been proposed in the literature and some of them have been built as pilot or commercial plants, with different characteristics in terms of storage capacity, response time and <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In this paper, the attention was focused on Pumped Thermal Electricity Storage (PTES), which is a technology that stores electric energy as heat by means of Heat Pumps (HP) and converts it again to power with a Heat Engine (HE). In this study, a hybrid PTES application was studied, which took advantage of a low-grade heat source to boost the electric round-trip efficiency of the system beyond 100 %. The main idea was to exploit the heat source to reduce the HP operational temperature difference; this thermal integration boosted the HP COP and thus the electric efficiency of the whole system. A Matlab numerical model was developed, using the thermodynamic properties of the Coolprop data base, and the steady state operation of a PTES system composed by a vapor-compression HP and an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) we simulated. Heat source temperature values ranging from 80 °C to 110 °C and different working fluids were studied. Among the refrigerants, which comply with the latest European environmental legislation, the most promising fluid was R 1233 zd(E) : with such fluid a maximum round trip-efficiency of 1. 3 was achieved, when the heat source temperature reaches 110 °C and the machinery isentropic efficiencies is 0. 8, the heat exchangers pinch points is 5 K and the ORC condensation temperature is 35 °C...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an integrated modelling methodology which includes reduced-order models of a lithium ion battery and a power electronic converter, {{connected to a}} 35 -bus distribution network model. The literature contains many examples of isolated modelling of individual energy storage mediums, power electronic interfaces and control algorithms for energy storage. However, when assessing {{the performance of a}} complete energy storage system, the interaction between components gives rise to a range of phenomena that are difficult to quantify if studied in isolation. This paper proposes an integrated electro–thermo–chemical modelling methodology that seeks to address this problem directly by integrating reduced-order models of battery cell chemistry, power electronic circuits and grid operation into a computationally efficient framework. The framework is capable of simulation speeds over 100 times faster than real-time and captures phenomena typically not observed in simpler battery and power converter models or non-integrated frameworks. All simulations are performed using real system load profiles recorded in the United Kingdom. To illustrate the advantages inherent in such a modelling approach, two specific interconnected effects are investigated: the effect of the choice of battery float state-of-charge on overall system efficiency and the rate of battery degradation (capacity/power fade). Higher state-of-charge operation offers improved efficiency due to lower polarisation losses of the battery and lower losses in the converter, however, an increase in the rate of battery degradation is observed due to the accelerated growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer. We demonstrate that grid control objectives can be met in several different ways, but that the choices made can result in a substantial improvement in system <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency,</b> with up to a 43 % reduction in losses, or reduction in battery degradation by a factor of two, depending on battery system use case...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} {{and national}} initiatives are promoting the worldwide transition of energy systems towards power production mixes increasingly based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The integration of large shares of RES into the actual electricity infrastructure is representing {{a challenge for}} the power grids due to the fluctuating characteristics of RES. The adoption of long-term, large-scale Electric Energy Storage (EES) is envisaged as the key-option for promoting the integration of RES in the electricity sector by overcoming the issue of temporal and spatial decoupling of electricity supply and demand. Among the several EES options, {{one of the most}} promising is the conversion of energy from the electrical into the chemical form through the synthesis of H 2 and synthetic natural gas (SNG) in Power-to-Gas (P 2 G) systems based on the electrolysis of water (and also CO 2) in Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs). The application of SOC technology in P 2 G solutions shows attractiveness for the high efficiency of high-temperature electrolysis and the flexibility of SOCs that can operate reversibly as electrolyzers or fuel cells (rSOC) and can directly perform the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O to syngas by co-electrolysis. The capability of reversible operation also allows the application of SOC-based systems to Power-to-Power (P 2 P) concepts designed for deferred electricity production. This dissertation is focused on the investigation of electricity storage using Power-to-Gas/Power systems based on SOCs. The aim of this Thesis has been the investigation of the thermo-electrochemical behavior of SOCs integrated P 2 G/P 2 P systems, with the purpose to identify the system configuration and the operating conditions that ensure the most efficient electricity-to-SNG (P 2 G) or electricity-to-electricity (P 2 P) conversion within the thermal limits imposed by state-of-the art SOC materials. To this purpose, a detailed thermo-electrochemical model of an SOC has been developed at cell level, validated on experimental data, extended at stack level and coupled with models of the main P 2 G/P 2 P components for the system analysis. Model validation was performed through the characterization of planar commercial SOCs in the reversible operation as electrolyzers (SOEC) and fuel cells (SOFC) with H 2 /H 2 O and CO/CO 2 fuel mixtures at different reactant fractions and temperatures. The physical consistency of electrode kinetic parameters evaluated from the model was verified with the support of literature studies. The investigation of SOC-based P 2 P and P 2 G solutions was performed using the models developed. Three different configurations were analyzed and simulated: 1) hydrogen-based P 2 P with rSOC, 2) SOEC-based electricity storage into hydrogen with subsequent SNG production by methanation with CO 2 and 3) electricity storage by co-electrolysis of water and carbon dioxide with SOEC for syngas production and subsequent upgrading to SNG by methanation. The performance of the P 2 P system was thoroughly assessed by analyzing the effects of rSOC stack operating parameters (inlet gas temperature, oxidant-to-fuel ratio, oxidant recirculation rate, cell current) and system configurations (pressurized/ambient rSOC operation, air/oxygen as oxidant/sweep fluid) on stack and system efficiency. The analysis allowed to identify the most efficient configuration of the P 2 P system, and to select the feasible operating currents (i. e., the currents included within the limits given by the physical thermal constraints of SOC materials) for which the highest <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> is achieved. Pressurized rSOC operation (10 bar) with pure oxygen as oxidant/sweep gas and full recirculation of the oxidant flow ensured the highest charging and discharging effectiveness, with a system <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 72 % when the stack is operating at the maximum efficiency currents (- 1. 3 A/cm 2 in SOEC and 0. 3 A/cm 2 in SOFC).

40|$|Energy storage {{technology}} {{is needed for}} the storage of surplus baseload generation and the storage of intermittent wind power, because it can increase the flexibility of power grid operations. Underground storage of hydrogen with natural gas (UHNG) is proposed as a new energy storage technology, {{to be considered for}} utility-scale energy storage applications. UHNG is a composite technology: using electrolyzers to convert electrical energy to chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. The latter is then injected along with natural gas into existing gas distribution and storage facilities. The energy stored as hydrogen is recovered as needed; as hydrogen for industrial and transportation applications, as electricity to serve power demand, or as hydrogen-enriched natural gas to serve gas demand. The storage of electrical energy in gaseous form is also termed “Power to Gas”. Such large scale electrical energy storage is desirable to baseload generators operators, renewable energy-based generator operators, independent system operators, and natural gas distribution utilities. Due to the low density of hydrogen, the hydrogen-natural gas mixture thus formed has lower volumetric energy content than conventional natural gas. But, compared to the combustion of conventional natural gas, to provide the same amount of energy, the hydrogen-enriched mixture emits less carbon dioxide. This thesis investigates the dynamic behaviour, financial and environmental performance of UHNG through scenario-based simulation. A proposed energy hub embodying the UHNG principle, located in Southwestern Ontario, is modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Then, the performance of UHNG for four different scenarios are assessed: injection of hydrogen for long term energy storage, surplus baseload generation load shifting, wind power integration and supplying large hydrogen demand. For each scenario, the configuration of the energy hub, its scale of operation and operating strategy are selected to match the application involved. All four scenarios are compared to the base case scenario, which simulates the operations of a conventional underground gas storage facility. For all scenarios in which hydrogen production and storage is not prioritized, the concentration of hydrogen in the storage reservoir is shown to remain lower than 7 % for {{the first three years of}} operation. The simulation results also suggest that, of the five scenarios, hydrogen injection followed by recovery of hydrogen-enriched natural gas is the most likely energy recovery pathway in the near future. For this particular scenario, it was also found that it is not profitable to sell the hydrogen-enriched natural gas at the same price as regular natural gas. For the range of scenarios evaluated, a list of benchmark parameters has been established for the UHNG technology. With a <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 39 %, rated capacity ranging from 25, 000 MWh to 582, 000 MWh and rated power from 1 to 100 MW, UHNG is an energy storage technology suitable for large storage capacity, low to medium power rating storage applications...|$|E
40|$|The present {{document}} is a manuscript-based dissertation covering Kyle Bassett’s PhD research from January, 2015 to January 2017. The research was particularly focused on studying and developing an emerging energy storage technique known as Buoyancy Battery Energy Storage (BBES). The buoyancy energy storage technique is presented and primary components are described and discussed. An idealized system was analyzed to determine governing equations of operation {{as well as}} ideal energy storage density. Experimental analysis was conducted to confirm properties of constant discharge force with respect to both float position and storage duration. Discharge testing was conducted with a developed scale system installed in the offshore testing tank and the University of Windsor. To evaluate the scalability of the technique, a utility scale BBES system was designed with power output capacity of 1 MW and energy storage capacity of 1 MWh. Several commercially available marine lift bags were considered and evaluated for volume requirements and drag effects at various float speeds. Theoretical <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> for this designed system {{was found to be}} 83 % based on results from drag calculations, pulley losses and electrical efficiency losses. Numerical simulations of system performance were completed to determine the revenue generation of the designed system based on 2015 Ontario market energy prices. To validate system operation in a marine environment, open water testing was conducted in Lake Huron. Testing validated surface deploy ability and steady state float motion was achieved. To further investigate the market opportunities and challenges facing the grid scale integration of energy storage, an analysis of market conditions was performed using Ontario, Canada as a case study. Ten years of Hourly Ontario Energy Price was analyzed using Fourier transform to reveal periodic trends within the data. It was found that the introduction of Time-of-use billing for electricity was effective in changing energy consumption behavior, improving balance for the electricity grid. Revenue generation simulations were completed for utility scale energy storage systems of various technologies (and thus various roundtrip efficiencies) using historic 2015 energy price data. Simulations included single and multi-cycle storage programs. It was determined that energy storage facilities are not currently financially viable, due to the minimal revenue produced through energy arbitrage transactions. The development of energy storage in Ontario will depend greatly on governmental subsidies and additional revenue-generating ancillary services such as regulation and black start capability. Additional experimental analysis was performed using a modified BBES system designed to convert input energy into mechanical work such that each quantity could be controlled and measured. Three float shapes of interest were tested including a horizontally configured cylinder, a vertically configured cylinder as well as a sphere. Discharge efficiencies greater than 90 % were achieved. Roundtrip efficiencies of 78 % were recorded. Results suggest that with improved conversion pulleys and component scaling, experimental roundtrip efficiencies should approach the theoretical efficiency used in the 1 MW BBES system designed...|$|E
40|$|This STTR Phase I {{research}} program {{was on the}} development of high temperature (400 to 650 C), secondary batteries with <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> > 90 % for integration with a 3 to 10 kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system. In fulfillment of this objective, advanced planar high temperature rechargeable batteries, comprised of an alkali metal ion conducting, highly refractory, beta'' alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) sandwiched between liquid sodium (or potassium) anode and liquid metal salt cathode, were developed at MSRI. The batteries have been successfully demonstrated at a working temperature as high as 600 C. To our knowledge, so far no work has been reported in the literature on planar rechargeable batteries based on BASE, and results obtained in Phase I {{for the very first time}} demonstrated the viability of planar batteries, though relatively low temperature tubular-based sodium-sulfur batteries and ZEBRA batteries have been actively developed by very limited non U. S. companies. The results of this Phase I work have fulfilled all the goals and stated objectives, and the achievements showed much promise for further, substantial improvements in battery design and performance. The important results of Phase I are briefly described in what follows: (1) Both Na-BASE and K-BASE discs and tubes have been successfully fabricated using MSRI's patented vapor phase process. Ionic conductivity measurements showed that Na-BASE had higher ionic conductivity than K-BASE, consistence with the literature. At 500 C, Na-BASE conductivity is 0. 36 S/cm, which is more than 20 times higher than 8 YSZ electrolyte used for SOFC at 800 C. The activation energy is 22. 58 kJ/mol. (2) CuCl{sub 2 }, FeCl{sub 2 }, ZnCl{sub 2 }, and AgCl were identified as suitable salts for Na/metal salt or K/metal salt electrochemical couples based on thermochemical data. Further open circuit voltage measurements matched those deduced from the thermochemical data. (3) Tubular cells with CuCl{sub 2 } as the cathode and Na as the anode were constructed. However, it was discovered that CuCl{sub 2 } was somewhat corrosive and dissolved iron, an element of the cathode compartment. Since protective coating technology was beyond this Phase I work scope, no further work on the CuCl{sub 2 } cathode was pursued in Phase I. Notwithstanding, due to its very high OCV and high specific energy, CuCl{sub 2 } cathode is a very attractive possibility for a battery capable of delivering higher specific energy with higher voltage. Further investigation of the Na-CuCl{sub 2 } battery can be done by using suitable metal coating technologies developed at MSRI for high temperature applications. (4) In Phase I, FeCl{sub 2 } and ZnCl{sub 2 } were finalized as the potential cathodes for Na-metal salt batteries for delivering high specific energies. Planar Na-FeCl{sub 2 } and Na-ZnCl{sub 2 } cells were designed, constructed, and tested between 350 and 600 C. Investigation of charge/discharge characteristics showed they were the most promising batteries. Charge/discharge cycles were performed as many as 27 times, and charge/discharge current was as high as 500 mA. No failure was detected after 50 hours testing. (5) Three-cell planar stacks were designed, constructed, and evaluated. Preliminary tests showed further investigation was needed for optimization. (6) Freeze-thaw survival was remarkably good for planar BASE discs fabricated by MSRI's patented vapor phase process...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{plants have}} high capital costs and low {{operating}} costs that favor base-load operation. This characteristic {{of nuclear power}} has been a critical constraint that limits the portion of nuclear power plants in a grid to stay below the base-load demand. A novel gigawatt-year thermal-energy storage technology is proposed to enable base load nuclear plants to produce variable electricity to meet seasonal variations in electricity demand. A large volume of underground rock is heated with hot water (or steam or carbon dioxide) from {{a nuclear power plant}} during periods of low electricity demand, and the heat is extracted during times of high demand and converted to electricity using a standard geothermal plant (Figure 1). Among various technical options, technically mature ones were selected for the reference design; a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) injects hot fluid into an underground reservoir through an intermediate heat exchanger and bypass flow lines on either the primary or secondary side. The reservoir size of 500 m in each dimension at 1. 5 km underneath the surface is engineered to have permeability of 2 Darcy using commercial hydraulic fracture methods, and is cyclically heated up and cooled down between the temperatures of 50 °C and 250 °C. Peak power electricity is produced by exploiting the stored thermal energy via an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) that employs a binary flash cycle. Models of a nuclear-EGS system performance, taking into account heat transfer in the reservoir, thermal front velocity in the reservoir, conductive heat & water losses, geothermal power plant electricity production performance, operating conditions and system interfaces were developed and independently compared with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using FLUENT 6. 3 to confirm the validity of the models. The design study with the validated models reveals that the reference nuclear-EGS system based on 2. 8 ~ 6. 0 GW(th) of nuclear power would have a thermal storage size of 0. 7 ~ 1. 5 GW(th) -year, which corresponds to 0. 08 ~ 0. 2 GW(e) -year with electricity round trip efficiency of 0. 34 ~ 0. 46. Reservoir permeability and geofluid temperature are found {{to be the most important}} design parameters that affect performance of nuclear-EGS storage systems. A grid that deploys a nuclear-EGS system will have three distinct electricity sectors: nuclear base load, EGS intermediate load, and gas turbine peak power. The nuclear-EGS storage system introduces economic benefits to a grid by leveraging economic gains arising from replacing expensive intermediate and peak electricity with cheap base-load electricity. A nuclear-EGS system has a higher capital cost than natural gas turbines; consequently, it replaces intermediate-load power plants but not all the gas turbines that operate for a small number of hours per year. It was found that the deployment of a operate for a small number of hours per year. It was found that the deployment of a Nuclear-EGS could cut the electricity production cost of the New England Independent Systems Operator (NE-ISO) by as much as 14 % of the storage-free cost (Fig. 2). Economic competitiveness of nuclear power plants is the most decisive factor for the deployment of the system in a grid. Because this was the first analysis of a nuclear EGS system, we used off-the-shelf technology wherever possible to reduce uncertainties and have confidence that the system will work. Significant improvements in <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> and economics may be possible by development of more advanced systems. For example, existing geothermal power plants are small (megawatts) versus several hundred megawatts for a nuclear EGS system. They use double flash power systems. The larger scale may enable the use of triple-flash and other more efficient power cycles. Reservoir development methods designed explicitly for nuclear EGS systems may significantly lower the costs of reservoir development. Like any other system dependent upon geology, costs and performance will depend upon the local geology.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Perry Li. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 201222 pages. Integrating {{wind and solar}} energy into the electric power grid is challenging due to variations in wind speed and solar intensity. Moreover, to maintain the stability of electric power grid, there must be always {{a balance between the}} energy production and consumption which is not easy since both of them undergo drastic variation over time. Large scale energy storage systems can solve these issues by storing the extra energy when supply exceeds demand power, and regenerating energy and send it to the electric grid when demand power surpasses the supply. This dissertation focuses on the optimal design and control of a new type of Com- pressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system that is especially applicable to off-shore wind turbines. The system is designed such that it addresses the need for a compact and energy dense storage system with high <b>roundtrip</b> <b>efficiency</b> for large-scale energy storage applications. The contributions of this work are also beneficial for designing power dense gas compressors/expanders with high thermal efficiency. The material of this thesis can be divided into two parts: In the first part, different approaches and techniques are studied to increase the power density of a liquid piston air compressor/expander system without sacrificing its efficiency. These methods are then combined and optimized {{in the form of a}} single design to maximize the performance of an air compressor/expander unit which is the most critical component of the energy storage system under investigation. In the second part, component-level and supervisory-level controllers are designed and developed for the combined wind turbine and energy storage system such that both short-term and long-term objectives are achieved. Improvement of thermal efficiency of an air compressor/expander is achievable by increasing heat transfer between air under compression/expansion and its surrounding solid material in the compression/expansion chamber. This will prevent heat loss by reducing air temperature rise/drop during the compression/expansion phase. Here, liquid piston (instead of conventional solid piston) is used in the compression/expansion chamber where the chamber volume is filled with porous material that increases heat transfer area by an order of magnitude, and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. Since the liquid piston is driven by a variable displacement pump/motor, optimal compression/expansion trajectories are calculated and applied to further increase heat transfer and improve the performance of the system. This improvement is verified both analytically and experimentally. Based on numerical results, utilizing porous material in the compression/expansion chamber with optimized distribution, combined with the corresponding optimal compression/expansion trajectory has the potential to increase the power density by more than 20 folds, without reducing its thermal efficiency. An alternative method to increase heat transfer is to introduce micro-size water droplets (through water spray) in the chamber during air compression/expansion process. Since water has a high heat capacity, the generated heat during compression can be absorbed by water and therefore reduce the temperature rise of air during compression. The same phenomenon but in opposite direction happens in expansion case (heat transfer from water droplets to air) that prevents air from getting very cold which causes poor efficiency. A numerical model is developed and used to study the effect of water spray amount and timing on the thermal performance of air compressor/expander. The opti- mal timing of water spray is calculated to maximize the effectiveness of a given amount of water that is sprayed into the air. The optimally designed liquid piston air compressor/expander unit is then combined with the other components of energy storage system, as well as a wind turbine. Nonlinear techniques are used to design plant-level controllers in order to coordinate different parts in the system, and to achieve both short term objectives (maintaining the frequency of electric generator while capturing maximum wind power) and long term objectives (tracking the power demanded from electric grid and regulating the pressure in the storage vessel). Finally, the combined wind turbine and energy storage system is studied for maximizing the total achievable revenue by optimizing the storage/regeneration sequence according to varying electricity price and available wind power (given storage size and its nominal power). According to the results, an increase of up to 137 % in total revenue is achievable by equipping a conventional wind turbine with a CAES system while tracking the calculated optimal storage/regeneration sequence. Additionally, by incorporating the price of different components of energy storage system, a study is conducted to find the effect of system size on maximum achievable revenue that can lead to the economical size selection of the energy storage system...|$|E
