The small gasoline reservoir for {{starting the engine}} with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier ethanol-only vehicles, was kept in {{the first generation of}} Brazilian flexible-fuel cars, mainly for users of the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below.

500|$|Flexible-fuel {{technology}} started {{being developed}} by Brazilian engineers {{near the end of}} the 1990s. The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier neat ethanol vehicles, was kept to avoid start up problems in the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below [...] An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 and allowed to eliminate the need for this secondary gas <b>reservoir</b> <b>tank.</b> Another improvement was the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start.|$|E
2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a <b>reservoir</b> <b>tank</b> to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E

2500|$|The use of clepsydrae {{to drive}} {{mechanisms}} illustrating astronomical phenomena {{began with the}} Han Dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78-139) in 117, who also employed a waterwheel. Zhang Heng {{was the first in}} China to add an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel, which solved the problem of the falling pressure head in the <b>reservoir</b> <b>tank.</b> Zhang's ingenuity led to the creation by the Tang dynasty mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) and Liang Lingzan in 725 of a clock driven by a waterwheel linkwork escapement mechanism. The same mechanism would be used by the Song dynasty polymath Su Song (1020–1101) in 1088 to power his astronomical clock tower, as well as a chain drive. Su Song's clock tower, over [...] tall, possessed a bronze power-driven armillary sphere for observations, an automatically rotating celestial globe, and five front panels with doors that permitted the viewing of changing mannequins which rang bells or gongs, and held tablets indicating the hour or other special times of the day. In the 2000s, in Beijing's Drum Tower an outflow clepsydra is operational and displayed for tourists. It is connected to automata so that every quarter-hour a small brass statue of a man claps his cymbals.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{reservoir}} engineering {{relies heavily}} on simulation models to provide a reliable prediction of the subsurface petroleum system. An ideal reservoir simulation model is one that represents the main features and behavior of a real system, but is simple enough to perform calculations in an efficient manner. [...] Using compressibility and transmissibility concepts, multiple <b>reservoir</b> <b>tanks</b> and flowing wellbores can be coupled to provide wellbore influx and inter-tank fluid transfer.

[...] A flexible system of equations was created to represent 'n' number of communicating <b>reservoir</b> <b>tanks</b> which were then solved using ordinary differential equations for the first time. [...] This work demonstrates the successful integration of aquifers, <b>reservoir</b> <b>tanks,</b> well inflow, and wellbore modeling into an integrated system that can quickly be used as a tool for investigating petroleum systems.
