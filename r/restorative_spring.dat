2500|$|A {{story of}} the [...] "Water of Life" [...] appears in the Eastern {{versions}} of the Alexander romance, which describes Alexander the Great and his servant crossing the Land of Darkness to find the <b>restorative</b> <b>spring.</b> The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of Al-Khidr, a sage who appears also in the Qur'an. Arabic and Aljamiado versions of the Alexander Romance were very popular in Spain {{during and after the}} period of Moorish rule, and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located {{at the foot of a}} mountain outside Polombe (modern Kollam) in India. Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly Gothic art, appearing for example on the ivory Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European Age of Exploration.|$|E
40|$|Performance of {{a cardiac}} assist device pumping chamber in counterpulsation was {{evaluated}} using numerical simulations of the unsteady, three-dimensional flow inside the chamber and an analytical {{model of the}} force required to eject and fill the chamber. The wall shear stress within the device was similarly computed and modeled. The analytical model was scaled to match the numerical results and then used to predict performance at physiological operating conditions. According to these models for a stroke volume of 70 ml, between 0. 4 and 1. 0 W is required for counterpulsation at a frequency of 1. 33 Hz against a <b>restorative</b> <b>spring,</b> depending on the spring constant chosen. The power and the maximum force calculated are within the ranges a trained skeletal muscle is capable of providing. Shear. stress predictions show that platelet activation {{in the absence of}} surface effects and hemolysis due to high shear are unlikely to occur with this design. Furthermore, vortices that develop in the chamber during filling are predicted to increase blood mixing and provide favorable washing of the chamber walls. A computational-analytical approach such as this may have potential to aid rapid performance evaluation of new devices and streamline the design optimization process. ...|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{examines}} {{restorative justice}} literature {{and research in}} order to assess whether the victim is indeed central in the restorative justice discourse. Looking at the origins of both restorative justice and the victimological movement, similarities can be discerned, but generally <b>restorative</b> justice did <b>spring</b> from offender-oriented movement such as communitarianism, and diversionary approaches. The relation between restorative justice and criminal justice (the latter being offender-oriented), the implementation of restorative justice within offender-oriented organizations and offender-oriented research have casted doubt on the victim centrality. Restorative justice evaluations generally show that victims are satisfied with their participation in restorative justice, voicing various reasons why they decided to participate. The flexibility of the process so it can be adapted to their needs and expectations was evaluated as important. Restoration may entail a sense of regaining control and being recognized as a victim. The complementary role between restorative justice and criminal justice can be important, with criminal justice offering a formal response and restorative justice an opportunity to voice concerns and questions. In conferencing, victims might not always feel really involved and the position of non-participating victims is a point of attention. status: publishe...|$|R
