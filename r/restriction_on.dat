40|$|<b>Restrictions</b> <b>on</b> {{travel to}} Cuba {{have been a}} key and often {{contentious}} component in U.

Several legislative initiatives have been introduced in the 109 th Congress that would ease <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> travel and remittances to Cuba. These bills would, among other things, lift overall <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> travel to Cuba, lift the overall embargo, and ease <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> exporting agricultural commodities to Cuba...|$|R

5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal {{had been}} {{fighting}} relegation in both the two previous seasons, and despite the chairman's <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> spending, Chapman nevertheless moved to Arsenal soon afterwards, attracted both by the London club's larger crowds and a salary of £2,000, double what he earned at Huddersfield Town. At Arsenal, Chapman immediately made an impact by signing 34-year-old Charlie Buchan, an England international and Sunderland's all-time record goalscorer, whom he made Arsenal captain.|$|E
5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality.

5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|By {{allowing}} u to vary {{over all}} possible integers, an infinite family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1).

This <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
40|$|We analyze several {{proposals}} to restrict CEO compensation and calibrate two models of executive compensation that describe how firms {{would react to}} different types of restrictions. We find that many restrictions would have unintended consequences. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>on</b> total realized (ex-post) payouts lead to higher average compensation, higher rewards for mediocre performance, lower risk-taking incentives, {{and the fact that}} some CEOs would be better off with a restriction than without it. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>on</b> total ex-ante pay lead to a reduction in the firm's demand for CEO talent and effort. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>on</b> particular pay components, and especially on cash payouts, can be easily circumvented.

He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> the sale of units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions.
