5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
