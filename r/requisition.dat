5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a <b>requisition,</b> broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the <b>requisition,</b> mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, {{and he could not}} see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan <b>requisition,</b> was elected.|$|E
5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it to}} her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes <b>requisition</b> the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Vizzini was the undisputed head of the Mafia in Villalba. The war provided the mafiosi with new opportunities for self-enrichment when the Italian Army requisitioned horses and mules in Sicily for the cavalry and artillery. Vizzini came to {{an agreement with the}} Army Commission to delegate the responsibilities to him. He collected a poll tax on the animals whose owners wanted to avoid <b>requisition.</b> He was also the broker for animals that were rustled for the occasion, buying at a low price from the hustlers and selling at market prices to the Army.|$|E

40|$|The Department of Energy`s (Department) {{network of}} {{management}} and operating contractors, {{as well as other}} prime contractors, procure over $ 270 million in goods and services from each other on a yearly basis by using intra-Departmental <b>requisitions.</b> The objective of the audit was to determine whether intra-Departmental <b>requisitions</b> were used appropriately. Specifically, that they were not used to (1) obtain commercially available goods and services; (2) acquire services outside the performing contractor`s mission; (3) procure the services of subcontractors; and (4) augment staffing. The audit disclosed that the Department`s prime contractors did not use intra-Departmental <b>requisitions</b> appropriately for 40 of the 104 <b>requisitions</b> reviewed. As a result, the Department did not always receive the most cost effective goods and services. For example, on two <b>requisitions</b> the Department could have saved almost $ 850, 000 out of $ 1. 6 million if the prime contractors had used normal procurement channels and competed the acquisitions. In other instances, using intra-Departmental <b>requisitions</b> resulted in multiple overhead rates being added to the cost of the goods or services procured. We recommended the Department issue criteria on the use of intra-Departmental <b>requisitions.</b> We also recommended operations offices establish policies and procedures over the use of these <b>requisitions</b> and provide a stronger emphasis on the appropriate use of intra-Departmental <b>requisitions</b> through contractor instruction and yearly reviews. Department management concurred with the finding and recommendations and agreed to initiate action on the recommendations in the report. Management comments are included in Part III of this report...|$|R

5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the <b>requisition</b> of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and laid off workers. The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of war or}} {{national}} emergency, the Naval Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to <b>requisition</b> about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament {{on the advice}} of his doctors, and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a <b>requisition</b> to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied that he could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{refrigerated}} cargo ships, World War One and other refrigerated cargo ships were used for World War Two. The s were six United Fruit passenger and refrigerated cargo liners built in 1931-33 that the United States Maritime Commission <b>requisitioned</b> in 1941-42 for the war. The six ships <b>requisitioned</b> were the: USS Antigua, , , , [...] and [...] Antigua, although <b>requisitioned,</b> was never commissioned into the Navy.|$|R
50|$|Without revenue, {{except for}} meager {{voluntary}} state <b>requisitions,</b> Congress {{could not even}} pay the interest on its outstanding debt. Meanwhile, the states regularly failed, or refused, to meet the <b>requisitions</b> requested of them by Congress.|$|R
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the War Department <b>requisitioned</b> 100 of these engines from the GWR and the GWR had to hastily reinstate some engines that had been recently withdrawn. The <b>requisitioned</b> engines were fitted with Westinghouse brakes and 10 were fitted with pannier tanks and condensing gear. All were painted black with their WD numbers painted on. In December 1940, the War Department <b>requisitioned</b> a further 8 engines.|$|R
5|$|The Inclosure Act {{separated}} Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton and Sheriff Hill (collectively High Fell) plus Low Fell. Commissioners {{were appointed}} to settle claims in land and to apportion Gateshead Fell accordingly. Plans were laid for the <b>requisition</b> {{and construction of}} wells (including Carter's Well; located on Durham Road and accompanied today by a commemorative Gateshead blue plaque), quarries, drains, roads, watering places and other essential requirements. Progress was slow, with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822, {{but by the time}} of completion, Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively consigned to history. The divisions of Gateshead Fell have remained more or less settled, so that the villages created by enclosure have survived, almost entirely intact, to the present day.|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} <b>requisition</b> promised to the legions, Germanicus paid {{them out of}} his own pocket. All 8 legions were given money, even if they didn't demand it. Both the armies of the Lower and Upper Rhine had {{returned}} to order. It seemed prudent to satisfy the armies, but Germanicus took it a step further. In a bid to secure the loyalty of his troops, he led them on a raid against the Marsi, a Germanic people on the upper Ruhr river. Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory. On the way back to their winter quarters at Castra Vetera, they pushed successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes) between the Marsi and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|With the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War II, Wendover Field took on greater importance. It was the Army Air Force's largest bombing and gunnery range. On March 1942 the Army Air Force activated Wendover Army Air Field and also assigned the research and development of guided missiles, pilotless aircraft, and remotely controlled bombs to the site. The new base was supplied and serviced by the Ogden Air Depot at Hill Field. In April 1942, the Wendover Sub-Depot was activated and assumed technical and administrative control of the field, under the Ogden Air Depot. The Wendover Sub-Depot was tasked to <b>requisition,</b> store, and issue all Army Air Forces property for organizations stationed at Wendover Field for training.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, Elisabethville was <b>requisitioned</b> by the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) {{for use as}} a troopship. She briefly {{returned}} to merchant service in 1946 before being <b>requisitioned</b> again in 1947 for further troopship duties, and rechristened the Empire Bure.|$|R
5|$|In September 1999, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. In January 1999, Braathens applied to register twenty of its Norwegian aircraft in Sweden, following their discovery that foreign-registered aircraft, such as Color Air's and SAS', did not have to pay value added tax on good sold on board. This was rejected by the Norwegian Armed Forces, who based their need of transport of military personnel during wartime on <b>requisition</b> of civilian, Norwegian-registered aircraft. The same month, Geir Olsen, head of Braathens in Sweden, withdrew from his position, due to disagreements about the corporate strategy.|$|E
5|$|Senior officer Mark (Robin Clarke) radios Sandy – his romantic {{interest}} – {{from the}} Operations Room to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary (Steven Grives) depart to <b>requisition</b> chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls his flesh. Preparing {{for a final}} confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn, mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as the mother blasts through the Operations Room door and destroys all the equipment inside, although {{it is evident that}} she no longer possesses unnatural strength. Crippled by an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to discover one of the twins biting at her slit neck, before its sibling launches itself at him.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's {{strategy}} of {{withdrawing from the}} occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply <b>requisition,</b> as summer was at an end {{and there was a}} decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan {{had little choice but to}} respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, while of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} 215 {{trawlers}} of no specific class These were commercial trawlers {{taken over by}} the Admiralty.

5|$|Asad was {{replaced}} by Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami (727–730). The new governor at first continued Asad's policy of conciliation, but then reversed it, leading to the outbreak of a full-scale rebellion in Transoxiana, which, coupled with renewed Turgesh attacks, reduced the Arab presence there to Samarkand and its environs. Ashras was able to recover Bukhara, but his successor, Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri, presided over the disaster of the Battle of the Defile, which crippled the Khurasani army, in 731. By the time of Junayd's death in 734, the Muslim holdings in Transoxiana {{had been reduced to}} Bukhara and parts of Tokharistan. These military defeats, the long-held grievances against the Umayyad government, and the forcible <b>requisition</b> of food by Junayd during the famine of 733 led to the outbreak of a rebellion in early 734, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Harith's uprising involved both Arabs and native princes, especially from the hitherto loyal principalities of Tokharistan, and spread quickly, with the rebels capturing Balkh. The new governor, Asim ibn Abdallah al-Hilali, managed to check Harith's advance on the capital, Marw, and forced him to seek terms. Asim's position remained precarious, however, and he wrote to the Caliph, asking for the placement of Khurasan once again under the purview of Iraq, the appointment of a new governor and the substantial reinforcement of the province with Syrian troops. Hisham accepted the recommendations, and instructed Khalid al-Qasri to send Asad once again as governor to Khurasan. Early in 735, Harith renewed his rebellion. This time, whether due to pressure from local sympathizers in Marw or as an expedient way to gain time for Asad to arrive, Asim agreed to a truce with Harith, promising also to support Harith's demands against the Caliph.|$|E
25|$|Kalinin would {{emphasize}} his own peasant background {{when speaking}} to rural audiences, calling village meetings and inquiring about <b>requisition</b> payments and land redistribution — sensitive matters {{of great concern}} to the poor farming– population.
