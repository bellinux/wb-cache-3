40|$|In this paper, we {{revisit the}} design of Raptor codes for binary input {{additive}} white Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) channels, where {{we are interested in}} very low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). A linear programming degree distribution optimization problem is defined for Raptor codes in the low SNR regime through several approximations. We also provide an exact expression for the polynomial representation of the degree distribution with infinite maximum degree in the low SNR regime, which enables us to calculate the exact value of the fractions of output nodes of small degrees. A more practical degree distribution design is also proposed for Raptor codes in the low SNR regime, where we include the <b>rate</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the decoding complexity in the optimization problem, and an upper bound on the maximum <b>rate</b> <b>efficiency</b> is derived for given design parameters.

40|$|Abstract—Overall {{equipment}} efficiency (OEE) {{is widely}} adopted in semiconductor manufacturing {{to assess and}} enhance equipment productivity. The <b>rate</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which is {{a major component of}} OEE, is utilized to evaluate the achievement of actual production rate to the equipment’s theoretical production rate. However, the <b>rate</b> <b>efficiency</b> is significantly influenced by factors beyond the equipment and, therefore, is inadequate for deciding whether a low production rate is due to the equipment itself. Such an inaccurate evaluation of production rate of equipment usually results in productivity loss. Hence, this study develops a novel metric, called running efficiency (RUNE), to compare the actual and theoretical production rates of the equipment. The RUNE is not affected by the production environment and can be employed to determine sources of equipment’s variation. Additionally, a RUNE management procedure is also proposed. The management procedure incorporates an automatic target-setting scheme to set the theoretical production time of every motion in equipment to obtain the RUNE value of equipment. An exponentially weighted moving average control chart is then utilized in the management procedure to monitor the RUNE value of equipment. A real case from a 300 -mm fabrication in Taiwan is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We analyze the effect of these design choices on the energy consumption and <b>rate</b> <b>efficiency.</b> We use a method of energy quanta for computing the energy consumption. We find that for both cases, the optimal operation is non-coordinated and with no power control. Sources should send at their maximum power and not pay attention to neighboring nodes.

40|$|When calculating {{emissions}} from point sources, inventory preparers multiply activity values by {{the highest quality}} emission factors available. If control devices are used to reduce emissions the emission estimate is reduced by the control efficiency. In reviewing the results of modeling of inventory data during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s EPA observed that to get atmospheric models to work properly they had to increase the emissions inputs. This implied that inventory preparers were underestimating emissions. EPA reasoned that the most likely cause was the assumption by inventory preparers that control devices operate at their <b>rated</b> <b>efficiency</b> all the time. Real world experience shows that control devices malfunction and sometimes go down, which would boost actual emissions significantly above traditionally calculated emissions estimates. To address the problem EPA developed guidance that was intended to correct the underestimates. Existing EPA guidance requires that to account for control device malfunctions and down times inventory preparers should assume that control devices work at <b>rated</b> <b>efficiency</b> only 80 % of the time. For processes controlled by high efficiency devices, such as baghouses, assuming that process were operating uncontrolled 20 % of the time resulted in greatly increasing estimates. Worse, the guidance was written ambiguously and was interpreted in several ways. This resulted in inconsistent application between the EPA Regions and even within the same Region.

40|$|One of the {{legislative}} regulations aiming at reduced energy consumption in the European Union, is (EC) 640 / 2009 that imposes requirements of the efficiency of electric motors sold in the Union. This study aimed at examining {{the effectiveness of these}} legislative requirements. To illustrate the opportunities of reducing energy consumption by the introduction of more efficient motors, an efficiency measurement of electric motors that drive the fuel feed system in a cogeneration plant in Nybro was intended to be carried out. This was to enable a comparison between the efficiency of existing motors with motors which comply with the efficiency levels in (EC) 640 / 2009 and to calculate how much the energy consumption would decrease in this energy system if more efficient motors were introduced. The planed measurements could not be carried out to give a reliable result because the plant suffer from the same problem as many other industries in the EU, which is that the motors in this energy system are oversized and operate at low loads. Oversized motors do not operate at their <b>rated</b> <b>efficiency</b> and therefore a comparison of existing motors and motors that comply with the efficiency requirements in (EC) 640 / 2009 fails to give a correct result, since they would not operate at their <b>rated</b> <b>efficiency</b> if they were installed in this energy system due to the efficiency drop at low loads. Instead the load factor was determined with the Input Power Estimation Method that showed that all motors were operated far below their rated power, thus making this an inefficient energy system. This is a common problem, and an impediment for the directive to achieve its full potential energy savings because the efficiency of motors drops substantially if they are operated below their rated power. The results show that guidelines to avoid motor misapplications {{is just as important as}} raising the efficiency of electric motors.
