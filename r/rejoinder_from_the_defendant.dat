5000|$|In {{its final}} {{form in the}} 19th century, common law {{pleading}} was terribly complex and slow by modern standards. The parties would normally go through several rounds of pleadings before the parties were deemed to have clearly stated their controversy, so that the case was [...] "at issue" [...] and could proceed to trial. A case would begin with a complaint in which the plaintiff alleged the facts entitling him to relief, then the defendant would file any one {{of a variety of}} pleas as an answer, followed by a replication from the plaintiff, a <b>rejoinder</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> a surrejoinder from the plaintiff, a rebutter from the defendant, and a surrebutter from the plaintiff. At each stage, a party could file a demurrer to the other's pleading (essentially a request that the court immediately rule on whether the pleading was legally adequate before they had to file a pleading in response) or simply file another pleading in response.|$|E

25|$|Deliberate {{elicitation}} {{is defined}} as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely to produce incriminating information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> through <b>the</b> use of undercover agents or paid informants.|$|R

50|$|Rei vindicatio is a {{legal action}} by which the {{plaintiff}} demands that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff.

In the end, Pigou's last assessment of Keynes's contribution to economic theory is retrieved, comparing it to his initial impressions on the advance of Keynesianism in the academic world. ...|$|R
