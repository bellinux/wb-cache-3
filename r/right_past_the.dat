25|$|Santiago Creek {{rises in}} the Cleveland National Forest, between Santiago Peak and Modjeska Peak, which {{together}} form the prominent Saddleback of the Santa Ana Mountains. The creek runs south-southwest toward Portola Hills before turning northwest. Once out of the national forest it passes through the town of Modjeska and meets the first major tributary, Harding Canyon Creek, from the right. Downstream, it receives Baker and Silverado creeks, both from the <b>right.</b> <b>Past</b> <b>the</b> first Santiago Canyon Road crossing, the gorge widens to a broad alluvial plain, where the valley walls pull away and decrease in height. The creek's perennial surface flows are limited to this upper stretch; below here the water flows underground except during the wet season of winter and early spring.|$|E
25|$|Neptune Beach's {{two huge}} outdoor pools hosted {{swimming}} races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian Johnny Weissmuller, who later starred {{as the original}} Tarzan, and Jack LaLanne, who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the Great Depression, {{the completion of the}} San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran <b>right</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> entrance to Neptune Beach {{on the way to the}} Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.|$|E

The difficulty of the songs was also warmly received, with reviews noting that Metallica's songs can [...] " [...] really well to a plastic guitar", and that [...] "the songs here are a treat on any skill level". However, the game still provides a difficult challenge for experienced players, {{and the introduction of}} the Expert+ difficulty for drums and the Drum Over mode were seen as good additions. Reviews commented favorably on the new career progression, noting that one can complete the career mode without having to play [...] "Metallica’s earliest, shreddiest, most brutal stuff", and allows the player to [...] "skip <b>right</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> early stuff and quickly get to the big tracks".|$|E
2500|$|Matthew Michael Carnahan was {{inspired}} to write the script when, while channel surfing {{trying to find a}} USC Trojans football game, he saw a news report about a Humvee that had flipped into an Iraqi river, drowning about five U.S. soldiers. Carnahan considered it an awful way to die, and [...] "couldn’t get past it fast enough", considering he was too indifferent, [...] "talking so much and not doing a damn thing", and [...] "the same hypocrite that I so can’t stand in our country, the kind of people that will flip <b>right</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> news to get to Access Hollywood". He first considered turning it into a stage play, but the military scenes, in particular the helicopter ones, made him turn it into a film screenplay.

He went <b>right</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> door, and then, {{with his hands in}} his pockets and making an infantile attempt to whistle, strolled right along beyond the end of the wall. There he recalls a number of mean dirty shops, and particularly that of a plumber and decorator with a dusty disorder of earthenware pipes, sheet lead, ball taps, pattern books of wall paper, and tins of enamel. He stood pretending to examine these things, and coveting, passionately desiring, the green door.|$|E

60|$|It may, perhaps, {{be remembered}} that, after his quarrel with Umslopogaas, Alphonse {{had gone off}} in an {{exceedingly}} ill temper to sulk over his scratches. Well, it appears that he walked <b>right</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Temple to the Sun, down the wide road on the further side of the slope it crowns, and thence on into the beautiful park, or pleasure gardens, which are laid out just beyond the outer wall. After wandering about there for a little he started to return, but was met near the outer gate by Sorais' train of chariots, which were galloping furiously along the great northern road. When she caught sight of Alphonse, Sorais halted her train and called to him. On approaching he was instantly seized and dragged {{into one of the}} chariots and carried off, 'crying out loudly', as our informant said, and as from my general knowledge of him I can well believe.|$|E
60|$|Came a straggling volley again, {{like a man}} {{running a}} metal hammer very rapidly along iron corrugations, and this time people were {{dropping}} all over the road. One white-faced man not a score of yards away fell with a curse and a sob, struggled up, staggered for some yards with blood running abundantly from his neck, and fell and never stirred again. Another went down upon his back clumsily in the roadway and lay wringing his hands faster and faster until suddenly with a movement like a sigh they dropped inert by his side. A straw-hatted youth in a flannel suit ran and stopped and ran again. He seemed to be holding something red and strange to his face with both hands; above them his eyes were round and anxious. Blood came out between his fingers. He went <b>right</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> hotel and stumbled and suddenly sprawled headlong at the opposite corner. The majority of the crowd had already vanished into doorways and side streets. But there was still shouting {{and there was still}} a remnant of amazed and angry men in the roadway--and one or two angry women. They were not fighting. Indeed they were unarmed, but if they had had weapons now they would certainly have used them.|$|E
