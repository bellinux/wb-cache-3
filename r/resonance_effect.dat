5|$|Ground-based telescopes in California, Hawaii, the Canary Islands, Arizona, and Texas, {{as well as}} the Spitzer Space Telescope, {{were used}} to conduct these {{follow-up}} observations and verify Kepler-11b's existence. In particular, the detection of an orbital <b>resonance</b> <b>effect</b> between Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c confirmed the find. Kepler-11b's discovery was announced to the public on February 2, 2011. It is part of the first system discovered with more than three transiting planets, and is also part of the most compact and flat system yet discovered. Kepler-11's planetary system is the second known system to have multiple transiting planets, surpassing the three confirmed planets (two transiting) orbiting the star Kepler-9.|$|E
25|$|However, {{only certain}} types of {{structures}} are vulnerable to this <b>resonance</b> <b>effect.</b> Taller buildings have their own frequencies of vibration. Those that are six to fifteen stories tall also vibrate at the 2.5-second cycle, making them act like tuning forks {{in the event of}} an earthquake. The low-frequency waves of an earthquake are amplified by the mud of the lakebed, which in turn, is amplified by the building itself. This causes these buildings to shake more violently than the earthquake proper as the earthquake progresses. Many of the older colonial buildings have survived hundreds of years on the lakebed simply because they are not tall enough to be affected by the <b>resonance</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

However, {{it is common}} to distinguish between the inductive effect and the <b>resonance</b> <b>effect,</b> which might be described as σ- and π-electronegativities, respectively. There are a number of linear free-energy relationships that have been used to quantify these effects, of which the Hammett equation is the best known.

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{stepping}} stick-slip motor, all these motors {{work on the}} same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the <b>resonance</b> <b>effect,</b> a much lower voltage {{can be used to}} produce a high vibration amplitude.|$|E
500|$|A basic {{component}} of waveguide filters is the cavity resonator. [...] This {{consists of a}} short length of waveguide blocked at both ends. [...] Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected {{back and forth between}} the two ends. [...] A given geometry of cavity will resonate at a characteristic frequency. [...] The <b>resonance</b> <b>effect</b> can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies. [...] Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure. [...] However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal. [...] A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter.|$|E
500|$|Kepler-11c's name {{is divided}} into two parts: it is named for Kepler-11, the star around which it orbits. As planets with discoveries that are {{announced}} at the same time are sorted by distance, Kepler-11c's [...] "c" [...] is because it was the second-closest planet from its host star at the time of discovery (Kepler-11b is the closest). Kepler-11, the host star, was named for the Kepler satellite, a NASA telescope that searches for terrestrial planets by measuring small fluctuations in the light of stars that occurs when celestial bodies transit, or cross in front of, the star with respect to Earth. Kepler-11 was flagged as home to a potential transit event by the satellite, and was given the designation KOI-157. After further observations, Kepler-11c's existence was confirmed by the observation of an orbital <b>resonance</b> <b>effect</b> between Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c. Along with the other five planets in orbit around Kepler-11, Kepler-11c was announced on February 2, 2011 at a press conference. Its findings were published on February 3 in the journal Nature. The Kepler-11 system is the first known to host more than three transiting planets.|$|E

2500|$|Conjugation {{increases}} the allylic strain because it forces substituents into a configuration that causes their atoms {{to be in}} closer proximity, increasing the strength of repulsive Van der Waals forces. [...] This situation occurs most noticeably when carboxylic acid or ketone is involved as a substituent of the allylic group. [...] <b>Resonance</b> <b>effect</b> on the carboxylic group shifts the CO double bond to a hydroxy group. [...] The carboxylic group will thus function as a hydroxyl group that will cause a large allylic strain to form and cancel the stabilization effects of the extended conjugation.

2500|$|To a {{conventionally}} composed Roman glass flux 330 {{parts per}} million of silver and 40 of gold were added: [...] "These particles were precipitated as colloids and form a silver-gold alloy. [...] When viewed in reflected light the minute metallic particles are just coarse enough to reflect enough of the light without eliminating the transmission. [...] In transmitted light the fine particles scatter the blue {{end of the spectrum}} more effectively than the red end, resulting in red transmission, and this is the colour observed. [...] Since it is impossible that the Roman artisans managed to add these incredibly low levels of silver and gold to the volume of the glass used to make the vessel deliberately, the levels were probably added at higher levels to a larger volume of glass-melt, and increasingly diluted by adding more glass." [...] The particles are only about 70 nanometers across, and embedded in the glass, so they cannot be seen by optical microscopy, and a transmission electron microscope is needed instead. [...] At this size they approach the size of the wavelengths of visible light, and a surface plasmon <b>resonance</b> <b>effect</b> takes place.|$|E

40|$|The {{non linear}} {{interaction}} between an intense laser radiation and atoms leads to ionization through {{the absorption of}} N photons from the laser radiation via laser-induced virtual states. The multiphoton ionization rate varies {{as a function of}} the laser intensity I as IN. We discuss the two most important effects which govern multiphoton ionization processes : <b>resonance</b> <b>effects</b> and laser-coherence effects. In a moderate laser intensity range (107 - 109 W cm- 2) corresponding to the two, three or four-photon ionization of atoms, <b>resonance</b> <b>effects</b> play a dominant role while the photon statistics of the laser radiation are relatively unimportant. On the contrary, in the very high intensity range (1012 - 1013 W cm- 2) required to observe large Nth - order ionization processes, coherence effects play a dominant role through N! enhancement in the N-photon ionization rate, while <b>resonance</b> <b>effects</b> are completely damped due to the high laser intensity.
