40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to analize a {{measuring}} system for the Ljubljana-Brod water supply system that would provide data about operation, fire safety, and head losses in the system. Problems associated with <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> and procedures used to find water-pipe leakage with acoustic instrumentation is also described. Uncertainty of measurement, defined by the interval of values, within the true value of data has been calculated in accordance with the ISO- 5168 standard, which defines the procedures for the evaluation of uncertainties in measurement of fluid flow. The basic principles of operation with pressure and flow instruments used in the maintenance of the water supply system by the public company VO- KA are also described in the project. Measurement of pressure was made at six points in the system, while measurement of flow was made at three points in the system. The results of the measurement showed the large sensitivity of flow meters in relation to input data that caused a measurement failure. Measurements of flow were made successfully and confirmed the predicted results. In conclusion, some proposals for improvement of the measuring system and <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> are given...|$|R

50|$|A {{portion of}} the {{clarified}} effluent water leaving the DAF tank is pumped into a small pressure vessel (called the air drum) into which compressed air is also introduced. This results in saturating the pressurized effluent water with air. The air-saturated water stream is recycled {{to the front of}} the float tank and flows through a pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> just as it enters the front of the float tank, which results in the air being released in the form of tiny bubbles. Bubbles form at nucleation sites on the surface of the suspended particles, adhering to the particles. As more bubbles form, the lift from the bubbles eventually overcomes the force of gravity. This causes the suspended matter to float to the surface where it forms a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the DAF unit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{decrease}} of the hydric losses with {{the reduction of}} the operation pressures of the distribution nets is a phenomenon a long time known for the sanitation and water distribution companies. Among the used techniques for this purpose, the division in sectors technique comes, now, as one of the more effective instruments of improvement and optimization of the supplying services. The wide diffusion of this technique, however, would not be possible without the technological evolution of the key elements, necessary to carry out this control method of urban hydric supplying. In this work are presented solutions implemented by the Basic Sanitation Company of the State of São Paulo which has been carried out for more than five years. This time allowed that the techniques and the methods presented reach the necessary maturation degree so that a functional and each more reliable model of the division in sectors technique would be established.

50|$|Eldred's {{company was}} called Breathing Appliances Pty Ltd and located at 70 Abbotsford St., North Melbourne. His {{marketing}} {{was done by}} his friend Bob Wallace-Mitchell. It was difficult for Wallace-Mitchell to market in those early days, as compressed air was not readily available. His first task was to locate a compressor with a sales point {{in each of the}} Australian capital cities. Once this was done, dealers could stock his SCUBA and refill the cylinders. In 1954 Eldred also created the Porpoise Universal, which had a high supply rate of over 300 liters per minute. The Universal used the same demand valve and was modular in design. The <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> was a balanced diaphragm type, which was modified to become a piston type. It became his flagship model. Eldred also made a cheaper model, called the Sportsman. The Sportsman was a very compact regulator with innovative features now found on regulators of today. It was made of plastic and had an unbalanced first stage. Market needs made this model necessary, but Eldred did not like it.|$|E
50|$|The French-designed {{open circuit}} SCUBA, called the Aqua Lung, was {{protected}} by US patent and international patents, so Eldred set about designing the Porpoise CA (a prototype), the world's first single hose regulator. Eldred referred to the French model as the Gagnan Aqua Lung, as designer Émile Gagnan was the Frenchman who actually designed the device for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. This new design was superior to the Aqua Lung, and did not violate any of the existing patents. Eldred's regulator was never patented as his business was {{too small for the}} expense. The first production model was designated the CA-1. (C A for compressed Air, 1 for single cylinder) He began using an oxygen welding <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> for his prototype. His chief design effort was developing the demand valve which people now call the second stage. It was sold as a complete single cylinder, single hose SCUBA early in 1952. The cylinder was inverted so the diver could reach the innovative regulator mounted reserve. Only about a dozen of these exist and are {{now in the hands of}} SCUBA collectors. Eldred also made the CA-2, which was a double cylinder model. Only two CA-2 Porpoises are still known to exist. About three quarters of the Porpoises made were surface supplied 'hookah' units. The 'hookah' was the device which started the demise of the standard dress helmet diving equipment. The Porpoise single hose SCUBA found its initial international praise in Arthur C. Clarke's 1955 book Coast of Coral. Clarke brought two French Mistrals to Australia, but set them aside when he was loaned two Porpoises for his Australian adventure by Eldred. They are illustrated in Clarke's book.|$|E
40|$|Leakage is {{frequently}} observed within water distribution systems, due to ageing of pipes and incorrect assembling of joints.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of water distribution networks {{has to take}} into account the variability of users’ water demand and the variability of network boundary conditions. In complex systems, e. g. those characterized by the presence of local private tanks and intermittent distribution, this variability suggests the use of dynamic models that are able to evaluate the rapid variability of pressures and flows in the network. The dynamic behavior of the network also affects the performance of valves that are used for controlling the network. Pressure <b>Reduction</b> <b>Valves</b> (PRVs) are used for controlling pressure and reducing leakages. Highly variable demands can produce significant fluctuation of the PRV set point, causing related transient phenomena that propagate through the network and may result in water quality problems, unequal distribution of resources among users, and premature wear of the pipe infrastructure. A model was developed in previous studies and an additional module for pressure control was implemented able to analyze PRVs in a fully dynamic numerical framework. The model was demonstrated to be robust and reliable in the implementation of pressure management areas in the network. The model was applied to a district of the Palermo network (Italy).

40|$|Complex {{systems of}} water {{distribution}} networks (WDS) {{are used to}} supply water to users. WDSs are systems {{where a lot of}} distributed energy is available. Historically, this energy is artificially dissipated by pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> (PRVs), thanks to which water utilities manage the pressure level in selected nodes of the network. The present study explores the use of economic hydraulic machines, pumps as turbines (PATs) to produce energy in a small network located in a town close to Palermo (Italy). The main idea is to avoid dissipation in favor of renewable energy production. The proposed study is applied to a WDN typical of the Mediterranean countries, where the users, to collect water during the period of water scarcity conditions, install private tanks. The presence of private tanks deeply modifies the network from its designed condition. In the proposed analysis, the economic benefit of PATs application in water distribution networks has been investigated, accounting for the presence of users’ private tanks. The analysis, carried out by mean of a mathematical model able to dynamically simulate the water distribution network with PATs, shows the advantage of their installation in terms of renewable energy recovery, even though the energy production of PATs is strictly conditioned by their installation position...|$|R

There are other limitations beyond the second law analysis mainly quality in turbine exit, a technological one, pay-back, an economical one and, operation time. Pressure and temperature in the steam main and saturated or superheated condition is other limitation. Several plots including various scenarios show the conditions where the alternative is or not a good choice. Key words: second law analysis, backpressure turbine, pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve.</b> Study Premises Thermodynamics indicators can be used for identify opportunities of engineering actions. But there are some risks if ones don’t use them with care. The second law analysts always suggests an opportunity to put a turbine where there is a pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> for steam, because an expansion in a valve is irreversible and lost exergy or potential work, but there are others parameters that must be considered.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the technical and economic feasibility of supplying recharge points for Electric Vehicles converting water pressure in excess into electric energy from a water distribution network. A real water distribution network was analyzed, by designing a power station consisting of three components: a Pump-as-Turbine, an ad hoc generator, and a control system. The last one controls the flow rate trend at the inlet of the Pump-as-Turbine to regulate the rotational speed corresponding to the optimal range of efficiency. Energy produced permits to supply a recharging point for Electric Vehicles on site with the aim to convert water pressure generally dissipated and, consequently, lost into a renewable energy and to reduce power grid congestion. The economic analysis confirms the convenience of the proposed power station, and overall, a comparable cost with pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> devices normally adopted to control pressure pattern and leakages of a water distribution network.|$|E
40|$|Water loss is a {{phenomenon}} frequently observed within water distribution systems (WDSs), that is considerably worsened by an excessive pressure throughout the network. As an alternative option to pipe replacement, the use of pumps working as turbines, throttle control valves (TCVs), or pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> (PRVs) {{can be used to}} reduce leakage. For a preassigned number of these devices, their positions and settings can be chosen to minimize the water losses in the network or to minimise the costs associated with the leakage. On the other hand, for a preassigned reduction in leakage, the number, the position and the setting of valves could be optimized in order to minimize their installation and maintenance costs. Based on these observations, a procedure for the optimal choice of the number, position and setting of PRVs is devised. The procedure is aimed at reducing the whole cost associated with water loss in urban WDSs, due to the background leakage from joints, and the purchase, installation and maintaining of the PRVs themselves.

Those due to water meter under-registration were evaluated {{by means of a}} mathematical model able to analyse the complexity of intermittent supply systems with private tanks. This supply scheme is very common in the Mediterranean area where unexpected water shortage often happens and intermittent water supply is a common practice. In order to analyse such complex systems, a demand model, reproducing the effect of private tanks, and an apparent losses module were developed and coupled with an hydraulic network model based on the Global Gradient Algorithm (GGA). In distribution networks pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> (PRVs) are often used by water utilities to control the pressure and reduce background losses. These practices could influence the performance of water meters. For this reason, a PRV model was implemented and integrated with the demand and the hydraulic network models to better estimate the effect of pressure management on real and apparent losses. The comprehensive model was applied to a real case study. The proposed modelling approach was used to identify regions of the network with high apparent losses. Furthermore, the model may be used to predict the results of a water meter replacement plan and of the installation of devices that could affect apparent losses. © IWA Publishing 2013...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous {{hydrogen}} {{is one of}} several alternatives to fossil-based vehicle fuels. In order to establish hydrogen as a good alternative, it is necessary to implement hydrogen refueling stations that can compete with conventional refueling stations. That is, the hydrogen refueling stations must be able to meet the customer's demands and expectations. The Society of Automotive Engineers has therefore developed a protocol that provides performance requirements for gaseous hydrogen refueling stations. These requirements include average pressure ramp rates (APRR) which describe the desired pressure rise in the vehicle tank along with precooling temperatures of the hydrogen prior to entering the vehicle. The precooling is necessary due to two phenomena occurring during refueling: 1) reverse Joule-Thomson effect, and 2) heat of compression. In this thesis, a simple dynamic model of a hydrogen refueling station with a direct compression design has been developed and implemented in MATLAB. The direct compression design consists of two parallel process lines where one contains a <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> and the other a compressor. The pressure difference between the station and the vehicle decides which process line is utilized during the refueling. In order to comply with the precooling temperature set by the protocol, a heat exchanger has to be included after the compressor and <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> but prior to the nozzle connected to the vehicle. A production section where {{hydrogen is}} produced from electrolysis of water has also been included in the model. Two pressure controllers have been implemented; one for each process line. These controllers are of the PI type and control the pressure rise in the vehicle tank. Various conditions such as different initial vehicle tank pressures, ambient temperatures and APRRs have been tested. These conditions were all handled well by the model. Additionally, the implemented controllers were able to track the APRR tightly under all the various conditions. The waste heat generated in different components at the station was quantified to see whether an absorption refrigeration process can be utilized for cooling the hydrogen prior to the vehicle tank. In total, four different cases for making the absorption refrigeration process workable were considered. However, the process is only achievable in one of the cases for an ambient temperature of 15 degrees C and presumably below...|$|E

The pressurized water systems have increased water efficiency since their implantation, but they also increased the consumed energy and therefore, the greenhouse gasses emissions. The present manuscript develops the proposal of the sustainable indicators that were selected through deep review. These indicators are related to social-cultural, economic, and environmental criteria. Furthermore as novelty, they were described and applied on a pressurized water network, complementing the energy indexes usually used in the energy audit. To reach {{the improvement of the}} sustainability in water systems, new strategies should be developed to improve all sustainability criteria, included the water and energy efficiency. These strategies were developed and analyzed by using of specific hydraulic software (i. e., EPANET) and they were based on operation rules to estimate the hydraulic values (pressure and flow). The operation and the regulation strategies were applied on a particular case study, in which, the energy saving was 12. 26 %, the cost saving was 15. 54 %, the reduction of energy footprint of water was 15. 04 %, and the decrease of GHG was 12. 26 % although the increase of the distributed volume was 9. 07 %.

The cell is connected to a high pressure methane tank using a pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> and a flow meter while being operated in open mode as to allow constant pressure supply of gas {{for the duration of}} the experiment. Experiments were ran at 6, 7 and 8 ˚C and at stirring rates from 225 to 800 rpm. 50 ml of distilled water was used for all of the experiments.

The start of each experiment is indicated by a rapid increase of temperature and gas consumption, and the end by the rotor blade either getting stuck in the hydrates, or reaching a constant power consumption due to pushing the hydrates aside. The growth period could be divided into three different growth stages, stage 1 representing the initial growth phase, stage 2 the mid-section and stage 3 the final section.

40|$|Water loss is {{an issue}} that affect Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) very often, {{especially}} when aged and high pressure occurs. Pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> (PRVs) can be used as devices to reduce as much as possible the water losses within the network. Indeed, for a given number of PRVs, the daily volume of water lost from the network can be reduced minimizing the pressure through a proper choice of valve positions as well as their settings. In this paper, a methodology for the optimal number, positioning and setting of PRVs is presented. In the proposed methodology, a genetic algorithm is coupled with a physical modelling of leakage from joints and a simplified and yet realistic hydraulic simulation of the WDS. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using two WDSs examples. Comparisons with a more extreme and complicated hydraulic modelling, already proposed by authors in previous work, are also performed in the first case study in order to validate the proposed methodology. These comparisons demonstrate that the methodology proposed in this work performs fairly well when compared to similar approach that uses a more sophisticated hydraulic model.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{implement}} and test a semi-active damping system based on a concept from an earlier thesis. The project includes implementation of mechanical, hydraulic and electronic hardware, aswell as controller software. The idea is to measure {{the movements of the}} vehicle chassis and based on these measurements set the damping torque using hydraulics. To be able to develop, test and evaluate the system, realistic input data must be available. To acquire such data, driving trials have been conducted on a variety of tracks. The first part of the system is the sensors that measure chassis movements. Both accelerometers and a gyro has been used. To remove drift and high frequency vibrations, the signals are filtered. The suggested controller from the earlier thesis requests damping torque based on the dampers vertical velocity. When accelerometer signals are integrated, measurement and rounding errors causes drift in the velocity. To compensate for this, a floating average is calculated and used. The main hydraulic component is a pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> that controls the pressure inside the damper. Higher pressure will give higher damping torque. The reaction speed of the system is mostly depending on the hydraulic components. It is important to know the time delay from a change in the valve control signal, to when the actual pressure in the damper has been reached. Tests have shown that a large step, going from 10 Bar to 60 Bar takes approximately 46 ms, and that a small step from 1 Bar to 20 Bar takes 63 ms. The valve is faster when higher pressure levels are requested. In addition to the hydraulic response time the delay through the signal filters, measured to about 14 ms, must be added. The sensors are affected by vibrations. If these can be reduced, the digital filters can be made less sharp with a lower filter delay as result. It is also important to have a good control computer so that large rounding errors in the filter calculations can be avoided. This would greatly decrease drift in the integrated velocity...|$|E
40|$|The thesis firstly {{includes}} {{a study of}} the structure and requirements of a general ballast system. Based on this knowledge a ballast system suiting the needs of the WindFlip concept was designed through using the risk-based design methodology (RBD). The presented ballast system has one sub-system for ballasting during rotation of WindFlip from horizontal to vertical position and back again (called main ballast system). Another sub-system (called the secondary ballast system) is used during transit without payload and during onloading of payload (one Hywind floating offshore wind turbine). The latter system is connected to an eductor circuit for stripping the ballast tanks. The main ballast system ballasts by flooding the ballast tanks. The tank is ventilated so it can flood freely, ventilation is closed when the tank is completely full. As WindFlip does not have a pressure hull, pressure is increased in empty ballast tanks when being submerged to compensate for increased hydrostatic pressure. During deballasting ventilation is used to relieve pressure gradually. Water in the ballast tanks is purged out by compressed air. The main ballast system has two main pipelines which are branched into feeder lines going into each tank. There are two valves connected to the feeder line leading into each tank; a butterfly valve and a pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> (PRV). The butterfly valve is used for ventilation and the PRV for the compressed air. The function of the two main lines may be switched (from vent to compressed air and vice versa), and there is an interconnection between the two also securing redundancy. The main ballast system reaches out to 102 ballast tanks. The secondary ballast system reaches out to 27 ballast tanks. The layout of this system is quite similar to common ballast systems. The main difference is that it only has one ballast pump, which is allowed for unmanned barges according to DNV. An eductor system is included in the secondary ballast system for stripping the ballast tanks. This system may however not be mandatory, this should be discussed further with the classing society. A ballast treatment plant is not included in the design as WindFlip mostly will operate locally. There is however a possibility for conducting ballast exchange with the sequential method during continental travel. A Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) was performed in order to find the unreliability of the system. The most interesting result was that a failure during rotation is expected once every third year. The FTA was compared to the use of Bayesian networks (BN). The report shows that BN can replace the FTA and that BN is a more flexible method. </p...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThe {{relation}} between mass transfer, energy transfer and growth rates has been examined during methane hydrate formation in stirred cell reactors. This {{was done to}} improve understanding rate determining factors during hydrate formation and growth. In stirred cell reactor heat transfer and heat transfer rates will be functions of stirring rate and through boundary layers at the wall. The heat transfer rate is also function of temperature gradients. Experiments have thus been conducted at three different stirring rates and temperatures levels to evaluate the effect of stirring and temperature gradients on heat transfer. Experiments have been conducted using two different cell setups, a smaller cell having a volume of 141. 4 ml and with inner diameter of 60 mm, outer diameter of 90 mm and a height of 50 mm, and a larger cell having a volume of 318. 1 ml and with an inner diameter of 90 mm, outer diameter of 120 mm and a height of 50 mm. The cell systems were connected to a high pressure methane reservoir via a pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valve</b> and a flow meter and operated in an open mode to maintain constant pressure throughout the experiments. In the smaller cell hydrate formation and growth was studied at three different experimental temperatures of 6, 7 and 8 °C and at stirring rates of 500, 700 and 1200 rpm using either 50 ml or 100 ml distilled water (DW). In the larger cell experiments were conducted at 8 °C and 700 rpm to examine effects of cell size and radial heat flow. The volume of water was either 112. 5 ml or 225 ml for the large cell experiments. Hydrate growth rates were estimated analyzing the amount of gas passing through the flow-meter per time unit {{and the amount of}} heat released (exothermic reaction) through temperature measurements. The analysis was terminated when heat release was observed to decay and prior to complete conversion of water into hydrates to reduce effects of increasing hydrate mass on heat transfer. The growth rate was initially relatively fast and decaying {{towards the end of the}} period analyzed. The analyzed growth period could be devided into three different rate section (Initial rate 1, Mid-section rate 2 and End-section rate 3) and within each section the rate could be approximated a linear function of time. Gas consumption by hydrate formation was used to calculate the heat production and heat flow into the cell. Heat flow out of the cell reactor was calculated on basis of measured temperature differences and the required heat input to balance the heat loss was estimated by simulations. Ideally this estimated heat input should be equal with the energy released by hydrate formation as calculated from the measured gas consumption during the process. The analysis was terminated when heat release was observed to decay as function of time and prior to complete conversion of water into hydrates to reduce effects of increasing hydrate mass on heat transfer. Discrepancies between energy / heat flow into the cell calculated from formation enthalpy and a value estimated on the basis of temperature measurements was used to evaluate the effect of stirring rate on heat transfer and the used heat transfer coefficients during simulations. Generally the simulated heat flow into the cell was higher than that calculated from the formation enthalpy indicating that heat transfer coefficients were overestimated...|$|E

Liang et al., on page 2359 Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) {{is a common}} finding in patients with global left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction. 1 In these patients, the mitral leaflets are structurally normal and leaflet coaptation failure results from an imbalance between valve closing forces and valve tethering forces. 2, 3 Impaired LV con-tractility, global LV dyssynchrony, and reduced mitral annulus sys-tolic contraction lead to a significant <b>reduction</b> in <b>valve</b> closing forces. In turn, valve tethering forces are increased due to mitral annulus dilatation, LV remodelling, and papillary muscle displace-ment. 4 Furthermore, MR per se induces additional adverse ventri-cular remodelling through volume overload, and plays a...|$|R

40|$|Leakages {{in urban}} water {{networks}} {{can be a}} very high percentage of the supplied water. The lost volume represents an economic damage not only for the cost of water pumping and treatment, but even because it makes necessary investments into systems capacity expansion or in searching for other water sources. In most cases of Water Distribution Systems (WDS) the most relevant percentage of lost water can be considered as the sum of small leakages distributed all over the network. In order to reduce this lost volume it may be advisable to plan medium-long term rehabilitation policies of the network combined with suitable management policies for controlling pressure heads in the system. Pressure regulation can be achieved by means of pressure <b>reduction</b> <b>valves</b> (PRV) remotely controlled, whose purpose is to decrease excessive pressures, ensuring the service conditions. The control of the PRVs is generally performed by mean of a hydraulic simulator of the network able to model as realistically as possible, both the geometry of the network and the nodal discharges. For a more realistic simulation of the WDS performance, the implementation of a fully pressure-dependent leakage specification is required. In the work, in order to treat water losses as pressure dependent quantities, the calibration of the WDS simulation model is performed concentrating leaks at the nodes and considering their flow as a function only of the local pressure. The estimation of the calibration coefficients is carried out solving an optimization problem with Genetic Algorithms (GA) coupled with the hydraulic model of the network. In order to obtain more realistic values for the nodal demand and water consumption discharges, it is advisable to base this calibration on the largest possible set of pressure and discharge measurements all over the network. Unfortunately measurements in WDS are usually carried out only at few nodes with high level of users aggregation. To overcome this problem the spatial interpolation of nodal pressures is performed with a geostatistical technique that feeds the calibration procedure with pressure heads at each node of the network...|$|R
