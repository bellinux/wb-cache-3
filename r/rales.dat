50|$|Following up on {{his belief}} that the French were behind Wabanaki claims, Governor Shute sent a {{military}} expedition to capture Father <b>Rale</b> in January 1722. Under the command of Colonel Thomas Westbrook of Thomaston, the New England militia were unsuccessful in capturing Father <b>Rale,</b> but they plundered the church and <b>Rale's</b> cabin.

40|$|Objective: We {{assessed}} the {{change over time}} in the contribution of maternal mortality to a life expectancy calculated between ages 15 and 49, or Reproductive-Aged Life Expectancy (<b>RALE).</b> Our goal was to estimate the increase in <b>RALE</b> in developed countries over the twentieth century and the hypothetical gains in African countries today by eliminating maternal mortality. Methods: Analogous to life expectancy, <b>RALE</b> is calculated from a life table of ages 15 to 49. Specifically, <b>RALE</b> is {{the average number of}} years that women at age 15 would be expected to live between 15 and 49 with current mortality rates. Associated single decrement life tables of causes of death other than maternal mortality are explored to assess the possible gains in <b>RALE</b> by reducing or eliminating maternal mortality. We used population-based data from the Human Mortality Database and the Demographic and Health Surveys. Findings: In developed countries, five years in <b>RALE</b> were gained over the twentieth century, of which approximately 10 %, or half a year, was attributable to reductions in maternal mortality. In sub-Saharan African countries, the possible achievable gains fluctuate between 0. 24 and 1. 47 years, or 6 % and 44 % of potential gains in <b>RALE.</b> Conclusions: Maternal mortality is a rare event, yet it is still a very important component of <b>RALE.</b> Averting the burden o...|$|R
25|$|The <b>RALES</b> trial {{showed that}} the {{addition}} of spironolactone can improve mortality, particularly in severe cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction less than 25%.) The related drug eplerenone was shown in the EPHESUS trial to have a similar effect, and it is specifically labelled for use in decompensated heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction. While the antagonism of aldosterone will decrease the effects of sodium and water retention, {{it is thought that}} the main mechanism of action is by antagonizing the deleterious effects of aldosterone on cardiac remodeling.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{can cause}} hyperkalemia, which can, rarely, be fatal. Of those {{prescribed}} typical doses, 10% to 15% developed hyperkalemia, and in 6%, it was severe.

500|$|Presentation may be subtle; {{people with}} mild {{contusion}} {{may have no}} symptoms at all. However, pulmonary contusion is frequently associated with signs (objective indications) and symptoms (subjective states), including those indicative of the lung injury itself and [...] of accompanying injuries. [...] Because gas exchange is impaired, signs of low blood oxygen saturation, such as low concentrations of oxygen in arterial blood gas and cyanosis (bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes) are commonly associated. [...] Dyspnea (painful breathing or difficulty breathing) is commonly seen, and tolerance for exercise may be lowered. Rapid breathing and a rapid heart rate are other signs. [...] With more severe contusions, breath sounds heard through a stethoscope may be decreased, or <b>rales</b> (an abnormal crackling sound in the chest accompanying breathing) may be present. People with severe contusions may have bronchorrhea (the production of watery sputum). Wheezing and coughing are other signs. Coughing up blood or bloody sputum is present in {{up to half of}} cases. Cardiac output (the volume of blood pumped by the heart) may be reduced, and hypotension (low blood pressure) is frequently present. The area of the chest wall near the contusion may be [...] tender or painful due to associated chest wall injury.|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{toxicity}} symptoms {{result from}} an inflammation that {{starts in the}} airways leading to the lungs and then spreads into the lungs (tracheobronchial tree). The symptoms appear in the upper chest region (substernal and carinal regions). This begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing. If breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen continues, patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a stethoscope (bubbling <b>rales),</b> fever, and increased {{blood flow to the}} lining of the nose (hyperaemia of the nasal mucosa). X-rays of the lungs show little change in the short term, but extended exposure leads to increasing diffuse shadowing throughout both lungs. Pulmonary function measurements are reduced, as noted by a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can hold (vital capacity) and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity. Tests in animals have indicated a variation in tolerance similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity, as well as significant variations between species. When the exposure to oxygen above [...] is intermittent, it permits the lungs to recover and delays the onset of toxicity.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the mortal}} {{blow to the}} company derived from Interco's {{response}} to a hostile takeover bid. [...] In 1988, Steven and Mitchell <b>Rales,</b> of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company. [...] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock. [...] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies. [...] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years. [...] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions {{in an attempt to}} remain solvent. [...] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds. [...] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991. [...] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.|$|E

[...] However, Hippocrates referred to pneumonia as a disease [...] "named by the ancients". He also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas. Maimonides (1135–1204 AD) observed: [...] "The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking pleuritic pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated pulse and cough." [...] This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the Middle Ages into the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} {{reprisals}} by the New Englanders against Norridgewock.

6000|$|There {{was in the}} Duchess's court a {{young fellow}} from the South of France, whose friends had sent him to faire son droit at Paris, where he {{had gone through the}} usual course of {{pleasure}} and studies of the young inhabitants of the Latin Quarter. He had at one time exalted republican opinions, and had fired his shot with distinction at St. Meri. He was a poet of some little note--a book of his lyrics, Les <b>Rales</b> d'un Asphyxie, having made a sensation {{at the time of their}} appearance. He drank great quantities of absinthe of a morning; smoked incessantly; played roulette whenever he could get a few pieces; contributed to a small journal, and was especially great in his hatred of l'infame Angleterre. Delenda est Carthago was tattooed beneath his shirt-sleeves. Fifine and Clarisse, young milliners of the students' district, had punctured this terrible motto on his manly right arm. Le leopard, emblem of England, was his aversion; he shook his fist at the caged monster in the Garden of Plants. He desired to have [...] "Here lies an enemy of England" [...] engraved upon his early tomb. He was skilled at billiards and dominoes, adroit in the use of arms, of unquestionable courage and fierceness. Mr. Jones of England was afraid of M. de Castillonnes, and cowered before his scowls and sarcasms. Captain Blackball, the other English aide-de-camp of the Duchesse d'Ivry, a warrior of undoubted courage, who had been [...] "on the ground" [...] more than once, gave him a wide berth, and wondered what the little beggar meant when he used to say, [...] "Since the days of the Prince Noir, monsieur, my family has been at feud with l'Angleterre!" [...] His family were grocers at Bordeaux, and his father's name was M. Cabasse. He had married a noble in the revolutionary times; and the son at Paris himself himself Victor Cabasse de Castillonnes; then Victor C. de Castillonnes; then M. de Castillonnes. One of the followers of the Black Prince had insulted a lady of the house of Castillonnes, when the English were lords of Guienne; hence our friend's wrath against the Leopard. He had written, and afterwards dramatised a terrific legend describing the circumstances, and the punishment of the Briton by a knight of the Castillonnes family. A more awful coward never existed in a melodrama than that felon English knight. His blanche-fille, of course, died of hopeless love for the conquering Frenchman, her father's murderer. The paper in which the feuilleton appeared died at the sixth number of the story. The theatre of the Boulevard refused the drama; so the author's rage against l'infame Albion was yet unappeased. On beholding Miss Newcome, Victor had fancied a resemblance between her and Agnes de Calverley, the blanche Miss of his novel and drama, and cast an eye of favour upon the young creature. He even composed verses in her honour (for I presume that the [...] "Miss Betti" [...] and the Princess Crimhilde of the poems which he subsequently published, were no other than Miss Newcome, and the Duchess, her rival). He had been one of the lucky gentlemen who had danced with Ethel on the previous evening. On the occasion of the ball, he came to her with a highflown compliment, and a request to be once more allowed to waltz with her--a request to which he expected a favourable answer, thinking, no doubt, that his wit, his powers of conversation, and the amour qui flambait dans son regard, had had their effect upon the charming Meess. Perhaps he had a copy of the very verses in his breast-pocket, with which he intended to complete his work of fascination. For her sake alone, he had been heard to say that he would enter into a truce with England, and forget the hereditary wrongs of his race.|$|E
