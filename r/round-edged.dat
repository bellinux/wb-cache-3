5000|$|Sharpening {{ice hockey}} skates {{plays a key}} factor in a player’s ability to skate and players will sharpen their skates {{hundreds}} of times throughout their career. Similar to figure skates, the blade is hollow ground in cross section, creating two edges that contact and cut into the ice, allowing increased maneuverability. The blades are sharpened with <b>round-edged</b> grinding wheels that create the two edges. The wheels grind out a hollow semi-circle {{along the length of the}} underside of the blade, forming the sharp edge on each side. Skate blade sharpness is measured by the thickness of the <b>round-edged</b> grinding wheel being used, the smaller the radius, the sharper the edge will be. The sharpness chosen by a player is based completely upon preference, not player size or level of play. While a half-inch radius of hollow is the most common and standard sharpening for most players, the standard radius of hollow for goalies is three-fourths inch.|$|E

The angulation is pinched out into a sharp <b>round-edged</b> keel. There are fine sharpish threads on the whole surface pretty equally distributed and of equal strength.

The grivnas that have been found at various archaeological sites are not necklaces but bullions of precious metals, usually silver. The weight and the shape of grivnas were not uniform, but varied by region. The grivnas of Novgorod and Pskov were thin long <b>round-edged</b> or three-edged ingots, while Kievan grivnas has rather the shape of a prolonged rhombus. The material was either gold or silver, but silver was predominant. Originally the weight of a grivna was close to the Roman or Byzantine pound. The weight of the Kievan grivna was around 140-165 g.

Study design/patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 23, 440 eyes implanted with either MA 60 BM, MA 60 AC, VA- 60 BB, CeeOnEdge, Clariflex, Technis Z 9002, SI- 40 NB, or UV 26 T IOLs. We calculated the YAG capsulotomy rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years post lens implantation. Results: YAG capsulotomy rates at 3 years postimplantation {{for the eight}} groups of IOLs were, respectively, 3. 7 %, 3. 9 %, 23. 7 %, 3. 4 %, 4. 5 %, 4. 7 %, 10. 4 %, and 21. 0 %. YAG capsulotomy rates at 10 years postimplantation for the MA 60 BM and SI- 40 NB IOLs were, respectively, 9. 1 % and 15 % (P< 0. 05). The average YAG rates for all sharp-edged and <b>round-edged</b> IOLs at 5 years postimplantation were, respectively, 5. 2 %± 0. 7 % and 25. 6 %± 9. 0 % (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Steady {{supersonic}} vortex-dominated flows are solved {{using the}} unsteady Euler equations for conical and three-dimensional flows around sharp- and <b>round-edged</b> delta wings. The computational method is a finite-volume scheme {{which uses a}} four-stage Runge-Kutta time stepping with explicit second- and fourth-order dissipation terms. The grid is generated by a modified Joukowski transformation. The steady flow solution is obtained through time-stepping with initial conditions corresponding to the freestream conditions, and the bow shock is captured {{as a part of}} the solution. The scheme is applied to flat-plate and elliptic-section wings with a leading edge sweep of 70 deg at an angle of attack of 10 deg and a freestream Mach number of 2. 0. Three grid sizes of 29 x 39, 65 x 65 and 100 x 100 have been used. The results for sharp-edged wings show that they are consistent with all grid sizes and variation of the artificial viscosity coefficients. The results for <b>round-edged</b> wings show that separated and attached flow solutions can be obtained by varying the artificial viscosity coefficients. They also show that the solutions are independent of the way time stepping is done. Local time-stepping and global minimum time-steeping produce same solutions...|$|E
