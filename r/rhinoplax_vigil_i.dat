50|$|The helmeted {{hornbill}} (<b>Rhinoplax</b> <b>vigil)</b> {{is a very}} large bird in the hornbill family. It is found on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. The casque (helmetlike structure on the head) accounts for some 11% of its 3 kg weight. Unlike any other hornbill, the casque is almost solid, and is used in head-to-head combat among males. It is a belief among the Punan Bah that a large {{helmeted hornbill}} guards the river between life and death.|$|R

This is a dense, carvable substance that makes up the solid casque growing above the upper mandible (from the bird's forehead). It is not ivory, horn, or bone, yet it has been called ivory for many centuries. It is softer than real ivory and is a creamy yellow in color, becoming red {{at the top and}} sides.|$|R

40|$|Hornbills {{provide a}} seed {{dispersal}} service for rainforest trees, but {{the persistence of}} hornbill populations depends {{on the availability of}} old trees that provide cavities for their nests. The Helmeted Hornbill <b>Rhinoplax</b> <b>vigil</b> is Critically Endangered, due to both forest destruction and an inhumane illegal trade in their bill casques, yet little is known about its nests and breeding biology. Here we describe the nest tree and external nest characteristics of a pair of Helmeted Hornbills in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Lampung, Sumatra, and compare them with observations of two nests of the Wreathed Hornbill Rhyticeros undulatus less than 1 km away. As in a previous study, the Helmeted Hornbill (HH) nest was in a large dipterocarp, and possessed a stump next to the entrance that the male used as a perch when feeding the female or chick. The nest entrance dimensions and bole diameter of the nest tree were much larger than those of the two Wreathed Hornbill (W 1 and W 2) nests. Egg laying in HH took place in February, while in W 1 and W 2, eggs were laid much later, between late May and July. The maximum nesting cycle of the Helmeted Hornbill was an astonishing 137 days (4. 5 months), close to the minimum period (range, 138 - 151) for a nest of the species in Peninsular Malaysia. This may be longer than the nesting cycle of the Wreathed Hornbill, but additional data are needed...|$|R

6000|$|Never {{was such}} a night of frozen beauty, never such dream-tranquillity. The wind had dropped, and the silence was such that one hardly liked to tread even on the grass. From the lawn and fields {{there seemed to be}} a mist rising--in truth, the {{moonlight}} caught on the dewy buttercups; and across this ghostly radiance the shadows of the yew-trees fell in dense black bars. Suddenly, I bethought me of the mare. How was she faring, this marvellous night? Very softly opening the door into the yard, I tiptoed across. A light was burning in her box. And I could hear her making the same half-human noise she had made in the afternoon, as if wondering at her feelings; and instantly the voice of the bearded man talking to her as one might talk to a child: [...] "Oover, me darlin'; yu've a-been long enough o' that side.

60|$|This annual {{spectacle}} {{had always}} been a moving one, but the feeling it now produced--this mingled feeling--was most powerful on still moonlight nights, when I would sit or lie on my bed gazing out on the prospect, earth and sky, in its changed mysterious aspect. And, lying there, I would listen by the hour to the three-syllable call-note of the upland or solitary plover, as the birds went past, each bird alone far up in the dim sky, winging his way to the north. It was a strange <b>vigil</b> <b>I</b> kept, stirred by strange thoughts and feelings, in that moonlit earth that was strange too, albeit familiar, for never before had the sense of the supernatural in Nature been stronger. And the bird I listened to, that same solitary plover I had known and admired from my earliest years, the most graceful of birds, beautiful to see and hear when it would spring up before my horse with its prolonged wild bubbling cry of alarm and go away with swift, swallow-like flight--what intensity and gladness of life was in it, what a wonderful inherited knowledge in its brain, and what an inexhaustible vigour in its slender frame to enable it to perform that annual double journey of upwards of ten thousand miles! What a joy it would be to live for ages in a world of such fascinating phenomena! If some great physician, wise beyond all others, infallible, had said to me that all my doctors had been wrong, that, barring accidents, I had yet fifty years to live, or forty, or even thirty, I should have worshipped him and would have counted myself the happiest being on the globe, with so many autumns and winters and springs and summers to see yet.|$|R

Then she died, and what her loss was to me--how can I say it?--how could you understand? And after she was taken away and buried, I said: 'She is not dead, and wherever she now is, in heaven or in purgatory, or in the sun, she will remember and come to me and comfort me.' When it was dark I went out alone and sat {{at the end of the}} house, and spent hours waiting for her. 'She will surely come,' I said, 'but I don't know whether I shall see her or not. Perhaps it will be just a whisper in my ear, perhaps a touch of her hand on mine, but I shall know that she is with me.' And at last, worn out with waiting and watching, I went to my bed and said she will come to-morrow. And the next night and the next it was the same. Sometimes I would go up the ladder, always standing against the gable so that one could go up, and standing on the roof, look out over the plain and see where our horses were grazing. There I would sit or lie on the thatch for hours. And I would cry: 'Come to me, my mother! I cannot live without you! Come soon-come soon, before I die of a broken heart!' That was my cry every night, until worn out with my <b>vigil</b> <b>I</b> would go back to my room.

60|$|Margaret was changing! At {{times during}} the past few days I had hardly known her as the same girl whom I had met at the picnic, and whose <b>vigils</b> <b>I</b> had shared in the sick-room of her father. Then, even in her moments of {{greatest}} sorrow or fright or anxiety, she was all life and thought and keenness. Now she was generally distraite, and at times in a sort of negative condition as though her mind--her very being--was not present. At such moments she would have full possession of observation and memory. She would know and remember all that was going on, and had gone on around her; but her coming back to her old self had to me something the sensation of a new person coming into the room. Up to the time of leaving London I had been content whenever she was present. I had over me that delicious sense of security which comes with the consciousness that love is mutual. But now doubt had taken its place. I never knew whether the personality present was my Margaret--the old Margaret whom I had loved at the first glance--or the other new Margaret, whom I hardly understood, and whose intellectual aloofness made an impalpable barrier between us. Sometimes she would become, as it were, awake all at once. At such times, though she would say to me sweet and pleasant things which she had often said before, she would seem most unlike herself. It was almost as if she was speaking parrot-like or at dictation of one who could read words or acts, but not thoughts. After one or two experiences of this kind, my own doubting began to make a barrier; for I could not speak with the ease and freedom which were usual to me. And so hour by hour we drifted apart. Were it not for the few odd moments when the old Margaret was back with me full of her charm I do not know what would have happened. As it was, each such moment gave me a fresh start and kept my love from changing.|$|R

40|$|In his {{newspaper}} article of 4 June 2014, Ng Chi Sum, a renowned Hong Kong (“HK”) current affairs commentator expressed his amazement about the binary labeling widely circulated {{then in the}} internet community: those who join the June Fourth Candlelight Vigil in Victoria Park (“VP Vigil”) are “Chinese”, and those who join that in Tsimshatsui’s Cultural Centre Piazza (“TST Vigil”) are “Hong Konger”. According to his understanding, as he wrote, this kind of labeling derived from the popular “domestic discourse” which received rising support in recent years, and which promotes, inter alia: absolute segregation of HK and China (“PRC”); that the democracy of HK cannot be dependent on the democracy of PRC; that matters concerning {{the human rights of}} the PRC people, including those like Liao Xiaobo and Li Wangyang, are matters of the PRC people only and HK people should not get involved in them; that the organizer of the VP Vigil, the HK Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (“the Alliance”), with one of its goals being “building a democratic China, has failed in promoting the democracy of China despite 25 years of effort, and together with the reasons listed above, the Alliance should not be supported anymore. In fact, numerous articles were published since May 2014 in the official online publication “Passion Times” of the TST Vigil’s organizer “Civic Passion”, explaining why it was time for HK people to “change venue” when doing any June Fourth memorial service. In one written in direct response to Ng’s above article, the author went further to say that for HK people, the June Fourth massacre is not about condolences, but about the brutality of the PRC government in killing its own people. It is no occasion for mourning anymore and HK people should attend the TST Vigil to pledge their determination on “domestic movement”, protecting domestic interest, fighting for HK’s democracy, and overturning the PRC regime. The author also highlighted that since some members of the Alliance made deals with the PRC government during the 2010 political reform of HK and betrayed HK people, they should no longer be trusted. Moreover, in face of the “colonization” of the HK by the PRC government/people since the 1997 handover, “patriotisms” is something HK people cannot afford to embrace anymore. And since the Alliance promotes patriotisms, HK people should entirely break their tie with the Alliance. All in all, the author seemed to suggest that those who opt for the TST Vigil are real true HK people subscribing to “radical domestic values”, and those attending the VP Vigil are either confused or “patriotic” like Ng. Personally, I am no fan of the Alliance or Civic Passion. However, I have been attending the VP Vigil for at least 20 times during the last 25 years. The reasons for doing so are complex and personal, including mobilization by some first-hand knowledge and experience of myself in 1989. In the morning of 4 June 2014, I posted a photo of last year’s VP Vigil on my Facebook (“FB”) page. Immediately it attracted comments from a FB friend (John Doe, alias) saying that the moment I attended the VP <b>Vigil,</b> <b>I</b> would be “hijacked” by the Alliance to become a supporter of them. He advised me not to go to the VP Vigil, but to the TST Vigil instead (See Appendix I). When talking about June Fourth, one easily associates with struggles of the people against an autocratic and centralized power (the PRC government). However, the above examples just illustrate that this association is far from complete. By just looking at the arguments over the location of the Candlelight Vigil, one can see that the struggles against subjection, the exercise of power amongst the people (i. e. people vs people), and some knowledge being subjugated consequently all interplay in this “site”. The ultimate question to be asked then is: have we been examining “power” with sufficient depth and width {{when we talk about the}} June Fourth Massacre...|$|R

6000|$|It {{seemed to}} be summer, [...] In the forenoon of the day; and the master's diligent pencil [...] Laid its last light touches on Eve driven forth out of Eden, [...] Otherwise Violante, and while his pupils about him [...] Wrought and chattered, in silence ran {{the thought of the}} painter: [...] "She, and forever she! Is it come to be my perdition? [...] Shall I, then, never more make the face of a {{beautiful}} woman [...] But it must take her divine, accursèd beauty upon it, [...] And, when I finish my work, stand forth her visible presence? [...] Ah! I could take this sword and strike it into her bosom! [...] Though I believe my own heart's blood would stream from the [...] painting, [...] So much I love her! Yes, that look is marvellous like you, [...] Wandering, tender--such as I'd give my salvation to win you [...] Once to bend upon me! But I knew myself better than make you, [...] Lest I should play the fool about you here before people, [...] Helpless to turn away from your violet eyes, Violante, [...] That have turned all my life to a vision of madness." [...] The painter [...] Here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered, [...] "Visions, visions, my son?" [...] said a gray old friar who listened, [...] Seated there in the sun, with his eye on the work of the painter [...] Fishily fixed, while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches. [...] "Much have I envied your Art, who vouchsafeth to those who adore [...] her [...] Visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and <b>vigils.</b> [...] <b>I</b> have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion, [...] Scourged myself almost to death, without one glimpse of the glory [...] Which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden. [...] Pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions: [...] Fain would I know how they come to you, though I never see them, [...] And in my thickness of hearing I fear some words have escaped me." [...] Then, while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar, [...] Baleful, breathless, bewildered, fiercer than noon in the dog-days, [...] Round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur; [...] From the lips to the ears of those nameless Beppis and Gigis [...] Buzzed the stinging whisper: [...] "Let's hear Pordenone's confession." [...] Well they knew the master's luckless love, and whose portrait [...] He had unconsciously painted there, and guessed that his visions [...] Scarcely were those conceived by the friar, who constantly [...] blundered [...] Round the painter at work, mistaking every subject-- [...] Noah's drunken Debauch for the Stoning of Stephen the Martyr, [...] And the Conversion of Paul for the Flight into Egypt; forever [...] Putting his hand to his ear and shouting, [...] "Speak louder, I pray [...] you!" [...] So they waited now, in silent, amused expectation, [...] Till Pordenone's angry scorn should gather to bursting. [...] Long the painter gazed in furious silence, then slowly [...] Uttered a kind of moan, and turned again to his labor. [...] Tears gathered into his eyes, of mortification and pathos, [...] And when the dull old monk, who forgot, while he waited the answer, [...] Visions and painter, and all, had maundered away in his error, [...] Pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom; [...] "For in my own," [...] he mused, [...] "is such a combat of devils, [...] That I believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better [...] Than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover [...] Heights which I never can reach, and bright on the pinnacle [...] standing [...] In the unfading light, my rival crowned victor above me. [...] If I could hint what I feel, what forever escapes from my pencil, [...] All after-time should know my will was not less than my failure, [...] Nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity. [...] All should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage, [...] Saying: 'Not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored; [...] His was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest [...] achievement, [...] Conscious of doing his utmost, and knowing how vast his defeat is. [...] Life, if he would, might have had some second guerdon to give him, [...] But he would only the first; and behold! Let us honor [...] Grief such as his must have been; no other sorrow can match it! [...] There are certainly some things here that are nobly imagined: [...] Look! here is masterly power in this play of light, and these [...] shadows [...] Boldly are massed; and what color! One can well understand [...] Buonarotti [...] Saying the sight of his Curtius was worth the whole journey from [...] Florence. [...] Here is a man at least never less than his work; you can feel it [...] As you can feel in Titian's the painter's inferior spirit. [...] He and this Pordenone, you know, were rivals; and Titian [...] Knew how to paint to the popular humor, and spared not [...] Foul means or fair (his way with rivals) to crush Pordenone, [...] Who with an equal chance'-- [...] "Alas, if the whole world should tell me [...] I was his equal in art, and the lie could save me from torment, [...] So must I be lost, for my soul could never believe it! [...] Nay, let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory, [...] Still, when I look on his work, my soul makes obeisance within me, [...] Humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled." ...|$|R
