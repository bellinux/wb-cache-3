The work contains tables for {{the movements of}} the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. The work is significant as it introduced Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic sciences. This work also marks the turning point in Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily <b>research</b> <b>approach</b> to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of nontraditional methods of study and calculations.|$|E

2500|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} are increasingly delivered by nurses {{in mental health}} settings and include psychotherapy interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy and less commonly other interventions such as milieu therapy or psychodynamic approaches. These interventions {{can be applied to}} a broad range of problems including psychosis, depression, and anxiety. Nurses will work with people {{over a period of time}} and use psychological methods to teach the person psychological techniques that they can then use to aid recovery and help manage any future crisis in their mental health. In practice, these interventions will be used often, in conjunction with psychiatric medications. Psychosocial {{interventions are}} based on evidence based practice and therefore the techniques tend to [...] follow set guidelines based upon what has been demonstrated to be effective by nursing research. There has been some criticism that evidence based practice is focused primarily on quantitative research and should reflect also a more qualitative <b>research</b> <b>approach</b> that seeks to understand the meaning of people's experience.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean fishery off the U.S. West Coast, a [...] "sardine crisis" [...] was looming. [...] From 1916 through 1939, {{the annual}} sardine catch {{had more than}} doubled every six years, and had reached an annual high of about 1,500,000,000 pounds (680,000,000 kg) in 1936. Although California state {{biologists}} had warned against overfishing, the California state government {{had been unable to}} regulate sardine fishing through legislation. Amid rising concerns about the food supply in the United States, the Bureau of Fisheries sent Sette – who had demonstrated his ability to manage fisheries and had experience in the California sardine fishery and good contacts in the California fishing industry – to California in 1937 under a Congressional mandate to conduct sardine research that would allow better management of the Pacific sardine fishery. Sette became director of the bureau′s new South Pacific Fisheries Investigations and established the organization′s headquarters on the campus of Stanford University with instructions to [...] "direct and perform research on the nature and causes of fluctuations in pelagic fish populations.” [...] Sette quickly developed a plan {{for the study of the}} life cycle of the sardine in relation to the fishery; his plan included ecological studies of all stages of the life history of sardines as well as studies of the impact of fishing that contrasted sharply with the more narrowly focused fisheries <b>research</b> <b>approach</b> that preceded them. He enlisted the assistance of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, thereby ensuring that ecological factors would be part of the findings in his sardine investigations.|$|E

40|$|Scientific pluralism, a {{normative}} {{endorsement of the}} plurality or multiplicity of <b>research</b> <b>approaches</b> in science, has recently been advocated by several philosophers (e. g., Kellert et al. 2006, Kitcher 2001, Longino 2013, Mitchell 2009, and Chang 2010). Comparing these accounts of scientific pluralism, one will encounter quite some variation. We want to clarify the different interpretations of scientific pluralism by showing how they incarnate different models of democracy, stipulating the desired interaction among the plurality of <b>research</b> <b>approaches</b> in different democratic ways. Furthermore, the example of scientific pluralism is used to advocate the application of democratic theory to philosophy of science problems in general. Drawing on the parallels between models of science and models of democracy, we can articulate how the plurality of <b>research</b> <b>approaches</b> in science should interact within a democratic framework {{as well as how}} to cultivate multiple <b>research</b> <b>approaches</b> in the epistemically most productive way possible. This will not only improve our understanding of scientific pluralism, but it can also help us stipulating how different <b>research</b> <b>approaches</b> should interact to constitute the most objective account possible or how the ideal of scientific consensus has to be understood. Ultimately, developing democratic models of science bears on the question of how deeply science and democracy are entwined...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{qualitative and quantitative}} research methodologies, {{there is also a}} third <b>research</b> <b>approach</b> called mixed methods. “Mixed methods is a type of procedural approach for conducting research that involves collecting, analyzing, and mixing quantitative and qualitative data within a single program of study. Its rationale postulates that the use of both qualitative and quantitative research provides a better and richer understanding of a research problem than either traditional <b>research</b> <b>approach</b> alone provides.” Complex contextual situations are easier to understand when using a mixed methods <b>research</b> <b>approach,</b> compared to using a qualitative or quantitative <b>research</b> <b>approach.</b> There are more than fifteen mixed method design typologies that have been identified. Because these typologies share many characteristics and criteria, they have been classified into six different types. Three of these types are sequential, meaning that one type of data collection and analysis happens before the other. The other three designs are concurrent, meaning both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The use of 'native categories' in {{management}} research avoids {{the input of}} researchers' a priori understandings into the research process. The rich, unobservable and subjective perceptions of managers may be explored through interpretative <b>research</b> <b>approaches,</b> but these {{do not meet the}} positive aspiration of generating findings of generalisable application. A gulf exists between these two <b>research</b> <b>approaches.</b> An approach is described and evaluated which, in attempting to address the 'native category' problem in a comparative management research study, reconciles many of the objectives of interpretative and positive research. It explicitly recognises imperfection in all <b>research</b> <b>approaches,</b> and strikes a range of appropriate compromises. It is a way of accessing managers' 'native category' data results that is amenable to interpretative and positive, qualitative and quantitative analysis. The approach presented shows that the gulf between interpretative and positive approaches may be bridged, and other 'bridges' may be developed for other research enquiries. ...|$|R
