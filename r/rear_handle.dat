25|$|Bench {{planes are}} {{characterized}} by the cutting iron bedded with the bevel facing down and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal bench planes, and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> known as a tote. Block planes {{are characterized by}} the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E
25|$|Each rod {{is sized}} {{to the fish}} being sought, the wind and water {{conditions}} and also to a particular weight of line: larger and heavier line sizes will cast heavier, larger flies. Fly rods come {{in a wide variety}} of line sizes, from size #000 to #0 rods for the smallest freshwater trout and pan fish up to and including #16 rods for large saltwater game fish. Fly rods tend to have a single, large-diameter line guide (called a stripping guide), with a number of smaller looped guides (aka snake guides) spaced along the rod to help control the movement of the relatively thick fly line. To prevent interference with casting movements, most fly rods usually have little or no butt section (handle) extending below the fishing reel. However, the Spey rod, a fly rod with an elongated <b>rear</b> <b>handle,</b> is often used for fishing either large rivers for salmon and Steelhead or saltwater surf casting, using a two-handed casting technique.|$|E
5000|$|The engine {{throttle}} is {{operated by the}} [...] under the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> of the saw. Unless the lock-out switch above the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> is also pressed, the throttle cannot move from the idle position, and the chain will not be driven.|$|E
5000|$|The {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>handles</b> {{of a typical}} [...] "rear handle" [...] {{chainsaw}} are widely spaced, so as to provide enough leverage for good control, and also to provide some degree of control {{in the event of}} a kickback.|$|R
50|$|Bubinga is {{also used}} in {{high-end}} furniture, especially by contemporary Arts and Crafts artists as well on high-end manual woodworking tools such as the front knobs and <b>rear</b> <b>handles</b> of smooth planes. Bubinga comes in various grain patterns, with rare patterns bringing top dollar.|$|R
5000|$|In a few beachside {{communities}} in Southern California, including Venice, California, [...] "walk streets" [...] were constructed around 1905 {{in a few}} blocks near the beach. Houses faced pedestrian lanes that ranged between 3 and 10 feet wide. Narrow alleys in the <b>rear</b> <b>handled</b> cars and parking. The canals in Venice, California, built during the same period, also had both sidewalks and canals {{in front of the}} houses.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> guard {{protects the}} hand of the {{operator}} when the chain derails.|$|E

50|$|The {{two most}} common types of kyūsu are yokode kyūsu (side hand(le) teapot), {{which has a}} side handle and which is the more common type, and ushirode kyūsu (back hand(le) teapot), which has a <b>rear</b> <b>handle,</b> just like teapots {{in other parts of}} the world; there are also uwade kyūsu (top hand(le) teapot).|$|E
50|$|The third {{series of}} Ypsilon adopted a five-door body with <b>rear</b> door <b>handles</b> {{hidden in the}} upright (solution similar to that adopted by the Alfa Romeo 147, 156 and Giulietta).|$|R
25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front door <b>handles,</b> recessed <b>rear</b> door <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden <b>rear</b> door <b>handles</b> and prominent front door handles to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|R
50|$|U.S. {{motorcycles}} came standard with {{a narrow}} dual saddle, though wide dual saddles with chrome <b>rear</b> <b>handles</b> could be ordered. Solo saddles made by Pagusa or Denfeld for driver and passenger were also available. All motorcycles came with a tool kit. Hella turn signals were optional (photo below left), and were mounted {{at the ends of}} the handlebars showing light both forward and back.The standard fuel tank held 17 L, though a commonly purchased option was a more bulbous 25 L tank. Also available as options were sport tanks of 26 L and 30 L capacities.|$|R
5000|$|In the top-handled saw, the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> and its {{operating}} controls are {{moved to the}} top of the saw. This gives a balance to the saw such that it can now be used one-handed. The front handle remains the same. The chain brake lever is usually separate, rather than being combined into the protective hand guard.|$|E
50|$|The {{chain catcher}} is located between the saw {{body and the}} clutch cover. In most cases {{it looks like a}} hook made in aluminum. It is used to stop the chain when it derails from the bar and shortens the length of the chain. When derailing the chain swings from {{underneath}} the saw towards the operator. The shorting prevents hitting the operator, but it hits the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> guard.|$|E
50|$|The safety {{throttle}} {{prevents the}} chain from being driven if the trigger is accidentally pushed by an obstruction, {{such as a}} branch in undergrowth. It also prevents throttle activation when hot-starting a saw {{on the ground with}} one boot inside the <b>rear</b> <b>handle.</b> The safety throttle is an additional layer of protection in this case, since the chainbrake should be applied before starting a saw in any context.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{generations of}} the Xterra {{featured}} a two-box design with a raised rear roofline to enable stadium seating—as well as a bump on the rearmost door expressing an interior first aid kit and [...] "C" [...] pillar-mounted <b>rear</b> door <b>handles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tenebrio molitor {{is often}} used for {{biological}} research. Its relatively large size, ease of <b>rearing</b> and <b>handling,</b> and status as a non-model organism make it useful in proof of concept studies {{in the fields of}} basic biology, biochemistry, evolution, immunology and physiology.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Neonatal {{maternal}} separation alters {{learning and}} memory. Glucocorticoids also modulate adult learning and memory, and neonatal maternal sepa-ration alters forebrain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) con-centrations. We used eyeblink classical conditioning {{to assess the}} effect of neonatal maternal separation on asso-ciative learning. We assessed delay eyeblink conditioning, GR expression, and total neuron number in the interposi-tus nucleus, a critical site of plasticity in eyeblink condi-tioning, in adult rats that had undergone either standard animal facilities <b>rearing,</b> <b>handling</b> for 15 min, or maternal separation for either 15 or 60 min per day on postnatal days 2 – 14. At 2 – 3 months of age, delay eyeblink classical conditioning was assessed. Brains were processed for GR immunohistochemistry, and GR expression in the inter...|$|R
50|$|The {{chain catcher}} helps prevent the chain being thrown {{back towards the}} user, if the chain breaks or becomes derailed. The catcher catches the chain when it details {{downwards}} and shortens it. Then the chain moves underneath the saw body smashing against the rear hand protection at the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> (The bottom of the handle is wider to the ba side as to the other). As shown in the image chain catchers are made of aluminum not to damage the chain. A worn out chain catcher can be changed.|$|E

50|$|The hatch opening was {{notoriously}} small. Any gunner of extra-large size or larger, {{while wearing}} his body armor, {{would have trouble}} fitting in the turret, {{and it would be}} nearly impossible if he was wearing his gas mask case across his chest. The hatch itself had three positions: full down, half up, and full up; when full up, it acted as a rear shield for the gunner. When opened, the spring-loaded hatch automatically went to the midpoint lock. This forced the gunner to pull down the handle in the rear so that the hatch opened fully. When closing the hatch, the gunner just pulled the <b>rear</b> <b>handle</b> down until he could latch the hatch. The gunner had a folding pedestal to stand on when behind the machine gun. Operationally, any time the gun was mounted, the gunner had to be behind it whether the vehicle was moving or not.|$|E
5000|$|The car's {{profile is}} {{dominated}} by the prominent wheel arches and the body's high waistline which contrast with the slim side windows, which is a modern interpretation of [...] "coke bottle styling" [...] popular during the 1960s and 1970s. Echoing a style first seen on the Maxima, Nissan's high performance electric coupé concept shown at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show, the glasshouse resembles a crash helmet visor. A coupé-like appearance is achieved by the <b>rear</b> door <b>handles</b> being located near the C-pillars, within the window frame. Locating the <b>rear</b> door <b>handles</b> within the window frame is a Nissan styling tradition, begun with the 1985 Nissan Pathfinder. The sport motif continues inside with the red- or grey-painted centre console bearing similarity to a motorcycle fuel tank.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of Aspergillosis in chickens on farms throughout Trinidad {{have left the}} chicken consuming population shocked and frightened. At present there exists very little published information available to the population on Aspergillosis {{and its effect on}} health and food safety. The present paper examines some of the fundamental questions associated with the pathogenesis of Aspergillus, health implications and recommendation for public health food safety. It is hoped through education and access to information on Aspergillus will serve to alleviate fears about Aspergillus and to empower farmers and the chicken consuming population about methods of reducing, preventing and eliminating Aspergillus, thereby restoring confidence through the adoption of good agriculture practices, safe food handling practices, good sanitation practices and good hygienic practices when <b>rearing,</b> <b>handling,</b> processing, preparing, storing and transporting poultry...|$|R

5000|$|A revised {{design was}} {{revealed}} on July 11, 2007 at E3 2007 with a form {{reminiscent of a}} submachine gun, in which the Wii Remote is fitted in the gun barrel and the Nunchuk is cradled in the <b>rear</b> <b>handle.</b> This design came about {{with the realization that}} making the Wii Zapper functionally independent from attachments would [...] "allow for more diverse play styles." [...] Some concern has been raised by this arrangement, since most people would naturally end up holding the Nunchuk with their dominant hand and be forced to pull the trigger with their non-dominant hand. Third-party titles designed to support the Wii Zapper include Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, Ghost Squad, Medal of Honor: Heroes 2, The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return, House of the Dead: Overkill, Call of Duty: World at War, Wild West Guns, Quantum of Solace, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Reflex Edition, Dead Space: Extraction, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, Heavy Fire: Special Operations, Mad Dog McCree: Gunslinger Pack, GoldenEye 007 and Call of Duty: Black Ops, while Nintendo has supported it with the first-party WiiWare game, Eco Shooter: Plant 530, as well as with Sin and Punishment: Star Successor.|$|E

40|$|The {{hand grip}} forces {{at the front}} and rear handles of a chain saw were {{measured}} during work, in 89 professional lumberjacks. The symptoms caused by vibration to the upper limbs were compared with the hand grip force (HGF) during work.

The mean HGF during sawing varied from 5 to 12 N in all subjects. The variation in HGF was greater at the front handle than at the <b>rear</b> <b>handle,</b> during sawing. The lumberjacks who had vibration-induced white fingers (VWF), had a higher HGF/MVC in both hands than the lumberjacks without VWF.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern of {{consumers}} that the meat producing animals are bred, reared, handled and slaughtered in ways that are sympathetic to their welfare status. Good animal welfare is generally considered as a primary requirement and EU and national legislation is in force throughout the total production chain and everyday practice is above the minimum threshold level required. The relative importance of stress during animal production and in the immediate pre-slaughter period as a major determinant of ultimate meat quality has long been recognized. Good welfare may result in better product quality is a powerful additional commercial incentive to improve the way we <b>rear,</b> <b>handle</b> and slaughter animals. In the ante mortem period, good welfare usually results from careful handling of animals that reduces stress and trauma. In contrast, poor ante mortem handling leads to stress and results in poorer meat quality. Critical points within the pre-slaughter period are (a) loading, (b) transport, (c) lairage, (d) stunning...|$|E

5000|$|In late 1973 the Cortina Mark III {{was given}} a facelift, and was redesignated TD. The main {{difference}} was the dashboard and clocks, no longer did it slope away from the driver's line of sight.
