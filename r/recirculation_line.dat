Simplified liquid oxygen propellant conditioning concepts are being sought for future launch vehicles. During a joint program, four alternative propellant conditioning options were studied: (1) passive recirculation; (2) low bleed through the engine; (3) recirculation lines; and (4) helium bubbling. The test configuration {{for this program}} {{was based on a}} vehicle design which used a main recirculation loop that was insulated on the downcomer and uninsulated on the upcomer. This produces a natural convection recirculation flow. The test article for this program simulated a feedline which ran from the main recirculation loop to the turbopump. The objective was to measure the temperature profile of this test article. Several parameters were varied from the baseline case to determine their effects on the temperature profile. These parameters included: flow configuration, feedline slope, heat flux, main recirculation loop velocity, pressure, bleed rate, helium bubbling, and <b>recirculation</b> <b>lines.</b> The heat flux, bleed rate, and recirculation configurations produced the greatest changes from the baseline temperature profile.

A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed {{to the east of}} the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing transfer pipeline. The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch vapour return arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch <b>recirculation</b> <b>line.</b> Additional facilities included further submerged combustion vapourisers; boil-off gas compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a vent stack.

40|$|For a high-brightness {{electron}} beam with high bunch charge traversing a <b>recirculation</b> beam <b>line,</b> coherent synchrotron radiation and space charge effects {{may result in}} microbunching instability (MBI). Both tracking simulation and Vlasov analysis for an early design of a circulator cooler ring (CCR) for the Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC) reveal significant MBI [Ya. Derbenev and Y. Zhang, Proceedings of the Workshop on Beam Cooling and Related Topics, COOL’ 09, Lanzhou, China, 2009 (2009), FRM 2 MCCO 01]. It is envisioned that the MBI could be substantially suppressed by using a magnetized beam. In this paper we have generalized the existing Vlasov analysis, originally developed for a nonmagnetized beam (or transversely uncoupled beam), to the description of transport of a magnetized beam including relevant collective effects. The new formulation is then employed to confirm prediction of microbunching suppression for a magnetized beam transport in the recirculation arc of a recent JLEIC energy recovery linac (ERL) based cooler design for electron cooling. It is found that the smearing effect in the longitudinal beam phase space originates from the large transverse beam size as a nature of the magnetized beams and becomes effective through the x-z correlation when the correlated distance {{is larger than the}} microbunched scale. As a comparison, MBI analysis of the early design of JLEIC CCR is also presented in this paper...|$|R

The current approach for most postprocessing and visualization work is to explore the 3 D flow simulations with one of a dozen or so interactive tools.

An active area of research this year has been the development of data mining tools that automatically search through gigabyte data sets and extract the salient features with little or no human intervention.

40|$|Energy {{recovering}} linac (ERL) {{offers an}} attractive alternative for generating intense beams of charged particles by approaching the operational efficiency of a storage ring {{while maintaining the}} superior beam quality typical of a linear accelerator. In ERLs, the decelerated beam cancels the beam loading effects of the accelerated beam with high repetition rate. Therefore, ERLs can, in principle, accelerate very high average currents with only modest amounts of RF power. So the efficiency of RF power to beam is much higher. Furthermore, the energy of beam to dump is lower, so it will reduce dump radiation. With the successful experiments in large maximum-to-injection energy ratio up to 51 : 1 and high power FEL up to 14 kW, the use of ERL, especially combining with superconducting RF technology, provides a potentially powerful new paradigm for generation of the charged particle beams used in MW FEL, synchrotron radiation sources, high-energy electron cooling devices and so on. The 3 + 1 / 2 DC-SC photo injector and two 9 cell TESLA superconducting cavity for IR SASE FEL in PKU provides a good platform to achieve high average FEL with Energy Recovery. The work of this thesis is on Beam line design and Beam dynamics study of Energy Recovery Linac Free Electron Laser for Peking University. It is the upgrade of PKU facility, which is under construction. With ERL, this facility can work in CW mode, so it can operate high average beam current without RF power constraint in main linac and generate high average FEL power. Moreover, it provides a test facility to study the key technology in ERL. System parameters are optimized for PKU ERL-FEL. The oscillation FEL output power is studied with different bunch charge, transverse emittance, bunch length and energy spread. The theory of optimal RF power and Q{sub ext} with ERL and without ERL is analyzed and applied to PKU injector and linac including microphonic effect. pace charge effect in the injector and merger is studied for beam energy at ~ 5 MeV. Simulation shows that in the 3 + 1 / 2 DC- C injector, there is a region the beam could be over focused by RF electromagnetic field and the transverse emittance in the transport line up to linac will increase instantly due to over focusing. In order to eliminate this effect on beam emittance, several solutions are investigated to avoid over focusing. This result {{is very important for}} beam loading experiment for low bunch charge operation. Meanwhile, different merger structures are compared in terms of error sensitivity and emittance increase with space charge effect. In <b>recirculation</b> beam <b>line,</b> a new symmetric 180 {degree} arc structure is designed. It fulfills the achromatic condition and adjustable bunch compression. These two parameters are controlled by different Quads knob. With this novel structure, the recirculation lattice can achieve path length adjustment, bunch compression and decompression in a large range. With beamline error, the beam central orbit will deviate from the designed trajectory. An orbit correction system is optimized, which balances between cost and performance of orbit after correction at design level. Different methods are used to estimate its robustness. The BBU instability, especially multi-pass BBU imposed a potentially severe limitation to the average current that can be accelerated in an ERL. Simulation gives the harmful HOMs and predicts that the threshold average current in this machine is much higher than the possible operation current. This work is based on the existing facility in PKU, so it provides guidelines for the facility operation and upgrade in the future.

The results of this investigation indicate that; (1) a solution to the stagnation properties calculational error that exists in the RELAP 4 code, when applied to the Evaluation Model, (RELAP 4 -EM) provides a conservative evaluation, relative to the Standard model (RELAP 4 -SM) regardless of which of the five critical flow models available in the code is selected; (2) of the five critical flow models available for use in RELAP$, the Moody model and the Henry-Fauske model are nearly equivalent in the relative degrees of conservatism. Following these models, in order of relative degree of conservatism, are the Modified Momentum/Homogeneous Equilibrium model and the Sonic model; (3) in order to best alleviate the stagnation properties codeing error, the flow areas for the volumes immediately upstream from the <b>recirculation</b> <b>line</b> rupture should be increased such that the area ration (break flow area/upstream volume flow area) is 0. 7.

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and {{industry}} contractors have undertaken activities {{to develop a}} simplified liquid oxygen (LO 2) propellant conditioning concept for future expendable launch vehicles. The objective of these activities is to reduce operations costs and timelines and to improve safety of these vehicles. The approach followed has been to identify novel concepts through system level studies and demonstrate the feasibility of these concepts through small-scale and full-scale testing. Testing will also provide data for design guidelines and validation of analytical models. Four different concepts are being investigated: no-bleed, low-bleed, use of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>line,</b> and helium (He) bubbling. This investigation is being done under a Joint Institutional Research and Development (JIRAD) program currently in effect between MSFC and General Dynamics Space Systems (GDSS). A full-scale test article, which is a facsimile of a propellant feed duct with an attached section to simulate heat input from a LO 2 turbopump, will be tested at the Cold Flow Facility at MSFC's West Test Area. Liquid nitrogen (LN 2), which has similar properties to LO 2, {{will be used in}} place of LO 2 for safety and budget reasons. Work to date includes design and fabrication of the test article, design of the test facility and initial fabrication, development of a test matrix and test procedures, initial predictions of test output, and heat leak calibration and heat exchanger tests on the test article. The tests for all propellant conditioning concepts will be conducted in the summer of 1993, with the final report completed by October, 1993...|$|E
40|$|Cryogens are viable {{candidate}} propellants for NASA's Lunar and Mars exploration programs. To {{provide adequate}} mass {{flow to the}} system's engines and/or to prevent feed system cavitation, gaseous helium (GHe) is frequently considered as a pressurant. During low gravity operations, a Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) is designed to maintain tank pressure during low gravity operations without propellant resettling. Therefore, {{a series of tests}} were conducted in the Multi-purpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) of Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in order to evaluate the effects of GHe pressurant on pressure control performance of a TVS with liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and nitrogen (LN 2) as the test liquids. The TVS used in these test series consists of a recirculation pump, Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion valve, and a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger combined with a longitudinal spray bar. Using a small amount of liquid extracted from the tank <b>recirculation</b> <b>line,</b> passing it through the J-T valve, and then through the heat exchanger, thermal energy is extracted from the bulk liquid and ullage thereby enabling pressure control. The LH 2 /GHe tests were performed at fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 % and LN 2 /GHe tests were conducted at fill levels of 50 % and 25 %. Moreover, each test was conducted with a specified tank ullage pressure control band. A one-dimensional TVS performance program was used to analyze and correlate the test data. Predictions and comparisons with test data of ullage pressure and temperature and bulk liquid saturation pressure and temperature with test data are presented...|$|E
40|$|In rapid {{accelerated}} hemodialysis (R-AHD), blood partially recirculates {{from the}} venous (outflow) to the arterial (inflow) line through a <b>recirculation</b> <b>line</b> (R) to selectively increase the filter {{blood flow rate}} (BFR). R-AHD PR uses two blood pump segments at the patient segment of the arterial line and at (R). To determine the effectiveness of R-AHD with regard to increasing anticoagulation and dialysis efficiency, we studied ten children with end-stage renal disease in two stages: stage 1 with 10 routine heparin R-AHD, then 10 half-dose heparin R-AHD, then 145 routine heparin R-AHD sessions for 1 month and then routine heparin double needle hemodialysis (DNHD) for one month (control). In stage 2, we dialyzed the patients with 10 routine heparin-mixed AHD PR and DNHD sessions, then eight low-dose heparin R-AHD PR" sessions, {{then one of the}} children with 10 no-heparin R-AHD PR sessions and then 10 routine heparin DNHD sessions" (control). Signs of blood clotting and dialysis efficiency were monitored. Blood clots appeared in four out of 165 R-AHD 0 (one pump circuit) sessions but in none of the 28 R-AHD PR sessions. In stage 1, the mean urea reduction rate was 0. 60, 0. 60 and 0. 70 for the R-AHD protocols, compared with 0. 71 for the control (P > 0. 05). In stage 2, the arterial blood urea nitrogen was reduced by 0. 66 ± 0. 15 after an R-AHD PR period, compared with 0. 79 ± 0. 18 after a DNHD period (P = 0. 059). In conclusion, R-AHD PR allowed successful low heparin and no heparin hemodialysis in children without increasing the patients′ BFR. However, the technique did not increase the efficiency of dialysis...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{containment}} isolation instrumentation automatically initiates closure of appropriate {{primary containment}} isolation valves (PCIVs). The {{function of the}} PCIVs, {{in combination with other}} accident mitigation systems, is to limit fission product release during and following postulated Design Basis Accidents (DBAs). Primary containment isolation within the time limits specified for those isolation valves designed to close automatically ensures that the release of radioactive material to the environment will be consistent with the assumptions used in the analyses for a DBA. The isolation instrumentation includes the sensors, relays, and switches that are necessary to cause initiation of primary containment and reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) isolation. Most channels include electronic equipment (e. g., trip units) that compares measured input signals with pre-established setpoints. When the setpoint is exceeded, the channel output relay actuates, which then outputs a primary containment isolation signal to the isolation logic. Functional diversity is provided by monitoring a wide range of independent parameters. The input parameters to the isolation logics are (a) reactor vessel water level, (b) area ambient temperatures, (c) main steam line (MSL) flow measurement, (d) Standby Liquid Control (SLC) System initiation, (e) main steam line pressure, (f) high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) and isolation condenser steam line flow, (g) drywell radiation and pressure, (h) HPCI steam line pressure, Mi) isolation condenser return flow, (j) <b>recirculation</b> <b>line</b> water temperature, and (k) reactor vessel pressure. Redundant sensor input signals from each parameter are provided for initiation of isolation. The only exception is SLC System initiation. Primary containment isolation instrumentation has inputs to the trip logic of the isolation functions listed below...|$|E
