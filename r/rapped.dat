40|$|<b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 {{are closely}} related {{proteins}} of the Ras family of small G-proteins. <b>Rap</b> 1 is well known to regulate cell-cell adhesion. Here, we have analysed the effect of Rap-mediated signalling on endothelial permeability using electrical impedance measurements of HUVEC monolayers and subsequent determination of the barrier resistance, which is a measure for {{the ease with which}} ions can pass cell junctions. In line with its well-established effect on cell-cell junctions, depletion of <b>Rap</b> 1 decreases, whereas activation of <b>Rap</b> 1 increases barrier resistance. Despite its high sequence homology with <b>Rap</b> 1, depletion of <b>Rap</b> 2 has an opposite, enhancing, effect on barrier resistance. This effect can be mimicked by depletion of the <b>Rap</b> 2 specific activator RasGEF 1 C and the <b>Rap</b> 2 effector MAP 4 K 4, establishing <b>Rap</b> 2 signalling as an independent pathway controlling barrier resistance. As simultaneous depletion or activation of both <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 results in a barrier resistance comparable to control cells, <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 control barrier resistance in a reciprocal manner. This <b>Rap</b> 1 -antagonizing effect of <b>Rap</b> 2 is established independent of junctional actin formation. These data establish that endothelial barrier resistance is determined by the combined antagonistic actions of <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the small}} GTPases of the Ras family, <b>Rap</b> {{proteins}} exhibit the highest homology with p 21 Ras. The four <b>Rap</b> proteins so far identified constitute two subgroups, comprising the <b>Rap</b> 1 (A,B) and the <b>Rap</b> 2 (A,B) proteins. The intracellular location of <b>Rap</b> 1 A, <b>Rap</b> 1 B and <b>Rap</b> 2 A proteins {{was investigated in}} mammalian cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Using a specific anti-Rap 1 affinity-purified antibody, both <b>Rap</b> 1 A and <b>Rap</b> 1 B proteins were localized to late endocytic compartments (late endosomes/lysosomes) in fibroblasts. The localization of the <b>Rap</b> 1 A and B proteins transiently overexpressed with the vaccinia T 7 system was identical to that observed for endogenous <b>Rap</b> 1 proteins. In contrast, epitope-tagged <b>Rap</b> 2 A protein colocalized with several markers of the Golgi complex, thus indicating that its site of function was distinct from that of <b>Rap</b> 1 A. In addition, morphological and subcellular fractionation studies provided evidence for the association of <b>Rap</b> 1 proteins with phagosomes displaying biochemical features of late endocytic structures in J 774 macrophages. Thus, the localization of <b>Rap</b> 1 A and <b>Rap</b> 1 B implicates their involvement in late endocytic/phagocytic processes...|$|R

40|$|Background Small GTPase <b>Rap</b> 1 {{has been}} implicated {{in a number of}} basic {{cellular}} functions, including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, proliferation and regulation of polarity. Evolutionarily con-served, <b>Rap</b> 1 has been studied in model organisms: yeast, Drosophila and mice. Mouse in vivo studies implicate <b>Rap</b> 1 in the control of multiple stem cell, leukocyte and vascular cell functions. In vitro, several <b>Rap</b> 1 effectors and regulatory mechanisms have been proposed. In particular, <b>Rap</b> 1 has {{been implicated in}} maintaining epithelial and endothelial cell junction integrity and linked with cerebral cavernous malformations.

5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees <b>rapped</b> over.|$|E

40|$|The low-molecular-mass rhoptry {{complex of}} Plasmodium falciparum {{consists}} of three proteins, rhoptry-associated protein 1 (<b>RAP</b> 1), <b>RAP</b> 2, and <b>RAP</b> 3. The genes encoding <b>RAP</b> 1 and <b>RAP</b> 2 are known; however, the <b>RAP</b> 3 gene has not been identified. In this study we identify the <b>RAP</b> 3 gene from the P. falciparum genome database and show that this protein {{is part of the}} low-molecular-mass rhoptry complex. Disruption of <b>RAP</b> 3 demonstrated that it is not essential for merozoite invasion, probably because <b>RAP</b> 2 can complement the loss of <b>RAP</b> 3. <b>RAP</b> 3 has homology with <b>RAP</b> 2, and the genes are encoded on chromosome 5 in a head-to-tail fashion. Analysis of the genome databases has identified homologous genes in all Plasmodium spp., suggesting that this protein plays a role in merozoite invasion. The region surrounding the <b>RAP</b> 3 homologue in the Plasmodium yoelii genome is syntenic with the same region in P. falciparum; however, there is a single gene.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the human}} general {{transcription}} factor IIF (TFIIF), a heteromeric complex of <b>RAP</b> 74 and <b>RAP</b> 30 subunits, {{was subjected to}} limited proteolysis with trypsin. The central region of <b>RAP</b> 74 was demonstrated to be highly sensitive to trypsin while both the N- and C-terminal regions contained trypsin-resistant structures. In contrast, <b>RAP</b> 30 digestion occurred after proteolysis of <b>RAP</b> 74. The digestion pattern of <b>RAP</b> 74 recruited into the preinitiation complex showed no marked difference from that of IIF, while <b>RAP</b> 30 in the complex was protected from trypsin. These results indicate that <b>RAP</b> 74 apparently contains three structural domains, the central {{one of which is}} externally surfaced and unstructured, but <b>RAP</b> 30 is internally wrapped by <b>RAP</b> 74.

40|$|<b>Rap</b> 1, {{a growth}} {{regulatory}} protein that is strongly expressed in human {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC), is inactivated by <b>rap</b> 1 GAP. Recent evidence in normal rat cells suggests that <b>rap</b> 1 GAP regulates proliferation. The objective {{of the current study}} was to in-vestigate whether <b>rap</b> 1 GAP functions as a tumor suppressor in SCC. Using a pull-down assay, active GTP-bound <b>rap</b> 1 was up-regulated in SCC compared to normal or immortalized keratinocytes. Because both <b>rap</b> 1 A and <b>rap</b> 1 B isoforms of <b>rap</b> 1 are expressed in SCC, the <b>rap</b> 1 GAP inactivation of both <b>rap</b> 1 isoforms was verified using cells transfected with EGFP-rap 1 A or EGFP-rap 1 B or co-transfected with FLAG-tagged <b>rap</b> 1 GAP. The results demonstrate that expression of <b>rap</b> 1 GAP in oropharyngeal SCC down-regulated active <b>rap</b> 1, ERK activation, and proliferation. Incubation of stably transfected SCC cells with nocodazole, an inhibitor of mitosis, caused a slower accumulation of <b>rap</b> 1 GAP-transfected cells in the G 2 phase, in comparison to the vector control, indicating that <b>rap</b> 1 GAP-transfected cells have slower progression through the cell cycle. This was supported by down-regulation of cyclin D 1, cdk 4, and cdk 6 in <b>rap</b> 1 GAP-transfected SCC cells. Furthermore, SCC cells transfected with <b>rap</b> 1 GAP produced significantly smaller tumors in nude mice as compared to controls (P < 0. 01). These novel findings suggest that <b>rap</b> 1 GAP acts as a tumor suppressor protein in SCC...|$|R

25|$|Initially {{language}} was a barrier for hip-hop in Japan. Rappers only <b>rapped</b> in English {{because it was}} believed that the differences between English and Japanese would make it impossible to rap in Japanese. Unlike English, the Japanese language ends phrases in auxiliary verbs. Whereas English ends in verbs or nouns, which are extremely common, Japanese rappers were limited by the small number of grammatically correct possibilities for ending a phrase. Japanese also lacks the stresses on certain syllables that provide flow to English rapping. Even traditional Japanese poetry was based on the numbers of syllables present, unlike English poetry, which was based on the stresses in a line. Most Japanese lyrical music was also formulated using textual repetition, not relying on the flow of the words.|$|E
40|$|Brush border {{formation}} during polarity {{establishment of}} intestinal epithelial cells is uniquely {{governed by the}} <b>Rap</b> 2 A GTPase, despite expression of the other highly similar <b>Rap</b> 2 isoforms (<b>Rap</b> 2 B and <b>Rap</b> 2 C).
