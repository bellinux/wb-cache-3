5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} about {{the success of the}} recent Pawnee harvest festival, city manager Paul (Phil Reeves) suffers a massive heart attack. Chris (Rob Lowe) accepts an offer to work as acting city manager while Paul recovers from bypass surgery. Chris {{requests}} of Leslie (Amy Poehler) more large-scale ideas to generate revenue, placing pressure on her to follow up the harvest festival, so she organizes a camping trip for the parks department to discuss ideas. Ann (Rashida Jones) feels awkward now that Chris is back; the two previously dated, but Chris broke up with Ann in such a friendly manner that she did not initially <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a break-up. Leslie invites Ann to the camping trip to help her feel better.|$|E

Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all a dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E

Howard was also involved in a civil case with Reed over custody of their son.|$|E
25|$|During {{the day the}} Mexican army {{tried to}} block the {{irrigation}} ditch leading into the Alamo. Texian Green Jameson tasked {{the men in the}} Alamo with finishing a well {{at the south end of}} the plaza. Although the men hit water, they weakened an earth and timber parapet by the low barracks; the mound collapsed, leaving no way to fire safely over that wall. The same day Texians spotted a Mexican general surrounded by aides and dragoons and fired, but did not hit any of them. The Texians did not <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Santa Anna.|$|E
25|$|The United States Coast Guard {{occasionally}} received telegrams from concerned citizens, {{who apparently}} did not <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a scripted show, pleading for them to rescue {{the people on the}} deserted island. The Coast Guard simply forwarded these telegrams to producer Sherwood Schwartz. In homage to those telegrams, the film Rescue from Gilligan's Island showed the successful rescue where Gilligan lights a fire aboard the castaways' makeshift raft and is chastised for a thoughtless, dangerous action by the others. However, the resultant smoke attracts the attention of a US Coast Guard helicopter, whose pilot commends Gilligan's fire; otherwise the castaways would have been adrift and unnoticed.|$|E

It's like they're {{punishing}} [...] for paying attention." [...] In {{the introduction to the}} ninth season DVD boxset, series creator Matt Groening describes [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as [...] "one of [...] least favorite episodes".

When a thief suddenly raids the promoter's office, Peter allows him to escape. Moments later, he discovers that Ben was carjacked, and killed. Peter pursues and confronts the carjacker, only to <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the thief he let escape. After Peter disarms him, the carjacker flees but dies in the process. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a military experiment by Oscorp's corporate rival and kills several scientists and the military's General Slocum.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} of Portal 2 initially envisioned it as a prequel to Portal {{set in the}} 1950s, long before GLaDOS took over the Aperture Science facility, with events set in motion when Aperture CEO Cave Johnson is put into a computer, only to <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake. Johnson would have led an army of robots, which would battle against the player to rise to power within Aperture. In June 2008, based on information from a casting call website and leaked script samples, Kotaku reported that Valve was seeking voice actors to play Johnson, named him as an AI and identified the game as a prequel. Valve attributed this leak to an [...] "overeager agent". Following negative playtester feedback about the omission of Chell and GLaDOS, Portal 2 was re-conceived as a sequel. The team returned {{to the idea of}} exploring parts of the facility from Aperture's early days, and reincorporated Johnson through a series of recordings.|$|E
500|$|Brad Dourif, Tim Curry, David Bowie, John Lithgow and James Woods were {{considered}} for the Joker. [...] Lithgow, during his audition, attempted to talk Burton out of casting him, a decision he would later publicly regret, stating, [...] "I didn’t <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> such a big deal". Burton wanted to cast Brad Dourif, but the studio refused. Robin Williams lobbied hard for the part. Jack Nicholson had been producer Michael Uslan's and Bob Kane's choice since 1980. Peters approached Nicholson {{as far back as}} 1986, during filming of The Witches of Eastwick. Nicholson had what was known as an [...] "off-the-clock" [...] agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming, as well as being off for Los Angeles Lakers home games. Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days. He received a $6 million salary, as well as {{a large percentage of the}} box office gross estimated between $60 million to $90 million.|$|E
500|$|The Day the Earth Stood Still: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated and {{conducted}} by Timothy Williams. Tyler Bates {{was brought in}} to compose the score for The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil's Rejects and Slither. Instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann, Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film, and he assumed that most people would not even <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a remake. Bates said, [...] "People revere an original property and feel that it's sacred, but frankly, there's a good story to be retold, as it applies to the climate of the world now. If that's something beyond the scope of a person's ability to take in, on a new level, without necessarily using the original as a criteria for whether or not they're going to enjoy it, then they probably shouldn't bother themselves with it." [...] The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith. When he got back to L.A., he created a sound loop on his GuitarViol to which Derrickson responded, [...] "I think that's the score!", when it was played for him. Bates utilized the theremin, which Herrmann heavily used for the original film's score. Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect, especially during Klaatu's surgery. A short segment from Bach's Goldberg Variations is heard playing in the background of the Professor's home when Klaatu visits the Professor which {{was not included in the}} film's accompanying soundtrack release.|$|E

2500|$|The flames were {{initially}} {{thought to be}} part of the act (the song's music video clearly shows flames blazing around the musicians); only as the fire reached the ceiling and smoke began to bank down did people <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> uncontrolled.

Draper recalls, [...] "Little girls would call and say, 'Helloooo, is [...] there? We just love him.' The only thing that's comforting is, they're pretty harmless at that age." [...] According to Nat, [...] "After the show came on, people began to really treat us like huge rock stars.

2500|$|More importantly, {{however, the}} Frankfurt School {{attempted}} {{to define the}} fate of reason in the new historical period. While Marcuse did so through analysis of structural changes in the labor process under capitalism and inherent features of the methodology of science, Horkheimer and Adorno concentrated on a re-examination of the foundation of critical theory. This effort appears in systematized form in Adorno's Negative Dialectics, which tries to redefine dialectics for {{an era in which}} [...] "philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> missed". Negative dialectics expresses the idea of critical thought so conceived that the apparatus of domination cannot co-opt it.|$|E
2500|$|By 1792, slave rebels {{controlled}} a {{third of}} the island. The success of the slave rebellion caused the newly elected Legislative Assembly in France to <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> facing an ominous situation. To protect France's economic interests, the Assembly granted civil and political rights to free men of color in the colonies [...] in March 1792. Countries throughout Europe as well as the United States were shocked by the decision, but the Assembly was determined to stop the revolt. Apart from granting rights to the free people of color, the Assembly dispatched 6,000 French soldiers to the island. The new governor sent by Paris, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax was a supporter of the French Revolution who abolished slavery in the Northern Province of Saint Domingue and had hostile relations with the planters, whom he saw as royalists.|$|E
