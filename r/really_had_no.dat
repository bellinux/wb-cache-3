5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was {{still very much a}} rugged wilderness, Northerners <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E

The U.S. <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> formal organization for providing foreign internal defense (FID) assistance, before {{the creation of}} the United States special operations forces. MAAG activities were intended to be largely advisory (i.e., noncombat), while the Special Forces was designed from the beginning for training and leading guerrillas of the host nation against an occupier.|$|E
25|$|One source {{estimated}} French military losses as 100–200 {{dead and}} wounded. The Austrians reported 43 dead and 161 wounded and 20 siege cannons either burst or became unusable from continuous firing. The Austrians <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance of capturing {{such a strong}} fortress. Ruault reported to the government that one-fourth of the houses in Lille were burnt. The political commissioners asserted that 500 houses were destroyed and another 2,000 damaged; the Church of Saint-Étienne was wrecked. One writer suggested that the damage was exaggerated for political purposes. Prudhomme attacked Duhoux in print for disobeying orders and Bourdonnaye for not relieving Lille sooner.|$|E

500|$|David Packard of DVD Verdict {{said that}} the live action scenes [...] "add to the silliness." [...] He also said [...] "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's {{eventual}} demise. Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo!

I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the album's {{commercial}} release, the Beach Boys {{were involved}} in the conception of the Monterey Pop Festival, which was held in June 1967. At the last minute, the band declined to appear at the event. Biographer David Leaf explained: [...] "Monterey was a gathering place for the 'far out' sounds of the 'new' rock, and the Beach Boys in concert <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> exotic sounds (excepting [...] "Good Vibrations") to display. The net result of all this internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go to Monterey, and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the 'underground' tide against them." [...] Publicly, the band said that they couldn't play for reasons pertaining to Carl's military draft, but many of the people involved with the festival thought that the group was simply too scared to compete with the [...] "new music". As author Steven Gaines writes, the decision [...] "had a snowballing effect" [...] that represented [...] "a damning admission that [...] were washed up".|$|E
500|$|In {{great pain}} while pulling sledges across the ice, McNish briefly rebelled, refusing {{to take his}} turn in the harness and protesting to Frank Worsley that since the Endurance had been {{destroyed}} the crew was no longer under any obligation to follow orders. Accounts vary as to how Shackleton handled this: some report that he threatened to shoot McNish; others that he read him the ship's articles, {{making it clear that}} the crew were still under obligation until they reached port. McNish's assertion would have normally been correct: duty to the master (and pay) normally stopped when a ship was lost, but the articles the crew had signed for the Endurance had a special clause inserted in which the crew agreed [...] "to perform any duty on board, in the boats, or on the shore as directed by the master and owner". Aside from this, McNish <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to comply: he could not survive alone and could not continue {{with the rest of the}} party unless he obeyed orders. Eventually, Shackleton decided that the attempt to pull the boats had been a mistake, and decided that the only solution was to wait for the movement of the ice to bring the party to open water.|$|E

500|$|The sixth season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the media. Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said, [...] "Wrapping up plot lines so quickly creates {{a bit of}} disappointment for audiences. Typically, season finales end with exciting cliffhangers to entice fan interest. Degrassi’s finale <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> loose ends. There is no pending excitement for fans and the two-part finale became a disappointment. The episodes felt more like a series finale rather than just a season ending." [...] In his end of year review, Joel Rubnoff of the Waterloo Region Record said Degrassi: The Next Generation {{was one of the}} best shows of 2007, adding, [...] "The greatest teen show on the planet rediscovers its mojo with a same sex romance between control freak Paige and teen rebel Alexa. The year's most compelling—and bittersweet—love story." [...] AfterEllen.com, a website which focuses on the portrayal of lesbian and bisexual women in the media, and owned by MTV Networks' Logo cable television network reported on the portrayal of two Degrassi: The Next Generation lesbian characters. [...] "Paige and Alex's relationship, developed over three seasons, has become one of the best portrayals of a lesbian teen relationship we've seen on American television," [...] said Sarah Warn, the website's Editor in Chief, before giving the series an [...] "A" [...] Grade for the portrayal of class issues, character development, sexual orientation, dialogue, the relationship and lesbian sex.|$|E

2500|$|One of Abbie Hoffman's {{well-known}} publicity stunts {{took place}} [...] in 1967, {{when he led}} members of the Yippie movement to the Exchange's gallery. The provocateurs hurled fistfuls of dollars toward the trading floor below. Some traders booed, and some laughed and waved. Three months later the stock exchange enclosed the gallery with bulletproof glass.

2500|$|Accounts of {{the amount}} of money that Hoffman and the group tossed was said to be as little as $30 to $300.

[...] "At that time we <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> notion of anything called a media event." [...] Yet the press was quick to react and by evening the event was reported around the world. After that incident, the stock exchange spent $20,000 to enclose the gallery with bulletproof glass.|$|E

2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe told me once ... that he <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
2500|$|Czechoslovak and Hungarian censuses {{are often}} used in {{political}} discussions, {{but they were not}} fully compliant and they did not measure the same data. According to the official Hungarian definition from 1900, a [...] "mother tongue" [...] was defined as a language [...] "considered by a person as his own, the best spoken and mostly preferred". This definition did not match the real definition of mother tongue, introduced subjective factors dependent on environment and opened the way for various interpretations. Further, in the atmosphere of raising magyarization, a person could be at risk if he did not declare the Hungarian language to be his favorite for a census commissar. Between 1880 and 1910, the Hungarian population increased by 55.9%, while Slovak population increased by only 5.5% though Slovaks had a higher birth rate at the same time. The level of differences does not explain this process by emigration (higher among Slovaks) or by population moves and natural assimilation during industrialization. In 16 northern counties, the Hungarian population rose by 427,238, while the majority Slovak population rose only by 95,603. The number of [...] "Hungarians who can speak Slovak" [...] unusually increased in a time when Hungarians <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> motivation to learn it – by 103,445 in southern Slovakia in absolute numbers, by 100% in Pozsony, Nyitra, Komárom, Bars and Zemplén County and more than 3 times in Košice.
