5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from <b>radiation</b> <b>damage,</b> by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> long ago.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to <b>radiation</b> <b>damage,</b> with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
50|$|Radiation {{retinopathy}} is {{very similar}} to other vascular diseases. Diabetes and <b>radiation</b> primarily <b>damage</b> the retinal capillaries.

40|$|The {{polarization}} switching {{processes in}} <b>radiation</b> <b>damaged</b> ferroelectrics were studied by the Merz method. In irradiated triglycine sulphate and sodium nitrite, the switching time depends exponentially on the applied electric field.

5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Under Weinberg's {{tenure as}} director, ORNL's Biology Division grew {{to five times}} the size of the next largest {{division}}. This division was charged with understanding how ionizing radiation interacts with living things and to try to find ways to help them survive <b>radiation</b> <b>damage,</b> such as bone marrow transplants. In the 1960s Weinberg also pursued new missions for ORNL, such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater. He recruited Philip Hammond from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the United States: the National Science Foundationâ€” Research Applied to National Needs Environmental Program.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most common}} {{radiation}} sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation, but {{large amounts of}} alpha particles which do not penetrate even {{a sheet of paper}} or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore invisible to normal radiation detectors. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause <b>radiation</b> <b>damage.</b> An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes {{obtained}} {{spectra of}} Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features {{similar to the}} surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have been in their present cold-temperature locations for timescales of billions of years. <b>Radiation</b> <b>damage</b> should also redden and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, {{as is the case with}} Pluto. Therefore, the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice. However, no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium has {{a potential}} use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized {{in order to}} deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.|$|E
40|$|Modeling {{techniques}} of P-N junctions {{have been applied}} for studying the physical parameters in metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor structures. A parameter extraction method provides a precise description {{of the changes in}} conduction processes due to <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> in the integral body-drain junction.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{theoretical}} study of Coulomb explosion in sili-cate glasses with low ionization potential under internal alpha-irradiation. The phenomenon was studied in the way of computer simulation, namely by the molecular dynamics (MD) method; parameters of the so-called lava-like fuel-containing materials (LFCM), were chosen as input parameters for the model due to its practical importance. LFCM are high-radioactive glasses, which were formed during an active stage of a well known heavy nuclear accident, occurred on Chornobyl NPP in 1986. Computer simula-tion revealed that Coulomb explosion really may occur in the LFCMs and leads to additional <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> under internal alpha-irradiation. The total quantity of atomic displacements produced in the way of Coulomb ex-plosion from each alpha-particle track is 40000 to 80000, which exceeds <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> from alpha-particle and heavy recoil nuclei altogether (about 3500) more than one order. Key words: Coulomb explosion, molecular dynamics, radioactive glasse...|$|R
50|$|Exposure of {{concrete}} structures to neutrons and gamma radiations in {{nuclear power plants}} and high-flux material testing reactor can induce <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> in their concrete structures. Paramagnetic defects and optical centers are easily formed, but very high fluxes are necessary to displace a sufficiently high number of atoms in the crystal lattice of minerals present in concrete before significant mechanical damage is observed.|$|R
5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent <b>radiation</b> <b>damage</b> in protein crystals.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{breakthrough}} publications, {{and support}} from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her {{to the use of}} X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after <b>radiation</b> <b>damage.</b> From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the nucleolus organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus. In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} uranium and thorium content, some zircons undergo metamictization. Connected to {{internal}} <b>radiation</b> <b>damage,</b> these processes partially disrupt the crystal structure and partly explain the highly variable properties of zircon. As zircon {{becomes more and}} more modified by internal <b>radiation</b> <b>damage,</b> the density decreases, the crystal structure is compromised, and the color changes.|$|E

40|$|As the {{chemical}} structures of <b>radiation</b> <b>damaged</b> molecules may differ greatly from their undamaged counterparts, investigation and description of <b>radiation</b> <b>damaged</b> structures is commonly biased by the researcher. Radical formation from ionizing radiation in crystalline Î±-L-rhamnose monohydrate {{has been investigated}} using a new method where the selection of radical structures is unbiased by the researcher. The method is based on using ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) studies to investigate how ionization damage can form, change and move. Diversity in the radical production is gained by using different points on the potential energy surface of the intact crystal as starting points for the ionizations and letting the initial velocities of the nuclei after ionization be generated randomly. 160 ab initio MD runs produced 12 unique radical structures for investigation. Out of these, 7 of the potential products have never previously been discussed, and 3 products are found to match with radicals previously observed by electron magnetic resonance experiments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{radiation}} on polymeric materials are a topic of concern {{in a wide range}} of industries including the sterilization, and the nuclear power industry. While much work has concentrated on systems like polyolefins that are radiation sterilized, some work has been done on epoxy systems. The epoxy system studied is an epoxy/amine paint which is representative of the paint that covers the inner surfaces of the French nuclear reactor containment buildings. In case of a severe accident on a Nuclear Power Plant, fission products can be released from the nuclear fuel to the reactor containment building. Among them, volatile iodine (I 2) can be produced and can interact with the epoxy-paint. This paint is also subjected to gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> (due to the high dose in the containment coming from radio-nuclides released from the fuel). So the epoxy-paint studied was exposed to gamma radiation under air atmosphere after being loaded with I 2 or not. The aim of this study is to characterize by FTIR spectroscopy the iodine-paint interactions, then to identify the <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> on the epoxy-paint, and to check their effects on these iodine-paint interactions. This work shows the potential of multi-block analysis method (ANOVA-PCA and COMDIM Â¼ AComDim) for such a study as it allows to identify the nature of iodine/epoxy-paint interactions and to characterize the gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>damages</b> on the epoxy-paint. AComDim method conduces to the extraction of Common Components to different tables and highlights factors of influence and their interactions...|$|R
