In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges major automakers selling cars in the Canadian province to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020.|$|E

40|$|One {{consequence}} of federal mandatory livestock price reporting regulations for the cattle industry was the discontinuation of eight regional voluntary price reports for slaughter cattle. The economic implication for market transparency in those affected <b>regional</b> <b>markets</b> is investigated. Agricultural Marketing News Services {{data were collected}} from discontinued price reports for a five-year period, along with aggregated regional price reports that were not eliminated under the new price reporting regime. Both sets of price reports were analyzed to determine if any of the price series, which continued to be published as mandatory reports, could be used by producers as a replacement for the discontinued reports in their respective regions. The empirical findings show that western <b>regional</b> <b>markets</b> currently do not have adequate, published, alternatives to replace the discontinued western regional price reports for live cattle. Midwestern <b>regional</b> <b>markets,</b> however, do have alternative price reports currently being published that can be used as alternative sources of market information. We conclude that market transparency was degraded in western <b>regional</b> <b>markets</b> relative to Midwest <b>regional</b> <b>markets</b> by the decision to eliminate the eight regional live cattle price reports.

25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{distance}} {{from the rest of the}} empire, Paraguay had little control over important decisions that affected its economy. Spain appropriated much of Paraguay's wealth through burdensome taxes and regulations. Yerba maté, for instance, was practically priced out of the <b>regional</b> <b>market.</b> At the same time, Spain was using most of its wealth from the New World to import manufactured goods from the more industrialized countries of Europe, notably Britain. Spanish merchants borrowed from British merchants to finance their purchases; merchants in Buenos Aires borrowed from Spain; those in Asunción borrowed from the porteños (residents of Buenos Aires), and Paraguayan peones (landless peasants in debt to landlords) bought goods on credit. The result was dire poverty in Paraguay and an increasingly impoverished empire.|$|E

Yet, in general, despite Greek colonization in such areas as Byzantium, Apollonia and other cities, the Thracians avoided urban life.

This American {{adaptation of the}} Famicom platform had been altogether deliberately delayed {{in the wake of}} the video game crash of 1983, a <b>regional</b> <b>market</b> disaster which the Japanese market had not directly experienced. The subsidiary did not want the increasingly popular Mario series to be known for maximal frustration and thus inaccessible to a recovering, transfiguring, and expanding market — nor to be stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 could be eventually converted to the NES's cartridge format, localized, and mass-produced for America. Utilizing considerable regional autonomy in order to avoid risking the franchise's popularity in this burgeoning market, they declined this game's American release and instead requested a newer and more friendly Super Mario Bros. sequel for the non-Japanese world.|$|E
40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>marketing</b> {{concepts}} can be {{a successful}} strategy for product differentiation. A research project in Northern Germany reveals the following results: consumers' stated preferences show clearly potential demand for regional food, in particular if environment-friendly produced and controlled. The main influencing factors that could be identified {{by means of a}} rank-ordered logit analysis are consumers' regional, nutrition, and environment consciousness as well as a low price sensitivity and mistrust in conventional food from somewhere else. Also some retailers indicated interest in <b>regional</b> <b>marketing</b> concepts, but rarely in environment-friendly produced food: listing of regional specialities and a seasonal offer as well as a farmer's market outlet in a shopping center. Further, farmers showed general interest in <b>regional</b> <b>marketing,</b> but not combined with environment-friendly production. Overall, one can conclude of these results, that the limiting factor for <b>regional</b> <b>marketing</b> seems to be more the supply than the demand side.
