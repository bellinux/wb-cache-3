30|$|Companies {{that take}} their {{responsibility}} seriously, comply with their information duty and eliminate SVHCs {{in all their}} articles are better prepared for upcoming restrictions and authorisation requirements can build trust in consumers and thus can profit from the resulting competitive advantage. However, the REACH <b>regulatory</b> <b>fitness</b> and performance programme evaluation (REACH REFIT) revealed that some retailers perceive their efforts to be well prepared for SVHC consumer requests as superfluous, as the interest by consumers for such information remains low [28]. Several results of our survey make it understandable, why many suppliers are reluctant to inform about SVHCs in their articles [5 – 8]: {{only a minority of}} all consumers would buy SVHC-containing articles with no strings attached (Question 25) and there were even consumers who regard the presence of an SVHC in an article as reason to return it to the retailer (Question 26). However, as long as only 4 % of the highly motivated and interested participants make the SVHC inquiries (Question 18, 19), the pressure applied by the consumers’ request to suppliers remains probably lower than other stimuli to substitute SVHCs in articles, such as the sun set date and the authorisation requirement according to REACH Art. 56, 58.|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Noise Directive (2002 / 49 /EC) (END) {{requires}} EU Member States {{to determine}} the exposure to environmental noise through strategic noise mapping and to elaborate action plans {{in order to reduce}} noise pollution, where necessary. A common framework for noise assessment methods (CNOSSOS-EU) has been developed by the European Commission in cooperation with the EU Member States and represents a harmonised and coherent approach to assess noise levels from the main sources of noise (road traffic, railway traffic, aircraft and industrial) across Europe. In 2015 CNOSSOS-EU became a new EU Commission Directive (based on a revised Annex II of the END) and will be mandatory for all EU Member States after 31 December 2018. In this presentation we will discuss a number of implementation challenges that should be faced in the context of current and potential EU noise policy developments and future perspectives before CNOSSOS-EU can become fully operational in the EU MS. With the purpose of more accurately estimating the exposure of EU citizens to potential harmful levels of environmental noise and assessing the associated burden of disease in Europe the implementation of CNOSSOS-EU in the EU Member States should be seen in strict relation to: (a) the on-going evaluation of the END implementation in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, EU added value and coherence {{in the context of the}} European Commission's <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Fitness</b> and Performance programme (REFIT); (b) the revised Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region under development by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and (c) the development of methods to assess the health implications of noise exposure by means of dose-effect relationships (revision of Annex III of the END).

40|$|Legionella pneumophila {{persists}} in incredibly diverse environments including intracellularly in myriad protists and mammilian lung macrophages, and extracellularly in natural and engineered water systems. Success {{in a given}} condition requires efficient regulation of appropriate gene and protein expression. A central regulator of the switch between two distinct expression profiles associated with the replicative and the transmissive cell types is CsrA, a highly conserved protein among many bacterial species. Interestingly, each of 14 surveyed strains in the Legionella genus encode between four and seven paralogs of the csrA gene. Every strain encodes {{a copy of the}} canonical csrA, as well as the non-redundant newly described csrR, which is a direct target of CsrA repression and itself promotes long-term survival in tap water. In addition, each strain encodes a variety of other csrA paralogs always associated with type IV secretion systems (T 4 SSs) in legionellae-specific horizontally acquired genomic islands referred to as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Bioinformatic analyses suggest that specific sequences of csrA-like genes are co-inherited with specific lineages of T 4 SSs. Ectopic expression of one of these ICE-associated csrA paralogs, csrT, resulted in repression of both ICE-dependent and core genome-associated fitness traits, such as resistance to hydrogen peroxide and cellular infectivity, respectfully. The observation that the core genome csrR and the ICE-associated csrT both demonstrated <b>regulatory</b> effects on <b>fitness</b> suggests that the Legionella genus extensively utilizes the csrA superfamily to control expression of genes and proteins to expand environmental versatility...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{over the}} last few decades have shown that {{antibiotic}} resistance mechanisms frequently confer a fitness cost and that these costs can be genetically ameliorated by intra- or extragenic second-site mutations, often without loss of resistance. Another, much less studied potential mechanism by which the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance could be reduced is via a regulatory response where the deleterious effect of the resistance mechanism is lowered by a physiological alteration that buffers the mutational effect. In mycobacteria, resistance to the clinically used tuberactinomycin antibiotic capreomycin involves loss-of-function mutations in rRNA methylase TlyA or point mutations in 16 S rRNA (in particular the A 1408 G mutation). Both of these alterations result in resistance by reducing drug binding to the ribosome. Here we show that alterations of tlyA gene expression affect both antibiotic drug susceptibility and fitness cost of drug resistance. In particular, we demonstrate that the common resistance mutation A 1408 G is accompanied by a physiological change that involves increased expression of the tlyA gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that methylates neighboring 16 S rRNA position C 1409, {{and as a result of}} increased TlyA expression the fitness cost of the A 1408 G mutation is significantly reduced. Our findings suggest that in mycobacteria, a nonmutational mechanism (i. e., gene <b>regulatory)</b> can restore <b>fitness</b> to genetically resistant bacteria. Our results also point to a new and clinically relevant treatment strategy to combat evolution of resistance in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Thus, by utilizing antagonistic antibiotic interactions, resistance evolution could be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} of proteins {{expressed in a}} particular environment are primary determinants of an organism's phenotypic and fitness properties. However, protein synthesis is costly and proteome size is limited; thus, the benefit of expressing proteins also comes with costs. In this thesis, I interrogate the evolutionary and regulatory trade-offs resulting from these proteome allocation constraints. Throughout the thesis I employ a genome-scale model of metabolism and protein synthesis for Escherichia coli, which can compute condition-specific proteome allocation requirements and limitations. First, I show that microbial growth rates are quantitatively determined by the expression of unused protein. Rather than supporting growth in the current environment, large fractions of the expressed proteome enable readiness for environmental change and stress. The expression of these different proteome segments is regulated by global transcription factors and results in fitness trade-offs. Second, I show that after selecting for growth through experimental evolution, several adaptive <b>regulatory</b> mutations increase <b>fitness</b> through proteome and energy resource re-allocation. These pleiotropic mutations in the RNA Polymerase systematically re-allocate the proteome towards growth and away from stress resistance, showing that fitness trade-offs are readily modulated by global regulators during evolution. Finally, I show that the diversity present in evolving populations is predictable and due to proteome allocation trade-offs. Rather than evolving to a unique optimum, a range of near-optimal proteomic and metabolic phenotypes is apparent when strains are independently evolved in the same environment. The diversity of alternative phenotypes reflects a rate-yield trade-off due to the varying protein cost of metabolic pathways in central carbon metabolism. Thus, proteome allocation constraints have a pervasive and predictable effect on bacterial ecology, regulation, and evolution...|$|R
