60|$|Mr. Newberry wore on {{his short}} {{circular}} person the summer costume {{of a man}} taking his ease and careless of dress: plain white flannel trousers, not worth more than six dollars a leg, an ordinary white silk shirt with a <b>rolled</b> <b>collar,</b> that couldn't have cost more than fifteen dollars, and on his head an ordinary Panama hat, say forty dollars.|$|R
25|$|The shawl lapel, <b>roll</b> <b>collar,</b> or {{shawl collar}} is a {{continuous}} curve. Originally {{seen on the}} Victorian smoking jacket, it is now most common on the dinner jacket or tuxedo. This similarly began as informal eveningwear, and was then made in both more and less formal versions, depending {{on the situation in}} which it was to be used. It is also commonly used on the mess jackets.|$|R
5000|$|The Peter Pan collar {{is a form}} of flat collar, one of {{the three}} basic collar types along with stand and <b>roll</b> <b>collars.</b> It is cut to fit around the neckline, {{following}} the curve, and to lie flat upon the torso. It can be made either as one part, with a front-fastening bodice, or in two parts to accommodate a back fastening while retaining the front opening. The collar is small and soft, with rounded corners.|$|R
60|$|I {{held out}} my arm across the threshold, {{and for the}} first time looked at the other man who had been on the point of entering. He was slight and {{somewhat}} sallow, with very high forehead and small deep-set eyes. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, the details of which, however, betrayed his status. He wore a heavy gold chain, a dinner coat, and a made-up white tie, with the ends tucked in under a <b>roll</b> <b>collar.</b> He appeared to be objectionable, but far from dangerous.|$|R

6000|$|With {{the elders}} it was {{sense of duty}} that prevailed. That, at all events, was English. The country must be saved. To {{their sons and daughters}} it was the originality, the novelty that {{gradually}} appealed. Mrs. Denton's Fridays became a new sensation. It came to be the chic and proper thing to appear at them in shades of mauve or purple. A pushing little woman in Hanover Street designed the [...] "Denton" [...] bodice, with hanging sleeves and square-cut neck.

50|$|The Corps reorganized its regimental band, {{which played}} at the monthly dances. Drill and ceremonies were still an {{important}} part of the Corps' activities. A regimental parade was held every month and the Corps was reviewed by the governor on the Common each year. The only dress uniform was the Army issue Class A olive drab uniform with a choke collar, later changed to a <b>roll</b> <b>collar</b> with tie. In April 1929 the Corps returned to its prewar full dress uniform; however, only enough uniforms for the band, regimental color guard and a 100-man marching unit could be purchased due to the expense.|$|R

60|$|He {{kept his}} word. I am wearing the fantaisie as I write. For a fantaisie, it is fairly quiet, {{except that it}} has three pockets on each side outside, and a <b>rolled</b> back <b>collar</b> {{suitable}} for the throat of an opera singer, and as many buttons as a harem skirt. Beyond that, it's a first-class, steady, reliable, quiet, religious fantaisie, such as any retired French ballet master might be proud to wear.|$|R
60|$|In Sir Hugo's {{youthful}} portrait with <b>rolled</b> <b>collar</b> {{and high}} cravat, Sir Thomas Lawrence had done {{justice to the}} agreeable alacrity of expression and sanguine temperament still {{to be seen in}} the original, but had done something more than justice in slightly lengthening the nose, which was in reality shorter than might have been expected in a Mallinger. Happily the appropriate nose of the family reappeared in his younger brother, and was to be seen in all its refined regularity in his nephew Mallinger Grandcourt. But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the family faces of various types, seen {{on the walls of the}} gallery; found no reflex. Still he was handsomer than any of them, and when he was thirteen might have served as model for any painter who wanted to image the most memorable of boys: you could hardly have seen his face thoroughly meeting yours without believing that human creatures had done nobly in times past, and might do more nobly in time to come. The finest childlike faces have this consecrating power, and make us shudder anew at all the grossness and basely-wrought griefs of the world, lest they should enter here and defile.|$|R
40|$|Coat of silk gazar with {{a printed}} pattern {{of red and}} white polka dots on a black background. The mid-length to below-knee length coat has a <b>rolled</b> <b>collar</b> and short sleeves with princess seaming. There is a center-front opening with 5 {{circular}} buttons covered with black gazar, and with piped buttonholes.

Coat has designer's label at inside back, below collar: "Givenchy", folded over and sewn {{in a way that}} obscures the rest of the label: "Made In / France". This coat is part of an ensemble that includes a dress of black gazar, and has matching shoes of same fabric made by Roger Vivier of Paris (1979. 011. 076) Donor notes: "This is the fabric that was invented for Balenciaga and now only Givenchy can have it [...] [the coat] is made so that if a dot had to be cut in half at a noticeable place, Givenchy had a whole dot appliqued over it. Monsieur Givenchy does not do this tedious handwork for all clients. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{the colors}} and textures of this {{collection}} were inspired by the octopus 2 ̆ 7 s physical skin, the essence is inspired by the its way of living. The hope is for the wearer to flourish within their own skin, relax into their being, and rekindle their curiosity of life. I searched {{for the existence of}} the octopus 2 ̆ 7 essence in other organisms and incorporated what I found into my senior collection. Vivacious life is inherently fragile, so throughout the collection protective shapes can also be seen within the looks. This design element is particularly strong in this second look, whose jacket was inspired by the nut-like hat of a mimosa blossom. In order to mimic its rounded design, a high <b>roll</b> <b>collar</b> was created that extends to form the body of the bolero. Its stand attaches to the facing and foam support structure within the coat. The coat was then decorated with felted pom poms and discs harkening the original inspiration of octopus by replicating the pattern of its tentacles. The dress that completes the look draws from both of the inspirations of the octopus and the blossom. Green, like that of a fresh bud, it features long gloved sleeves and corset-like seam lines that flare into an asymmetrical trumpet hemline...|$|R

50|$|After {{months of}} debate between Coppola and Paramount over Brando, the two finalists {{for the role}} were Borgnine and Brando, the latter of which Paramount {{president}} Stanley Jaffe required to perform a screen test. Coppola {{did not want to}} offend Brando and stated that he needed to test equipment in order to set up the screen test at Brando's California residence. For make-up, Brando stuck cotton balls in his cheeks, put shoe polish in his hair to darken it, and <b>rolled</b> his <b>collar.</b> Coppola placed Brando's audition tape {{in the middle of the}} videos of the audition tapes as the Paramount executives watched them. The executives were impressed with Brando's efforts and allowed Coppola to cast Brando for the role if Brando accepted a lower salary and put up a bond to ensure he would not cause any delays in production.|$|R
6000|$|Christina quickly {{took off}} her own thick cloth mantle, well lined with dressed lambskins, {{laid it on the}} floor, <b>rolled</b> the <b>collar</b> of it over a small log of wood--the only {{substitute}} she could see for a pillow--and showed an inviting couch in an instant. Ermentrude let her brother lay her down, and then was covered with the ample fold. She smiled as she turned up her thin, wasted face, faded into the same whitey-brown tint as her hair. [...] "That is good," [...] she said, but without thanks; and, feeling the soft lambswool: [...] "Is that what you burgher-women wear? Father is to give me a furred mantle, if only some court dame would pass the Debateable Ford. But the Schlangenwaldern got the last before ever we could get down. Jobst was so stupid. He did not give us warning in time; but he is to be hanged next time if he does not." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{half of a}} brick {{is still}} a brick. Half a brick is a block. A {{building}} block, it {{is a thing of}} construction. Repeated, it makes a wall. Unnoticed, it is a stumbling block. It is mobile. When lobbed, it brings the construction down. This research draws on legacies of minimalism, as exemplified in processes of isolation and the repetition of a singular unit – but it is not reductive. Literal theatricality is embraced and ramped up in the drafting of stage directions, and lighting and effects plots embedded as a part of picture making. As with theatrical scripts, a looped feedback of proposition and account is employed and items are expelled and accumulate around the questions: ‘What is the record?’ ‘What is the thing?’ Within this recursive process motifs appear. Each form, whether it be half a brick, a choral ode, a riddle, a monogram or a <b>rolled</b> butterfly <b>collar,</b> expands on the materiality and mechanisms of the thing itself. The approach is to creep up on it: a form of research by stealth...|$|R
40|$|A Coulomb {{friction}} damper, {{consisting of}} a case-hardened roll-threaded collar resting against a reverse taper segment of drill rod, is studied for its noise-reduction potential. Axial im-pact causes the drill rod to be excited in many transverse bend-ing modes of vibration, along with longitudinal and torsional resonances. Due to the inertia of the collar, simultaneous axial and rotational self-tightening motion occurs on the <b>rolled</b> thread. The <b>collar</b> consequently presses on the case-hardened tapered surface of the drill rod, inducing interfacial frictional rubbing, resulting in 5 - 45 dB of attenuation in peak acceleration of the modes of vibration, and reduction in decay time {{on the order of}} 10 seconds...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} examined the relative effectiveness and mental workload {{associated with the}} use of Anvis, Collar, and Theta symbologies for an attitude maintenance task. Subjects performed an attitude maintenance task and an auditory probe task in single- and dual-task conditions. Both the <b>Collar</b> (<b>roll)</b> and Theta (pitch) showed an advantage over the Anvis for minimizing deviations in attitude. Moreover, as indexed by the auditory probe task, the mental workload associated with performing the attitude maintenance task was generally less with the Collar and the Theta than with the Anvis. We suggest that the relative superiority of the Collar and the Theta can be attributed to the fact that these symbologies convey a strong sense of objectness...|$|R
