Based on this technique, the recycling BiCG algorithm has been developed recently. Here, we now generalize and extend this recycling theory to BiCGSTAB. Recycling BiCG focuses on efficiently solving sequences of dual linear systems, while the focus here is on efficiently solving sequences of single linear systems (assuming non-symmetric matrices for both recycling BiCG and recycling BiCGSTAB). As compared with other methods for solving sequences of single linear systems with non-symmetric matrices (e. g., recycling variants of GMRES), BiCG based recycling algorithms, like recycling BiCGSTAB, have the advantage that they involve a short-term recurrence, and hence, do not suffer from storage issues and are also cheaper {{with respect to the}} orthogonalizations.

We discuss the overall pathway of ribosome recycling in eubacteria with especial reference to the important role of the initiation factor 3 (IF 3) in this process. Depending on the step(s) at which IF 3 function is implicated, three models have been proposed. In model 1, RRF and EFG dissociate the post-TCs into the 50 S and 30 S subunits, mRNA and tRNA(s). In this model, IF 3, which binds to the 30 S subunit, merely keeps the dissociated subunits apart by its anti-association activity. In model 2, RRF and EFG separate the 50 S subunit from the post-TC. IF 3 then dissociates the remaining complex of mRNA, tRNA and the 30 S subunit, and keeps the ribosomal subunits apart from each other. However, in model 3, both the genetic and biochemical evidence support a more active role for IF 3 even at the step of dissociation of the post-TC by RRF and EFG into the 50 S and 30 S subunits...|$|E

A discussion of forest carbon storage, an important input in calculating the emission benefits of paper product recycling, is also included in this chapter. 1. A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF RECYCLING EPA defines recycling as “minimizing waste generation by recovering and reprocessing usable products that might otherwise become waste (i. e., recycling of aluminum cans, paper and bottles, etc.) ” (EPA, 2008). WARM considers the recycling of post-consumer materials, which are defined as “materials or finished products that have served their intended use and have been diverted or recovered from waste destined for disposal, having completed their lives as consumer items ” (EPA, 2008). <b>Recycling</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> that takes materials or products that are at end of life and transforms them into either (1) the same product or (2) a secondary product (see discussion of open- and closedloop recycling). When a material is recycled, it is used in place of virgin inputs in the manufacturing process, rather than being disposed of and managed as waste. Consequently, recycling provides GHG reduction benefits in two ways, depending upon the material recycled: (1) it offsets a portion of “upstream ” GHGs emitted in raw material acquisition, manufacture and transport of virgin inputs an...|$|E

We aimed to determine the contribution of plant and soil organic matter (SOM) to size classes of DOC in a field experiment with C 3 to C 4 vegetation change on two soil types through different seasons. Stable isotope ratios of DOC size classes were measured using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled on-line to liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC-IRMS). SEC resolved DOC into three size classes: very high molecular weight/vHMW (> 10 kDa), high molecular weight/HMW (0. 4 - 10 kDa) and low molecular weight/LMW (< 0. 4 kDa). HMW DOC was most abundant in all seasons, soil types and depths. In contrast, vHMW DOC was only seen post snowmelt in upper 20 cm and was mainly (87 ± 9 %) plant-derived. Through all seasons, HMW and LMW DOC had less than 30 % recent plant contribution. Similar size range and source of DOC size classes and soil chloroform fumigation extracts suggest microbial origin of DOC.

Murein <b>recycling</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> complex <b>process</b> with discrete steps {{taking place in}} the periplasm and the cytoplasm. The AmpG permease is critical to this process as it transports N-acetylglucosamine anhydrous N-acetylmuramyl peptides across the inner membrane. In Pseudomonadaceae, this intrinsic mechanism remains to be elucidated. Since the mechanism involves two cellular compartments, the characterization of transporters is crucial to establish the link. Results: Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 has two ampG paralogs, PA 4218 (ampP) and PA 4393 (ampG). Topology analysis using b-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase fusions indicates ampP and ampG encode proteins which possess 10 and 14 transmembrane helices, respectively, that could potentially transport substrates. Both ampP and ampG are required for maximum expression of b-lactamase, but complementation and kinetic experiments suggest they act independently to play different roles. Mutation of ampG affects resistance to a subset of b-lactam antibiotics. Low-levels of b-lactamase induction occur independently of either ampP or ampG. Both ampG and ampP are the second members of two independent two-gene operons. Analysis of the ampG and ampP operon expression using b-galactosidase transcriptional fusions showed that in PAO 1, ampG operon expression is b-lactam and ampR-independent, while ampP operon expression is b-lactam and ampR-dependent. b-lactam-dependen...|$|R

The motor protein myosin Vb regulates plasma membrane recycling through {{its association with}} Rab 11 a. Overexpression of the tail of myosin Vb disrupts trafficking out of plasma membrane recycling systems and leads to the accumulation of Rab 11 a in both polarized and non-polarized cells. We have investigated the association of Rab 11 family interacting protein 2 (Rab 11 -FIP 2) with myosin Vb as an adapter protein between Rab 11 a and myosin Vb. Immunofluorescence studies indicated a colocalization of endogenous Rab 11 -FIP 2 with green fluorescent protein-myosin Vb tail overexpressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Yeast two hybrid assays showed that amino acids 129 - 356 of Rab 11 -FIP 2 were important for binding to myosin Vb tail. In vitro association assays and co-transfection experiments in both MDCK and HeLa cells confirmed this result but further refined the binding site to amino acids 129 - 290 of Rab 11 -FIP 2. Like myosin Vb, functional studies indicated that Rab 11 -FIP 2 is also important for normal plasma membrane recycling. Green fluorescent protein-Rab 11 -FIP 2 (129 - 512), which lacks its amino-terminal C 2 domain, functioned as a dominant negative acting truncation that caused accumulation of Rab 11 a and disrupted IgA trafficking in MDCK cells and transferrin trafficking in HeLa cells.

40|$|Sustained {{directional}} fibroblast migration requires both polarized {{activation of}} the protrusive signal, Rac 1, and redistribution of inactive Rac 1 {{from the rear of}} the cell so that it can be redistributed or degraded. In this work, we determine how alternative endocytic mechanisms dictate the fate of Rac 1 in response to the extracellular matrix environment. We discover that both coronin- 1 C and caveolin retrieve Rac 1 from similar locations at the rear and sides of the cell. We find that coronin- 1 C-mediated extraction, which is responsible for Rac 1 <b>recycling,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> constitutive <b>process</b> that maintains Rac 1 protein levels within the cell. In the absence of coronin- 1 C, the effect of caveolin-mediated endocytosis, which targets Rac 1 for proteasomal degradation, becomes apparent. Unlike constitutive coronin- 1 C-mediated trafficking, caveolin-mediated Rac 1 endocytosis is induced by engagement of the fibronectin receptor syndecan- 4. Such an inducible endocytic/degradation mechanism would predict that, in the presence of fibronectin, caveolin defines regions of the cell that are resistant to Rac 1 activation but, in the absence of fibronectin leaves more of the membrane susceptible to Rac 1 activation and protrusion. Indeed, we demonstrate that fibronectin-stimulated activation of Rac 1 is accelerated in the absence of caveolin and that, when caveolin is knocked down, polarization of active Rac 1 is lost in FRET experiments and culminates in shunting migration in a fibrous fibronectin matrix. Although the concept of polarized Rac 1 activity in response to chemoattractants has always been apparent, our understanding of the balance between recycling and degradation explains how polarity can be maintained when the chemotactic gradient has faded...|$|R

They possess MurNAc- 6 -phosphate (MurNAc- 6 P) etherase (MurQ in E.  coli) enzymes, which are responsible for the intracellular conversion of MurNAc- 6 P to N-acetylglucosamine- 6 -phosphate and d-lactate. By applying mass spectrometry, we observed accumulation of MurNAc- 6 P in MurNAc- 6 P etherase deletion mutants but not in either the isogenic parental strains or complemented strains, suggesting that MurQ orthologs are required for the recycling of cell wall-derived MurNAc in these bacteria. Quantification of MurNAc- 6 P in ΔmurQ cells of S.  aureus and B.  subtilis revealed small amounts during exponential growth phase (0. 19  nmol and 0. 03  nmol, respectively, per ml of cells at an optical density at 600 nm [OD 600] of 1) but large amounts during transition (0. 56  nmol and 0. 52  nmol) and stationary (0. 53  nmol and 1. 36  nmol) phases. The addition of MurNAc to ΔmurQ cultures greatly increased the levels of intracellular MurNAc- 6 P in all growth phases.

Horticultural films include several quite different products: mulch and fumigation films, low and high tunnels, greenhouse and hoophouse covers, irrigation tubes, bags for inputs and storage, and more. At this point in time, virtually all are recyclable, though each with some challenges. These challenges fall into one of three categories: (i) characteristics inherent to these plastics, (ii) characteristics of the products after use on farms and in nurseries, and (iii) cost and logistics of collection and transport from fields (or nurseries) to <b>recycling</b> markets. <b>Recycling</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> multi-stepped <b>process</b> that involves collecting used material, reclaiming it, and then manufacturing new products with the recycled content. Materials that enter the <b>recycling</b> stream <b>are</b> not fully recycled until they are made into something new. Thus simply hauling recyclables away from the farm (or other place where they were used) does not constitute recycling. The recycling life cycle involves users who separate recyclables from garbage, haulers who collect the recyclables, and reclaimers (also called processors) who do some of the following: clean, shred, compact, densify, pelletize, etc. Reclaimers will buy plastic recyclate from haulers only if they can sell their processed plastic to manufacturers who will incorporate it into new products. (To increase efficiency, improve the profit margin, and guarantee that they will have an adequate supply, many recycling companies carry out more than one of these recycling functions. They will, for example, both collect and process plastic, or process and also manufacture new products.) Very importantly, for <b>recycling</b> to <b>be</b> successful and sustainable over time, consumers—industrial and commercial buyers, government procurement offices, and individuals—must choose to buy products that are made with recycled content. Purchasing power is the fuel that keeps the gears of recycling turning...|$|R

In particular, evapotranspiration {{from the}} Amazon basin contributes substantially to precipitation regionally {{as well as}} over other remote regions such as the La Plata basin. Here we present an in-depth analysis of South American moisture recycling mechanisms. In particular, we quantify the importance of cascading moisture recycling (CMR), which describes moisture transport between two locations on the continent that involves re-evaporation cycles along the way. Using an Eulerian atmospheric moisture tracking model forced {{by a combination of}} several historical climate data sets, we were able to construct a complex network of moisture recycling for South America. Our results show that CMR contributes about 9 – 10 % to the total precipitation over South America and 17 – 18 % over the La Plata basin. CMR increases the fraction of total precipitation over the La Plata basin that originates from the Amazon basin from 18 – 23 to 24 – 29 % during the wet season. We also show that the south-western part of the Amazon basin <b>is</b> not only <b>a</b> direct source of rainfall over the La Plata basin, but also a key intermediary region that distributes moisture originating from the entire Amazon basin towards the La Plata basin during the wet season. Our results suggest that land use change in this region might have a stronger impact on downwind rainfall than previously thought. Using complex network analysis techniques, we find {{the eastern side of the}} sub-tropical Andes to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> key region where CMR pathways are channeled. This study offers a better understanding of the interactions between the vegetation and the atmosphere on the water cycle, which <b>is</b> needed in <b>a</b> context of land use and climate change in South America.

40|$|The south east Levantine {{basin of}} the eastern Mediterranean <b>is</b> <b>a</b> uniquely P starved system with a nitrate:phosphate ratio in the deep water of 25 – 28 : 1, a PON:POP ratio of 27 – 32 : 1 and a DON:DOPUV ratio of 100 : 1 (which {{probably}} represents a DON:DOPTOTAL of 50 : 1). The C:N:P ratio of nutrients accumulated in the deep water from decomposed organic matter was 106 : 8. 5 – 10. 8 : 0. 34 – 0. 43 similar to the measured ratios for dissolved and particulate organic matter and {{much higher than the}} Redfield ratio. It is concluded that the P limitation {{of the eastern}} Mediterranean is {{due to the lack of}} P within the system and not in the preferential removal of P relative to N. Results from the first extensive deployment of on-board nanomolar nutrient measurements in this low nutrient low chlorophyll system showed that free ammonia (50 – 80 nM) was present in the surface waters while nitrate was less than 10 nM, confirming the results obtained elsewhere in the CYCLOPS addition experiment results that grazing/nutrient <b>recycling</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dominant <b>process</b> in this system. The total DIN:DIP ratio in the nutrient depleted waters above the chlorophyll maximum was predominantly greater than 16 : 1, suggesting that the system has not switched to N limitation. A primary nitrite maximum was observed immediately below the chlorophyll maximum at the top of the nutricline, which was similar to those found previously in oligotrophic ocean locations. Where nanomolar technology was deployed through the nutricline, it was found that the phosphocline started at the same depth as the nutricline for nitrate and silicate, a conclusion that would not have been made if only conventional micromolar technology had <b>been</b> available. <b>A...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cold in Place <b>Recycling</b> (CIPR) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{treatment}} <b>process</b> of {{road that}} had a structural defect. The process consists of recycling asphalt from the pavement layer to a certain layer {{in order to improve}} the pavement structure. The process involves breaking up and pulverizing the existing pavement. This material will be named Recycle Asphalt Pavement (RAP). Even though the CIPR method is proved successfully implemented but due to lack of knowledge and understanding about this method, it’s only applied in about 10 % of total Malaysian roads length. The aim {{of this study is to}} encourage interested parties to have more understanding in the CIPR treatment by broaden its spectrum.

40|$|Protein {{biosynthesis}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> core <b>process</b> in {{all living}} organisms. Assembly of the protein chain from aminoacids is catalysed by the ribosome, ancient and extremely complex macromolecular machine. Several different classes of accessory molecules {{are involved in}} translation, and one set of them, called translational GTPases (trGTPases), was in {{the focus of this}} work. In this thesis properties of two trGTPases– EF-G and eRF 3 - were studied by means of direct biochemical experiments. EF-G <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bacterial trGTPase involved in two steps of translation: translocation and ribosomal <b>recycling.</b> Translocation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of the ribosomal movement along the mRNA, and recycling as the step when upon completion of the protein ribosome is released from the mRNA via splitting in two ribosomal subunits. We found that off the ribosome EF-G has similar affinities to GDP and GTP, and thus given the predominance of the latter in the cell, EF-G should be present mostly in the complex with GTP. However, binding to the ribosome increases factors affinity to GTP drastically, ensuring that it is in the GTP-bound state. GDP can not promote neither translocation, not recycling, and GDPNP can not promote recycling. It can, however, promote translocation, but in so doing it results in an intermediate ribosomal state and translocation process can be reversed by addition of GDP, which is not the case for the EF-G•GTP-catalyzed reaction. The second trGTPase we investigated is eukaryotic termination factor eRF 3. This protein together with another factor, eRF 1, is involved translation termination, which is release of the synthesized protein from the ribosome. We demonstrateed, that eRF 3 alone has basically no propensity to bind GTP and thus resides in the GDP-bound state. Complex formation between eRF 1 and eRF 3 promotes GTP binding by the latter, resulting {{in the formation of the}} ternary complex eRF 1 •eRF 3 •GTP, which in turn is catalyzing the termination event. Experimental investigations of trGTPases where rationalized within a generalized thermodynamical framework, accommoding the existent experimental observations, both structural and biochemical...|$|R
