40|$|Factors are {{obtained}} from semiempirical equations for correcting engine-cylinder temperatures for variation in important engine and cooling conditions. The variation of engine temperatures with atmospheric temperature is treated in detail, and correction factors {{are obtained}} for various flight and test conditions, such as climb at constant indicated air speed, level flight, ground <b>running,</b> <b>take-off,</b> constant {{speed of cooling}} air, and constant mass flow of cooling air. Seven conventional air-cooled engine cylinders enclosed in jackets and cooled by a blower were tested {{to determine the effect}} of cooling-air temperature and carburetor-air temperature on cylinder temperatures. The cooling air temperature was varied from approximately 80 degrees F. to 230 degrees F. and the carburetor-air temperature from approximately 40 degrees F. to 160 degrees F. Tests were made over a large range of engine speeds, brake mean effective pressures, and pressure drops across the cylinder. The correction factors obtained experimentally are compared with those obtained from the semiempirical equations and a fair agreement is noted...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Running</b> <b>take-offs</b> on {{forward dive}} groups (including twists) are allowed, given {{there is enough}} space for the approach.|$|R
5000|$|The lotus kick is {{also known}} as jump outside, outside spinkick, Wai Xuan Feng Tui, or Teng kong bai lian. This is a very popular jump in Wushu kung fu martial arts. The kick begins by {{launching}} off from the right leg into a 360째 clockwise rotation that includes an outward snapkick in the air. The performer may land on the right leg or both legs. The kick may be performed from both a <b>running</b> or standing <b>take-off.</b> Advanced practitioners may increase the difficulty of the move by rotating greater than 360째, usually 540째 or 720째. In traditional Chinese longfist kung fu, it is typically used as a long-range attack, much like a tornado kick.|$|R
5000|$|The Mistel {{series of}} fighter/powered bomb {{composite}} ground-attack aircraft pre-dated the He 162 by over two years, and the Mistel 5 project study in early 1945 proposed the mating of an He 162A-2 to the Arado E.377A flying bomb. The fighter would sit atop the bomb, which would itself {{be equipped with}} two underwing-mounted BMW 003 turbojets. This ungainly combination would take off on a sprung trolley fitted with tandem wheels on each side for the [...] "main gear" [...] equivalent, derived from that used on the first eight Arado Ar 234 prototypes, with all three jets <b>running.</b> Immediately after <b>take-off,</b> the trolley would be jettisoned, and the Mistel would then fly to within strike range of the designated target. Upon reaching this point, the bomb would be aimed squarely at the target and then released, with the jet turning back for home. The Mistel 5 remained a [...] "paper project", as the Arado bomb never progressed beyond the blueprint stage.|$|R
