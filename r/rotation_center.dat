5000|$|The {{identification}} of the theoretical/geometrical horopter with the Vieth-Müller circle should be reconsidered. It was pointed out in Gulick and Lawson (1976) [...] that Müller's anatomically incorrect assumption that the nodal point and eye <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> are coincident should be rejected. Unfortunately, their attempt to correct this assumption was flawed, as demonstrated in Turski (2016). This analysis shows that, for a given fixation point, one has a different horopter circle for each different choice of the nodal point’s location. Moreover, if one changes the fixation point along a given Vieth-Müller circle such that the vergence value remains constant, one obtains an infinite family of such horopters, {{so long as the}} nodal point is not at the eye’s <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> These statements follow rather simply from the Central Angle Theorem and the fact that three non-collinear points give a unique circle. What is less simple to show is the fact that, for fixations along a given Vieth-Müller circle, all the corresponding horopter circles intersect at the point of symmetric convergence. This result implies that each member of the infinite family of horopters is also composed of a circle in the fixation plane and a perpendicular straight line passing through the point of symmetric convergence (located on the circle) so long as the eyes are in primary or secondary position.|$|E

But even when ocular mechanics are simplified to pure rotations about a head-fixed <b>rotation</b> <b>center,</b> their noncommutative property makes them difficult to visualize.

50|$|The {{collimation}} of {{the machine}} means that, while rotating, the X-rays project only a limited portion of the anatomy onto the film at any given instant but, as the rotation progresses around the skull, a composite picture of the maxillo-facial block is created. While the arm rotates, the film moves in a such way that the projected partial skull image (limited by the beam section) scrolls over it and exposes it entirely. Not all of the overlapping individual images projected on the film have the same magnification because the beam is divergent and the images have differing focus points. Also not all the element images move with the same velocity on the target film as {{some of them are}} more distant from and others closer to the instant <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> The velocity of the film is controlled in such fashion to fit exactly the velocity of projection of the anatomical elements of the dental arch side which is closest to the film. Therefore, they are recorded sharply while the elements in different places are recorded blurred as they scroll at different velocity.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} analysis on the performance degradation of inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imagery with the polar format algorithm (PFA) due to the inaccurate <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> And a novel algorithm is developed to estimate the <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> for ISAR targets to overcome the degradation. In real ISAR scenarios, the real <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> shift is usually not coincided with the gravity center of the high-resolution range profile (HRRP), due to the data-driven translational motion compensation. Because of the imprecise information of <b>rotation</b> <b>center,</b> PFA image yields model errors and severe blurring in the cross-range direction. To tackle this problem, an improved PFA based on integrated cubic phase function (ICPF) is proposed. In the method, the <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in the slant range is estimated firstly by ICPF, and the signal is shifted accordingly. Finally, the standard PFA algorithm {{can be carried out}} straightforwardly. With the proposed method, wide-angle ISAR imagery of non-cooperative targets can be achieved by PFA with improved focus quality. Simulation and real-data experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposal.|$|E
30|$|This paper first {{introduces}} the standard PFA processing for ISAR imaging and then analyzes the performance degradation {{caused by the}} imprecise <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> From the analysis, one can find that the PFA image by using an inaccurate <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> {{is equivalent to the}} response of a disturbance system with the ideal PFA image as the input. Therefore, for real applications of PFA, an accurate and robust method for rotation parameter estimation is necessary.|$|E

40|$|Linear {{piezoelectric}} gauges, {{eddy current}} transducers and other control and measuring devices {{have been widely}} applied for vibration diagnostics of objects in industry. Methods based on such gauges and used for measuring angular and linear vibrations do not provide the possibility to assess a <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> or point angle of an object. Parasitic oscillations may occur during rotor rotation {{and in some cases}} the oscillations are caused by dis-balance. The known methods for measuring angular and linear vibrations make it possible to detect the phenomenon and they do not provide information for balancing of the given object. For this very reason the paper describes a method for obtaining instantaneous <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in the vibrating object. It allows to improve informational content of the measurements owing to obtaining additional data on position of object <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> The obtained data can be used for balancing of a control object. Essence of the given method is shown by an example of piezoelectric gauges of linear vibrations. Two three-axial gauges are fixed to the investigated object. Then gauge output signals are recalculated in angular vibrations of the object (for this purpose it is necessary to know a distance between gauges). Further projection positions of the object <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> are determined on three orthogonal planes. Instantaneous <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> is calculated according to the position of one of the gauges. The proposed method permits to obtain data on linear and angular vibrations and <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> position of the vibrating object using one system of linear gauge. Possibilities of object diagnostics are expanded due to increase in number of determined parameters pertaining to object moving. The method also makes it possible to reduce material and time expenses for measurement of an angular vibration component.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Aseptic {{loosening}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} problems in hip replacement surgery. The <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> of the hip is believed to influence the longevity of fixation. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of cemented and cementless cup fixation techniques on the position of the center of rotation because cemented cup fixation requires the removal of more bone for solid fixation than the cementless technique. Methods We retrospectively compared pre- and post-operative positions of the hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in 25 and 68 patients who underwent artificial hip replacements in our department in 2007 using cemented or cementless cup fixation, respectively, with digital radiographic image analysis. Results The mean horizontal and vertical distances between the <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> and the acetabular teardrop were compared in radiographic images taken pre- and post-operatively. The mean horizontal difference was − 2. 63 mm (range: - 11. 00 mm to 10. 46 mm, standard deviation 4. 23 mm) for patients who underwent cementless fixation, and − 2. 84 mm (range: - 10. 87 to 5. 30 mm, standard deviation 4. 59 mm) for patients who underwent cemented fixation. The mean vertical difference was 0. 60 mm (range: - 20. 15 mm to 10. 00 mm, standard deviation 3. 93 mm) and 0. 41 mm (range: - 9. 26 mm to 6. 54 mm, standard deviation 3. 58 mm) for the cementless and cemented fixation groups, respectively. The two fixation techniques had no significant difference on the position of the hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in the 93 patients in this study. Conclusions The hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> was similarly restored using either the cemented or cementless fixation techniques in this patient cohort, indicating that the fixation technique itself does not interfere with the position of the center of rotation. To completely answer this question further studies with more patients are needed. </p...|$|E

Methods: In a comparative non-random prospective study, 64 adult patients underwent elective total hip arthroplasty using the minimally-invasive posterior approach performed by one single surgeon, All patients included in this study had a superior and lateral migration of the <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> of the hip in comparison to the normal contralateral hip. Patients were excluded from the study if they presented the following: diagnosis of femoral neck fracture, displasic hip types 2, 3 and 4 (Crowe`s classification), osteoarthritis of the contralateral hip. Of the 64 patients in the study, 39 had a radiographic pre-op acetabular size planning equal or less than 50 mm and 25 patients had a radiographic pre-op acetabular size planning equal or more than 52 mm. We considered a good result the following goals: acetabular bend between 35 and 50 degrees, acetabular size according to the pre-op estimative with full contact in the three zones of DeLee-Charnley, a lower medial and vertical positioning of the <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in comparison with the pre-op values and a final limb discrepancy lower than 10 mm. Results: A better restoration of the <b>rotation</b> <b>center,</b> as well as, excellent acetabular positioning was found in patients with smaller acetabular size (equal or less than 50), p= 0, 04. We must draw attention to two risks when using the minimally-invasive posterior approach: a vertical acetabular position and a lateral position of the acetabular component increasing the risk of a poor contact in the zone 1 due to an insufficient reaming of the medial acetabular host bone. Conclusion: We propose standard surgical approaches in patients with larger anatomical measurements (acetabular planning size more than 50) ...|$|E
