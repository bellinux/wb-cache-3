40|$|This study {{investigates the}} marine vehicle {{accident}} characteristicsin the inland waterways of Bangladesh. The statistical {{study revealed that}} the leading causes of accidents were collision among ships, trawlers & country boats and loss of stability due to Nor'wester. The study also identified some other causes of accidents such as loss of stability due to <b>rushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger,</b> overloading, grounding, etc. It was also observed that many accidents in Bangladesh often remain underreported due to less exposure to the media probably because the victims represent the poorer segment of the society. Based on this study a number of recommendations have been made for improving safety of marine vehicles in Bangladesh and for further research and investigations...|$|R

[...] Railway Pravasi Sangh President Subhash Gupta told the paper, [...] "I am aware of this issue and also took it up in the meeting with railway officials. The railway FOB here can't take the burden of thousands <b>of</b> additional Metro <b>passengers.</b> The rush has increased manifold after Metro services started." ...|$|R
50|$|The Rajkot Secunderabad Express is {{a popular}} train in the South Central Railway zone of the Indian Railways. It is only one among the three trains {{connecting}} Hyderabad with Rajkot {{in the state of}} Gujarat, the other two being the Kakinada - Bhavnagar Express and the Rameswaram - Okha Express. Initially the train ran for only once a week. But, due to the increasing <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> the train was made bi-weekly in June 2001 and tri-weekly in April 2003.|$|E
50|$|Once open, the <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> was {{so great}} that for a time, the railway did not even bother with advertising. Among the various kinds of freight carried on the railway were {{agricultural}} products, ores from local mines, and wood from the heavily forested mountain region. Wood remained the most important kind of goods on the Mariazell Railway right up until freight operations were discontinued. As early as 1909, standard-gauge goods wagons were being transported along the Mariazellerbahn on transporter wagons, insofar as the railway's narrow loading gauge would allow it.|$|E

Then the throb of the propeller slackened, and when the Estremedura lay rolling wildly athwart the long, moonlit heave, an uproar broke out in the engine room below. The Castilian is excitable, and apt to lose his head when orders which he cannot understand are hurled at him, while Macallister, when especially diligent, did not trust to words alone, but used lumps of coal and heavy steel spanners. He was just then apparently chasing his greasers and firemen up and down the engine room. There was a <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> apprehensive <b>passengers</b> towards the open skylights, from which steam as well as bad language ascended, and Austin, who went with them, found Jacinta by his side.|$|R

50|$|Maihar {{is placed}} quite well {{as far as}} {{connectivity}} is concerned. It is connected via both major rail routes and National Highway 7. The Mahakoshal Express provides a daily direct connection from Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin station. The Mahakoshal train (Train no. is 12189(Jbp to Delhi) and 12190(Delhi to Jbp))runs between Hazrat Nizamuddin station and Jabalpur station which is situated about 722 km past Maihar. Maihar railway station is situated in between Katni and Satna stations of the West Central Railway. During the Nav Ratra festivals there is a heavy <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> pilgrims.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore the {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time in high-speed rail hub, this paper analyzed the influencing factors <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time, based on the survey <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time in high-speed rail hub. And the main influencing factors were screened out using variance analysis. Then the prediction model <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time based on BP neural network was established, {{the parameters of the}} model were calibrated and the validity was verified. The results show that, travel time in urban area, trip distance, familiarity toward the hub, educational background <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> and the type of transportation is the main influencing factor <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time in high-speed rail hub, and the average relative error is only 9. 2 % using the proposed prediction model <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time based on BP neural network...|$|R
