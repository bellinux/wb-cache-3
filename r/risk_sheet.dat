An information system for data collection (corporate memory) and analysis (algorithm) supports the presented method. Data acquisition is based on structured <b>risk</b> <b>sheets</b> that maintain all the required information for the analysis. Processing is based on three managerial roles required by the method: The Risk Manager, the Bid Manager and the Knowledge Manager, each one using his expertise to analyse information and fill in the method's <b>risk</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>Risk</b> assessment algorithm is based on two different scales {{in order to be}} adaptable to specific industrial needs.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} using the partial least squares (PLS) path {{modelling}} methodology in archival auditing research by replicating {{the data and}} research questions from prior bank audit fee studies. PLS path modelling allows for inter-correlations among audit fee determinants by establishing latent constructs and multiple relationship paths in one simultaneous PLS path model. Endogeneity concerns about auditor choice can also be addressed with PLS path modelling. With a sample of US bank holding companies for the period 2003 - 2009, we examine the associations among on-balance <b>sheet</b> financial <b>risks,</b> off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risks</b> and audit fees, and also address the pervasive client size effect, {{and the effect of}} the self-selection of auditors. The results endorse the dominating effect of size on audit fees, both directly and indirectly via its impacts on other audit fee determinants. By simultaneously considering the self-selection of auditors, we still find audit fee premiums on Big N auditors, which is the second important factor on audit fee determination. On-balance-sheet financial risk measures in terms of capital adequacy, loan composition, earnings and asset quality performance have positive impacts on audit fees. After allowing for the positive influence of on-balance <b>sheet</b> financial <b>risks</b> and entity size on off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risk,</b> the off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risk</b> measure, SECRISK, is still positively associated with bank audit fees, {{both before and after the}} onset of the financial crisis. The consistent results from this study compared with prior literature provide supporting evidence and enhance confidence on the application of this new research technique in archival accounting studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{assessment}} of scientific approaches to the classification of banking risks, clarifying their classifications and types, the place of off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risks</b> in the proposed classification. It was determined that the complexity of identifying the risks is associated with fuzzy and multi-directional positions on the allocation of its classification. The article specifies the signs of risk classification and singles out the banking risks which contributes to the improvement of the theoretical foundations of risk management in the context of improving the identification and assessment of risks and the development of effective anti-crisis measures. The author determines the place of off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risks</b> in the current classification system and refines their essence: the off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risk</b> should be understood the potential for increasing the credit risk of the institution as a result of insufficient information display of off-balance sheet operations (relative to the presence and movement of resources and their sources, not belonging to the enterprise, but only temporarily at its disposal) in financial statements of the borrower. It is noted that the nature of off-balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risks</b> are unpredictable, nonquantificational, internal (related to the lack of completeness of the company’s financial information) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop an}} incentive-based theory of margins {{in the context}} of a {{tradeoff}} between the benefits of hedging in terms of enhanced risk-sharing and its costs in terms of financial instability. We model hedging as the design of a contract between a protection buyer, seeking to reduce his risk exposure, and a protection seller. If the seller learns that the hedge is likely to be loss-making for her even though actual losses have not materialized yet, her incentives to control the risk of her other positions (balance <b>sheet</b> <b>risk)</b> diminish. The seller’s risk-taking incentives limit hedging and generate endogenous counterparty risk.

40|$|The town of Santa Teresa (Cusco Region, Peru) {{has been}} {{affected}} by several large debris-flow events in the recent past, which destroyed parts {{of the town and}} resulted in a resettlement of the municipality. Here, we present a risk analysis and a risk management strategy for debris-flows and glacier lake outbursts in the Sacsara catchment. Data scarcity and limited understanding of both physical and social processes impede a full quantitative risk assessment. Therefore, a bottom-up approach is chosen in order to establish an integrated risk management strategy that is robust against uncertainties in the risk analysis. With the Rapid Mass Movement Simulation (RAMMS) model, a reconstruction of a major event from 1998 in the Sacsara catchment is calculated, including a sensitivity analysis for various model parameters. Based on the simulation results, potential future debris-flows scenarios of different magnitudes, including outbursts of two glacier lakes, are modeled for assessing the hazard. For the local communities in the catchment, the hazard assessment is complemented by the analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery and fieldwork. Physical, social, economic, and institutional vulnerability are considered for the vulnerability assessment, and risk is eventually evaluated by crossing the local hazard maps with the vulnerability. Based on this risk analysis, a risk management strategy is developed, consisting of three complementing elements: (i) standardized <b>risk</b> <b>sheets</b> for the communities; (ii) activities with the local population and authorities to increase social and institutional preparedness; and (iii) a simple Early Warning System. By combining scientific, technical, and social aspects, this work {{is an example of a}} framework for an integrated risk management strategy in a data scarce, remote mountain catchment in a developing country...|$|R
