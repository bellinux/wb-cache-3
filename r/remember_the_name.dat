25|$|The Romans finally {{captured}} the Antonia Fortress {{and began a}} frontal assault on {{the gates of the}} Temple. Titus was apparently bent on ending Judaism as a religion. He sought to slaughter their animals, kill their men, rape their women, enslave their children, and kill their God. When he finally did breach the walls, his soldiers set upon everyone – man, woman, child, those who stayed loyal to Rome, and those who did not. The city went up in flames. The roar of the inferno mixed with screams of agony as the Romans swept through the upper and lower city, literally clambering over dead bodies in pursuit of the rebels, until they reached the Temple, set it aflame, and reduced it to dust. When the fires subsided, Titus gave the order to destroy the remainder of the city, seeking that no one would <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Jerusalem. The Temple was demolished, after which Titus' soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory.|$|E

In addition, Glover was a former writer on 30 Rock. Coincidentally, guest star Queen Latifah executive produces the romantic comedy television series Let's Stay Together that airs on BET.|$|E

500|$|... "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] {{was one of}} {{the very}} first {{psychedelic}} instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band. It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with [...] "Astronomy Domine"), although band members would later disparage this term. [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying to hum a song he could not <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of (most commonly identified as Love's cover of [...] "My Little Red Book"). Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett followed Jenner's humming with his guitar and used it {{as the basis for the}} principal melody of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Bassist Roger Waters once told Barrett that the song's riff reminded him of the theme tune from Steptoe and Son (by Ron Grainer). Around the time the song was written, Barrett was also inspired by AMM and their guitarist Keith Rowe, who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar's fretboard.

They mostly ignore him, despite his eagerness to talk about his acting experiences and his requests for a drink. Terry is irritable and impatient, unwilling to talk to Tina or Gemma about a prank with him dressed up as a gorilla. This prank led to a young boy wetting himself and a previous cancellation of Scaredy Cam. The programme is due to return on a different channel, and Terry has chosen a different prank to be announced as the winner of a [...] "public" [...] vote for the programme's best.

Robin Oliver writing for The Sydney Morning Herald said that Frank was Home and Away's [...] "good-looking young hero". Linda Barnier and Ben Doherty of The Newcastle Herald summed Frank up as [...] "the bloke who married tomboy Bobby after he left Roo at the altar, after he recovered from a serious car accident that left him in a coma at a general hospital and before he ran off to the States for a sea change." [...] Doherty also named Frank an [...] "old favourite" [...] of the series.

2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you {{put your hands on}} me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title. [...] "How brilliant. The title of the song is rhythmically weighted two ways—it's like a flank attack. Two sides of the same face.

2500|$|The {{freshman}} then [...] "pops to" [...] {{attention and}} [...] "sounds off", loudly greeting the upperclassman with [...] "Howdy, Ms. Smith, Ma'am!"

If the fish does not recall an upperclassman's name, he or she must whip out again. Freshmen must also observe a complex set of rules governing when and where whipping out to and greeting upperclassmen is appropriate. For example, fish in the band must whip out to other bandsmen anywhere on campus, but they need not whip out to non-band cadets unless they are on the Quad.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a medical}} missionary, Dr. Cadbury cared greatly for his patients.
