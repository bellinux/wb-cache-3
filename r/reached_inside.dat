5|$|The second {{main event}} match had Bearer's Undertaker {{fighting}} DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker {{walked to the}} ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He <b>reached</b> <b>inside</b> the casket and pulled out an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver. As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away.|$|E
500|$|Although {{supporting}} the Conservative Party {{before and after}} that moment, Seara was focusing its efforts on attacking the Conservative-Democratic Party of Take Ionescu, with whom the Conservative Premier Titu Maiorescu had formed a coalition (one resented by Cantacuzino and Bogdan-Pitești). In this context, critic Ion Vianu notes, Seara became [...] "an aggressive publication, {{with a history of}} base attacks and blackmail." [...] The anti-Ionescu discourse was notably outlined in an Arghezi article of September 11, 1913. It collectively and disparagingly identified the Conservative-Democrats (or Takists) as ciocoi ("upstarts"), accusing them of having repressed in blood the 1907 peasant revolt: [...] "They are the symbol of 1907, when, his arms, chest, shoulders and back loaded with ravens, with ciocoi, the peasant tore himself away from his field, split himself, fought to chase them away and [...] fell down murdered by the claws that clutched down, tore down into his flesh and <b>reached</b> <b>inside</b> to his soul and killed it as well. These ciocoi, we will eradicate." [...] In a 1913 issue, Romanian Land Forces General Ștefan Stoica referred to Ionescu's men as craii de Curtea-Veche ("the Old Court rakes"), another colloquialism for [...] "upstarts".|$|E
2500|$|M.C. Hammer {{was arrested}} on February 21, 2013 in Dublin, California for {{allegedly}} obstructing {{an officer in the}} performance of their duties and resisting an officer (according to [...] "stop and identify" [...] statutes). Hammer claims he was a victim of racial profiling by the police, stating an officer pulled out his gun and randomly asked him: [...] "Are you on parole or probation?" [...] Hammer stated that as he handed over his ID, the officer <b>reached</b> <b>inside</b> the car and tried to pull him out. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was 'blasting music' in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner. [...] "After asking Hammer who the registered owner was, he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions," [...] police spokesman Herb Walters typed in an e-mail to CNN. Hammer was booked and released from Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. A court date was scheduled, however, all charges were dropped in early March. Hammer tweeted that he wasn't bitter and considered what happened [...] "a teachable moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and <b>reached</b> <b>inside</b> the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move! Fuck!” Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|E

5000|$|To <b>Reach</b> <b>Inside</b> a Vault: Bucklow's {{most recent}} {{body of work}} {{is a series of}} {{paintings}} which he is thinking of presenting under the title To <b>Reach</b> <b>Inside</b> a Vault. These are oil paintings on canvas, mostly very large in size. (The image shown here, for example is 64×200 inches.) They are filled with symbols which Bucklow describes as being produced by his mind as authentic symbols for itself. The paintings seem to flow out of him, to be thought about and analyzed only after they are finished. Bucklow says, in talking about his motives in making these works, [...] "I question the role and place of my consciousness within the totality of my unconscious mental systems" [...] (taken from an interview with the artist in eyeful magazine, 2009).|$|R

Most modern vibraphonists are highly skilled in this technique.|$|R
5000|$|At midnight, on 5 March 2000&#160;— after 12 {{hours of}} continual pain, Ramírez {{sat down on}} a bench and drank three small glasses of hard liquor.

50|$|B/OB mode is an {{intermediary}} between the optical breakdown mode (OB mode) and the filamentary mode (F mode). The plasma density generated in this mode {{can go from}} 0 to the critical value i.e. optical breakdown threshold. Intensities <b>reached</b> <b>inside</b> the B/OB zone can range from multi-photon ionization threshold to the optical breakdown threshold. In the visible-IR domain, B/OB mode is obtained under very tight external focusing (high numerical aperture), to avoid self-focusing, and for intensities below optical breakdown threshold. In the UV regime, where optical breakdown intensity threshold is below self-focusing intensity threshold, tight focusing is not necessary. The shape of the ionization area {{is similar to that}} of the focal area of the beam, and can be very small (only a few micrometres). B/OB mode is possible only at short pulse durations, where AI's contribution to the total free electron population is very small. As the pulse duration becomes even shorter, the intensity domain where B/OB is possible becomes even wider.|$|E
50|$|Incubators were expensive, so {{the whole}} room was often kept warm instead. Cross-infection between babies was greatly feared. Strict nursing {{routines}} involved staff wearing gowns and masks, constant hand-washing and minimal handling of babies. Parents were sometimes allowed to watch {{through the windows of}} the unit. Much was learned about feeding—frequent, tiny feeds seemed best—and breathing. Oxygen was given freely {{until the end of the}} 1950s, when it was shown that the high concentrations <b>reached</b> <b>inside</b> incubators caused some babies to go blind. Monitoring conditions in the incubator, and the baby itself, was to become a major area of research. Most early units had little equipment, providing only oxygen and warmth, and relied on careful nursing and observation. In later years, further research allowed technology to play a larger role in the decline of infant mortality. The development of pulmonary surfactant, which facilitates the oxygenation and ventilation of underdeveloped lungs, has been the most important development in neonatology to date.|$|E
