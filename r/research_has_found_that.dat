5|$|Some {{evidence}} {{does suggest that}} the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions {{could be used to}} forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.|$|E

50|$|New {{developments}} in <b>research</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> targeted autophagy {{may be a}} viable therapeutic solution in fighting cancer. As discussed above, autophagy plays both a role in tumor suppression and tumor cell survival. Thus, the qualities of autophagy {{can be used as}} a strategy for cancer prevention.

After this point, each additional person has less of an influencing effect. However, adding more members to a small group (i.e., 3 to 4 people) has a greater effect than adding more members to a larger group (i.e., 53 to 54 people) (Aronson).|$|R

50|$|Some {{studies suggest}} grazing may be {{beneficial}} in nutrient-rich conditions and harmful on habitats poor in nutrients. In other cases grazing will not affect ecosystems whatsoever. For instance, in the Mongolian rain forest, Cheng et al. <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> grazing pressure plays a highly, positive important role in species richness in the wetter steppe of the rain forest. The same <b>research</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in the dryer, desert ecosystem grazing pressure did not affect species richness significantly. In habitats with extremely poor in nutrients, grazing could potentially wipe out what little plants are present.|$|R
