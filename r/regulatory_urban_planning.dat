40|$|The main aim of Work package 5. 2 is to {{identify}} and integrate appropriate productive re-use of urban water for agriculture into the policy, legislative and <b>regulatory,</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> and decision-making frameworks of cities. The Work package is being implemented in three cities; Accra, Beijing and Lima, and linkages have been developed fwith Hamburg. Urban agriculture contributes {{to a wide variety}} of urban issues; it provides multiple benefits for urban inhabitants and can have many different functions. There are three challenges. The first challenge is to address the diversity and variety of urban farmers and livelihoods. A second challenge is to seek to involve, and undertake appropriate research with, the stakeholders who represent this diversity of functions. The third challenge is to facilitate integration of (water for) urban agriculture into city planning and policy making. This paper will present an overview of a situation analysis undertaken in WP 5. 2 and ongoing action research and demonstrations in these three cities. An update will also be given on the multi-stakeholder processes and action research on productive use or re-use of water in Accra, Beijing, and Lima as part of the Learnin...|$|E

Chapter 1 identifies recent fundamental challenges faced by urban areas in the region. Chapter 2 describes the varying nature of the urban context within which planning takes place, with emphasis on the socio-spatial issues which are of concern to <b>urban</b> <b>planning.</b> Chapter 3 reviews the emergence of contemporary or modern <b>urban</b> <b>planning.</b> A discussion {{of the nature of}} the institutional and <b>regulatory</b> framework for <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> is then provided in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 examines the extent to which the planning process is inclusive of relevant stakeholders and communities (participatory/collaborative planning). Chapter 6 considers the role of <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> in promoting sustainable urban development. An assessment of planning responses to informality in cities including the emergence of related processes (peri-urbanization, urban sprawl, metropolitanization and rural densification) is undertaken in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8, the effects of infrastructure provision on the spatial structure of cities and the implications for planning are reviewed. Chapter 9 discusses the extent to which monitoring and evaluation of <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> is an integral part of planning processes.

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{the importance and}} role of <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> in spatial planning. Generally, these plans have {{the character of a}} specific regulation, establishing rules and outlining directives for the development of localities, determining the areas to be built and the areas with no constructions in a certain locality, assigning the functions in localities, thus influencing the development and organization of the territory. Any construction or any investment is {{made on the basis of}} such a <b>plan</b> (General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan,</b> Zonal <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan,</b> and Detailed <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan)</b> following the legislation and the plans for that specific territory at that moment. The wider territorial plans (plans made for the national territory or at a county scale) and the present urban legislation regulate the manner of intervention on a territory through <b>urban</b> <b>plans.</b> However, the <b>urban</b> regulations apply differently according to the specificity of the rural area, taking into account the cultural influences, the traditions, customs, the relief forms, population, etc. (i. e. the General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> for Săvădisla – Hungarian influences in land <b>planning,</b> the General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> of Râşca, the General <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> of Unguraş – planning influenced by the landscape). The Zonal <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> and the Detailed <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> are documents that have the role of modifying the regulations of the general <b>urban</b> <b>plan,</b> establishing new requirements for building regime and spatial arrangement (ex. Zonal <b>Urban</b> <b>Plan</b> of Călăţele holiday village - planning of a tourist area), taking into account the area’s specificity and the needs of the community, the territorial offer etc. The <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> can contribute to the spatial development of a locality by setting the functions and facilities, yet they can also restrict and limit the way in which a rural locality develops...|$|R

One of the theories increasingly researched by urban planners is realisation of participatory planning to facilitate public participation. This approach, as an effective bottom-up method, should increase the capabilities of planners to solve urban problems by including the general public in the <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> process. This paper proposes a framework for a Web-based spatial decision support system (WebGIS-SDSS) adjusted to a participatory <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> approach. The framework, called Web-based participatory <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> (WPUP), has been implemented in a case study. It offers a Web-based spatial forum to demonstrate how the proposed system can not only help citizens to share their idea regarding <b>urban</b> <b>plans,</b> but also help planners to implement applicable bottom-up and public participation decision-making theory in the <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> process. WPUP supports the deliberative and analytic components of the collaborative spatial decision-making process. It facilitates inclusion of local knowledge in <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> to complement traditional approaches.
