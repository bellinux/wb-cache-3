6000|$|Now {{that the}} fight was over the people, to use Scott's words, [...] "turned their eyes with one consent on the man, by whose {{unbending}} fortitude, and pre-eminent talents, this triumph was accomplished." [...] He was hailed joyously and blessed fervently wherever he went; the people almost idolized him; he was their defender and their liberator. No monarch visiting his domains could have been received with greater honour than was Swift {{when he came into}} a town. Medals and medallions were struck in his honour. A club was formed to the memory of the Drapier; shops and taverns bore the sign of the Drapier's Head; children and women carried handkerchiefs with the Drapier's portrait woven in them. All grades of society respected him for an influence that, founded in sincerity and guided by integrity and consummate ability, had been used patriotically. The DEAN became Ireland's chiefest citizen; and Irishmen will ever revere the memory of the man who was the first among them to precipitate their national instincts into the abiding form of national power--the <b>reasoned</b> <b>opinion</b> of a free people.|$|E

It has prevailed, so far as we can discover, not only in all the courts which now exist, whether of law or equity, but in those which have been suppressed or disused, such as the Court of Wards and the Star Chamber. An author quoted by Rushworth, speaking of the constitution of that chamber, says,--"And so it was resolved by the Judges, on reference made to them; and their opinion, after deliberate hearing, and view of former precedents, was published in open court."[28] It appears elsewhere in the same compiler that all their proceedings were public, even in deliberating previous to judgment.|$|E

40|$|The Early Warning System gives {{national}} parliaments {{the right to}} intervene in European Union policy-making. This article investigates their incentives to submit <b>reasoned</b> <b>opinions.</b> It analyses the reactions of 40 parliamentary chambers to 411 draft legislative acts between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013 by ReLogit models. The article argues that, beyond institutional capacity, political motivation explains cross-chamber and inter-temporal variation. Higher levels of party political contestation over EU integration have a positive effect, but greater party dispersion on the left-right dimension negatively affects submissions. Furthermore, salient and urgent draft legislative acts incentivise parliaments to become active in the Early Warning System. Finally, some findings suggest that minority governments and economic recession represent positive conditions for unicameral parliaments and lower chambers to submit <b>reasoned</b> <b>opinions.</b> The findings are discussed {{with reference to the}} role of {{national parliaments}} in EU democracy...|$|R

This thesis provides empirical findings in the field of the usage of the EWM. In particular it focuses on the adaption of the Czech, Slovak, and Polish parliaments to the EWM and analyses whether the understanding of the principle of subsidiarity by the respective chambers influences their activity in the EWM. This thesis combines a broad range of data sources including: firstly, primary sources such as official documents, <b>reasoned</b> <b>opinions</b> available from relevant databases (IPEX) and a questionnaire filled out by the parliamentary staff; secondly, secondary sources such as previous research in the field, and lastly direct observations. This study concludes that subsidiarity control is understood by the national parliaments as a tool to defend their legislative prerogatives.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} a novel method for opinion elicitation, {{which is based}} on the popular 3 D online world of “Second Life”. Here people, as avatars, are put into a somewhat realistic context related to the topic for which opinions are sought. We hypothesize that this kind of concrete, interactive context supports the evocation of opinions better than noncontext methods, e. g. only showing related images. To confirm our hypothesis, we conducted a small pilot study, which compares the influence of static and interactive context methods on the opinions expressed by subjects. The opinion elicitation scenario in Second Life is supported by the automatic retrieval of opinions from the web. The results of a study indicate that subjects show more <b>reasoned</b> <b>opinions</b> in the interactive condition. A demo illustrating the content of this paper is available...|$|R

Since 2009 the necessary threshold (i. e. {{one third of the}} total number of votes) has only been reached three times.

The subsidiarity concerns were rejected by the Commission and the legislative process continues despite deep divisions between old and new Member States over the controversial policy issue of revising the Posted Workers Directive...|$|R

According to EFSA, the submitted data are sufficient to confirm the MRL proposal of 0. 9 mg/kg for pome fruits as derived in the previous EFSA <b>reasoned</b> <b>opinion.</b> The MRL proposal of 0. 09 mg/kg for apricots has been derived, in {{accordance with}} the provisions of the EU guidance document on extrapolation from residue trials on peaches and apples. Although the data are compliant with the data requirements, EFSA recommends performing additional trials on apricots to confirm that the MRL is sufficient to cover the use on apricots. The new freezer storage stability study submitted for dodine in high oil content matrices confirms the validity of the residue trials on olives. Thus, the data gap identified in the previous opinion with regard to the MRL for olives (20 mg/kg) is sufficiently addressed. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the new intended less critical uses on pome fruit and apricots which result in lower MRL proposals compared to the existing MRLs, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore are unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
