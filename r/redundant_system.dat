500|$|By 2005, when Radiant Dawns {{predecessor}} Path of Radiance was released, the Fire Emblem series {{had successfully}} established itself overseas {{first with the}} release of Fire Emblem for the Game Boy Advance and then Path of Radiance for the GameCube. The developers at Intelligent Systems wanted to continue the story of Path of Radiance on home consoles, but they decided not to release on the Gamecube as it was becoming a <b>redundant</b> <b>system.</b> Instead, as they had seen the Fire Emblem series' ability to sell hardware, they chose to develop the next title for the then-in-development Wii. Development began in May 2005, the same time the Wii was first announced under its codename [...] "Revolution". The reason development began so early was because they wanted to release Radiant Dawn {{as close as possible to}} the console's release, so it would boost both hardware and software sales: this was the first time in the series' history the developers had attempted anything like that. They also decided to make it a Wii exclusive rather than making versions for both Wii and Gamecube, as the new graphics meant the game could not run on Gamecube. This in turn coincided with the decision to keep the series on home consoles rather than developing for the new portable Nintendo DS after its absence from them between the releases of Path of Radiance and [...] The Wii's motion controls options were not implemented into the gameplay as it felt unnecessary to the design. Wi-Fi compatibility had been considered, with features such as downloadable battle maps and units, although difficulties relating to balance and difficulty prevented the idea from developing.|$|E

However, genetic deletion of IDO in female mice does not lead to the rejection of their foreign fetal offspring, indicating that a <b>redundant</b> <b>system</b> for the suppression of the mother's immune response exists in the uterus during pregnancy. In addition, HLA-G expresses oligosaccharides that are very different from those linked to other HLA class I molecules, so the possibility [...] exists that HLA-G at the fetomaternal interface is itself employing its unusual carbohydrate sequences as functional groups to suppress the mother's immune response.|$|E
2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the <b>redundant</b> <b>system.</b> A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E

40|$|Design {{diversity}} {{has long}} been used to protect <b>redundant</b> <b>systems</b> against common-mode failures. The conventional notion of diversity relies on "independent" generation of "different" implementations. This concept is qualitative and {{does not provide a}} basis to compare the reliabilities of two diverse systems. In this paper, for the first time, we present a metric to quantify diversity among several designs. Based on this metric, we derive analytical reliability models that show a simple relationship between design diversity, system failure rate, and mission time. In addition, we present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of design diversity in Duplex and Triple Modular <b>Redundant</b> (TMR) <b>systems.</b> For independent multiple-module failures, we show that, mere use of different implementations does not always guarantee higher reliability compared to <b>redundant</b> <b>systems</b> with identical implementations [...] - it is important to analyze the reliability of <b>redundant</b> <b>systems</b> using our metric. For common-mode failures and design faults, there is a significant gain in using different implementations [...] - however, as our analysis shows, the gain diminishes as the mission time increases.
