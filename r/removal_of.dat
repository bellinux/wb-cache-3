40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} studied enhanced {{treatment of}} sewage from discharging points of rivers by biofilm process dosing with enzyme and promotion effect of enzyme on {{treatment of sewage}} by biofilm process, and investigated {{the effect of the}} ratio of CODCr to total nitrogen (C/N) on <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> pollution indexes. The research results indicated that with the decrease <b>of</b> C/N, the <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> CODCr were stable and the <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> NH 3 -N increased, but the <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> TN obviously decreased in the three reactors. When C/N= 5, the average <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> TN was higher than 30 % in reactor B and C. When C/N= 3, it decreased and maintained about 30 %. When C/N= 2, it was low and approximately 20 %. When C/N= 5, 3 or 2 ，the <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> CODCr, NH 3 -N and TN greatly increased in reactor B and C than in reactor A, which indicated that the promotion effects of the composite enzyme and the compounded enzyme on the <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> the target pollutants were favorable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} studied enhanced {{treatment of}} sewage from discharging points of rivers by biofilm process dosing with enzyme and promotion effect of enzyme on {{treatment of sewage}} by biofilm process, and investigated the changes <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> the main pollution indexes at different temperature to ensure the optimal temperature. The research results indicated that temperature was an important factor influencing the <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> the main pollution indexes. When temperature was {{in the range of}} 5 °C- 8 °C, the promotion effects of enzyme on the <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> CODCr and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) of sewage by biofilm process were not obvious. However when temperature were in the ranges of 15 °C- 18 °C and 22 °C- 25 °C, enzyme had the high promotion effects on the <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> the pollution indexes. Furthermore, within the certain temperature (5 °C- 25 °C), the <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> CODCr and NH 3 -N were on the rise with the increase of temperature. When temperature increased from 5 °C- 8 °C to 15 °C- 18 °C, the <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> CODCr obviously increased, but when temperature continued to increase to 25, the rise trend <b>of</b> the <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> CODCr became slow. On the other hand, when temperature increased from 5 °C- 8 °C to 22 °C- 25 °C, the increase <b>of</b> the <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> NH 3 -N was always evident. Therefore, the optimal temperature was in the range of 22 °C- 25 °C for the enhanced treatment of sewage from discharging points of rivers by biofilm process dosing with enzyme...|$|R

Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery.
