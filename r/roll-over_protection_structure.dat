40|$|The rate of {{occupational}} accidents in British agriculture {{is higher than}} in most other industries. The most common fatal accidents are those involving vehicles and machinery, falls from a height and electrocution. A substantial proportion of reported non-fatal injuries in agricultural employees is attributable to manual handling, but among self-employed farmers the contribution is much smaller. Few data are available on longer-term determinants of risk, but accidental deaths are most frequent in July, August and September. The main approaches to preventing agricultural accidents are through engineering improvements, and education and training of the workforce. The introduction of <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection</b> <b>structures</b> for tractors {{has been an important}} development in recent decades. Other engineering controls include guards for power take off shafts, guard rails to prevent falls, better handling facilities for animals and closed transfer systems for pesticides. Training on safety is available from several sources, but its effectiveness in reducing accidents is uncertain...|$|R
5000|$|These {{structures}} were first required by legislation in Sweden in 1959. Before they were required, some farmers died when their tractors rolled {{on top of}} them. Row-crop tractors, before ROPS, were particularly dangerous because of their 'tricycle' design with the two front wheels spaced close together and angled inward toward the ground. Some farmers were killed by rollovers while operating tractors along [...] slopes. Others have been killed while attempting to tow or pull an excessive load from above axle height, or when cold weather caused the tires to freeze to the ground, in both cases causing the tractor to pivot around the rear axle. ROPS were first required in the United States in 1986, but this requirement did not retroactively apply to tractors produced before this year; therefore, adoption of ROPS has been incomplete in the farming community. To combat this problem, CROPS (cost-effective <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection</b> <b>structures)</b> {{have been developed to}} encourage farmers to retrofit older tractors.|$|R

50|$|A {{roll bar}} {{is a single}} bar behind the driver that {{provides}} moderate <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection.</b> Due {{to the lack of}} a protective top, some modern convertibles utilize a strong windscreen frame acting as a roll bar.

2500|$|In {{the first}} year for new GM C-body shared with Oldsmobile 98 and Cadillac, the 1971 Electra 225 rode on a new body chassis which {{retained}} the [...] wheelbase with styling evolutionary from previous models. The new design included a double-shell roof for improved <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection</b> and noise reduction. Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel shared with B-body LeSabre and Centurion models that grouped all instruments with easy reach of the driver.|$|R
25|$|The {{new body}} also {{featured}} a double shell roof for improved <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection.</b> Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents {{mounted in the}} trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|R
2500|$|For Land Rover's 50th {{anniversary in}} 1998 two special editions were built. The {{first was the}} Defender 50th which was {{essentially}} a NAS (North American spec) Defender 90.

For the UK and Europe they were painted Atlantis blue, a dark green-blue flip-flop colour, and had a safety devices <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection</b> cage for the front seat occupants. In total 1071 50th anniversary Defenders were built; 385 for the UK home market, the rest for Japan, Europe and the Middle East.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{proposed}} US legislation on <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection</b> {{at the time}} of its launch, the TR7 was not initially available as a convertible. In early 1979, Triumph belatedly introduced a convertible version, called the TR7 Drophead Coupé (DHC), which first went on sale in the US (the original hardtop model being known as the Fixedhead Coupé, or FHC). A small number of pre-production cars were manufactured at Speke in 1978, soon after the pre-production TR7 V8 (later designated TR8) and TR7 Sprint cars. The British market received it in early 1980. The prototype for the convertible version of the original Harris Mann design came from Michelotti and the engineering to make it work was done by Triumph.|$|R
5000|$|For 1971, Catalina {{and other}} {{full-sized}} Pontiacs were completely redesigned and restyled from the wheels up with long hood/short deck proportions and fuselage styling somewhat similar to Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, {{along with a}} double shell roof for improved <b>roll-over</b> <b>protection</b> and flush pull-up exterior door handles - the latter two features first seen on the [...] Firebird. Catalina and Catalina Brougham sedans and coupes rode on a 123.4 in wheelbase while Bonneville and Grand Ville used a longer 126 in wheelbase, and Safari wagons were an inch longer at 127 inches. Station wagons also got their own multi-leaf spring rear suspensions, while sedans and coupes continued to be suspended with front and rear coil springs.|$|R

25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components.

2500|$|All A-bodies, {{including}} the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated [...] crash bumpers.

50|$|Modern dumpers have {{payloads}} {{of up to}} 10 t {{and usually}} steer by articulating at {{the middle of the}} chassis (pivot steering). They have multi-cylinder diesel engines, some turbocharged, electric start and hydraulics for tipping and steering and are usually four-wheel drive. An A-frame known as a ROPS (<b>Roll-Over</b> <b>Protection)</b> frame, may be fitted over the seat to protect the driver if the dumper rolls over. Some dumpers have FOPS (Falling Object Protection) as well. Lifting skips are available for discharging above ground level. In the 1990s dumpers with swivel skips, which could be rotated to tip sideways, became popular, especially for working in narrow sites such as road works.
