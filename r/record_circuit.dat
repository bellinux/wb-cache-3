25|$|Rusk {{began his}} {{mountaineering}} {{career in the}} summer following the completion of his first year of teaching school. He and his uncle W. A. Maxwell ascended Mount Adams via the South Climb. The next year, 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of Adams. This was the first <b>recorded</b> <b>circuit</b> by white women and likely the first <b>recorded</b> <b>circuit</b> by anyone. On this trip, he named Avalanche Valley and Rusk Glacier; however, the Rusk Glacier name was not official until 1901 when Rusk assisted Harry Fielding Reid in mapping Adams.|$|R
5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first <b>recorded</b> <b>circuit</b> of Adams by a woman and likely the first <b>recorded</b> <b>circuit</b> by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this <b>record.</b> <b>Circuit</b> computation requires precision in the timing, extent, and synchrony of principal cell (PC) firing that is largely enforced by parvalbumin-expressing, fast-spiking interneurons (PVFSIs). To reliably coordinate network activity, PVFSIs exhibit specialized synaptic and membrane properties that promote efficient afferent recruitment such as expression of high-conductance, rapidly gating, GluA 4 -containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs). We found that PVFSIs upregulate GluA 4 during the second postnatal week coincident with increases in the AMPAR clustering proteins NPTX 2 and NPTXR. Moreover, GluA 4 is dramatically reduced in NPTX 2 (-/-) /NPTXR(-/-) mice with consequent reductions in PVFSI AMPAR function. Early postnatal NPTX 2 (-/-) /NPTXR(-/-) mice exhibit delayed circuit maturation with a prolonged critical period permissive for giant depolarizing potentials. Juvenile NPTX 2 (-/-) /NPTXR(-/-) mice display reduced feedforward inhibition yielding a circuit deficient in rhythmogenesis and prone to epileptiform discharges. Our findings demonstrate an essential role for NPTXs in controlling network dynamics highlighting potential therapeutic targets for disorders with inhibition/excitation imbalances such as schizophrenia.

40|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle or radiation enters the sensitive volume of a counter {{an avalanche of}} electrons is formed by the process known as ionization by collisions. In general a counter is operated with the central wire positive {{with respect to the}} cylinder, and consequently the electrons are collected by the wire. A negative voltage pulse is thus developed. On the wire, the size of which depends upon the capacitance of the wire system and the magnitude of the collected charge. The duration and form of the pulse will depend upon the characteristics of the particular counter usedand upon the time constant of the receiving system. In general each {{ionizing particle}} produces a voltage pulse, and it is the function of the associated electrical <b>circuits</b> to <b>record</b> these pulses and thus count the number of particles entering the sensitive volume of counter. The size of the voltage pulse varies with the counter and the type of particle being detected, but the pulses can be increased to the necessary size to actuate scaling and recording devices by means of an amplifier. For counters operating in the Geiger region the pulse size is independent of the type ofionizing agent being detected, providing the voltage across the counter is kept constant, as the counter voltage is increased the pulse size varies over a considerable range until the voltage is reached at which the counter goes into continuous discharge. In consequence, for use in conjunction with different counters, working at various operating potentials, an amplifier with variable gain is necessary. The amplifier can then be set to give a suitable output pulse to the following circuits independently {{of the size of the}} input pulse. For slow counting rates the counter and amplifier can be used directly in conjunction witha suitable mechanical recorder. Many counters have recovery times as short as 10 seconds and correspondingly high counting rates. Amplifiers can be designed with RC time constants as short as 10 seconds or less, so that the results are not affected by the amplifying stage. On the other hand mechanical recorders have comparatively long time constants and if used directly would seriously decrease the possible counting rate. This is avoided by the use of electrical scaling circuits which pass on only a certain proportion of the pulses to the <b>recording</b> <b>circuit.</b> In this case the recovery time and counting rate of the whole system is governed entirely by the characteristics of the counter itself. The pulses from the last stage of the scaling circuit pass on to the <b>recording</b> <b>circuit.</b> It is the function of this circuit to use these pulses to operate some mechanical recorder. The pulses are not usually able to influence the counter directly, and so a hard valve or thyratron is used in conjunction with a telephone or Cenco counter. It will be seen from the above discussion that the electrical circuits needed for use in association with a Geiger counter are as follows 1. Voltage supply circuits for amplifier, scaling and <b>recording</b> <b>circuits.</b> 2. Pulse amplifier. 3. Scaling <b>circuit.</b> 4. <b>Recording</b> <b>circuit.</b> 5. Stabilised high voltage supply for Geiger counter. The arrangement of these circuits will be such as is shown in block form in diagram I. <p...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{volume of}} Emigrants in Bondage published in 1988 acknowledged {{that there were}} some notable omissions from the list of transported felons then printed, which remained to be researched and remedied. The Supplement of 1992 began to supply the omissions, but now with the publication of More Emigrants in Bondage, Mr. Coldham has closed the remaining gaps. Altogether there are some 9,000 new and amended records in this important new work, which is arranged and annotated {{in the same way as}} the parent volume. To the original list of 50,000 records, these additions come as a windfall, arising from the availability of previously closed archival resources and the re-examination of conventional transportation records such as Assize Court <b>records,</b> <b>Circuit</b> Court <b>records,</b> and the quaintly-named Sheriffs' Cravings, to which can be added newspapers and printed memoirs.|$|R
