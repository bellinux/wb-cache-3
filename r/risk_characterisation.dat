40|$|Dietary {{exposure}} {{is an essential}} element of a risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) foods. This is primarily used following the identification and characterisation of a hazard, or for the assessment of the nutritional consequences after consumption of GM foods with altered nutritional profile and then for the full <b>risk</b> <b>characterisations.</b> A crude estimate of dietary exposure may also be used during hazard identification / characterisation to support the choice of dose regimes. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 503 / 2013 requires that a dietary exposure assessment is carried out on the basis of representative consumption data, and that it should consider also particular consumer groups. The EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database is currently the only available single source of consumption data in Europe, its use is encouraged for all GM applications.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the requirements for, and illustrates the application of, a methodology for a socio-economic analysis (SEA) {{especially as it}} might be adopted in the framework of REACH. Socio-economic analysis weighs the costs of any restrictions on the production and use of chemicals against the benefits to human health and the environment. The reasons why industry needs to understand the principles and practices of socioeconomic analysis are: (l) to carry out, where appropriate, a SEA as an argument for authorisation (this is an industry responsibility), and (2) to be able to contribute as stakeholders in socio-economic discussions with regulatory authorities when a SEA is used as a basis for justifying restrictions. The focus of this report is on the ecological impacts of chemicals rather than on their human health impacts. This is where many of the most profound ecological and economic challenges are, and the ECHA guidance for socio-economic analysis associated with both restrictions and authorisation in the REACH process identifies the need for more work in this area. The report argues for as much quantification as possible, with the ideal of monetisation so that a cost-benefit analysis can be carried out. Without quantification the ecological benefits of restrictions on chemicals (including failure to authorise) may well be presented in emotive terms that are hard to counter {{on the basis of the}} economic benefits that might be lost from restricted use or the banning of a chemical. An ecological benefits assessment involves two components. One is the extent to which ecological etlects are or may be ameliorated by restrictions on a chemical, and the other is the monetary value that is put on the ecosystems so protected. There are enormous challenges in ascribing monetary values, especially to non-marketed ecological goods or services. However, environmental economics has made great strides over recent years in developing appropriate methodologies to enable this to be achieved. This report draws attention to the appropriate sources. A substantial part of the challenge for valuation in benefits assessments is in identifying and quantifying the ecological impacts themselves in appropriate terms. The problem is that ecological <b>risk</b> <b>characterisations</b> and assessments do not express effects in terms of 2 ̆ 7 impacts 2 ̆ 7 that can be valued. This report draws attention to a number of possible scenarios whereby the outputs of <b>risk</b> <b>characterisations</b> might be linked to quantified ecological impacts through such methods as species-sensitivity analysis, smart modelling, making connections to ecological quality status and using an ecosystem services approach. None of these methods is developed to the extent that they could be applied in case studies. There will be a need for pioneering efforts in these areas. The challenge of conducting a socio-economic analysis becomes even harder when only hazard criteria are available as is the case for substances of very high concern. The report takes the view that most of these chemicals will be degradable in the environment and in organisms, and therefore should be amenable to standard <b>risk</b> <b>characterisations.</b> However, the expectation is that the SEA arguments will have to be particularly convincing to allow authorisation. Finally, socio-economic analysis needs to bring together risk assessment and economic considerations. This requires that ecologists and economists, scientists and regulators understand each other 2 ̆ 7 s needs and languages. The establishment of a forum to facilitate this is to be encouraged...|$|R

40|$|Information on hazard identification, hazard {{characterisation}} (including dose–response assessment) and exposure assessment are brought together under <b>risk</b> <b>characterisation</b> {{in order to}} provide advice to risk managers. Hazard identification and characterisation define the adverse effects produced by the chemical and are used to determine a health-based guidance value, such as an acceptable daily intake for threshold effects, or an estimate of the intake associated with a predefined level of risk for non-threshold effects. Exposure assessment aims to define average and high intakes, and has to take into account different dietary patterns. Hazard characterisation and exposure data need to be closely inter-related, for example the data should relate to the same life-stages and durations of exposure. <b>Risk</b> <b>characterisation</b> has to be an iterative process in which information on hazard and exposure are matched and any discrepancy taken into account where necessary by the generation of additional data.

The broad application of high throughput techniques for the description of genome wide patterns of structural (copy number aberrations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, methylation pattern) and functional (gene expression profiling, proteomics, miRNA) alterations in the cancer tissue lead not only to a better understanding of the tumour biology but also to a description of gastric cancer subtypes independent from classical stratification systems.

40|$|<b>Risk</b> assessment-led <b>characterisation</b> of a {{site for}} the {{geological}} storage of CO 2 in the UK northern North Sea was performed for the EU SiteChar research project {{as one of a}} portfolio of sites. Implementation and testing of the SiteChar project site characterisation workflow has produced a ‘dry-run’ storage permit application that is compliant with regulatory requirements. A site suitable for commercial-scale storage was characterised, compatible with current and future industrial carbon dioxide (CO 2) sources in the northern UK. Pre-characterisation of the site, based on existing information acquired during hydrocarbon exploration and production, has been achieved from publicly available data. The project concept is to store captured CO 2 at a rate of 5 Mt per year for 20 years in the Blake Oil Field and surrounding Captain Sandstone saline aquifer. This commercial-scale storage of 100 Mt CO 2 can be achieved through a storage scenario combining injection of CO 2 into the oil field and concurrent water production down-dip of the field. There would be no encroachment of supercritical phase CO 2 for more than two kilometres beyond the field boundary and no adverse influence on operating hydrocarbon fields provided there is pressure management. 				Components of a storage permit application for the site are presented, developed as far as possible within a research project. Characterisation and technical investigations were guided by an initial assessment of perceived risks to the prospective site and a need to provide the information required for the storage permit application. The emphasis throughout was to reduce risks and uncertainty on the subsurface containment of stored CO 2, particularly with respect to site technical performance, monitoring and regulatory issues, and effects on other resources. The results of selected <b>risk</b> assessment-led site <b>characterisation</b> investigations and the subsequent risk reassessments are described together with their implications for the understanding of the site. Additional investigations are identified that could further reduce risks and uncertainties, and enable progress toward a full storage permit application.

40|$|An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for {{nanomaterials}} (NMs) is {{outlined in}} this paper. Contrary to other recent {{papers on the}} subject, the main data requirements, models and advancement {{within each of the}} four risk assessment domains are described, i. e., in the: (i) materials, (ii) release, fate and exposure, (iii) hazard and (iv) <b>risk</b> <b>characterisation</b> domains. The material, which is obviously the foundation for any risk assessment, should be described according to the legislatively required characterisation data. Characterisation data will also be used at various levels within the ERA, e. g., exposure modelling. The release, fate and exposure data and models cover the input for environmental distribution models in order to identify the potential (PES) and relevant exposure scenarios (RES) and, subsequently, the possible release routes, both with regard to which compartment(s) NMs are distributed in line with the factors determining the fate within environmental compartment. The initial outcome in the <b>risk</b> <b>characterisation</b> will be a generic Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC), but a refined PEC can be obtained by applying specific exposure models for relevant media. The hazard information covers a variety of representative, relevant and reliable organisms and/or functions, relevant for the RES and enabling a hazard characterisation. The initial outcome will be hazard characterisation in test systems allowing estimating a Predicted No-Effect concentration (PNEC), either based on uncertainty factors or on a NM adapted version of the Species Sensitivity Distributions approach.

40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{prevalent}} bone condition, characterised by low {{bone mass}} and increased fracture risk. Currently, {{the gold standard}} for identifying osteoporosis and increased fracture risk is through quantification of bone mineral density (BMD) using dual energy X-ray absorption (DEXA). However, the risk of osteoporotic fracture is determined collectively by bone mass, architecture and physicochemistry of the mineral composite building blocks. Thus DEXA scans alone inevitably fail to fully discriminate individuals who will suffer a fragility fracture. This study examines trabecular bone at both ultrastructure and microarchitectural levels to provide a detailed material view of bone, and therefore provides a more comprehensive explanation of osteoporotic fracture <b>risk.</b> Physicochemical <b>characterisation</b> obtained through X-ray diffraction and infrared analysis indicated significant differences in apatite crystal chemistry and nanostructure between fracture and non-fracture groups.

30|$|In {{the context}} of life cycle {{assessment}} and <b>risk</b> <b>characterisation</b> of AgNPs, the main focus is the quantity and how AgNPs become free of the products that contain them (e.g. textiles and wall facades). Numerous studies show the release of AgNPs from textiles [12, 13], silver nanoparticle-containing washing machines [14] and facades [15]. Release into the surrounding environment results in changes to AgNP properties and their effects on terrestrial and aquatic organisms. As a result, {{it is difficult to}} perform a <b>risk</b> <b>characterisation</b> without including possible modifications and transformation processes from the pristine nanoparticulate form [16]. The release of AgNPs into the environment commonly occurs via point source accumulation in sewage sludge (the end product of sewage treatment) that is applied as an agricultural fertiliser. In Germany, 2 million tons of dry sewage sludge solids from municipal wastewater treatment plants is produced annually. Around 30 % of this sludge is used for farmland application. In Spain, Portugal, France and the UK, the majority of sewage sludge produced is applied to agricultural land [17].|$|E
40|$|One of {{the many}} utays in {{preparing}} for drought is {{to carry out a}} drought <b>risk</b> assessment by <b>characterisation</b> of the frequency, severity and duration of n drought. Therefore, the current study aimed at the development of safety-duration-frequency (SDF) curves to provide a comprehensive characterisation of the droughts for 10 selected stations in Victoria, Australia. The development of the frequency curves is based on the precipitation deficits which were computed based on the Standardised Participation Index (SPI). Instead of using SPl values, the precipitation thresholds were use to complete the severity of the droughts. This would be very helpful in delivering information that can be understood easily by ordinary users and decision-makers. The SDF curves were developed using the partial duration series (PDS) technique. Log Pearson Type III distribution was chosen and fitted well to the precipitation deficits for different durations of drought. Overall, SDF curues were succesfully derived for 10 stations in Victoria and can provide useful information for medium/long term planning, such as in planning irrigation supply and developing drought relief policies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} shown that a number of serovars of Salmonella enterica may be {{isolated}} from wild birds, and {{it has been suggested that}} wild birds may play a role in the epidemiology of human and livestock salmonellosis. However, little is known about the relationship between wild bird S. enterica strains and human- and livestock- associated strains in the United Kingdom. Given the zoonotic potential of salmonellosis, the main aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of S. enterica infections in wild birds in the north of England and, in particular, to determine if wild bird isolates were similar to those associated with disease in livestock or humans. Results Thirty two Salmonella enterica isolates were collected from wild birds in northern England between February 2005 and October 2006, of which 29 were S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium); one S. Newport, one S. Senftenberg, and one isolate could not be classified by serotyping. Further analysis through phage typing and macro-restriction pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that wild passerine deaths associated with salmonellosis were caused by closely-related S. Typhimurium isolates, some of which were clonal. These isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, capable of invading and persisting within avian macrophage-like HD 11 cells in vitro, and contained a range of virulence factors associated with both systemic and enteric infections of birds and mammals. However, all the isolates lacked the sopE gene associated with some human and livestock disease outbreaks caused by S. Typhimurium. Conclusion The wild bird isolates of S. enterica characterised in this investigation may not represent a large zoonotic <b>risk.</b> Molecular <b>characterisation</b> of isolates suggested that S. Typhimurium infection in wild passerines is maintained within wild bird populations and the causative strains may be host-adapted. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} model is presented extending the integrated probabilistic risk assessment (IPRA) model of van der Voet and Slob [van der Voet, H., Slob, W., 2007. Integration of probabilistic exposure assessment and probabilistic hazard <b>characterisation.</b> <b>Risk</b> Analysis, 27, 351 - 371]. The {{aim is to}} characterise the health impact due {{to one or more}} chemicals present in food causing one or more health effects. For chemicals with hardly any measurable safety problems we propose health impact characterisation by margins of exposure. In this probabilistic model not one margin of exposure is calculated, but rather a distribution of individual margins of exposure (IMoE) which allows quantifying the health impact for small parts of the population. A simple bar chart is proposed to represent the IMoE distribution and a lower bound (IMoEL) quantifies uncertainties in this distribution. It is described how IMoE distributions can be combined for dose-additive compounds and for different health effects. Health impact assessment critically depends on a subjective valuation of the health impact of a given health effect, and possibilities to implement this health impact valuation step are discussed. Examples show the possibilities of health impact characterisation and of integrating IMoE distributions.

Improper environmental management has resulted in the pollution of land and waters creating a serious problem in industrialised countries. The stringent environmental regulations and the change of the land use from mining/industrial to residential, agricultural or even recreational, require development of new and improved treatment technologies for soil decontamination.

Data collection comprised a standardised nurse-administered questionnaire with cognitive assessment, functional performance testing, quantitative heel ultrasound scans and a year’s prospective monitoring of falls. KEY FINDINGS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS: The study’s description of a representative population aged over 90 is valuable to service planners preparing for demographic change, revealing high levels of many fall <b>risk</b> factors. Detailed <b>characterisation</b> of functional status showed close agreement between reported disability levels and performance measures. This first population-based survey of skeletal fragility in the tenth decade found quantitative ultrasound measures markedly lower than previous studies with younger old people. Skeletal fragility reflected weight-bearing functional test performance and reported current or past mobility. This first prospective study of falling and adverse sequelae amongst people aged over 90 in a representative population-based sample found falls are even more common than previously reported for very old people a decade younger: 60 % fell at least once during follow-up, 45 % more than once, with minimal gender differences. Incidence was 277 falls / 100 person-years. Most falls occurred alone, most people were unable to get up after falling, and most did not use available alarms to call help. Findings also showed high levels of injuries including fractures, hospitalisation and long-term care admissions. Fracture risk factors were also associated with skeletal ultrasound measures.

40|$|Accurate {{modelling}} of the Martian {{atmosphere is}} essential both {{for planning and}} completing future missions to the Martian surface, and for accurate analysis and interpretation of the data that they return. Large dust storms and local wind patterns can affect spacecraft landing profiles, {{and the level of}} dust present in the atmosphere may impact lander performance. The ExoMars 2016 Mission will carry an Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module (EDM), primarily designed to test the ability of ESA’s lander technology to carry a science package to the surface [1]. The Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigations and Analysis (AMELIA) team [2] will use the module’s entry and descent trajectory to characterise the structure of the atmosphere along the travelled landing profile, and to determine properties of the atmosphere, such as density and wind speed, over a wide altitude range from the upper atmosphere to the surface. Aerosol abundances, including atmospheric dust, will also be characterised. These combined datasets will enable more accurate predictions of the atmospheric environment that future landers will encounter. EDM’s surface science package, DREAMS (Dust <b>characterisation,</b> <b>Risk</b> assessment, and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface), includes sensors to measure wind speed and direction, surface temperature, pressure, and the amount of atmospheric dust present near the surface [3].

The survey (90 women, 20 men) comprised a standardised nurse-administered questionnaire with cognitive assessment, quantitative heel ultrasound scans and functional performance measures: Timed Unsupported Stand, Short Physical Performance Battery (standing balance tests, gait speed and chair rising), 180 ° turn, functional reach and hand grip strength. Data collection also included a year’s prospective monitoring of falls {{using a combination of}} weekly calendars and telephone follow-up, with reports from participants themselves and proxy informants. KEY FINDINGS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS The study’s description of a representative population aged over 90 is valuable to service planners preparing for demographic change, revealing high levels of many fall <b>risk</b> factors. Detailed <b>characterisation</b> of functional status showed close agreement between reported disability levels and performance measures. This first population-based survey of skeletal fragility in the tenth decade found quantitative ultrasound measures markedly lower than in previous studies with younger old people. Skeletal fragility reflected weight-bearing functional test performance and reported current or past mobility. This first prospective study of falling amongst people aged over 90 in a representative population-based sample found falls are even more common than previously reported for very old people a decade younger: 60...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Recent {{years have}} seen {{increased}} levels of production and consumption of seafood, leading to more frequent reporting of allergic reactions in occupational and domestic settings. This review focuses on occupational allergy in the fishing and seafood processing industry.  REVIEW—Workers involved in either manual or automated processing of crabs, prawns, mussels, fish, and fishmeal production are commonly exposed to various constituents of seafood. Aerosolisation of seafood and cooking fluid during processing are potential occupational situations {{that could result in}} sensitisation through inhalation. There is great variability of aerosol exposure within and among various jobs with reported allergen concentrations ranging from 0. 001  to 5. 061 (µg/m 3). Occupational dermal exposure occurs as a result of unprotected handling of seafood and its byproducts. Occupational allergies have been reported in workers exposed to arthropods (crustaceans), molluscs, pisces (bony fish) and other agents derived from seafood. The prevalence of occupational asthma ranges from 7 % to 36 %, and for occupational protein contact dermatitis, from 3 % to 11 %. These health outcomes are mainly due to high molecular weight proteins in seafood causing an IgE mediated response. Cross reactivity between various species within a major seafood grouping also occurs. Limited evidence from dose-response relations indicate that development of symptoms is related to duration or intensity of exposure. The evidence for atopy as a risk factor for occupational sensitisation and asthma is supportive, whereas evidence for cigarette smoking is limited. Disruption of the intact skin barrier seems to be an important added risk factor for occupational protein contact dermatitis.  CONCLUSION—The range of allergic disease associated with occupational exposure to crab is well characterised, whereas for other seafood agents the evidence is somewhat limited. There is a need for further epidemiological studies to better characterise this <b>risk.</b> More detailed <b>characterisation</b> of specific protein antigens in aerosols and associated establishment of dose-response relations for acute and chronic exposure to seafood; the respective roles of skin contact and inhalational exposure in allergic sensitisation and cross reactivity; and the contribution of host associated factors in the development of occupational seafood allergies are important areas for future research.    Keywords: occupational seafood allergy; occupational asthma; protein contact dermatiti...|$|R
