5|$|On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial <b>Resupply</b> Services {{contracts}} to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation. SpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. Orbital Sciences uses its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. The first Dragon <b>resupply</b> mission occurred in May 2012. The first Cygnus <b>resupply</b> mission occurred in September 2013. The CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs; {{with the exception}} of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the European ATV and the Japanese HTV.|$|E
5|$|A {{break in}} the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final <b>resupply</b> flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small <b>resupply</b> efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Gazala and {{the fall}} of Tobruk, the LRDG were forced to {{withdraw}} from Siwa on 28 June. 'A' Squadron withdrew to Cairo to <b>resupply</b> and then moved back to Kufra, while 'B' Squadron moved to Faiyum.|$|E
50|$|Finally {{the great}} powers imposed {{nothing more than the}} return at the {{concessions}} of 1866. Unsatisfied, the Cretans maintained the armed struggle. But the difficulties of <b>resupplying,</b> particularly <b>resupplying</b> food, created strife between the leaders of the Cretan clans.|$|R

5|$|At 11:00, however, {{a second}} attempt to <b>resupply</b> B Company {{resulted}} in an Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire, and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and <b>resupply.</b>|$|E
5|$|Drayton {{became part}} of Task Force 67, which intercepted a Japanese naval force {{guarding}} transports en route to <b>resupply</b> Guadalcanal. The Battle of Tassafaronga followed.|$|E
5|$|The IJN {{continued}} to suffer losses and damage to its ships {{in attempting to}} keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American PT boat and CAF air attacks during subsequent <b>resupply</b> missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, {{very few of the}} supplies carried on these missions actually reached Japanese army forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the <b>resupply</b> effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.|$|E

50|$|Vigilant, with a hold {{capacity}} of 7 tons, {{played an important}} role in the Battle of Timor from May 1942 and made several supply trips to the island. During one of these supply voyages, it assisted in the search for survivors from HMAS Armidale. During this time, it also <b>resupplied</b> corvettes operating in the Timor Sea, notably <b>resupplying</b> HMAS Deloraine with depth charges.|$|R
5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, the Japanese were finding it {{increasingly}} difficult to <b>resupply</b> their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, refusing to let Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, the Japanese were forced to <b>resupply</b> their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E
5|$|AFSOC {{provides}} Air Force {{special operations}} forces for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified commands. The command's SOF are composed of highly trained, rapidly deployable airmen, conducting global special operations missions ranging from precision application of firepower via airstrikes or close air support, to infiltration, exfiltration, <b>resupply</b> and refueling of SOF operational elements.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail had to do double duty. Materiel sent from the north was stored in caches in the border regions that were soon retitled Base Areas, which, in turn, became sanctuaries for NLF and PAVN forces seeking respite and <b>resupply</b> after conducting operations within South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that the}} Japanese were {{beginning}} a major offensive {{in the southern}} Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a <b>resupply</b> convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five task forces. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{declared}} war on France in May 1803 following the short-lived Peace of Amiens and by June, Emerald, {{under the command of}} Captain James O'Bryen, had joined Samuel Hood's squadron in the Leeward Islands. Prior to the British invasion of St Lucia on 21 June, she harassed enemy shipping, disrupting the island's <b>resupply.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bulteel's convoy {{continued}} on, pausing at Rio de Janeiro on 12 August to <b>resupply.</b> The East Indiamen {{then went}} on to Saint Helena on their way to Asia. The two Botany Bay ships sailed on to Australia and the whaler Seringapatam sailed for the South Seas.|$|E

5|$|Four U.S. {{soldiers}} were killed within the first 20 minutes of the battle, another died later, and at least three others were wounded. Three times teams of soldiers from the main base ran through Taliban fire to <b>resupply</b> the observation post and carry back the dead and wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1756 Gage served as second-in-command of a failed {{expedition}} to <b>resupply</b> Fort Oswego, which fell to the French while the expedition was en route.

The roadblock proved difficult to break, and forced U.S. troops to move through nearby mountains to evacuate their wounded.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-30 was {{the first}} privately funded manned space {{expedition}} but several other firsts were also achieved, including the first privately funded extra-vehicular activity, and the first privately funded unmanned <b>resupply</b> mission to a space station, utilizing the Progress-M1 spacecraft. Soyuz TM-30 also managed to delay the de-orbit of Mir, which was originally scheduled to occur some time in 2000, but ultimately occurred in March 2001.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{was able}} to {{maintain}} transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable <b>resupply</b> of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and <b>resupply</b> ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no <b>resupply</b> of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E
