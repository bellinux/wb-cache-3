50|$|The <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> or crested coot, (Fulica cristata), is {{a member}} of the rail and crake bird family, the Rallidae.|$|E
40|$|Capsule: <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coots</b> Fulica cristata and Common Coots Fulica atra {{have similar}} {{breeding}} biology except in chick survival, which {{was significantly lower}} in <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coots.</b> Aims: To provide information on the breeding biology of <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coots</b> in Spain and to compare this with similar data for Common Coots. Methods: During two consecutive breeding seasons, clutch size, egg size, brood size and chick survival of <b>Red-knobbed</b> and Common <b>Coots</b> were studied in {{nearly all of the}} lagoons in which <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coots</b> were breeding. Results: Clutch size was similar in the two species. Egg volume varied between years within species. Both species had similar brood sizes but chick survival differed significantly, being lower in <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coots</b> (36 % and 55 % in 2002 and 2003, respectively) than in Common Coots (93 % and 91 % in 2002 and 2003, respectively). The number of fledglings per pair was lower in <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coots</b> (0. 9 and 2. 1 in 2002 and 2003, respectively) than in Common Coots (2. 2 and 3. 0 in 2002 and 2003, respectively). Conclusion: The disparity in productivity between <b>Red-knobbed</b> and Common <b>Coots</b> in the lagoons of southern Spain is mainly due to differential chick survival rates. These differences could be the key factor that has led to their currently different conservation status in Spain. Â© 2008 British Trust for Ornithology. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Zebras, buffaloes, {{black and}} white colobus, blue monkeys, bushbucks, sunis, and leopards {{populate}} the park. The park contains some 350 species of birds in total, of which 52 are birds of prey. The cliffs in {{the northern end of}} Lake Paradise, in Gof Sokorte Gurda, are home to a number of birds, including Ruppell's griffon vultures, peregrine falcons, mountain buzzards, black kites and African fish eagles. Ducks such as garganeys, southern pochards and teals are found on the lake, which is also home to <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coots,</b> hamerkops, ibises, purple herons, and yellow-billed storks.On the lower slopes of the forest of the park, marked by scrubland, there are populations of olive baboons, vervet monkeys, Peter's gazelles, beisa oryxes, striped hyenas, caracals and aardwolves.|$|R
50|$|Just {{northeast}} of the town, on the Kabeljous River, lies the Kabeljous Nature Reserve. It is a walk-about reserve, well known to anglers for a diverse number of fish. The Kabeljous estuary {{is one of the}} best preserved estuaries in the Eastern Cape. The lagoon is home to waterfowl, herons, and a variety of waders. Nearby, the Seekoei River Nature Reserve lies between Aston Bay and Paradise Beach. The reserve lies on the estuary formed by the Seekoei and Swart rivers. The reserve is rich in birdlife with over 120 species of birds. The lagoon is also home to numerous <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coots</b> and small antelope. Fishing from boats is prohibited here. There is also a circular hiking trail that takes about three hours to complete. The trail starts with a trip on a raft across the lagoon and runs through fynbos and subtropical vegetation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> is an omnivore, {{and will}} take a variety of small live prey {{including}} the eggs of other water birds. Its main food in most waters however comprises various waterweeds such as species of Potamogeton for which it commonly dives.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> is {{reluctant}} to fly and when taking off runs across the water surface with much splashing. It does the same, but without actually flying, when travelling a short distance at speed (to escape a rival, for example, or to dispute possession of a choice morsel). It bobs its head as it swims, and makes short dives from a little jump.|$|E
50|$|The Andalusian {{wetlands}} host a rich {{variety of}} birds. Some are of African origin, {{such as the}} <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> (Fulica cristata), the purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), and the greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus). Others originate in Northern Europe, such as the greylag goose (Anser anser). Birds of prey (raptors) include the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti), the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and both the black and red kite (Milvus migrans and Milvus milvus).|$|E
50|$|The {{habits of}} the <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> are {{practically}} identical {{to those of the}} Eurasian coot. It is much less secretive than most of the rail family. Where it is undisturbed it is likely to bully any intruder, even large birds such as Egyptian geese, if they do not defy its challenges. It can be seen swimming on open water or walking across waterside grasslands. It is an aggressive species, and strongly territorial during the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|A {{good view}} is {{necessary}} to separate this species from the Eurasian coot, with which its range overlaps. There are two tiny red knobs {{at the top of}} the facial shield, which are not visible at any great distance and are only present in the breeding season; the black feathering between the shield and the bill is rounded, whereas in Eurasian it comes to a point; and the bill has a bluish grey tinge. In flight, the <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> lacks the white trailing edge to the secondaries of the Eurasian coot.|$|E
50|$|Dakhla Peninsula and Cintra Bay {{are some}} of the most {{important}} wintering grounds for birds especially for waders. The greater flamingo is one of the most iconic birds in the region and there are numerous others known to migrate or inhabit. Some of these are; pelican, great cormorant, gulls (slender-billed, Audouin's, black-backed), larks (sparrow, bar-tailed), terns (little, Caspian, royal, Sandwich), black wheatear, western reef heron, marsh harrier, sparrowhawk, lesser kestrel, laughing dove, great spotted cuckoo, little swift, hoopoe, rock martin, cricket longtail, oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, pharaoh eagle owl, and <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> {{is largely}} black {{except for the}} white frontal shield. It is 38 - 45 cm long, spans 75 - 85 cm across the wings and weighs 585 - 1085 g. As a {{swimming}} species, it has partial webbing on its long strong toes. The juvenile is paler than the adult, has a whitish breast, and lacks the facial shield; the adult's black plumage develops when about 3-4 months old, but the white shield is only fully developed at about one year old, some time later.|$|E
50|$|Upwards of 170 native {{bird species}} have been recorded, but the {{presence}} or breeding of some have been transient, due to urbanization and other factors. Resident or visiting passerine birds include thick-billed weaver, southern red bishop, African reed-warbler, little rush-warbler and lesser swamp-warbler. Various heron species visit the reserve, including black-crowned night-heron, little bittern, green-backed heron, purple heron, black and little egret. Other regular water birds are <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot,</b> fulvous duck, Egyptian goose, white-faced duck, Cape teal and southern pochard. Pinioned crowned cranes and blue cranes have been released into the reserve, and some exotic duck species are present.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot,</b> (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
5000|$|The Mascarene coot {{was a large}} {{bird and}} while not flightless, it had reduced flying ability, so that if pursued, it would have even more {{preferred}} to escape by diving than it is already a general habit of the coots. As the bird had considerable stamina, it could have easily crossed the ocean between the islands, explaining why a single species occurred on both islands. The birds looked like oversized Eurasian coots, being about 45 cm long, but as {{they were more likely}} derived from the <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot,</b> {{it is not clear whether}} the distinguishing red knobs (which are easily overlooked) on top of the white frontal shield were not present or simply not reported by Dubois, who described the species in some detail in 1674 as [...] "Waterhens which are as large as fowls. They are always black, and have a large white crest on the head." ...|$|E
50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (Ardea purpurea). Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 983 g African black duck (Anas sparsa), the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E
40|$|The <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> Fulica cristata {{experienced}} a dramatic population decline in Spain, where the common coot F. atra does not face conservation problems. This is puzzling because both species have similar ecologies. It {{has been suggested}} that habitat alterations affected the quality of food plants, and this impacted differentially both coots. To verify this, we conducted experiments to determine the assimilation efficiency of both species in relation to food quality. Two types of diets differing in fibre content (commercial food and Potamogeton pectinatus) were offered to captive red-knobbed and common coots, during both spring and autumn. We examined variations in faecal particle size among coot species and diets, indicative of the facility with which food can be assimilated, and used the stable isotope technique to study differences between coot species in stable isotope fractionations from consumption to excretion. Faecal particle size was larger in red-knobbed than in common coots when fibre content was high, but was similar when it was low. Faecal particle sizes were larger in autumn, when fibre content was higher, than in spring. In general, Î´ 15 N in faeces of red-knobbed coots was greater than in faeces of common coots. These results suggest that the digestive efficiency of the <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> was lower than that of the common coot, and that the differences increased when the fibre content in food plants increased. Managers should try to make available to coots wetland habitat with high quality food, which may be facilitated by prolonging the hydroperiods. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|We give {{examples}} of how waterbirds can be valuable indicators of changes in aquatic systems. Eutrophication is a widespread problem that can increase the food supply for some birds and hence increase their population size (e. g. great-crested grebes). Many birds are sensitive to changes in water depth, and some can decline due to siltation of shallow lakes (e. g. <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot)</b> or when low rainfall leads temporary wetlands to dry out (e. g. greater flamingos). The species-richness of the waterbird community is a less reliable indicator than trends for a given species, and has a weak relationship with the richness of other aquatic communities. As well as indicating changes in conditions, waterbirds can also cause them when they reach high densities, e. g. when colonial birds import nutrients from elsewhere or when geese cause overgrazing. When using waterbirds as indicators, a thorough knowledge of their ecology and clear objectives for the monitoring programme are essential. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|PO Box 13434, Norkem Park 1631, South Africa The <b>Red-knobbed</b> <b>Coot</b> Fulica cristata is an {{abundant}} aquatic bird in South Africa and was {{anticipated to have}} indicator abilities for metal pollution. This hypothesis was tested on 83 coot samples collected from five selected aquatic ecosystem areas supporting substantial coot populations, of which various abiotic and biotic components are known to contain varying levels {{of a number of}} metals. The aim of this study was achieved by determining the variations in Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb concentrations in liver, kidney, bone and blood samples, with the use of standard flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry techniques. Coots from the Germiston Lake sampling site showed the highest concentrations of cadmium in liver (2. 2 Âµg/g d. w.) and kidney (5. 4 Âµg/g d. w.). The absence of metal-processing industries in the catchments of the Florida Lake and the Steynsrus farm dams reflects the low liver and kidney concentrations of Cd, Ni and Cu, respectively. The blood of the Natalspruit wetland coots contained the highest dry weight concentrations of Ni (11. 4 Âµg/g), Cd (1. 8 Âµg/g) and Cu (14. 4 Âµg/g). The statistical evaluation points towards small-scale geographical differences, especially in the concentrations of Cu, Ni and Pb and in the liver, kidney and blood. However, in terms of actual metal concentrations recorded, no significant differences existed between coots of the reference site (Steynsrus farm dams) and those from the other four localities. It is concluded that the impact of metal-containing diets on the tissue concentrations of these metals in birds plays a far more significant role compared to the migratory habits or short-range movements of the coots...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean shallow lakes support high {{biodiversity}} but suffer many anthropogenic threats, including {{introductions of}} alien fish. We studied {{the impact of}} introduction of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to Medina and ZoÃ±ar lakes in SW Spain. Both lakes were protected as Ramsar sites because of their importance for waterbirds, particularly the globally threatened white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala IUCN Endangered) and common pochard (Aythya ferina IUCN Vulnerable). Two carp introduction events in Medina lake, with total eradication of carp in between, provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study the impacts of carp on the waterbird community (counted monthly from 2001 to 2013, with up to 69 species) and submerged macrophyte cover (quantified with satellite images). A comparison of waterbird abundance before and after carp eradication in the smaller ZoÃ±ar lake supported the results from Medina lake. Carp consistently led to the destruction of macrophyte beds and a radical change in the waterbird community. After controlling for the influence of depth fluctuations, the numbers and species richness of diving ducks were significantly reduced by carp, whilst the opposite effect was observed for piscivores such as herons. Negative impacts on O. leucocephala, A. ferina, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) and herbivorous coots (Fulica spp.) were particularly pronounced. A significant negative impact of carp was also recorded on greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber), black-necked grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis) and gadwall (Anas strepera). In contrast, carp presence had a positive impact on grey herons (Ardea cinerea). The ongoing expansion of alien cyprinids in the Mediterranean region constitutes a major threat for waterbirds and particularly for sedentary, threatened taxa such as the white-headed duck and <b>red-knobbed</b> <b>coot</b> (F. cristata). Of 22 key sites for the isolated Iberian population of white-headed duck identified in a European action plan in 1996, at least 14 have since suffered carp invasions. Further development of successful control methods for carp populations is urgently required to support the conservation of waterbirds in the Mediterranean region. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
