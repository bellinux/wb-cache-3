York House was the setting for a masque presented before their majesties in May 1627, in which Buckingham appeared followed by [...] "Envy, with divers open-mouthed dogs' heads representing the people’s barking, while next came Fame and Truth", just before his departure for his unsuccessful second foray against France.|$|R
40|$|Superconducting quantum {{interference}} devices (SQUIDs) are {{magnetic field}} sensors {{with the highest}} sensitivity and largest dynamic range known to date. In a joint German R&D project, the authors are developing a multi-channel SQUID system for non-destructive detection of tendon <b>ruptures</b> in prestressed <b>members</b> of bridges. The system uses the magnetic stray field measuring method. The tendons are magnetised {{by means of a}} yoke magnet scanning along the members. The magnetic stray field during magnetisation or the remanent field subsequent to magnetisation is measured using four SQUID sensors mounted in the yoke. Signals from stirrups of the mild steel reinforcement are suppressed with two types of techniques: either a best fit of typical stirrup signals to the stray field signal and their substraction, or the comparison of remanent field signals after changing the magnetisation direction of the stirrups. Subsequent correlation analysis with the dipolar signal of a typical void yields a rupture probability distribution and rupture signal amplitudes. Results of measurements on a prestressed concrete highway bridge are presented. At three locations, signal amplitudes above the threshold values were found. Two of them were verified by opening the bridge deck. In one case, one out of eight wires in the strand was broken, in the other case two. Thus, it was shown that the unsurpassed sensitivity and dynamic range of SQUID sensors can be applied to localise <b>ruptures</b> in prestressed <b>members</b> of bridges...|$|R
40|$|The {{upper limit}} of the column {{strength}} of structural members composed of thin material is the maximum axial stress such members can carry when short enough to fail locally, by crinkling. This stress {{is a function of}} the mechanical properties of the material and of the geometrical shape of the cross section. The bending strength, as measured by the modulus of <b>rupture,</b> of structural <b>members</b> is also a function of these same variables. Tests were made of round tubes of chromium-molybdenum steel and of duralumin to determine the crinkling strengths and the bending strengths in terms of the specified yield strength and the ratio of diameter to thickness. Empirical formulas are given relating these quantities...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{campaign on}} the <b>rupture</b> at the <b>member</b> side of a typical floor-to-beam dry connection for precast structures {{has been carried out}} at the laboratory of Politecnico di Milano within the activity of the European Project Safecast. When subjected to horizontal loading, like the seismic action, a strong and stable behaviour of the connection shall be ensured, provided it is properly designed to avoid early brittle ruptures of the concrete edges. The resistance of the concrete side of the connection depends on many factors, among which the reinforcement detailing used in the local part. The experimental investigation regards the behaviour of such portion of the connection reinforced with a typical hooked rebar, studying also the influence of the addition of horizontal stirrups, metallic fibres into the concrete and the presence of pre-stressing tendons...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{is carried out}} to elicit important factors causing cracks and <b>rupture</b> of steel <b>members</b> under imposed large repeated deformations, and to investigate the quantitative relationships among the important physical factors leading to failure. Eight angle specimens were subjected to repeated axial load after undergoing inelastic buckling. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the effect of elongation of the specimen on the very low-cycle fatigue behavior under load repetitions of the order of a few to twenty. The experimental results show that energy dissipation capacity depends heavily on the entire history of loading and the deflection mode, but no simple quantitative relations are observed between the initiation of the visible cracks or rupture and the energy dissipation capacity. The maximum value of residual "net" strains ranges from 30 % to 35 %, independent of test parameters...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—The risk of {{intracranial}} aneurysm (IA) <b>rupture</b> in asymptomatic <b>members</b> {{of families}} who have multiple affected individuals is not known. Methods—First-degree unaffected relatives of those with a familial history of IA who {{had a history of}} smoking or hypertension but no known IA were offered cerebral MR angiography (MRA) and followed yearly as part of a National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke-funded study of familial IA (Familial Intracranial Aneurysm [FIA] Study). Results—A total of 2874 subjects from 542 FIA Study families were enrolled. After study enrollment, MRAs were performed in 548 FIA Study family members with no known history of IA. Of these 548 subjects, 113 subjects (20. 6 %) had 148 IAs by MRA of whom 5 subjects had IA 7 mm. Two subjects with an unruptured IA by MRA/CT angiography (3 -mm and 4 -mm anterior communicating artery) subsequently had rupture of their IA. This represents a...|$|R
40|$|Collagen {{serves as}} a {{structural}} scaffold and a barrier between tissues, and thus collagen catabolism (collagenolysis) is required to be a tightly regulated process in normal physiology. In turn, the destruction or damage of collagen during pathological states {{plays a role in}} tumor growth and invasion, cartilage degradation, or atherosclerotic plaque formation and <b>rupture.</b> Several <b>members</b> of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family catalyze the hydrolysis of collagen triple helical structure. This study has utilized triple helical peptide (THP) substrates and inhibitors to dissect MMP- 1 collagenolytic behavior. Analysis of MMP- 1 /THP interactions by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry followed by evaluation of wild type and mutant MMP- 1 kinetics led to the identification of three noncatalytic regions in MMP- 1 (residues 285 – 295, 302 – 316, and 437 – 457) and two specific residues (Ile- 290 and Arg- 291) that participate in collagenolysis. Ile- 290 and Arg- 291 contribute to recognition of triple helical structure and facilitate both the binding and catalysis of the triple helix. Evidence from this study and prior studies indicates that the MMP- 1 catalytic and hemopexin-like domains collaborate in collagen catabolism by properly aligning the triple helix and coupling conformational states to facilitate hydrolysis. This study is the first to document the roles of specific residues within the MMP- 1 hemopexin-like domain in substrate binding and turnover. Noncatalytic sites, such as those identified here, can ultimately be utilized to create THP inhibitors that target MMPs implicated in disease progression while sparing proteases with host-beneficial functions...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{cracking}} strength can {{be defined}} as the tensile strength of concrete subjected to pure tension stress. However, as it is difficult to apply direct tension load to concrete specimens, concrete cracking is usually quantified by the modulus of <b>rupture</b> for flexural <b>members.</b> In this study, a new direct tension test setup for cylindrical specimens (101. 6 [*]mm in diameter and 203. 2 [*]mm in height) similar to those used in compression test is developed. Double steel plates are used to obtain uniform stress distributions. Finite element analysis for the proposed test setup is conducted. The uniformity of the stress distribution along the cylindrical specimen is examined and compared with rectangular cross section. Fuzzy image pattern recognition method is used to assess stress uniformity along the specimen. Moreover, the probability of cracking at different locations along the specimen is evaluated using probabilistic finite element analysis. The experimental and numerical results of the cracking location showed that gravity effect on fresh concrete during setting time might affect the distribution of concrete cracking strength along the height of the structural elements...|$|R
40|$|Although {{advanced}} plaques that rupture and trigger most acute coronary {{events have}} well-defined morphology 1 and histological characteristics, 2, 3 the preceding local envi-ronment and the mechanisms that promote {{the evolution of}} early lesions toward rupture-prone thin-capped atheromata (TCA) remain largely unknown. Low regional endothelial shear stress (ESS) promotes focal plaque development and progression 4 – 8 and critically influences plaque vulnerabil-ity. 9, 10 Previous studies have established the mechanistic link between low ESS and atherogenesis in vitro, 11 – 13 but the mech-anisms whereby low ESS favors the localization of rupture-prone coronary lesions in vivo remain poorly understood. This study explored, in particular, 2 issues with important clinical implications not addressed in prior studies: the in vivo effect of ESS environment on (1) local collagen metabolism and (2) smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype. Interstitial collagen strengthens the fibrous cap and likely enhances its resistance to <b>rupture.</b> 3, 14 <b>Members</b> of the matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) family with collagenase activity, including MMP- 1,- 8,- 13, and the activator of MMP collagenases, MMP- 14, weaken the plaque by degrading collagen fibers. 14 – 17 Low ESS associates with increased expression of extracellular matrix–degrading enzymes ex vivo 18 and {{with the formation of}} collagen-poor carotid lesions in mice. 19 Previous studies, however, used isolated cells or examined only 2 time points to assess natura...|$|R
40|$|Simplified {{methods of}} seismic verification, using {{equivalent}} single {{degree of freedom}} systems for the response prediction, {{have been the subject}} of great emphasis on research in the field of earthquake engineering particularly since the mid- 1990 s. This interest is justified still today by the great uncertainty characterizing the prediction of the seismic response: the variability of the parameters influencing the structural capacity and the seismic input definition, makes the use of sophisticated models not always effective and warranted. Furthermore, the extensive use of Non Linear Time-History (NLTH) analyses requires a calibration of the hysteretic model parameters and ground motions that seems still to date hardly applicable to day to day engineering practice. At the same time in last decade the design for earthquake resistance has undergone a critical review, triggered by the concept of Performance-Based Design. Performance objectives represent the attainment of certain damage levels for a given seismic intensity, and it has been widely recognized that the damage measure for a structure is directly related to deformations: displacements are the fundamental index of structural damage in seismic events and the achievement of the target displacement in relation to the different limit states should be the main objective of the verification procedure. Displacement-Based methods for seismic verification of structures hold together the two aspects evidenced so far, being simplified procedures which rely on a substitute SDOF structure and use as reference control parameter the target limit displacement for the system under exam. At present Displacement-Based Design (DBD) methods for new structures have reached a degree of formalization almost complete, with the recent publication of a Model Code for their adoption into seismic codes (Calvi and Sullivan, 2009). However, several aspects related to the method calibration are still matter of research, being the representativeness of the substitute linear structure a critical issue, in particular the formulation of equivalent viscous damping and the definition of the target displacement profile for a given structural system. With regard to the appraisal of existing structures, the development of Displacement-Based Assessment (DBA) approach represents the state of the art of research in this field, since so far the calibration of the methods dealt essentially with new structures only. The specific problems of the development of DBA methodologies include the prediction of the possible collapse mechanisms due to brittle <b>rupture</b> of <b>members</b> (which may be substantially different from those of the new ductile structures, designed following capacity design criteria), and the inclusion of local damage effects caused by nodes not adequately confined. In this context the research activity focuses on the evaluation, calibration and development of simplified Displacement-Based approaches for seismic verification of bridge structures, with particular reference to their use in a probabilistic framework, represented by vulnerability analyses and risk calculation on a large scale. In the first part the thesis addresses the methodological aspects of the DBD procedures focusing on the error sources of the simplified methods. In particular the current design methods for new structures with flexural ductile behaviour are evaluated, with reference to the formulations of the equivalent viscous damping and target displacement profile to be adopted in the analysis. A first study investigates the accuracy of the current Direct Displacement-Based Design (DDBD) procedure applied to simple SDOF systems (with specific reference to multi-span simply supported rc bridge piers), the main error sources being the approximation of the substitute linear structure characterized by the equivalent viscous damping, and the scaling of the displacement elastic spectrum through the modification damping factor. Using different formulations proposed in literature for equivalent viscous damping and spectrum reduction factor, a parametric study is carried out on an ample set of SDOF systems (previously designed with the DDBD method and subsequently verified with NLTH analyses), and an average error chart is obtained, allowing the prediction of the expected error for the design cases of multi-span simply supported bridge piers. A second work investigates the representativeness of the equivalent SDOF structure related to the estimation of the design displacement profile within a displacement-based framework. In the case of transverse response prediction for continuous rc girder bridges, the accuracy of the current iterative Direct Displacement-Based method (called DBD-IT in this work) is evaluated, and compared to an alternative direct design method (named DBD-DEM) herein proposed. The alternative methods combine in a non-iterative procedure the DBD framework with a Response Spectrum Analysis carried out with effective stiffness. In the second part the methodological aspects are addressed with regard to the specific issues of the existing bridge structures, not seismically designed (and not satisfying capacity design principles), and thus characterized by failure modes, limit states, hysteretic behaviour, and local ductility of the nodes that are different from those characterizing new seismically designed structures. In particular the calibration effort regards the assessment of pier capacity, piers generally representing the most vulnerable elements in existing bridges. A simplified numerical model is defined for the aggregation of phenomenological non linear shear behaviour and fiber representation of flexural behaviour for piers, calibrated by using experimental results on rc columns with flexure and shear failure extracted from on line databases (PEER database). A parametrical study is then developed for single bent and multiple bent piers (cantilever, walls frame), considering all main geometrical and material properties that can influence the pier capacity, aiming at the determination of the effective properties for existing rc bridge piers, to be used in a Displacement-Based framework. The effective ranges of the selected parameters were determined by a preliminary statistical analysis on the bridges of the reference database (the Veneto Region road network bridge stock, named VR stock). With regard to the appraisal of existing structures, the specific advantage in the use of simplified analytical procedures becomes apparent when a probabilistic seismic risk estimation is carried out on a large-scale. In this study, in the final part, the DBA method previously calibrated, is applied to assess the seismic vulnerability of the bridge stock under exam on a regional scale. A limited number of bridges are chosen as reference examples for each homogeneous subclass of multi-span bridges, comparing simplified DBA procedures with NLTH analyses for the development of analytical fragility curves, and an extensive vulnerability analysis for the class of multi-span rc bridges of the VR stock is then developed, using the previously calibrated DB fragility curves. Finally regional seismic risk maps are drafted including all the multi-span rc bridges of the VR stock, for three different scenarios of damage: the seismic risk is obtained by the convolution of hazard functions, defined on the base of the PGA exceedance probabilities provided by the current Italian seismic code, and the analytical fragility curves calculated with the Displacement-Based approaches. An immediate extension of the research on existing rc bridges, may be represented by the development of fragility curves for the whole classes of multi-span structures: these fragility functions could be obtained considering the variability in the range of geometrical and mechanical characteristics obtained from the statistical analysis of the VR database for that specific classes, and the envelope curves obtained could than be applied for the vulnerability evaluation of typical bridges of the Italian or European stocks. A long-term development of the work may regard the extension of the simplified Displacement-Based procedures to the evaluation of different classes of structures, particularly of single span rc bridges and masonry arch bridges, which represent the other major category of existing bridges, to complete as much as possible the scenario of seismic risk for the infrastructure network under examination. In this context it will be possible to calibrate the seismic input for risk analysis through the use of hazard curves, obtained from micro-zonation studies in the areas of interest. ...|$|R
