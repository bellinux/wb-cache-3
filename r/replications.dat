25|$|A second 'deliberate' {{mechanism}} is called replicative senescence or cellular senescence. Metaphorically, a cell {{may be said}} to 'count' (with its telomeres) the number of times that it has divided, and after a set number of <b>replications,</b> it languishes and dies. It has been proposed that this mechanism evolved to suppress cancer. Many invertebrates experience replicative senescence, though they never die of cancer. Even one-celled organisms count <b>replications,</b> and will die if they don't replenish their telomeres with conjugation (sex).|$|E
50|$|In Windows Server 2003 R2 and Windows Server 2008, DFS <b>Replication</b> is {{available}} {{as well as}} the File <b>Replication</b> Service. DFS <b>Replication</b> is a state-based <b>replication</b> engine for file <b>replication</b> among DFS shares, which supports <b>replication</b> scheduling and bandwidth throttling. It uses Remote Differential Compression to detect and replicate only the change to files, rather than replicating entire files, if changed. Windows Vista also includes a DFS <b>Replication</b> Service which is limited to peer-to-peer DFS <b>Replication</b> service groups.

25|$|DNA <b>replication</b> at the <b>replication</b> fork can be halted by a {{shortage}} of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) or by DNA damage, resulting in <b>replication</b> stress. This halting of <b>replication</b> {{is described as a}} stalled <b>replication</b> fork. A fork protection complex of proteins stabilizes the <b>replication</b> fork until DNA damage or other <b>replication</b> problems can be fixed. Prolonged <b>replication</b> fork stalling can lead to further DNA damage. Stalling signals are deactivated if the problems causing the <b>replication</b> fork are resolved.|$|R

In the <b>replication</b> machineries these components coordinate. In {{most of the}} bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA <b>replication</b> are located on <b>replication</b> forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA <b>replication.</b> These <b>replication</b> machineries are called replisomes or DNA replicase systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on <b>replication</b> forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.|$|R

25|$|Cold fusion {{researchers}} (McKubre since 1994, ENEA in 2011) {{have speculated}} that a cell that is loaded with a deuterium/palladium ratio lower than 100% (or 1:1) will not produce excess heat. Since most of the negative <b>replications</b> from 1989–1990 did not report their ratios, this has been proposed as an explanation for failed <b>replications.</b> This loading ratio is hard to obtain, and some batches of palladium never reach it because the pressure causes cracks in the palladium, allowing the deuterium to escape. Fleischmann and Pons never disclosed the deuterium/palladium ratio achieved in their cells, there are no longer any batches of the palladium used by Fleischmann and Pons (because the supplier uses now a different manufacturing process), and researchers still have problems finding batches of palladium that achieve heat production reliably.|$|E
25|$|The <b>replication</b> {{factories}} perform disentanglement {{of sister}} chromatids. The disentanglement {{is essential for}} distributing the chromatids into daughter cells after DNA <b>replication.</b> Because sister chromatids after DNA <b>replication</b> hold each other by Cohesin rings, there is the only chance for the disentanglement in DNA <b>replication.</b> Fixing of <b>replication</b> machineries as <b>replication</b> factories can improve the success rate of DNA <b>replication.</b> If <b>replication</b> forks move freely in chromosomes, catenation of nuclei is aggravated and impedes mitotic segregation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{brings the}} {{following}} three main contributions: a hierarchy of specifications for <b>replication</b> techniques, semi-passive <b>replication,</b> and Lazy Consensus. Based on {{the definition of the}} Generic <b>Replication</b> problem, we define two families of <b>replication</b> techniques: <b>replication</b> with parsimonious processing (e. g., passive <b>replication),</b> and <b>replication</b> with redundant processing (e. g., active <b>replication).</b> This helps relate <b>replication</b> techniques to each other. We define a novel <b>replication</b> technique with parsimonious processing, called semi-passive <b>replication,</b> for which we also give an algorithm. The most significant aspect of semi-passive <b>replication</b> is that it requires a weaker system model than existing techniques of the same family. We define a variant of the Consensus problem, called Lazy Consensus, upon which our semi-passive <b>replication</b> algorithm is based. The main difference between Consensus and Lazy Consensus is a property of laziness which requires that initial values are computed only when they are actually needed...|$|R
25|$|In {{vertebrate}} cells, <b>replication</b> sites concentrate into positions called <b>replication</b> foci. <b>Replication</b> sites can {{be detected}} by immunostaining daughter strands and <b>replication</b> enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged <b>replication</b> factors.

25|$|Many {{scientists}} {{tried to}} replicate the experiment with the few details available. Hopes faded due to {{the large number of}} negative <b>replications,</b> the withdrawal of many reported positive <b>replications,</b> the discovery of flaws and sources of experimental error in the original experiment, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts. By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead, and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science. In 1989 the United States Department of Energy (DOE) concluded that the reported results of excess heat did not present convincing evidence of a useful source of energy and decided against allocating funding specifically for cold fusion. A second DOE review in 2004, which looked at new research, reached similar conclusions and did not result in DOE funding of cold fusion.|$|E

40|$|During the mitotic {{mammalian}} cell cycle cells faithfully replicate their DNA utilizing multiple DNA <b>replication</b> sites known as origins of <b>replication.</b> DNA is replicated to provide each daughter cell a complete {{copy of the}} genome. <b>Replication</b> proceeds bi-directionally from a minority of potential origins licensed for <b>replication</b> {{by a variety of}} <b>replication</b> factor proteins. <b>Replication</b> is catalysed by processive <b>replication</b> enzymes known as DNA polymerases and is limited to the synthesis phase (S phase) of the cell cycle. Changes in the timing of <b>replication,</b> origin usage and <b>replication</b> rate are indicative of DNA <b>replication</b> stress, a proposed hallmark of cancer that causes genome instability. Cell cycle progression is largely controlled by the activity of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin binding partners. Here using an in vitro cell-free DNA <b>replication</b> system we analyse the interplay between Ciz 1 and cyclin A/CDK 2 in regulation of the initiation phase of DNA <b>replication.</b> This demonstrates that Ciz 1 modulates and enhances the activity of cyclin A-CDK 2 in cell free DNA <b>replication</b> assays and that Ciz 1 increases the permissive CDK range that can promote DNA <b>replication.</b> Next the inhibitory effect of Ap 4 A in cell free DNA <b>replication</b> assays is studied. These data suggest that Ap 4 A inhibits initiation by reducing loading of the replicative helicase MCM 2 - 7 and the DNA polymerase sliding clamp PCNA. These data suggest that Ap 4 A can inhibit the firing of <b>replication</b> origins through disruption of <b>replication</b> complex assembly. Finally, DNA combing is established to measure <b>replication</b> parameters. Here we find that the <b>replication</b> fork progresses at 1. 3 kbp/min in mouse fibroblast cells, consistent with other studies, and quantify <b>replication</b> fork stalling by <b>replication</b> inhibitor aphidicolin. These data demonstrate the potential for cell free DNA <b>replication</b> assays to be combined with DNA combing to dissect <b>replication</b> parameters and characterise DNA <b>replication</b> stress in future studies...|$|R
40|$|Bi-directionality is {{a common}} feature {{observed}} for genomic <b>replication</b> for all three phylogenetic kingdoms: Eubacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes. A consequence of bi-directional <b>replication,</b> where the two <b>replication</b> forks initiated at an origin move away from each other, is that the <b>replication</b> termination will occur at positions away from the origin sequence(s). The <b>replication</b> termination processes are therefore physically and mechanistically dissociated from the <b>replication</b> initiation. The <b>replication</b> machinery is a highly processive complex that in short time copies huge numbers of bases while competing for the DNA substrate with histones, transcription factors, and other DNA-binding proteins. Importantly, the <b>replication</b> machinery generally wins out; meanwhile, when converging forks meet termination occurs, thus preventing over-replication and genetic instability. Very different scenarios for the <b>replication</b> termination processes have been described for the three phylogenetic kingdoms. In eubacterial genomes <b>replication</b> termination is site specific, while in archaea and eukaryotes termination is thought to occur randomly within zones where converging <b>replication</b> forks meet. However, a few site-specific <b>replication</b> barrier elements that mediate <b>replication</b> termination have been described in eukaryotes. This review gives an overview about {{what is known about}} <b>replication</b> termination, with a focus on these natural site-specific <b>replication</b> termination sites...|$|R
40|$|DNA <b>replication</b> is a {{very well}} orchestrated process that results in the {{accurate}} duplication of the genome. Conditions that deregulate the <b>replication</b> timing and the DNA <b>replication</b> fork progression lead to DNA <b>replication</b> stress. In response to escalating DNA <b>replication</b> stress conditions, DNA <b>replication</b> forks stall, regress and eventually collapse. Cells have evolved multiple recombination-dependent repair pathways for <b>replication</b> fork restart like the template switching, the recombination-dependent <b>replication</b> (RDR) and the break-induced <b>replication</b> (BIR). Although these pathways will retain cell’s viability, they will do so {{at the expense of}} genomic instability. In our studies, we aimed to identify proteins that are important for <b>replication</b> fork restart under oncogene-induced DNA <b>replication</b> stress conditions. By carrying out flow-cytometry based siRNA screenings we identified 6 proteins (POLD 3, POLD 4, RAD 52, MUS 81, SMARCAL 1 and ZRANB 3) that are required for S-phase progression in DNA <b>replication</b> stress conditions.

We show that the formation of <b>replication</b> factories is a consequence of DNA <b>replication</b> itself. Our analyses of <b>replication</b> at specific DNA sequences support a long-standing hypothesis that sister <b>replication</b> forks generated from the same origin stay associated with each other within a <b>replication</b> factory while the entire replicon is replicated.

40|$|DNA <b>replication</b> is {{a central}} {{mechanism}} to all forms of life. Errors occurring during DNA <b>replication</b> can result in mutagenesis and genome rearrangements, which can cause various diseases. In this work I have investigated the stability of direct tandem repeats (TRs) {{in the context of}} <b>replication</b> and replication-associated repair mechanisms. During DNA <b>replication</b> the <b>replication</b> fork encounters many obstacles, such as DNA-protein barriers, secondary DNA structures and DNA lesions. How and if <b>replication</b> resumes or restarts in these circumstances in order to complete genome <b>replication</b> is not well understood and the ﬁdelity of <b>replication</b> in response to such obstacles remains unclear. I have developed TR assays to assess <b>replication</b> errors in the context of <b>replication</b> fork restart and secondary structures. The results suggest that structured DNA (G 4) can cause instability of TRs in the context of normal <b>replication</b> and that restarted <b>replication</b> can be intrinsically error-prone. Surprisingly, the mutagenic effect of G 4 -DNA on TR stability was not elevated in the context of <b>replication</b> fork restart. Therefore, deletions of TRs containing G 4 -DNA are not more susceptible to the compromised fidelity of a restarted <b>replication</b> fork. Structures such as stalled <b>replication</b> forks can induce checkpoint responses to maintain genome stability. The stabilisation of <b>replication</b> forks is central in the response to <b>replication</b> stress. These protective mechanisms include the regulation of enzymatic activities. Mus 81 -Eme 1 is a structure-specific endonuclease which is regulated by the DNA <b>replication</b> checkpoint, but has also been shown to be required for <b>replication</b> fork restart in certain circumstances. In collaboration with Professor Neil McDonald I analysed a novel domain identified in Mus 81 -Eme 1.
