500|$|In {{contrast}} to the past, when {{emphasis was placed on}} the applicants' ideological criteria, the current CPC stresses technical and educational qualifications. To become a probationary member, the applicant must take an admission oath before the party flag. The relevant CPC organization is responsible for observing and educating probationary members. Probationary members have duties similar to those of full members, with the exception that they may not vote in party elections nor stand for election. Many join the CPC through the Communist Youth League. Under Jiang Zemin, private entrepreneurs were allowed to become party members. According to the CPC constitution, a member, in short, must follow orders, be disciplined, uphold unity, serve the Party and the people, and promote the socialist way of life. Members enjoy the privilege of attending Party meetings, reading relevant Party documents, <b>receiving</b> <b>Party</b> education, participating in Party discussions through the Party's newspapers and journals, making suggestions and proposal, making [...] "well-grounded criticism of any Party organization or member at Party meetings" [...] (even of the central party leadership), voting and standing for election, and of opposing and criticizing Party resolutions ("provided that they resolutely carry out the resolution or policy while it is in force"); and they have the ability [...] "to put forward any request, appeal, or complaint to higher Party organizations, even up to the Central Committee, and ask the organizations concerned for a responsible reply." [...] No party organization, including the CPC central leadership, can deprive a member of these rights.|$|E

We suppose it was by Walpole's advice that he gave her Hungarian Majesty that 200,000 pounds of Secret-Service Money;--advice sufficiently Walpolean: [...] "Russian Partition-Treaties; horrible to think of;--beware of these again! Give her Majesty that cash; can be done; it will keep matters afloat, and spoil nothing!" [...] That, till the late Subsidy payable within year and day hence, was all of tangible his Majesty had yet done;--truly that is all her Hungarian Majesty has yet got by hawking the world, Pragmatic Sanction in hand. And {{if that were the}} bit of generosity which enabled Neipperg to climb the Mountains and be beaten at Mollwitz, that has helped little! Very big generosities, to a frightful cipher of Millions Sterling through the coming years, will go the same road; and amount also to zero, even for the <b>receiving</b> <b>party,</b> not to speak of the giving!

50|$|A {{unilateral}} NDA (Sometimes {{referred to}} as a one-way NDA) Involves two parties where only one party (i.e; The disclosing party) Anticipates disclosing certain information to the other party (i.e; the <b>receiving</b> <b>party)</b> and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure for some reason (e.g; maintaining the secrecy necessary to satisfy patent laws or legal protection for trade secrets, limiting disclosure of information prior to issuing a press release for a major announcement, or simply ensuring that a <b>receiving</b> <b>party</b> does not use or disclose information without compensating the disclosing party).|$|E

50|$|A {{nondisclosure}} agreement {{can protect}} {{any type of}} information that is not generally known. However, nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources {{they would not be}} obligated to keep the information secret. In other words, the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the <b>receiving</b> <b>party</b> to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party. Ironically, however, it is sometimes easier to get a <b>receiving</b> <b>party</b> to sign a simple agreement that is shorter, less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver.|$|E
