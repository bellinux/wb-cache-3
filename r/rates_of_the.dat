5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting {{for up to}} 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} it is shown that for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{nonlinear}} power amplifier behavioural modelling, the sampling rate {{can be set}} to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal, rather than to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal by making use of Zhu’s generalized sampling theorem. This claim is supported by measurements on a basestation power amplifier. The findings are that the model error obtained when the output signal is sampled at <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal is approximately 1. 5 dB higher than when the sampling rate is set to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal. However, if a sampling <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> twice <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal is used, which is still typically, much lower than <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal, the degradation is only 0. 2 dB. These are important findings that will substantially ease the requirements on ADCs used in measurement setups used for amplifier modelling...|$|R

5|$|Less than a {{third of}} those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. Of the groups shown in the table, 49% of the children, 26% of the female passengers, 82% of the male passengers and 78% of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different classes aboard Titanic, especially among women and children. Although less than 10percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92% died. Additionally, among the pets brought aboard, three survived the sinking.|$|E

The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.|$|E

Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
