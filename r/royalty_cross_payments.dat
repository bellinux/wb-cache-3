5000|$|Burials may {{be placed}} in a number of {{different}} positions. Bodies with the arms crossed date back to ancient cultures such as Chaldea in the 10th century BC, where the [...] "X" [...] symbolized their sky god. Later ancient Egyptian gods and royalty, from approximately 3500 B.C. are shown with crossed arms, such as the god Osiris, the Lord of the Dead, or mummified <b>royalty</b> with <b>crossed</b> arms in high and low body positions, depending upon the dynasty. The burial of bodies in the extended position, i.e., lying flat with arms and legs straight, or with the arms folded upon the chest, and with the eyes and mouth closed. Extended burials may be supine (lying on the back) or prone (lying on the front). However, in some cultures, being buried face down shows marked disrespect. Other ritual practices place the body in a flexed position with the legs bent or crouched with the legs folded up to the chest. Warriors in some ancient societies were buried in an upright position. In Islam, the body is placed in supine position, hands along the sides and the head is turned to its right with the face towards the Qibla. Many cultures treat placement of dead people in an appropriate position to be a sign of respect even when burial is impossible.|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} services industry is changing rapidly {{as a result}} of advances in information technology (IT), telecommunications and the Internet. Technological innovations and increasing customer demand have led to the emergence of new services and new organizational forms for {{financial services}} firms. Willingly or unwillingly, banks are being forced to move toward worldwide operation. This enables them to offer services and credit facilities on a global scale, tailored to customers regardless of where they are based. However, variations among national markets present obstacles as well as opportunities to companies attempting to “go global. ” This paper describes specific problems and solutions for the globalization of banking services, and a case study carried out on payment services for an international bank to develop a new system architecture for <b>cross</b> border <b>payment.</b> The proposed architecture aims to keep a part of the processes local, but transfers the core of the transaction operations to a centralized system with clear services and clear interfaces. The bi-directional translation of formats makes standardized processing possible, while output for the specific contexts can be provided in the original formats. An important property of the architecture is that the rich context has been integrated into the handling of transactions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Today {{we still}} do not have a widely {{available}} digital cash system for the masses. This is not because there are no inventions in this area or the money community is out of ideas on how to construct such a system. It is mainly because there are conflicts of interests between banks, government and community. In this paper we first present a short history of money and look at these conflicts. Then we focus on the so-called success-factors, which are essential for a highly accepted e-Payment system. Based on these success-factors, we will present a new system called fairCASH. By adopting our fairCASH system, users {{will be able to make}} payments of any value, including micro payments. fairCASH is a multipurpose, multi-currency, pre-paid inter-operable scheme for domestic usage and <b>cross</b> border <b>payments.</b> It features non-account-related completely anonymous payment transactions by encrypting the transferred e-Tokens. There is no need of registration for users of the fairCASH e-Money system. It is suitable for person-to-person, chip-to-chip or P 2 P money transfers. It is independent of the communication platform or the digital transmission standard. Highlights are the inherent zero transaction costs for B 2 C, B 2 B and C 2 C operations. Last but not least, we would like to point out that the system posses the multi-hopping capability allowing e-Token circulation that is very advantages for users of such system. Keywords...|$|R

This is specifically caused by decoupling direct payments from agricultural production, which will increase the market orientation of agriculture and by implementing cross compliance. A number of key aspects promoting a future environment-friendly development of the CAP are suggested, based on an empirical analysis of the impact of this reform in eight German regions. In particular, we recommend the coupling of direct payments with the provision of environmental and social welfare services as well as the installation of a long-term monitoring system to enhance the understanding of the links between policy, behaviour of farmers and environmental systems. reform of the Common European Agricultural Policy, decoupling of direct <b>payments,</b> <b>cross</b> compliance, regional embeddedness of farmers, intrinsic motivation,...|$|R

Based on an empirical analysis of the consequences of the CAP reform in eight German regions, a number of key aspects for a future environmentally friendly development of the agrarian policy are suggested. The results indicate that the CAP reform currently does not increase the proportion of environmentally friendly production systems significantly. Cross Compliance is shown to have certain positive effects; it improves the control of environmentally damaging farm activities, in particular in the field of nitrate control. However, positive effects are limited and CC is often negatively associated with nature conservation. The results furthermore show that farms are affected varyingly by the CAP reform.

40|$|Since 1 January 2002, {{consumers}} {{have been paying}} with euro banknotes and coins everywhere in the euro area, irrespective of the country, but non – cash payments between two countries continued to be expensive and complicated. Because of this fact, further integration was needed. To push the process forward, the European Union adopted a new law in December 2001 (Regulation no. 2560 / 2001). Banks had to charge the same fees for cross – border and national payments, but the costs for processing <b>cross</b> – border <b>payments</b> were still high. The banks could no longer pass on the costs to the customers, so they were losing money. This drove the banks to create the European Payments Council (EPC) in 2002.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} an auction {{mechanism}} for airspace slots, {{as a means}} of solving the European airspace congestion problem. A disequilibrium, between Air Traffic Control (ATC) services supply and ATC services demand are at the origin of almost one fourth of delays in the air transport industry in Europe. In order to tackle this congestion problem, we suggest modifying both pricing and allocation of ATC services, by setting up an auction mechanism. Objects of the auction will be the right for airlines to cross a part of the airspace, and then to benefit from ATC services over a period corresponding to the necessary time for the <b>crossing.</b> Allocation and <b>payment</b> rules have to be defined according to the objectives of this auction. The auctioneer is the public authority in charge of ATC services, whose aim is to obtain an efficient allocation. Therefore, the social value will be maximized. Another objective is to internalize congestion costs. To that end, we apply the principle of Clarke-Groves mechanism auction: each winner has to pay the externalities imposed on other bidders. The complex context of ATC leads to a specific design for this auction...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the reform}} of payment systems from netting {{settlement}} systems to Real Time Gross Settlement systems (RTGS) {{around the world in}} recent years, there is a dramatic increase in the interest in modeling the large-valued interbank payment system. Recently some queueing facilities have been introduced in the response to the liquidity management within the RTGS systems. Since stochastic process models have been wildly applied in social networks, and some aspects of which have similar statistical properties with the payment system, therefore, based on the existing empirical research, a Markov type model for RTGS payment system with queueing and collateral borrowing facilities was developed. We analysed the effect on the performance of the payment system of the parameters, such as the probabilities of payment delay, the initial cash position of participating banks and the probabilities of <b>cross</b> bank <b>payments.</b> Two models were proposed; one is the simplest model where payments were assumed to be equally distributed among participating banks, the other one is a so-called "cluster" model, that there exists a concentration of payments flow between a few banks according to the evidence from empirical studies. We have found that the performance of the system depends on these parameters. A modest amount of total initial liquidity required by banks would achieve a desired performance, that minimising the number of unsettled payments by the end of a business day and negligible average lifetime of the debts. Because of the change of large-valued interbank payment systems, the concern has shift from credit risk to liquidity risk, and the payment systems around world started considering or already implemented different liquidity saving mechanisms to reduce the high demand of liquidity and maintain the low risk of default in the mean time. We proposed a specified queueing facility to the "cluster" model with modification with the consideration of the feature of the UK RTGS payment system, CHAPS. Some of thepayments would be submitted into a external queue by certain rules, and will be settled according an algorithm of bilateral or multilateral offsetting. While participating banks's post liquidity will be reserved for "important" payments only. The experiment of using simulated data showed that the liquidity saving mechanism was not equally beneficial to every bank, the banks who dominated most of the payment flow even suffered from higher level of debts {{at the end of a}} business day comparing with a pure RTGS system without any queueing facility. The stability of the structure of the central queue was verified. There was evidence that banks in the UK payment system would set up limits for other members to prevent unexpected credit exposure, and with these limits, banks also achieved a moderate liquidity saving in CHAPS. Both central bank and participating banks are interested in the probability that the limits are excess. The problem can be reduced to the calculation of boundary crossing probability from a Brownian motion with stochastic boundaries. Boundary crossing problems are very popular in many fields of Statistics. With powerful tools, such as martingales and infinitesimal generator of Brownian motion, we presented an alternative method and derived a set of theorems of boundary crossing probabilities for a Brownian motion with different kinds of stochastic boundaries, especially compound Poisson process boundaries. Both the numerical results and simulation experiments are studies. A variation of the method would be discussed when apply it to other stochastic boundaries, for instances, Gamma process, Inverse Gaussian process and Telegraph process. Finally, we provided a brief survey of approximations of Levy processes. The boundary crossing probabilities theorems derived earlier could be extended to a fair general situation with Levy process boundaries, by using an appropriate approximation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although current {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) {{should be performed}} for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), accessibility to this important health care service for severe heart emergency among floating population in Guangzhou remains largely unstudied and poorly understood. This retrospective study explored the variations in the odds of receiving primary PCI for STEMI patients among floating population and residential population in Guangzhou. Methods: Study {{data were collected from}} the First People’s Municipal Hospital of Guangzhou to conduct a cross-sectional study of 1, 216 patients with STEMI (code 410 of ICD- 9) for the period from 2009 to 2014. Data in this study, including demographic and clinical characteristics, invasive treatment and pre-hospital delay time, was retrieved from electronic medical record system developed in 2005 and maintain a comprehensive electronic record of all patients of hospital. Chi-square test was performed to evaluate the differences in demographic characteristics and coexisting condition among STEMI patients between floating population and residential population. Differences in receipt primary PCI, pre-hospital delay time and door-toballoon time between two population groups were evaluated by a binary logistic regression model. To evaluate the performance odds, I adjusted for age, gender, and coexisting conditions. Data of the study was analysed using the SPSS 21 package software. Result: Compare to residential population, STEMI patients in floating population were less likely to receive primary PCI (20. 5 % vs 26. 3 %, P= 0. 049). On adjusting for sex, age and coexisting conditions, the odds of receipt primary PCI for STEMI patients in floating population was lower than residential population (floating population, OR= 0. 63, 95 % CI= 0. 45 - 0. 88; residential population, OR= 1. 0). More pre-hospital delays of STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI were found in floating population, the odds of delay time > 6 hours was higher than residential population (OR= 4. 27, 95 % CI= 1. 49 - 12. 24). There was no statistical difference in door-to-balloon time > 90 minutes between two population groups (OR= 1. 61, 95 % CI= 0. 60 - 4. 32). Conclusion: Patients with STEMI in Guangzhou floating population were less likely to receive primary PCI. Policy interventions including government subsidy on severe disease in population, pilot medical insurance schemes, and transferability of insurance <b>payment</b> <b>cross</b> provinces are needed to increase the accessibility to emergency severe health care for STEMI patients in floating population. Additionally, an educational program on early symptoms and rapid response of STEMI should be established to increase the awareness at national level, especially in floating population. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
