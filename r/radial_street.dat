25|$|The city {{suffers from}} traffic {{problems}} {{largely due to}} this <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> pattern, {{making it difficult for}} Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities. Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (Zona a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has {{led to the creation of}} night-time ZTLs in those districts.|$|E
2500|$|Tverskaya Street (...) , known between 1935 and 1990 as Gorky Street (...) , is {{the main}} <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> in Moscow. The street runs Northwest from the central Manege Square in the {{direction}} of Saint Petersburg and terminates at the Garden Ring, giving the name to Tverskoy District. The route continues further as First Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, Leningradsky Avenue and Leningradskoye Highway.|$|E
2500|$|In 1804, as {{principal}} agent opening {{the area for}} the Holland Land Company, Joseph Ellicott, the architect of Washington D.C., designed a <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes similar to the street system he used in the nation's capital. Although Ellicott named the settlement [...] "New Amsterdam," [...] the name did not catch on.|$|E

50|$|According to this plan, {{the streets}} of Nikšić radiate {{to the north and}} east from the central city square (today a roundabout), locally known as Skver. The <b>radial</b> <b>streets</b> are intersected by {{circumferential}} streets and avenues, thus creating a half-spider web-like street layout.|$|R
2500|$|John Galt, {{the first}} Superintendent of the Canada Company, {{selected}} Guelph as {{the headquarters of}} British development firm [...] "the Canada Company". Galt was a popular Scottish novelist who also designed the town to attract settlers and farmers to the surrounding countryside. His design intended the town to resemble a European city centre, complete with squares, broad main streets and narrow side streets, resulting {{in a variety of}} block sizes and shapes which are still in place today. The street plan was laid out in a <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> and grid system that branches out from downtown, a technique which was also employed in other planned towns of this era, such as Buffalo, New York.|$|E

This metric is also called Moscow metric.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s, {{the city}} {{government}} has proposed conversion of the Garden Ring to a one-way street, completely separated from <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> traffic. The public and professionals equally reject {{the idea of a}} one-way, 18-lane street.|$|E
50|$|On 15 May 2009 {{the representatives}} of the Social Movement “Arkhnadzor” Y. V. Mezentseva and K. P.

5000|$|In 1804, Joseph Ellicott, a {{principal}} {{agent of the}} Holland Land Company, designed a <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes, {{and is one of}} only three <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> patterns in the US [...] In 1810, the Town of Buffalo was formed from {{the western part of the}} Town of Clarence. On December 30, 1813, during the War of 1812, British troops and their Native American allies first captured the village of Black Rock, and then the rest of Buffalo, burning most of both to the ground. Buffalo gradually rebuilt itself and by 1816 had a new courthouse. In 1818, the eastern part of the town was lost to form the Town of Amherst.|$|E
50|$|The {{city centre}} {{is the oldest}} part of town and lies south of the palace in the {{quadrant}} defined by nine of the <b>radial</b> <b>streets.</b> The {{central part of the}} palace runs east-west, with two wings, each at a 45° angle, directed southeast and southwest (i.e., parallel with the streets marking the boundaries of the quadrant defining the city center).|$|R
2500|$|The {{developed}} part of {{the city}} is currently arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing, since 1999, two-thirds of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) diameter circle with the Man Sculpture and his supporting complex at the very center ( [...] in 2012). <b>Radial</b> <b>streets,</b> sometimes called Avenues, extend from the Man to the outermost circle.

Baroque architecture became dominant in the city during the first sixty years, culminating in the Elizabethan Baroque, represented most notably by Italian Bartolomeo Rastrelli with such buildings as the Winter Palace. In the 1760s, Baroque architecture was succeeded by neoclassical architecture.|$|R

50|$|The Professor’s Colony {{with the}} <b>radial</b> <b>streets</b> system and semicircular square {{followed}} the current urban planning {{ideas in the}} third decade of the 20th century, {{and the idea of}} garden cities. The colony supposed, apart from the unified allotment, relatively unified type of buildings as well. Most of the buildings in the Professor’s Colony were created on the basis of standardized projects which were built by the architects Svetozar Jovanović, Mihailo Radovanović and Petar Krstić at the beginning of 1926.|$|R

50|$|Buffalo’s {{original}} plan {{from the early}} 19th century was loosely based on Pierre Charles L’Enfant’s 1791 plan for Washington, an Americanized version of Paris’s system of radiating boulevards. Buffalo’s <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> grid was designed by Joseph Ellicott and complemented by a system of parks and parkways designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Buffalo was the first city for which Olmsted designed an interconnected park and parkway system rather than stand-alone parks.|$|E
50|$|Povarskaya Street (Поварская улица), {{known from}} 1924-1991 as Vorovsky Street (улица Воровского), is a <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> {{in the center}} of Moscow, Russia, {{connecting}} Arbat Square on Boulevard Ring with Kudrinskaya Square on the Garden Ring. It is known informally as Moscow's Embassy Row, and is home to the finest mansions built in the 1890s and 1900s. Povarskaya Street also houses the Supreme Court of Russia and the Gnessin State Musical College.|$|E
5|$|With {{the land}} secured, the campus was {{designed}} {{in a way}} to ensure the maximum collaboration between the different sciences, with buildings laid along <b>radial</b> <b>streets</b> emanating from a central circular plaza, which also hosted administrative buildings. The layout of the campus would eventually be used on the design of the university's logo, created by Max Schiefer, which is essentially a simplified map of the core circle of the campus. This design is similar to the University of California, Irvine campus, build around the same time.|$|R
2500|$|Florence was {{an early}} model of the new urban planning, which took on a star-shaped layout adapted from the new star fort, {{designed}} to resist cannon fire. This model was widely imitated, reflecting the enormous cultural power of Florence in this age; [...] "he Renaissance was hypnotised by one city type which for {{a century and a}} half— from Filarete to Scamozzi— was impressed upon utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city". <b>Radial</b> <b>streets</b> extend outward from a defined centre of military, communal or spiritual power.|$|R
5000|$|The {{city was}} planned with the palace tower (Schloss) {{at the center}} and 32 streets {{radiating}} out from it like the spokes of a wheel, or the ribs of a folding fan, so that one nickname for Karlsruhe in German is the [...] "fan city" [...] (Fächerstadt). Almost all of these streets survived until today. Because of this city layout, in metric geometry, Karlsruhe metric refers to a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along <b>radial</b> <b>streets</b> and along circular avenues around the centre.|$|R
50|$|Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street (Большая Никитская улица, Nikitskaya Ulitsa) is a <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> {{that runs}} west from Mokhovaya Street to Garden Ring in Moscow, between Vozdvizhenka Street (south) and Tverskaya Street (north). Central, {{eastern part of}} the street is notable for its {{educational}} institutions (old Moscow State University and Moscow Conservatory) and theaters, western part beyond the Boulevard Ring has many Neoclassical mansions and competes with nearby Povarskaya Street for the title of Moscow's Embassy Row.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the outer}} fortifications were {{demolished}} {{during the period of}} Napoleonic rule in Milan under the Cisalpine Republic. The semi-circular Piazza Castello was constructed around the city side of the castle, surrounded by a <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> layout of new urban blocks bounded by the Foro Buonoparte. The area on the [...] "country" [...] side of the castle was laid out as a 700 by 700 m square parade ground known as Piazza d'Armi.|$|E
5000|$|The main, central square {{was very}} {{important}} for the concept of [...] "building for the community", thus planning of the main square was a separate project, won by Károly Kós one of the star architects of the period. He designed the arrangement with the <b>radial</b> <b>street</b> layout and also one of the trademark wooden gates (the eastern one). Many of the famed architects of the era (e.g. Lajos Schodits, Béla Eberling, Dezső Zrumeczky, Gyula Wälder and Dénes Györgyi) designed houses on the square.|$|E
50|$|The clever {{layout of}} streets {{also makes it}} very quiet as the <b>radial</b> main <b>streets</b> route {{vehicular}} traffic efficiently onto the heavily used, multiple-lane streets surrounding the area.|$|R
5000|$|Scholars have {{identified}} the structure of Arkaim as the cities built [...] "reproducing {{the model of the}} universe" [...] described in ancient Indo-European spiritual literature, the Vedas and the Avesta. The structure consists of three concentric rings of walls and three <b>radial</b> <b>streets,</b> reflecting the city of King Yima described in the Rigveda. The foundation walls and the dwellings of the second ring are built according to swastika-like patterns; the same symbol is found on various artefacts. Arkaim is designated as a [...] "national and spiritual shrine" [...] of Russia and has become a holy site for Rodnover, Zoroastrian and other religious movements.|$|R
40|$|Field trial {{results when}} {{applying}} a particular ramp metering strategy to an urban corridor network (Corridor Périphérique in Paris) including a motorway, a parallel arterial, and connecting <b>radial</b> <b>streets</b> are reported. The impact of ramp metering on corridor traffic is studied by comparative evaluation of several performance indices {{in the cases}} with and without control. The main finding of the field trial is that application of an efficient ramp metering strategy considerably improves traffic conditions {{not only on the}} motorway but also on the parallel arterial and on the whole corridor network. This improvement is found to be even more accentuated in presence of nonrecurrent congestion caused by traffic incidents. ...|$|R
