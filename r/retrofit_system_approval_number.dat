40|$|A {{polymeric}} {{hybrid composite}} system made of high-performance concrete (HPC) and an innovative carbon/epoxy reinforced polymer (CFRP) unidirectional laminates was proposed as a <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> to enhance flexural {{strength and ductility}} of reinforced concrete (RC) slabs. The effectiveness of the proposed system was confirmed through experimental evaluation of three full-scale one-way slabs having two continuous spans. In this study, {{the results of the}} loading tests for the hybrid high-performance <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> are presented and discussed. Design limits to derive a flexural failure of a continuous RC slab strengthened with the hybrid <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> are extracted. Using the proposed design limits, the procedure of a flexural failure design for a continuous RC slab strengthened with the hybrid <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> is demonstrated with numerical examples for two types of the <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> with respect to overlay strength. The flexural failure design limits can be extended for flexural and shear strengthening design with externally bonded FRP to ensure flexure failure for a continuous flexural members. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to recent}} seismic {{activity}} in the Netherlands, the demand of adequate strengthening and retrofitting techniques increased, especially for single leaf masonry. Two Dutch companies founded in the re-gion have initiated an experimental program to study the applicability of existing stand-alone seismic <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> on the unique and challenging situation in Groningen. During the out-of-plane experiments it was con-cluded that the existing materials used in stand-alone <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> were insufficient and needed improve-ment. By applying special developed glue and combining two stand-alone seismic retrofit measures, an ampli-fying effect in terms of load bearing capacity and ductility was reached. The proposed seismic <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> is tested in bending on wallettes and on walls which were loaded in-plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{threat against}} government and public {{facilities in the}} United States and abroad has highlighted {{the need to provide}} an economic and efficient method to retrofit existing conventional structures. Hollow, unreinforced, concrete masonry unit (CMU) infill walls, commonly used in reinforced concrete or steel framed structures, are particularly vulnerable to blast loads. Facilities that incorporate CMU walls must either be hardened or retrofitted for explosive events. Conventional retrofit techniques that focus on increasing the overall strength of the structure by adding steel or concrete are difficult to implement, time consuming, expensive, and in some cases, increase the debris hazard. The current research presents an alternative <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> for CMU walls that involves the application of an elastomeric material applied to the interior surface of the wall to prevent secondary debris in the form of CMU fragments from entering the structure when it is exposed to blast loads. The experimental program used to evaluate the alternative <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> was divided into three phases. In Phase one, resistance functions for seven different <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> were developed in 24 subscale static experiments. In Phase two, the structural response of the <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> subjected to blast loads was evaluated in 25 subscale experiments. The final phase of the experimental program consisted of 18 full-scale high-explosive (HE) experiments used to validate the structural response observed in the subscale dynamic experiments. Data generated from the experimental program were used to develop a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model to predict the mid-span deflection of the retrofitted CMU walls subjected to blast loads. The subscale resistance functions from Phase one were scaled and used in the SDOF model. The full-scale experimental results and the predicted results from the model were compared and the <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> were ranked according to the qualitative and quantitative results obtained from the experimental and analytical research...|$|R

40|$|According {{to recent}} {{technology}} road maps, system cost reductions {{and development of}} standardised plug-and-function systems {{are some of the}} most important goals for solar heating technology development. Retrofitting hot water boilers in single-family houses when installing solar collectors has the potential to significantly reduce both material and installation costs. Previous studies have investigated such retrofitting, using theoretical simulations and laboratory tests, but no actual installations were made and tested in practice. This article describes the installation, measured performance and cost effectiveness of a retrofitting solution that converts existing domestic hot water heaters to a solar domestic hot water system. The measured performance is characterised by the monthly and annual solar fractions. The cost effectiveness is evaluated by a life-cycle cost analysis, comparing the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>system</b> to a conventional solar domestic hot water system and the case without any solar heating system. Measurements showed that approximately 50 % of the 5000 kWh/year of domestic hot water consumption was saved by the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>system</b> in south Sweden. Such savings are in agreement with previous estimations and are comparable to the energy savings when using a conventional solar domestic hot water system. The life-cycle cost analysis showed that, according to the assumptions and given climate, the return on investment of the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>system</b> is approximately 17 years, while a conventional system does not reach profitability during its lifetime of 25 years...|$|R

40|$|Past {{high speed}} wind events have exposed the {{vulnerability}} of the roof systems of existing light-framed wood structures to the uplift forces resulting from high speed winds, contributing greatly to economic and human loss. This research focuses on developing a <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> to increase the uplift capacity of these structures using numerical and experimental techniques. The proposed system provides the uplift forces an alternate load path to the ground, reducing the demand placed on the weak, nailed connections within the structure. A three-dimensional finite-element model of a roof system of full-scale wood structure has been developed. The model is compared to the results of a full-scale experiment in both the linear and nonlinear ranges, proving the ability of the model to predict the deflected shape of the structure. The numerical results identify the importance of considering the nonlinear plastic damage that occurs to the roof-to-wall connection under realistic wind loading. The validated numerical model is then extended to include the proposed retrofit idea. A rigorous analysis of the behaviour of the structure after application is then carried out. The model predicts that application of the <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> can increase the critical mean hourly wind velocity from 38 m/s to 50 m/s. An experiment has been conducted, proving the <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> is effective at increasing the uplift capacity of light-framed wood structures. The results of the experiment have been used to validate the assumptions of the numerical model, proving that the model captures the structural interaction between the <b>retrofit</b> and truss <b>systems...</b>|$|R
