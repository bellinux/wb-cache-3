Tsang in Beijing to attend the “Mainland and Hong Kong SAR major {{infrastructure}} coordination meeting”, and with the State Development Planning Commission and the relevant ministry officials, the talks were initially on <b>Regional</b> <b>Express</b> <b>railway</b> line connecting Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, focussing on the design and coordination of consensus between the parties.

50|$|A {{high-speed}} railway connecting Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, railway {{was brought}} up in the late 1990s by the Government of Hong Kong. This <b>Regional</b> <b>Express</b> <b>Railway</b> (RER) proposal was developed in the 1994 “Railway Development Study” (RDS); it foresaw a continual growth of Hong Kong's population {{over the next two decades}} and strong demand for cross-border passenger traffic. The Hong Kong (SAR) Government commissioned a second Railway Development Study in March 1998. The Study went further on the British proposal of connecting Hong Kong and China from Kowloon. The RER could be further extended to Hong Kong Island. At the same time, the report recommended that Hung Hom station should continue to play a central role in Hong Kong's mass transit. Since the typical timeframe for rail projects, from conception to completion phase, would take eight or nine years, the Railway Development Study recommended that the Hong Kong (SAR) Government should commence as soon as possible, so that the new express railway could be constructed in time to meet capacity demands.|$|E
