25|$|In the 1970s, {{money market}} funds began disintermediating banks from their classic {{interposition}} between savers and borrowers. The funds provided a more direct link, with less overhead. Large banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Notably, the Fed is itself owned by the large private banks, and controls the overall supply {{of money in the}} United States. The OCC is housed within the Treasury Department, which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multi-trillion dollar debt of the U.S. government. The overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs. actual ongoing tax receipts. Unquestionably, the private banking industry, bank regulation, the national debt, and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected. Interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the Fed, and inflation (all else being equal) allows today's fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars. The third major bank regulator, designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bailout fund and <b>resolution</b> <b>authority</b> that can eliminate banks that are failing, with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself. They also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits.|$|E

40|$|Failures of internationally active banks {{some years}} ago pointed to {{deficiencies}} in private and public governance for such banks as Banco Ambrosiano, BCCI, and Barings.

40|$|This paper {{looks into}} the {{specific}} influence that the European banking union will have on (future) bank client relationships. It shows that the intended regulatory influence on market conditions in principle serves as a powerful governance tool to achieve financial stability objectives. From this vantage, it analyzes macro-prudential instruments with a particular view to mortgage lending markets - the latter have been critical {{in the emergence of}} many modern financial crises. In gauging the impact of the new European supervisory framework, it finds that the ECB will lack influence on key macro-prudential tools to push through more rigid supervisory policies vis- 0 -vis forbearing national authorities. Furthermore, this paper points out that the current design of the European bail-in tool supplies <b>resolution</b> <b>authorities</b> with undue discretion. This feature which also afflicts the SRM imperils the key policy objective to re-instill market discipline on banks' debt financing operations. The latter is also called into question because the nested regulatory technique that aims at preventing bail-outs unintendedly opens additional maneuvering space for political decision makers...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyses}} some of {{the legal}} and economic policy issues concerning proposals to establish a European Banking Union. It discusses {{the role of the}} European Central Bank as a bank supervisor and the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The article then critically analyses the draft Directive on Bank Recovery and Resolution (RRD) and argues that it is inadequate to serve as one of the pillars of banking union. The article reviews the difficulties of Member States in implementing the RRD by analysing the United Kingdom’s resolution framework as a case study. Finally, the article suggests that although strengthened powers for national <b>resolution</b> <b>authorities</b> are necessary to enhance the RRD, the logic of banking union demands further centralisation of sovereign authority in the Euro area in order to manage more effectively the resolution and recovery of financial institutions and to establish more institutional coherence with the ECB/SSM as bank supervisor. Further centralisation of banking supervision and resolution powers, however, could result in a deepening split in the EU internal market between member states not participating in banking union and participating states...|$|R

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis, {{the question of how to}} handle a big bank's collapse has arisen. Large banks perform functions that if disrupted could seriously damage the financial sector and the real economy. The European Union's new resolution regime introduced by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) aims at orderly resolution of banks, with creditors - and to greatest the extent possible, not the taxpayer - bearing the cost of bankruptcy, while the banking functions crucial to the financial system and the economy continue to be performed. The Single Resolution Board (SRB) has been set up exactly to carry out this task in the banking union. This Policy Contribution evaluates the obstacles to resolvability that the legal and operational structures of the large euro-area banks could present, assuming that it is possible to liquidate smaller and medium-sized banks through transfer of their relevant activities to other banks. Dirk Schoenmaker classifies the large euro-area banks according to their number of legal entities, foreign assets and their governance. From this, he identifies three groups of banks: 1. domestic banks with a limited number of entities; 2. domestic cooperative banks with more complicated legal and decision-making structures; 3. cross-border banks with complex structures operating in multiple jurisdictions. The paper focuses on specific aspects of the SRB's resolvability assessment process. The legal and operational structures of banks should facilitate the separation of critical and non-critical bank operations. Non-critical operations should be liquidated when a bank is in resolution. The SRB should take a strict line on critical functions and, if necessary, overrule national <b>resolution</b> <b>authorities</b> (NRAs). The SRB should not only simplify complex legal structures but also streamline protracted decision-making procedures within banks. Only when effective cooperation arrangements with foreign <b>resolution</b> <b>authorities</b> are in place, should the SRB rely on the efficient single-point-of-entry (SPE) approach. Otherwise, a multiple-point-of-entry (MPE) approach is more realistic. Within the banking union, the SRB should promote the more efficient SPE approach in cooperation with NRAs. There is currently no clarity on the provision of liquidity to a resolved bank. Liquidity is important if the resolved bank is to re-open for business. Dirk Schoenmaker recommends that the European Central Bank should clarify that it is prepared to provide emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to properly resolved banks...|$|R
