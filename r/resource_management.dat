5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew <b>resource</b> <b>management.</b> For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew <b>Resource</b> <b>Management,</b> while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew <b>Resource</b> <b>Management</b> class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of 'boundary work' perspectives for enhancing current approaches in water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> and research {{with a focus on}} developing countries. Boundary work thinking is analysed in the context of three currently leading approaches for water and natural <b>resources</b> <b>management,</b> i. e. Integrated Water <b>Resources</b> <b>Management,</b> Adaptive Management, and the Ecosystem Approach. Given the political dimension of water <b>resources</b> <b>management,</b> questions of governance are merged into the boundary work perspective. The paper introduces the Boundary Work framework as developed by Mollinga (2010 a), discusses {{the potential of}} the framework for enhancing water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> and research practice and proposes amendments to the framework. Based on the analyses and following the rationale of Mollinga's boundary work framework, the paper is meant to spark the discussion on a generic 'boundary concept' to communicate about problems in water <b>resources</b> <b>management,</b> to reflect upon a general protocol to develop suitable 'boundary objects' and to cogitate on 'boundary settings' to understand limitations and limits to change towards sustainable water <b>resources</b> <b>management.</b> This serves the development of operational guidance how to approach complex water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> problems, aiming for: increased sustainability of current water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> systems, improved research and management approaches under uncertainty, increased adaptive capacity, enhanced resilience to changes, such as climate change. Further, fields for future research in the context of boundary work and water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> are outlined...|$|R

5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and <b>resource</b> <b>management,</b> that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, they realized that the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game Hearthstone, taking design cues from the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head of strategy games Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as impactful on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> with individual unit combat.|$|E

Qualitative approaches such as semi-structured interviews, participatory observation and literature review were used in this study. This study demonstrates that the water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> of Omnogovi province is unsustainable in this time period, yet the implementation of IWRM approach has improved the water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> of the province. The barriers to sustainable water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> in Omnogovi province are inefficient governance and poor enforcement of law, today. Despite it, data-scarcity and transboundary water issues might become barriers to practice efficient water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> in the province. The involvement of residents in water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> of Omnogovi province is deficient, yet the implementation of participatory approach and establishment of RBC might improve the participatory governance. The study shows IWRM can improve the water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> of a developing country, yet it can be time-consuming, costly and challenging to implement in a country, which is still in socio-economic and political transition. ...|$|R

This study used a bottom-up approach to analyse water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> practices and livelihoods in the river basin. The objective {{of the study was to}} understand practices in water <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> at the local level, and what drives those practices.
