David Thomson wrote about [...] "the problem in assessing [...] career: who did what in their collaboration? And what is Donen's real standing as a director?" [...] Thomson remarked that [...] "nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen's retreating crane shot." [...] However set reports state that Kelly <b>rode</b> the camera <b>boom</b> between shots and during camera set-ups. Donen stated that [...] "by the time you hash it through {{from beginning to end}} ten million times, you can't remember who did what except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea." [...] Composer Saul Chaplin said that [...] "Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an eager and talented pupil." [...] During the shooting of On the Town, all memos and correspondence from MGM to the production were addressed exclusively to Donen and not to Kelly.|$|R
40|$|The Great Barrier Reef is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of the Australian properties on United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) World Heritage List. At {{the time of its}} inscription in 1981, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature noted that ‘… if only one coral reef site in the world were to be chosen for the World Heritage List, the Great Barrier Reef is the site to be chosen’. The listing followed the ‘Save the Reef’ campaign, which ran through the 1960 s and 1970 s and highlighted threats from rapid industrialization and a nation <b>riding</b> a resources <b>boom.</b> Nevertheless, in recent years, the Reef has teetered on being named a ‘World Heritage Site in Danger’, with similar economic conditions driving its deterioration. This article juxtaposes recent media activism to protect the Reef against the earlier campaign in order to compare and better understand how these campaigns engaged publics and policy makers by representing and communicating threats, and concludes by considering their capacity to influence long-term conservation policy.

5000|$|The Salopians {{finally found}} a {{financier}} and {{the first issue of}} Private Eye was published on 25 October 1961. Rushton put it together in his bedroom in Scarsdale Villas using Letraset and cow-gumming illustrations onto cards which were taken away to be photo-lithographed. He also contributed all the illustrations and the mast-head figure of Little Nitty (who still appears on the cover, a blended caricature of John Wells and the Daily Express standard-head). One critic described the original lay-out of the magazine as owing much to [...] "Neo-Brechtian Nihilism", although Rushton thought it resembled a betting shop floor. One feature in the early issues was the [...] "Aesop Revisited", a full-page comic strip which let him work in a wealth of puns and background jokes. With Private Eye <b>riding</b> the satire <b>boom,</b> Peter Cook soon took an interest and contributed two serials recounting the bizarre adventures of Sir Basil Nardly-Stoads and the Rhandi Phurr, both of which were illustrated by Rushton, as was [...] "Mrs Wilsons Diary". In the early days the team also worked on two books, Private Eye on London and Private Eyes Romantic England that make heavy use of his cartooning talents. One of the first Private Eye-published books was Rushtons first collection of cartoons, Willie Rushtons Dirty Weekend Book (banned in Ireland).|$|R
40|$|The author proposes and {{estimates}} a microeconomic investment model {{to determine the}} relative importance of three explanations for Mexico's investment decline in the early 1980 s: the decline in oil prices; the termination of capital inflows; and the effects of debt overhang and uncertainty. He uses investment data for private industries between 1981 and 1985, which have yet to be used in addressing the question under discussion. The data indicate that the main microeconomic mechanism driving the decline in investment was a rise in the relative price of investment goods - especially the relative price of machinery (a traded good in Mexico). Moreover, the decline in trade (driven by falling world oil prices) explains much of the increase in this relative price. The decline in Mexico's international terms of trade was probably the most important ultimate cause of the increased relative cost of machinery, but the reversal in net capital inflows to Mexico probably also played a role in increasing this relative price. On this point, the evidence is not as clear. After controlling for these effects, the author finds little evidence that the effects of debt overhang and uncertainty {{had much to do with}} the investment decline. The author points out that investment in Texas and Louisiana (which were also <b>riding</b> the oil <b>boom</b> of 1973 - 81) also fell in 1981 - 86, and adverse commodity price shocks also affected many other heavily indebted countries. At the very least, commodity price shocks (such as Mexico's decline in oil prices) as a direct cause of declining investment levels in the 1980 s have been insufficiently emphasized in the literature on the effects of the international debt crisis.
