5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and <b>residential</b> <b>use.</b> The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and <b>residential</b> <b>use.</b> As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|Lakeshore East {{features}} {{several of}} the tallest buildings in Chicago and may include {{a few of the}} tallest buildings in the United States. The overall planned development, the park, and {{several of the}} individual buildings have won awards for architecture and/or urban planning. The buildings are planned for various types of <b>residential</b> <b>use</b> (condominiums, apartments, or hotels). Due to the neighborhood's proximity to both Lake Michigan to the east and the Chicago River to the north, many of the buildings are named with aquatic or nautical themes. As of August 2008, 1,500 condominiums have been sold and 1,200 apartments have been completed.|$|E

5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead {{poisoning}} became {{common in the}} work setting. The introduction of lead paint for <b>residential</b> <b>use</b> in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood {{lead poisoning}} occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in <b>residential</b> <b>use</b> but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E

5|$|St Anne's Church, Hindsford was {{originally}} a mission occupying a barn which was replaced in 1901 by a church designed by Austin and Paley on Tyldesley Road. It {{has since been}} converted to <b>residential</b> <b>use.</b> St Michael and All Angels at Howe Bridge was built in 1877. There are chapels of the Wesleyan, Baptist, Independent Methodist, and Primitive Methodist denominations; a Congregational church at Howe Bridge was opened in 1904. Roman Catholics celebrated mass in a loft behind the Star and Garter public house on Tyldesley Square until Sacred Heart Church opened in Hindsford in 1869. The site was given by Lord Lilford with building materials donated by John Holland, manager of Yew Tree Colliery in Tyldesley. It served the growing Catholic population in Hindsford and Tyldesley. Sacred Heart closed in 2004 and its parish together with those of St Richard's in Mayfield Street which opened in 1928, Holy Family in Boothstown, St Ambrose Barlow in Astley, St Gabriel's, Higher Folds in Leigh are now united as a single community with St Margaret Clitherow as its patron.|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} {{recognized}} {{the historic district}} in its zoning code. It divides the area into six separate districts — the Riverfront, First, Second, Third, Fourth Street and Fifth Avenue local historic districts. The Riverfront district includes the neighborhood to the northwest listed on the National Register as the Northern River Street Historic District. The other five are roughly aligned with the eponymous streets, with the First Street district consisting of two detached areas, the Second and Third street districts taking {{up most of the}} central area and the other two occupying the northeastern corner of the district. The city has also made some grants and tax exemptions available to qualified property owners. The city's current master plan calls for enhancing the district's mixed-use character, by encouraging both <b>residential</b> <b>use</b> and businesses that serve consumers, particularly retailers, and providing tax incentives for the rehabilitation of historic homes.|$|E
5|$|Baptists {{had been}} worshipping {{in the town}} since 1669, and had two churches. One was built in Sheppards Barton (now South Parade) in 1708. This was {{demolished}} and replaced by a new building in 1850, which was itself closed in 2001. Part of this building was converted to <b>residential</b> <b>use</b> but the main church, with a baptism pool, remains disused. A second Baptist Church was built in Badcox Lane (now Catherine Street) in 1711. It was replaced with a new building in 1813, which was embellished with a Doric portico in 1845. It closed in 1962 (later serving as a library, before being converted into flats in the 1980s). The Methodist church, built in 1812 at Gorehedge, is still in use after considerable additions in 1863, restoration in 1871 and major internal rearrangement in the 1980s. Sun Street Chapel was erected by the Primitive Methodists in 1834, and closed in 1982, although it was used by another religious group afterwards. It is now used as a Community Centre. There is another Methodist church on Portway, built in 1910. A Dissenters' Cemetery with Chapel at Vallis Road, was founded in 1851 by Frome's 'Free Churches', mainly Baptist, Congregational and Methodist and has been the site of over 6,000 burials.|$|E

40|$|While <b>residential</b> land <b>use</b> {{change is}} {{ubiquitous}} in Tijuana, {{it is not}} a random process. The presence of commercial or industrial land uses, for example, can make certain areas more or less desirable places to live. This can affect the socioeconomic character of a neighborhood and influence the amount of investment people are willing to put into homes in that location. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine features of the built and physical landscape which affect change in <b>residential</b> land <b>use.</b> With an understanding of these features, a predictive model of <b>residential</b> land <b>use</b> change is developed.
