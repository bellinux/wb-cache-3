40|$|An {{important}} element of any Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) is the phasor measurement algorithm. The role of such algorithm is to extract fundamental frequency phasors from signals measured on secondary winding of a current transformer (CT). As a result of faults and switching in primary network {{we can expect to}} have current signals with high amplitude of exponentially decaying DC. In these conditions, the measured current signal can also be influenced by high <b>remanent</b> <b>flux</b> in the CT core. These factors may lead to different degrees of CT saturation. During saturation, the CT output is no longer accurately representing the primary current signal. Consequently, the implemented measurement and protection functions in IEDs are affected. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the measurement algorithms implemented in IEDs, in particular Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Two-Sample algorithms, to factors which cause CT to saturate. Impact analysis of the following uncertain factors will be presented: amplitude and time constant of the asymmetrical fault current, and <b>remanent</b> <b>flux</b> in CT core. The study has been performed at three different CT burden values. Uncertainty of the measurement algorithms during CT saturation was assessed using mean, standard deviation and bounds of measurement error. Uncertainty results show that higher measurement bias is encountered at higher burden.

40|$|Axial flux {{machines}} {{may give}} higher power-to weight ratios than conventional radial flux machines. As the axial flux machine {{can easily be}} constructed with a multi-rotor configuration, it is well suited for ironless stator design, which has gained interest in the latest years due {{to the development of}} high <b>remanent</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> permanent magnets. In addition to the reduced eddy current losses and weight of the stator itself, an ironless design eliminates the magnetic forces acting on the stator, so that the necessity of a heavy stator frame is reduced. Several winding topologies exist for ironless stators, and it can be interesting to compare these with each other. For this purpose, an ironless axial flux 110 pole dual rotor permanent magnet machine with easily exchangeable stator has been made. This machine allows preliminary tests on different stator designs before more expensive prototypes are built. As all active parts of the machine are visible, it may also serve as a demonstration model for electro-mechanical energy conversion. Simulations done on a single-layer 3 -level-endturn winding with q= 6 / 5 shows an induced voltage of 40. 22 V at 50 Hz. This corresponds well with measurements done on a stator segment covering 2 / 11 of the machine. The measured DC resistance of this segment is equivalent of 2. 51 &# 937; for a complete stator, which even though somewhat less than calculated, is rather large due to long endturns compared to the radial length of the conductors.

40|$|Electrical machine drives are {{the most}} {{electrical}} energy-consuming systems worldwide. The largest proportion of drives is found in industrial applications. There are, however many other applications that are also based {{on the use of}} electrical machines, because they have a relatively high efficiency, a low noise level, and do not produce local pollution. Electrical machines can be classified into several categories. One of the most commonly used electrical machine types (especially in the industry) is induction motors, also known as asynchronous machines. They have a mature production process and a robust rotor construction. However, in the world pursuing higher energy efficiency with reasonable investments not every application receives the advantage of using this type of motor drives. The main drawback of induction motors is the fact that they need slipcaused and thus loss-generating current in the rotor, and additional stator current for magnetic field production along with the torque-producing current. This can reduce the electric motor drive efficiency, especially in low-speed, low-power applications. Often, when high torque density is required together with low losses, it is desirable to apply permanent magnet technology, because in this case {{there is no need to}} use current to produce the basic excitation of the machine. This promotes the effectiveness of copper use in the stator, and further, there is no rotor current in these machines. Again, if permanent magnets with a high <b>remanent</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> are used, the air gap flux density can be higher than in conventional induction motors. These advantages have raised the popularity of PMSMs in some challenging applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), wind turbines, and home appliances. Usually, a correctly designed PMSM has a higher efficiency and consequently lower losses than its induction machine counterparts. Therefore, the use of these electrical machines reduces the energy consumption of the whole system to some extent, which can provide good motivation to apply permanent magnet technology to electrical machines. However, the cost of high performance rare earth permanent magnets in these machines may not be affordable in many industrial applications, because the tight competition between the manufacturers dictates the rules of low-cost and highly robust solutions, where asynchronous machines seem to be more feasible at the moment. Two main electromagnetic components of an electrical machine are the stator and the rotor. In the case of a conventional radial flux PMSM, the stator contains magnetic circuit lamination and stator winding, and the rotor consists of rotor steel (laminated or solid) and permanent magnets. The lamination itself does not significantly influence the total cost of the machine, even though it can considerably increase the construction complexity, as it requires a special assembly arrangement. However, thin metal sheet processing methods are very effective and economically feasible. Therefore, the cost of the machine is mainly affected by the stator winding and the permanent magnets. The work proposed in this doctoral dissertation comprises a description and analysis of two approaches of PMSM cost reduction: one on the rotor side and the other on the stator side. The first approach on the rotor side includes the use of low-cost and abundant ferrite magnets together with a tooth-coil winding topology and an outer rotor construction. The second approach on the stator side exploits the use of a modular stator structure instead of a monolithic one. PMSMs with the proposed structures were thoroughly analysed by finite element method based tools (FEM). It was found out that by implementing the described principles, some favourable characteristics of the machine (mainly concerning the machine size) will inevitable be compromised. However, the main target of the proposed approaches is not to compete with conventional rare earth PMSMs, but to reduce the price at which they can be implemented in industrial applications, keeping their dimensions at the same level or lower than those of a typical electrical machine used in the industry at the moment. The measurement results of the prototypes show that the main performance characteristics of these machines are at an acceptable level. It is shown that with certain specific actions it is possible to achieve a desirable efficiency level of the machine with the proposed cost reduction methods...|$|E
