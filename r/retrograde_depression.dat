40|$|In the {{cerebellar}} {{molecular layer}} parallel fibre terminals release glutamate {{from both the}} active zone and from extrasynaptic "ectopic" sites. Ectopic release mediates transmission to the Bergmann glia that ensheathe the synapse, activating Ca(2 +) -permeable AMPA receptors and glutamate transporters. Parallel fibre terminals exhibit several forms of presynaptic plasticity, including cAMP-dependent long-term potentiation and endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression, {{but it is not}} known whether these presynaptic forms of long-term plasticity also influence ectopic transmission to Bergmann glia. Stimulation of parallel fibre inputs at 16 [*]Hz evoked LTP of synaptic transmission, but LTD of ectopic transmission. Pharmacological activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin caused LTP at Purkinje neurons, but only transient potentiation at Bergmann glia, reinforcing the concept that ectopic sites lack the capacity to express sustained cAMP-dependent potentiation. Activation of mGluR 1 caused depression of synaptic transmission via retrograde endocannabinoid signalling but had no significant effect at ectopic sites. In contrast, activation of NMDA receptors suppressed both synaptic and ectopic transmission. The results suggest that the signalling mechanisms for presynaptic LTP and <b>retrograde</b> <b>depression</b> by endocannabinoids are restricted to the active zone at parallel fibre synapses, allowing independent modulation of synaptic transmission to Purkinje neurons and ectopic transmission to Bergmann glia.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reason why}} neurons {{synthesize}} {{more than one}} endocannabinoid (eCB) and how this {{is involved in the}} regulation of synaptic plasticity in a single neuron is not known. We found that 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and anandamide mediate different forms of plasticity in the extended amygdala of rats. Dendritic L-type Ca(2 +) channels and the subsequent release of 2 -AG acting on presynaptic CB 1 receptors triggered <b>retrograde</b> short-term <b>depression.</b> Long-term depression was mediated by postsynaptic mGluR 5 -dependent release of anandamide acting on postsynaptic TRPV 1 receptors. In contrast, 2 -AG/CB 1 R-mediated retrograde signaling mediated both forms of plasticity in the striatum. These data illustrate how the eCB system can function as a polymodal signal integrator to allow the diversification of synaptic plasticity in a single neuron...|$|R
5000|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} cannabinoid receptor stimulation on neurotransmitter release have caused this {{system to be}} connected to various forms of depressant plasticity. A recent study conducted with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis found that the endurance of the depressant effects was mediated by two different signaling pathways based on the type of receptor activated. 2-AG was found to act on presynaptic CB1 receptors to mediate <b>retrograde</b> short-term <b>depression</b> (STD) following activation of L-type calcium currents, while anandamide was synthesized after mGluR5 activation and triggered autocrine signalling onto postsynapic TRPV1 receptors that induced long-term depression (LTD). Similar post-synaptic receptor dependencies were found in the striatum, but here both effects relied on presynaptic CB1 receptors. [...] These findings provide the brain a direct mechanism to selectively inhibit neuronal excitability over variable time scales. By selectively internalizing different receptors, the brain may limit the production of specific endocannabinoids to favor a time scale in accordance with its needs.|$|R
5000|$|CB1 {{induction}} of LTD and STD {{have been}} shown in the Dorsal striatum, Amygdala, Prefrontal cortex, Ventral tegmental area, and the BNST. A recent study compared the endocannabinoid induction of LTD and STD in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and striatum. Results found that both short- and long-term effects were dependent on CB1 receptor activation in the striatum, whereas LTD induction in the BNST relied on TRPV1 receptor. Effects vary based on the endocannabinoid molecule: 2-AG was found to act on presynaptic CB1 receptors to mediate <b>retrograde</b> short-term <b>depression</b> following activation of L-type calcium currents, whereas anandamide was synthesized after mGluR5 activation and triggered autocrine signalling that induced long-term depression. [...] These findings demonstrate the CB1 receptor as a direct mechanism for the brain to selectively inhibit neuronal excitability over variable time scales. By selectively internalizing different receptors, the brain may limit the production of specific endocannabinoids to favor a time scale in accordance with its needs. mGlu5 forms a heterodimer with A2A, which allows endocannabinoids to regulate their own levels, as they inhibit cAMP production, thus increase free adenosine to agonise A2A. This forms a feedback loop between {{the positive and negative}} metabotropic receptors, which can maintain a relatively similar homeostasis with any neuron connected through an electrical synapse.|$|R
40|$|Endocannabinoid (eCB) {{signaling}} mediates depolarization-induced {{suppression of}} excitation (DSE) and inhibition (DSI), two prominent forms of <b>retrograde</b> synaptic <b>depression.</b> N-Arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), two known eCBs, are degraded by {{fatty acid amide}} hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), respectively. Selective blockade of FAAH and MAGL is critical for determining {{the roles of the}} eCBs in DSE/DSI and understanding how their action is regulated. 4 -Nitrophenyl 4 -(dibenzo[d][1, 3]dioxol- 5 -yl(hydroxy) methyl) piperidine- 1 -carboxylate (JZL 184) is a recently developed, highly selective, and potent MAGL inhibitor that increases 2 -AG but not AEA concentrations in mouse brain. Here, we report that JZL 184 prolongs DSE in Purkinje neurons in cerebellar slices and DSI in CA 1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. The effect of JZL 184 on DSE/DSI is mimicked by the nonselective MAGL inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. In contrast, neither the selective FAAH inhibitor cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3 ′-carbomoylbiphenyl- 3 -yl ester (URB 597) nor FAAH knockout has a significant effect on DSE/DSI. JZL 184 produces greater enhancement of DSE/DSI in mouse neurons than that in rat neurons. The latter finding is consistent with biochemical studies showing that JZL 184 is more potent in inhibiting mouse MAGL than rat MAGL. These results indicate that the degradation of 2 -AG by MAGL is the rate-limiting step that determines the time course of DSE/DSI and that JZL 184 is a useful tool for the study of 2 -AG-mediated signaling...|$|R
40|$|In {{the nucleus}} accumbens (NAc), a key {{structure}} {{to the effects}} of all addictive drugs, presynaptic cannabinoid CB 1 receptors (CB 1 Rs) and postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGluR 5 s) are the principal effectors of endocannabinoid (eCB) -mediated <b>retrograde</b> long-term <b>depression</b> (LTD) (eCB-LTD) at the prefrontal cortex–NAc synapses. Both CB 1 R and mGluR 5 are involved in cocaine-related behaviors; however, the impact of in vivo cocaine exposure on eCB-mediated retrograde synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Electrophysiological and biochemical approaches were used, and we report that a single in vivo cocaine administration abolishes eCB-LTD. This effect of cocaine was not present in D 1 dopamine receptor (D 1 R) �/ � mice and was prevented when cocaine was coadministered with the selective D 1 R antagonist 8 -chloro- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro- 3 – 5 – 1 h- 3 -benzazepin- 7 -ol (0. 5 mg/kg) or with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blocker (�) - 5 -methyl- 10, 11 -dihydro- 5 H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten- 5, 10 -imine maleate (1 mg/kg), suggesting the involvement of D 1 R and NMDAR. We found that the cocaine-induced blockade of retrograde signaling was correlated with enhanced expression levels of Homer scaffolding proteins containing the coiled-coil domain and accompanied by a strong reduction of mGluR 5 surface expression. The results suggest that cocaine-induced loss of eCB retrograde signaling is caused by a reduction in the ability of mGluR 5 to translate anterograde glutamate transmission into retrograde eCB signaling...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} (mean age 64 years) with {{a previous}} episode of transient global amnesia (TGA) were examined {{to assess the}} functioning of objective memory (by using the Randt Memory Test), the metamemory capacities (Sehulster Memory Scale), the residual level of retrograde amnesia (Questionnaire of Remote Events), {{and the level of}} depression (Geriatric Depression Scale). Patients with residual retrograde amnesia scored significantly lower than non-amnesic ones on indices of both short-term and long-term memory, and for one of three main metamemory components, namely self-rating of memory functioning through comparison with memory functioning of peers (Set 3). Age, time interval from TGA attack and TGA duration did not prove to influence memory and metamemory scores. <b>Retrograde</b> amnesia and <b>depression</b> were rather substantially associated (1 / 5), and this association was found to negatively influence nearly all memory and metamemory scores. Depression level showed a positive correlation with short-term memory functioning in non-amnesics. The different pattern and strength of the relationships between metamemory components and objective memory dimensions observed in amnesics and non-amnesics indicate that metamemory evaluations are more closely related to memory functioning in amnesics than in non-amnesics...|$|R
