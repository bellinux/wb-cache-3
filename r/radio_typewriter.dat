5000|$|In 2010, Adornato's artwork {{took on a}} distinctively {{different}} {{look that}} tended towards [...] "assemblage". He began to work with antiquated materials from before the 1960s: everything from reclaimed barn wood, to <b>radios,</b> <b>typewriters,</b> cameras, sewing machines, to vintage fur pelts, antlers, and World War II-era gas masks. His hybrid assemblage/mash-up style continues to be prevalent in his current sculptural work. Recent notable creations are the Hunting Dissent series, which {{was the subject of}} a conflict with a local eatery when Adornato spoke out against an alleged copy of his work. The Hunting Dissent series, along with the dark-humored BlowUp Dolls, and the emerging train-derailment series Progress Derailed, are among those shown in many non-traditional venus in Ottawa.|$|R
5000|$|Baron {{has also}} {{repaired}} and restored old clocks, music boxes, <b>radios</b> and <b>typewriters</b> since childhood. In 2007, Baron spent about 70 hours repairing the [...] "Draughtsman-Writer" [...] automaton by Henri Maillardet (1745-1830). A version of Maillardet’s automaton, a self-powered robot that writes poetry and draws four different images, was in Martin Scorsese’s movie Hugo and Brian Selznick’s book The Invention of Hugo Cabret.|$|R
50|$|Tobin's third company, Concept Industries, Inc., {{was founded}} in 1975. While he served as {{president}} and CEO, the company developed computer software training programs, which went on {{to be used by}} most major word-processing and photo-typsetting systems like Compugraphic, Olivetti, Philips USA, <b>Radio</b> Shack, Royal <b>Typewriter,</b> Savin, and Xerox, to name a few.|$|R
5000|$|Normal {{occupancy}} of Wordie House in {{its early}} years was four to five people. Cans of coffee and other goods, records, tools, paint cans, plates, pots, pans, books, <b>typewriters,</b> <b>radio</b> equipment, and other items still remain in the hut, making it a fascinating time capsule of life in one of the first scientific stations established in Antarctica.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Museum of Technology and Textile Industry== The Museum {{preserves}} {{traditions of}} the wool industry in Bielsko-Biała, by means of collecting machines, equipment and documents related to this field of manufacturing. The exhibits are stored in four rooms. Each of them is commensurate with division of old textile factory - preliminary treatment mill, weaving mill and finishing mill. A separate unit consists of machines for making hats. The display is complemented by exhibition devoted {{to the history of}} Bielsko-Biała fire brigade and of municipal water supply system. There is also a little printing office and a so-called museum granary, where all the historical household equipments, <b>radio</b> sets, <b>typewriters</b> etc., are being stored. The historical lathe, drilling machines and locksmith tools remind of the traditions of metal processing industry in Bielsko.|$|R
50|$|The film also {{attempts}} to explore unanswered questions, such as why prison officials tolerated the relationship {{for a full}} decade before Blank and Jacobsz were executed. (In an interview packaged with the DVD release, John Greyson notes the real Blank and Jacobsz began their relationship {{when they were both}} teenagers - Blank having been imprisoned on Robben Island at age 16 - and were actually known to be a couple for twenty years before they were charged with sodomy and executed, when they were both nearly 40.) Intentional anachronisms - such as transistor <b>radios,</b> electric <b>typewriters</b> and jeeps - are also used in the film to illustrate Greyson's larger theme that homophobia and racism of the type that led to Blank's and Jacobsz' executions are still very much present in today's world. These twentieth-century objects, including modern (c. 1964) dress on many occasions, are invariably presented in juxtaposition with eighteenth-century items. The eighteenth-century prison commandant, for example, is replaced by a former subordinate, who wears a twentieth-century guard's uniform and is often accompanied by a fierce-looking Alsatian on a short lead.|$|R
2500|$|In 1974, Art Salsberg became {{editor of}} Popular Electronics. It was Salsberg's goal {{to reclaim the}} lead in {{electronics}} projects. He was impressed with Don Lancaster's TV <b>Typewriter</b> (<b>Radio</b> Electronics, September 1973) article and wanted computer projects for Popular Electronics. Don Lancaster did an ASCII keyboard for Popular Electronics in April 1974. They were evaluating a computer trainer project by Jerry Ogdin when the Mark-8 8008-based computer by Jonathan Titus appeared on the July 1974 cover of Radio-Electronics. The computer trainer was put on hold and the editors looked for a real computer system. (Popular Electronics gave Jerry Ogdin a column, Computer Bits, starting in June 1975.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The first ORT {{school in}} Israel opened in Jaffa in 19491. Its {{beginnings}} were modest, with only short courses for discharged soldiers, {{in order to}} make it easier for them to integrate into the country's economy. The school was headed by engineer Zvi Rivlin. Thus ORT Israel was founded, and this was also the beginning of technology education in the State of Israel. The school operated for seven consecutive years in extremely crowded conditions. The first courses were in welding, carpentry, pajama sewing, weaving, <b>radio,</b> electricity, and <b>typewriter</b> repair. Hundreds of discharged soldiers and new immigrants passed through the school, studying mainly in evening classes. At the end of the 1950s, ORT managed to open the new and very modern school in Tel Aviv, Yad Eliyahu named ORT Syngalowsky.|$|R
