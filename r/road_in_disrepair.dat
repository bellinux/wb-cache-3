50|$|Naomi R. Patton of The Detroit News {{said that}} the park serves as an illegal dumping ground and has <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b> Kenneth Cheyne, {{a member of the}} family who had donated much of the park land, {{regularly}} patrolled the park in a Mercedes, looking for prostitutes and people who illegally dump waste. Cheyne argues that the park is in a highly derelict situation.|$|R

50|$|When Vanderbilt {{bought the}} estate in 1895, the farm complex across {{what was then}} just the Albany Post <b>Road</b> was <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b> The herdsman's house, an 1830 one-and-half-story five-bay {{rectangular}} frame building with gabled asphalt-shingled roof, was built when Robert Langdon owned the property.

In 1880, GBMA officers were Grand Army of the Republic members from various states, by late 1882 GBMA funds were nearly exhausted, {{and by the}} 1890s the GBMA's <b>roads</b> were <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Laws of the Twelve Tables, {{dated to}} about 450 BC, {{specified}} that a road shall be 8Roman feet (perhaps about 2.37 m) wide where straight and twice that width where curved. Actual practices varied from this standard. The Tables command Romans to build roads and give wayfarers {{the right to}} pass over private land where the <b>road</b> is <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b> Building <b>roads</b> that would not need frequent repair therefore became an ideological objective, as well as building them as straight as possible {{in order to build}} the narrowest roads possible, and thus save on material.|$|R
50|$|The {{road was}} {{operative}} till 1990 but was ignored {{by both the}} Tamil Nadu Forest Department and the Kerala Highways Department {{in a dispute over}} its inter-state ownership. The old <b>road</b> is now <b>in</b> <b>disrepair</b> and overgrown with vegetation in some places. It is used as a logging trail and as a walking trail by local villagers and trekkers. Encounters with wild animals including bison, elephants, Leeches and leopards sometimes occur on the trail.|$|R
5000|$|When the British {{advanced}} northwards in November 1917, {{the railway}} was sabotaged by the retreating Turkish army and most (five) of its bridges were blown up. The Turks carried away {{anything that was}} movable, from railway cars and wooden rails to parts of the stations. It was however still valuable to the British, as it provided the only viable link from Jerusalem to Egypt, as the <b>roads</b> were <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b> Trestle bridges were installed instead of the destroyed iron ones and a [...] gauge railway was built from Jaffa to Lydda, with an extension to the Yarkon River, the front line at the time., it continued to be used until 1922-23 mainly for transporting construction materials, without locomotives. Another [...] gauge railway extension was built from Jaffa railway station to Port of Jaffa, which operated until 1928.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the plank}} road company lasted {{less than two}} decades, it {{had its share of}} controversy. In the January 1853 case of Wilson v. Rochester and Syracuse Railroad Company, Wilson, the plaintiff, was {{traveling}} southbound along the plank road through Elbridge. At a grade crossing with railroad tracks, Wilson fell off his horses and wagon upon hitting the tracks. He then fell onto the tracks below and was permanently injured as a result. In 1861, during Jordan & Skaneateles Plank Road Company vs. Morley, the company sued Morley for evading the toll in Elbridge. Morley countered that the <b>road</b> was <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b> However, on the plaintiff's side, the toll collector was aware that Morley had passed through the toll gate but took no action to enforce the toll. If Morley had paid, he would have been liable for $62.50 (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|R
50|$|Since around 2010, a {{small number}} of the {{buildings}} have been demolished, either for development, or because they were unsafe. Beginning around 2012, parts of the area have been restored, with the building facades overhauled and <b>road</b> surfaces <b>in</b> severe <b>disrepair</b> being replaced with cobblestones. As of June 2015, the entire west side of the areas has had new cobblestone roads installed. A number of the buildings on the northern boundary on Binhai Road have been demolished and replaced with buildings in the original style.|$|R
2500|$|When the British {{advanced}} northwards in November 1917, {{the railway}} was sabotaged by Austrian saboteurs from the retreating Central Powers army and most (five) of its bridges were blown up. The Turks carried away {{anything that was}} movable, from railway cars and wooden rails to parts of the stations. It was however still valuable to the British, as it provided the only viable link from Jerusalem to Egypt, as the <b>roads</b> were <b>in</b> <b>disrepair.</b> Trestle bridges were installed instead of the destroyed iron ones, and the first British train reached Jerusalem on December 27, 1917. In February 1918, a Decauville [...] gauge railway was built from Jaffa to Lydda, with an extension to the Auja River, the front line at the time. This extension was furthered to the Arab village al-Jalil (today the Glilot area), and continued to be used until 1922–23 mainly for transporting construction materials, without locomotives. Another extension was built from the Jaffa station to the port, which operated until 1928.|$|R
50|$|During the {{planning}} stage, information arriving from {{people on the}} ground in Zimbabwe suggested that the <b>roads</b> were <b>in</b> severe <b>disrepair,</b> causing traffic to move very slowly. This was interpreted by the riders to mean safety from traffic would be high since everyone would be trying to miss potholes. However, on arrival in Zimbabwe, {{it soon became clear that}} vehicles, including heavy wagons, were moving much faster than expected, and were overtaking much more dangerously than was anticipated. For this reason, traffic became the single biggest threat to rider safety during the ride.|$|R

50|$|The {{climate and}} {{topography}} {{of the municipal}} divide into two parts. The land is beautiful and many take hiking trips for fun since the climate is almost perfect. This is increasing tourism in the area. Many buses departing from Mexico City arrive to this destination and visitors spend time in the so famous water parks throughout the community. One well known park is El Parque Acuatico De Dios Padre. This particular park offers transportation, hotels, camping and services for tourists that come from Mexico City. Many immigrants that migrated to the U.S. in the 1980s as the result in shortages of farm labor in California are from this particular area. Now in their late 20's, many have now obtained a {{higher education in the}} U.S. and are now returnig to their homeland in Ixmiquilpan. This has let to new entreneurship in the area. Small businesses of tourism and hotels can now be found across the city. The southern portion is dry with green areas only where there is irrigation. It is relatively flat. The north in squarely in the Mezquital Valley and is considerably higher, wetter and more mountainous. A mountain ridge separates the two sections. The highest elevations are found at the La Palma, Thito, Muñeca, Guadril, Temboo, Dexitzo and Daxhie Mountains. These and other mountains have forests which contain pine, oak, walnut {{and a number of other}} trees. The dry areas contain vegetation such as mesquite, nopal, palms and other plants adapted to arid areas. Much of the agriculture in the municipality occurs in the relatively flat south which relies on irrigation due to the lack of rainfall. Main crops are corn, beans, animal feed and tomatoes. Livestock raised includes cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, turkeys and bees. There is some fishing in the north, where water is abundant, but it is mostly for auto-consumption.Almost a third of the population of the municipality still speaks an indigenous language, and this is almost exclusively Otomí. This is especially true in the smaller communities such as San Alberto, located in one of the lower portions of the Mezquital Valley off the highway between Ixmiquilpan and El Progreso, near the Tula River. It is a village of about 700 people, all of whom speak Otomi and a number speak little or no Spanish. They are farmers, living off the harvests of corn, beans and other staples. It is a poor town, with <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>disrepair</b> and no streetlights. While the village has been converting this fresh water and hot springs here into bathing pools to attract tourism, many of their young people go to the United States to work and send back money.|$|R
