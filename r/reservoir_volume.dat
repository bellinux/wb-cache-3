25|$|In the upstream, above Belgorod, {{the river}} {{contains}} several dams and small reservoirs. In the downstream, after {{the confluence of}} the Wolf River (Volchiya River), there is Pechenihy <b>Reservoir</b> (<b>volume</b> 86km3) which supplies water to the city of Kiev. Below Pechenga Reservoir, Donets is fed by Udy and by its largest tributary Oskol. There the valley widens and contains numerous oxbow lakes in its floodplain. Within Ukraine, the river flows between the Cisdesna plateau and the Donets lowland. In its middle, the river is partly fed by the Dnieper River waters which are brought though the Dnieper–Donbas–Seversky Donets channels which provide water to the coal industry of the Donets Basin, usually called the Donbass. Near the Russian city of Donetsk (Rostov oblast), the river crosses the Donets Ridge and flows in a narrow valley with steep and rocky slopes. In the lower part of Donets lowland, the flow is interrupted by sluices and is slow. At the delta it splits into three distributaries.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} two years the state {{continued}} to delay allowing the reservoir to fill because the Bureau of Reclamation had not convincingly demonstrated that [...] "the irrigation need will outweigh any damage that results to fish, wildlife and recreation in the watershed above New Melones Dam." [...] Further studies by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Reclamation itself showed that completely filling New Melones Lake would, in fact, offset some of the benefits of the project. For example, if additional water were provided for farms, even more water would have to be released into the Stanislaus River to wash out polluted return flows from new irrigation. A larger reservoir would also halt the Stanislaus' spring flooding {{to such an extent that}} it would harm the salmon populations that the dam was intended to benefit. Also, a higher reservoir would allow for less flood control space in emergencies. The state determined that the optimal <b>reservoir</b> <b>volume</b> was , which would provide enough water to fulfill existing rights and fishery flows as well as provide a hedge against droughts and floods; although it would inundate about [...] of the river above Parrott's Ferry, FOR agreed to this compromise.|$|E
