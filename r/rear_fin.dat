25|$|The Zonda 760RS {{is another}} one-off version built for a {{businessman}} in Chile, who {{is said to}} be a very close friend of Horacio Pagani. It the engine attached to a sequential gearbox and finished with a carbon exterior and black interior. The 760RS also features a distinctive <b>rear</b> <b>fin</b> that runs down the centre of the car, while also feature the same air ducts and roof air intake as the Cinque.|$|E
25|$|The Zonda 764 Passione {{features}} the same appearances {{as that of}} the 760RS and the 760LH, but it is an upgraded Zonda F and features a bigger rear spoiler and bigger distinctive central <b>rear</b> <b>fin.</b> It is finished in grey carbon fibre with accents of natural carbon fibre with light grey striping on the sides and the Italian flag running alongside the nose just like on the Tricolore. The car has purple-pink interior with wooden steering wheel, all done upon customer's request. The engine is mated to the same 6-speed manual gearbox Lewis Hamilton commissioned on his Zonda. The 764 Passione was delivered to its owner in Tokyo, Japan in December 2012. The car is Zonda F chassis No.83.|$|E
25|$|That the {{bodywork}} enclosing all of Chapman's {{innovative technology}} was similar in appearance to the Vanwall Grand Prix cars was no accident, as both cars had been sculpted by pioneer automotive aerodynamacist Frank Costin. As {{with many of}} Lotus's competition cars, the aluminium used to construct the bodywork was extremely thin and offered {{little in the way}} of support for the underlying chassis members. The car was extremely low and compact, with the bonnet barely reaching the same height as the tops of the front wheels, despite the smaller diameters used from the 1959 season onward. The driver sat in a slightly reclined position — nowhere near as extremely inclined as Chapman would later inflict upon his pilots but still unusual for its day — and behind the driver rose a stubby <b>rear</b> <b>fin,</b> incorporating the fuel tank.|$|E

Toyota debuted the third generation Prius (2010 US model year) at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, and sales began in Japan on May 18, 2009.

50|$|However, in Gran Turismo Sport, all {{of these}} {{specifications}} change. There are now four front graphene canards, a FIA-based <b>rear</b> <b>fin,</b> and a large external wing. Also, when seen driving around a track, the performance will be found to be on par with a normal LMP1 prototype race car.|$|E
5000|$|These series' modest tailfin era styling {{reflected}} the US-led trend. In Mercedes terminology the short <b>rear</b> <b>fins</b> were designated Peilstege, parking aids which {{marked the end}} of the car for aid in backing.|$|R

50|$|The Copperhead's {{new look}} {{includes}} larger wheel fenders, a larger front bumper, a slightly smaller front grille, headlights positioned below the hood, side inlet pits (rather than the regular side performance inlets), removed front air intake, smaller hood louvers, a stubby top <b>rear</b> <b>fin,</b> smaller Viper taillights, and front wheels {{that have been}} slightly moved forward for better handling.|$|E

50|$|The styling, {{finalised}} by Stanley Watts of H. J. Mulliner, {{was influenced}} by aerodynamic testing conducted at Rolls-Royce's wind tunnel by Evernden's assistant, Milford Read. The <b>rear</b> <b>fins</b> stabilised the car at speed and made it resistant to changes in direction due to crosswinds.|$|R
50|$|Viewed {{from the}} outside, the Wolseley 16/60 was {{differentiated}} from the 15/60 by the overriders on the bumpers which protruded more {{than on the}} earlier car: the plastic mouldings on the rear lights were also modified along with the <b>rear</b> <b>fins,</b> now much reduced in their sharpness.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{design was}} inspired by aerospace engineering, with {{the inclusion of a}} <b>rear</b> <b>fin,</b> and a cockpit-like cabin. The cockpit cabin will differ, depending on the amount of chosen seats, from one to three. The chassis design was designed by L.M. Gianetti. The interior slightly represents the British-built sports car, the McLaren F1, with the inclusion of three seats, but this is only if the customer has chosen the option of three front seating. The interior also contains a denim material for the seats, which is constructed by high-end Italian clothing company, PT Pantaloni Torino.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{the first}} {{wingless}} glider, SeaExplorer was released {{with a large}} payload capacity, dedicating the first third of the vehicle to interchangeable payloads, in addition to typical CTD sensors.

50|$|While the {{personal}} luxury, pony, and muscle cars {{got most of}} the attention, the full sized cars formed the bulk of auto sales in the 1960s, helped by low oil prices. The styling excesses and technological gimmicks (such as the retractable hardtop and the pushbutton automatic transmission) of the 1950s were de-emphasized. The <b>rear</b> <b>fins</b> were downsized and largely gone by the mid-1960s, as was the excessive chrome.|$|R

A tachometer was available. Safety features such as an impact absorbing, deep-dish steering wheel, front seat stops (to keep the front seat from breaking away) and safety door locks were standard, while seat belts and a padded dash were optional.|$|E

50|$|New 2011 Le Mans Prototype {{regulations}} will {{render the}} first-generation 908 obsolete; Peugeot began {{development of a}} new prototype, known as the 90X, in late 2009. Officially unveiled on 3 February 2011 at the French manufacturers’ signature store on the Champs-Élysées, the new 908 is similar in design to the 908 HDi FAP but includes larger front wheels similar to the Audi R18 as well as a new ACO-mandated <b>rear</b> <b>fin.</b> The new 908 features a 3.7 L V8 that remains diesel-fueled. However, Oreca continued to run with the old 908 HDi FAP in 2011. With the ending of Peugeot's motorsport program in 2012, 2011 marks the last year of competition for the 908 family.|$|E

50|$|Histiophryne is a genus of frogfishes {{found in}} waters ranging from Taiwan to South Australia. There are {{currently}} three known species.

50|$|Targeting is by {{search radar}} and beam {{transmitter}} with targets tracked by a search radar until a beam riding transmitter locks on, {{at which point}} the missile can be fired, riding the beam until impact, proximity fuze or radio signal detonation.
