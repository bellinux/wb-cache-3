40|$|Dual-route {{theories}} of reading posit that a sublexical <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism</b> that operates serially and {{from left to}} right is involved in the orthography-to-phonology computation. These theories attribute the masked onset priming effect (MOPE) and the phonological Stroop effect (PSE) to the serial left-to-right operation of this mechanism. However, both effects may arise during speech planning, in the phonological encoding process, which also occurs serially and {{from left to right}}. In the present paper, we sought to determine the locus of serial processing in reading aloud by testing the contrasting predictions that the dual-route and speech planning accounts make in relation to the MOPE and the PSE. The results from three experiments that used the MOPE and the PSE paradigms in English are inconsistent with the idea that these effects arise during speech planning, and consistent with the claim that a sublexical serially operating <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism</b> is involved in the print-to-sound translation. Simulations of the empirical data on the MOPE with the dual route cascaded (DRC) and connectionist dual process (CDP++) models, which are computational implementations of the dual-route theory of reading, provide further support for the dual-route account. 24 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Reading aloud {{is faster}} when target words/nonwords are preceded by masked prime words/nonwords that share their first sound with the target (e. g., save-SINK) {{compared}} to when primes and targets are unrelated {{to each other}} (e. g., farm-SINK). This empirical phenomenon is the masked onset priming effect (MOPE) and {{is known to be}} due to serial left-to-right processing of the prime by a sublexical <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> However, the literature in this domain lacks a critical experiment. It is possible that when primes are real words their orthographic/phonological representations are activated in parallel and holistically during prime presentation, so any phoneme overlap between primes and targets (and not just initial-phoneme overlap) could facilitate target reading aloud. This is the prediction made by the only computational models of reading aloud that are able to simulate the MOPE, namely the DRC 1. 2. 1, CDP+, and CDP++ models. We tested this prediction in the present study and found that initial-phoneme overlap (blip-BEST), but not end-phoneme overlap (flat-BEST), facilitated target reading aloud compared to no phoneme overlap (junk-BEST). These results provide support for a <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism</b> that operates serially and from left to right, yet are inconsistent with all existing computational models of single-word reading aloud. 8 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{mechanisms}} used by deaf children with and without cochlear implants (CIs) to read sentences and the linguistic bases (vocabulary and syntax) underlying those <b>reading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Previous studies have shown that deaf persons read sentences using the key word strategy (KWS), which consists of identifying some frequent content words and ignoring the function words. The present results show that deaf children, including those wearing CIs from an early age, do use the KWS. It is also shown that this tendency is related with a linguistic deficiency, especially with a poor ability to deal with function words. Furthermore, the age of implantation, and the degree of hearing loss for children without CIs, plays an important role in using the KWS. Some pedagogical consequences of this situation are considered. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere is {{increasing}} {{evidence for the}} presence of an alternative code imprinted in the genome that might contribute to gene expression regulation through an indirect <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In mammals, components of this coarse-grained regulatory mechanism include chromatin structure and epigenetic signatures, where d(CpG) nucleotide steps are key players. We report a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of d(CpG) steps that provides a detailed description of their physical characteristics and the impact of cytosine methylation on these properties. We observed that methylation changes the physical properties of d(CpG) steps, having a dramatic effect on enriched CpG segments, such as CpG islands. We demonstrate that methylation reduces the affinity of DNA to assemble into nucleosomes, and can affect nucleosome positioning around transcription start sites. Overall, our results suggest a mechanism by which the basic physical properties of the DNA fiber can explain parts of the cellular epigenetic regulatory mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Explaining the {{apparent}} non-random codon distribution {{and the nature}} and number of amino acids in the ‘standard’ genetic code remains a challenge, despite the various hypotheses so far proposed. In this {{paper we propose a}} simple new hypothesis for code evolution involving a progression from singlet to doublet to triplet codons with a <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism</b> that moves three bases each step. We suggest that triplet codons gradually evolved from two types of ambiguous doublet codons, those in which the first two bases of each three-base window were read (‘prefix’ codons) and those in which the last two bases of each window were read (‘suffix’ codons). This hypothesis explains multiple features of the genetic code such as the origin of the pattern of four-fold degenerate and two-fold degenerate triplet codons, the origin of its error minimising properties, and why there are only 20 amino acids...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the <b>reading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used by deaf adults who had completed secondary or higher education. Our main hypothesis was that they used a reading strategy consisting of identifying (some of) the key words of sentences and deriving an overall representation of their meaning. All the predictions derived from this hypothesis were supported by the results. In addition, an orthographic test showed that they possessed an orthographic lexicon richer than hearing group of the same reading level. This is {{in harmony with the}} key word strategy. Finally, most of the deaf participants (12 out of 14) reached scores in metaphonological tasks slightly under the level reached by the hearing group. It is speculated that the <b>mechanisms</b> of <b>reading</b> and spelling at play in deaf adults are based on phonological representations of words. © The Author 2009.

40|$|Epigenetic {{pathways}} {{are involved}} {{in a wide range of}} diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Specifically, histone modifying and reading processes are the most broadly studied and are targeted by several licensed drugs. Although there have been significant advances in understanding the mechanistic aspects underlying epigenetic regulation, the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors remains a challenge. Experimentally, it is generally difficult to elucidate the atomistic basis for substrate recognition, as well as the sequence of events involved in binding and the subsequent chemical processes. In this regard, computational modelling is particularly valuable, since it can provide structural features (including transition state structures along with kinetic and thermodynamic parameters) that enable both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the mechanistic details involved. Here, we summarize knowledge gained from computational modelling studies elucidating the role of the protein environment in histone-lysine modifying and <b>reading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We give a perspective on the importance of calculations to aid and advance the understanding of these processes and for the future development of selective inhibitors for epigenetic regulators. </p...|$|R

40|$|The issue {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} whether there are differential effects of number of letters on word and nonword naming latency. Experiment 1 examined the effect of number of letters on latency for naming high-frequency words, low-frequency words, and nonwords. Number of letters affected latency for low-frequency words and nonwords but did not affect latency for high-frequency words. Number of letters was also negatively correlated with number of orthographic neighbours, number of friends, and average grapheme frequency. Number of letters continued to affect nonword naming latency, but not low-frequency word naming latency, after the effects of orthographic neighbourhood size, number of friends, and average grapheme frequency had been accounted for. Experiment 2 found that number of letters had no effect on the latency of delayed naming of the same words and nonwords.

40|$|From the {{consideration}} of general features of the anticodon loop and stem in tRNA and the properties of present-day translation, we put forward a plausible scenario to explain {{the evolution of the}} genetic code from a highly ambiguous triplet code to the present refined decoding system. Our model based on the reading of the code suggests that the anticodon of primordial tRNA could adopt either the 3 ′ or the 5 ′ stacked conformation permitting the formation of the "best two out of three" base pairs, either the first and second codon position or the second and third. Progressive acquisition of precise structural constraint and the modification of bases in the anticodon loop would give way eventually to the less ambiguous "two out of three" <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism</b> having only the 3 ′ stacked conformation. Further adjustments of base composition and modification leads inevitably to the present generalized code. In this way the primordial code encoding 4 - 8 amino acids or related derivates evolves smoothly to the present code having 20 amino acids. © 1986. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{editorial}} {{provides a}} summary of the highlights from 11 new papers that have been published in a special issue of Brain and Language on the neurobiology of reading. The topics investigate <b>reading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in both adults and children. Several of the findings illustrate how responses in the left ventral occipito-temporal cortex, and other reading areas, change with learning, expertise and the task: In the early stages of reading acquisition, learning/expertise increases activation in reading areas as well as in an attentionally-controlled, learning circuit. In later stages, expertise and efficiency decrease activation within the reading network and increase anatomical connectivity. Special interest is given to a white matter tract (the vertical occipital fasciculus) that projects dorsally from the left occipito-temporal cortex to the posterior parietal lobe. This observation fits with a magnetoencephalography study showing how activity in the angular gyrus is influenced by early occipito-temporal activity; with angular gyrus activity contributing to inferior frontal activity. Overall, the papers within the special issue illustrate the wide range of different techniques {{that can be used to}} reveal the functional anatomy of reading and the time course of activity within the different reading pathways...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic genomes are {{packaged}} into chromatin by histone proteins whose {{chemical modification}} can profoundly influence gene expression. The histone modifications often act in combinations, which exert different effects on gene expression. Although {{a number of}} experimental techniques and data analysis methods {{have been developed to}} study histone modifications, it is still very difficult to identify the relationships among histone modifications on a genome-wide scale. We proposed a method to identify the combinatorial effects of histone modifications by association rule mining. The method first identified Functional Modification Transactions (FMTs) and then employed association rule mining algorithm and statistics methods to identify histone modification patterns. We applied the proposed methodology to Pokholok et al’s data with eight sets of histone modifications and Kurdistani et al’s data with eleven histone acetylation sites. Our method succeeds in revealing two different global views of histone modification landscapes on two datasets and identifying a number of modification patterns some of which are supported by previous studies. We concentrate on combinatorial effects of histone modifications which significantly affect gene expression. Our method succeeds in identifying known interactions among histone modifications and uncovering many previously unknown patterns. After in-depth analysis of possible mechanism by which histone modification patterns can alter transcriptional states, we infer three possible modification pattern <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism</b> (‘redundant’, ‘trivial’, ‘dominative’).

40|$|Recently, it {{was shown}} that {{wild-type}} glutamine tRNAs in yeast cause low-level nonsense suppression that can be enhanced by increasing glutamine tRNA gene copy number. In order to investigate glutamine tRNA behavior further, anticodon mutations that confer nonsense suppression were identified in yeast sup 70 gene, which codes for glutamine tRNA(CAG). In this study we show that suppressors derived by mutation severely limit growth such that suppressor-bearing spores germinate but arrest cell division at approximately the 50 cell stage. Analysis of a sup 70 deletion was used to establish that growth limitation results from loss of wild-type glutamine tRNA(CAG) function. By exploiting the growth inhibition of sup 70 alleles, some exceptional codon recognition properties of glutamine tRNAs were revealed. Our results indicate that amber suppressor glutamine tRNA(UAG) can translate 5 '-CAG- 3 ' glutamine codons with low efficiency {{in the presence of}} an A/C mismatch at the first position of the codon, suggesting that reading may occur at a low level by a two-out-of-three <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In addition, when glutamine tRNA(CAA) is over-expressed in vivo, it translates 5 '-CAG- 3 ' codons using a mechanism that resembles prokaryotic-like U/G wobble, which normally does not occur in yeast.

40|$|Background: The {{introduction}} of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) in 1996 to treat patients {{living with the}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), led to dramatic improvements in their mortality and morbidity. However, high levels of adherence to HAART regimens are required and due to {{the very nature of}} HIV- 1 : its high replicative capacity and lack of a proof <b>reading</b> <b>mechanism,</b> drug resistance mutations emerge, which impact on the ability of the drugs to suppress the patient’s circulating viruses.

Methods: A clinical cohort database was developed to host the demographic, treatment and resistance mutation data for patients living with HIV- 1 across the United Kingdom (UK) who had a genotypic resistance test (tests) conducted as part of their clinical care. These data were pooled and interrogated to determine the evolution and dynamics of resistance in targeted sub-groups of patients including treatment-naïve patients; treatment-experienced patients and their potential susceptibility to new ARV drugs; and the evolution of new subtype profiles within the clinical cohort and the impact of this on clinical outcomes.

One-hundred-and-five English speaking undergraduates, divided into “high IQ” and “average IQ” groups, were compared on their visual, auditory temporal and reading processes.

Auditory temporal order judgment and the transient visual measures significantly predicted reading and spelling independent of IQ.

The central focus is {{on the development of the}} processes involved in identifying written words because these processes are specific to reading. It is argued that word identification develops through a self-learning process, which works by translating graphemes into their corresponding phonological representations. Phonological awareness and, more specifically, phonemic awareness are abilities that are causally related with the development of <b>reading</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Studies concerning the development of phonemic awareness show that this ability does not evolve without systematic intervention specifically targeting this end, which argues in favour of phonologically oriented teaching methods. Comparative studies of reading acquisition with different alphabetic systems suggest that phonic teaching methods are especially suited to transparent systems like Spanish. Finally, reading problems and dyslexia are considered to be phonologically based. These problems are not limited to written word identification but also involve phonological aspects which are not specifically related to reading, such as, fine phonemic discrimination, access to phonological representations of words as in picture naming and verbal fluency tasks. © 2006 by Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.
