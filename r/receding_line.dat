It must keep the public eye fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a sacred thing, and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was ever set up by the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation; and that hence no throne exists that has a right to exist, and no symbol of it, flying from any flagstaff, is righteously entitled to wear any device but the skull and crossbones of that kindred industry which differs from royalty only business-wise--merely as retail differs from wholesale. It must keep the citizen's eye fixed in reverent docility upon that curious invention of machine politics, an Established Church, and upon that bald contradiction of common justice, a hereditary nobility; and diligently divert it {{from the fact that the}} one damns him if he doesn't wear its collar, and robs him under the gentle name of taxation whether he wears it or not, and the other gets all the honors while he does all the work.|$|E

In this paper we report the effects of surface roughness on contact line friction coefficients of water droplets on micro- and nano-patterned surfaces. Both advancing and <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> friction coefficients have been measured, analyzed and compared on smooth, one-tier (with micropillars), and two-tier (with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on micropillars) surfaces {{over a wide range}} of contact line velocities and droplet volumes. Our results indicate that superhydrophobic surfaces with CNTs on top of micropillars can significantly decrease both the advancing and <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> friction coefficients. In comparison, both the advancing and <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> friction coefficients on smooth surfaces were more than ten times larger than those on superhydrophobic surfaces. However, droplets on one-tier surfaces with only micropillars exhibit different dynamic behaviors on advancing and receding movements. We experimentally investigated the Wenzel-Cassie transition on micropillar structures and found that the receding motion on micropillars is dominated by the Wenzel behavior, which leads to higher <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> friction coefficients on one-tier surfaces. However, there is a high tendency for an advancing droplet to exhibit Cassie-type behaviors on one-tier surfaces. As a result, advancing contact line friction coefficient is considerably mitigated on micropillars. On two-tier superhydrophobic surfaces, it was the Cassie–Baxter behavior that dominates both the advancing and <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> motions giving rise to less friction coefficients. Furthermore, the effects of surface roughness on contact line hysteresis are discussed in this paper. dc 201...|$|R

At equilibrium, the liquid completely wets {{the walls of a}} cylindrical cell, and the bubble is pushed to the sidewall. In these experiments the system's temperature T is increased at a constant rate past the critical temperature Tc, pushing it slightly out of equilibrium. The wetting film shows a large mechanical response to this heating, including contact <b>lines</b> that <b>recede</b> on a solid surface and a spreading bubble. Near Tc, the <b>receding</b> contact <b>lines</b> make the entire bubble appear to spread along the copper sidewall.

The resulting details of the contact line motion lead us to propose a 2 -D model, which incorporates the contact-line friction. The new 2 -D model matches the 2 -D experimental results excellently while all existing models show significant deviation. By introducing a line solid fraction term, the 2 -D model is further generalized to a 3 -D model, which successfully predicts a wide range of 3 -D data in the literature regardless of their distinct microstructures and receding modes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the author reports {{the effects of}} surface {{roughness}} on dynamic behavior of water droplets on different types of rough structures. First, the influence of roughness geometry on the Wenzel/ Cassie-Baxter transition of water droplets on one-tier (solid substrates with Si micropillars) surfaces is studied (Chapter 3). In order to address distinct wetting behaviors of the advancing and receding motions, the author investigates the Wenzel/ Cassie-Baxter transition of water droplets on one-tier surfaces {{over a wide range}} of contact line velocities and droplet volumes in both advancing and receding movements. The discussions are strengthened by experimental results. According to the author’s analysis, the advancing contact zone tends to follow the Cassie-Baxter behavior for a wider range of geometric ratios than the receding contact zone. Physical phenomena such as advancing contact line rolling mechanism and the pinning of the <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> are introduced to justify distinct transition points of the advancing and receding movements respectively. Based on the analysis provided in Chapter 3, the author experimentally investigates the contact line fluctuations and contact line friction coefficients of water droplets on smooth, one-tier, and two-tier (with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on Si micropillars) surfaces in Chapters 4 and 5. Both the advancing and <b>receding</b> contact <b>line</b> fluctuations/friction coefficients have been measured, analyzed and compared on smooth, one-tier, and two-tier surfaces over a wide range of contact line velocities and droplet volumes.

40|$|In {{recent years}} glacial {{surfaces}} have received much attention as microbial habitats of diverse photoautotrophic and heterotrophic cells. Supraglacial ecosystems are annually covered and uncovered by snow. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the microbial community response to changing environmental conditions in a transect following the <b>receding</b> snow <b>line</b> on the surface of Ecology Glacier (King George Island, Antarctica). Parameters of surface ice and cryoconite holes included chemical composition of ice and sediment, Bacteria diversity by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), microbial functional diversity (Biolog Ecoplates), and microbial counts (epifluorescence microscopy, colony forming units - CFU). Data demonstrated profound differences between surface ice and cryoconite holes. Changing environmental factors along the transect influenced composition and abundance of the microbiocenosis in both habitat types. Several parameters correlated positively with distance from the glacier edge, including the cell morphotype Shannon Index, chlorophyll a, nitrogen and seston concentrations. Suspended solids content positively correlated with microbial 2 abundance and diversity. Nitrogen and phosphorus were limiting factors of microbial growth as amounts of organic nitrogen and phosphorus positively correlated with the cell numbers, fission rates and photoautotroph contribution. Our findings indicate that microbial community shows a response in terms of abundance and diversity to exposure of the glacial surface as snow-cover melts. To our knowledge this is the first study to recognize a microbial development pattern on a glacier surface in connection with the <b>receding</b> snow <b>line.</b> This may help better understand variability within supraglacial habitats, correct sampling procedures and inform biocenotic development models...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic wetting {{transition}} of an interface on a partially wetting substrate is numerically investigated using a diffuse-interface method. Both advancing and <b>receding</b> contact <b>lines</b> are considered. As the driving {{speed of the}} substrate exceeds a threshold, the contact line keeps moving with the plate and cannot remain stable. For the receding case, the onset of wetting transition is found to agree with previous lubrication theory, and the transition can be delayed by changing boundary conditions such that the macroscopic meniscus can maintain a pressure difference. For the {{transition of}} an advancing contact line, the apparent contact angle remains finite, and the critical speed decreases with the contact angle, which is opposite to the receding case...|$|R
