50|$|This strain was {{originally}} isolated from a 47-year-old {{man with a}} one-month history of diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain, and designated Flexispira <b>rappini</b> Romero et al. 1988. Hänninen et al. (2005) proposed to include this taxon in the species Helicobacter bilis, although based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, {{it is one of}} 10 distinct groups, which has been called Helicobacter sp. flexispira taxon 8 (provisionally Helicobacter <b>rappini)</b> et al. 2000. H. <b>rappini</b> has also been isolated from the feces of healthy people, dogs, and mice, as well as from patients with bacteremia. H. bilis and the other taxa include isolates {{from a wide range of}} host species, and have been associated with diarrhea, hepatitis, cholangitis, gallstones, liver cancer, and abortion.|$|E

40|$|A unique Helicobacter species, MZ 640285, was {{isolated}} {{from a patient}} with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia suffering from recurrent abdominal abscesses and was identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. In the phylogenetic tree, the isolate fell into a cluster which included Flexispira <b>rappini,</b> Helicobacter bilis, and Helicobacter sp. strain Mainz. Helicobacters are being increasingly recognized as pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. These fastidious bacteria are not easily cultured in the routine diagnostic laboratory, {{and this is the}} first report of their identification by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing performed directly from a clinical specimen...|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterium}} with {{an unusual}} ultrastructure and possessing a fusiform protoplasmic cylinder, spiral periplasmic fibers, and bipolar tufts of sheathed flagella was identified in the intestinal mucosae of laboratory mice. The organism was cultured under microaerophilic conditions and was found to rapidly hydrolyze urea. On the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the organism was shown to be "Flexispira <b>rappini.</b> " "F. rappini" {{is closely related to}} members of the genus Helicobacter and has been reported to be associated with human gastroenteritis and ovine abortion. "F. rappini" has not previously been observed in the gastrointestinal tracts of mice...|$|E
40|$|A young immunocompetent {{patient was}} {{admitted}} for a febrile illness with malaise, arthralgias, painful leg swelling, and polyserositis. Shortly prior to becoming ill, {{the patient had}} traveled to the Northern African desert. The symptoms disappeared during treatment with antibiotics (doxycycline and ceftriaxone) but recurred twice after stopping therapy. A motile gram-negative fusiform rod was isolated from a blood culture taken on the first admission. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene of the blood culture isolate revealed close similarity with Helicobacter sp. flexispira taxon 8 (99. 9 % identity), a species that was previously reported as “Flexispira <b>rappini.</b> ” This is the first reported case of a recurrent Helicobacter sp. flexispira bacteremia in an adult, immunocompetent patient...|$|E
40|$|Three murine helicobacter {{species have}} {{recently}} been identified: Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter muridarum, and Helicobacter bilis. Infections with H. hepaticus and H. bilis {{have been associated with}} hepatitis and hepatic neoplasia. In this study, oligonucleotide primers were designed from regions of the 16 S rRNA gene that are conserved among members of the Helicobacter genus. The assay amplified the expected 374 -bp product from all three rodent Helicobacter species and was able to detect as little as 5 pg of H. hepaticus, H. bilis, or H. muridarum DNA. The specificity of the reaction was determined by testing cecal DNA from uninfected mice and mice with documented Helicobacter infections and by testing DNA from other bacterial genera. A product of the expected size was generated with cecal DNA from Helicobacter-infected mice but not with DNA from uninfected mice. With the exception of that of "Flexispira <b>rappini,</b> " which is closely related to the Helicobacter genus, DNA from other bacterial genera was not amplified with the Helicobacter genus-specific primers. MboI, MaeI, and HhaI restriction enzyme analyses of the amplified product were able to differentiate among the murine Helicobacter species but could not differentiate H. bilis from "F. <b>rappini.</b> " To distinguish H. bilis, a reverse primer based on H. bilis 16 S rRNA sequence was designed. PCR with the H. bilis-specific reverse primer (Hbr) and the Helicobacter genus-specific forward primer (H 276 f) amplified H. bilis DNA but not DNA from "F. rappini" or other rodent helicobacters. Examination {{of a large number of}} murine cecal tissues with this combination of PCR assays and restriction enzyme analyses indicated that H. hepaticus and H. bilis infections are widespread in laboratory mouse and rat colonies...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} undescribed Helicobacter sp. {{was recovered}} from a cat with severe diarrhea. Based upon {{the absence of any}} other identifiable cause of diarrhea, this helicobacter may be involved {{in the development of the}} disease signs. The organism could not be cultured but was described on the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis and morphology and appeared to be a new species, with Helicobacter canis being the most genetically similar species. The presence of a diarrhea-inducing helicobacter in a companion animal may pose a risk of zoonosis. Diarrhea is common in humans and animals, although it is frequently impossible to identify a causative agent. Although Helicobacter spp. are better known as gastric pathogens, accu-mulating reports describe enteric pathogenic helicobacters, in-cluding Helicobacter canis in dogs (3, 22), Helicobacter cinaedi in humans (11, 24), Helicobacter fennelliae in humans (24), Flexispira <b>rappini</b> (a misnamed helicobacter) in humans (1), and Helicobacter pullorum in poultry and humans (4, 23). Hel-icobacter pamatensis from bird feces has been described, but it is of unknown pathogenicity (7). Some Helicobacter specie...|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterium}} with {{a spiral}} shape and bipolar, single, sheathed flagella was {{isolated from the}} livers of mice with active, chronic hepatitis. The bacteria also colonized the cecal and colonic mucosae of mice. The bacterium grew at 37 °C under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions, rapidly hydrolyzed urea, was catalase and oxidase positive, reduced nitrate to nitrite, and was resistant to cephalothin and nalidixic acid but sensitive to metronidazole. On the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the organism was classified as a novel helicobacter, Helicobacter hepaticus. This new helicobacter, like two other murine Helicobacter species, H. muridarum and "H. <b>rappini,</b> " is an efficient colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract, but in addition, it has the pathogenic potential to elicit persistent hepatitis in mice. During the last decade, microaerophilic spiral-to-curve-shaped bacteria isolated from the stomachs of humans and animals have {{been the focus of}} considerable research because of their association with gastric disease (24). These microor-ganisms are recognized as belonging to the genus Helicobacter. It is now known that the type species Helicobacterpylori causes active, chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in humans (14...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} Campylobacter-like organisms (CLOs) were {{isolated}} from the faeces of diarrhoeic or healthy dogs, constituting 4 % of all CLOs from this source. Since they formed a unique DNA homology group within the genus Helicobacter, and exhibited distinctive phenotypic properties, they were collectively termed the HC group. A polyphasic taxonomic analysis was made of this group. The phenotype of four dog isolates and a single human isolate was unique and could be distinguished bacteriologically from other helicobacters. Electron microscopic ultrastructure revealed defining characteristics of Helicobacter. The 16 s rRNA gene of the nominated type strain NCTC 12739 T was sequenced, and its analysis delineated {{the group as a}} new species of Helicobacter. This conclusion was supported by relative DNA homology and whole-cell protein electrophoretic patterns. We therefore propose the name Helicobacter canis sp. nov. for this group. The species most closely related to H. canis sp. nov. were H, cinaedi, 'Flexispira <b>rappini</b> ' and H. fennelliae. A species-specific recombinant DNA probe was cloned from NCTC 12739 T for use in routine laboratory identification and epidemiological studies. The faecal source, bile tolerance and lack of urease activity of H. canis sp. nov. suggest that this new Helicobacter species colonizes the lower bowel rather than the stomach...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a 27 -year-old man with X-linked (Bruton’s) hy-pogammaglobulinemia who presented during a 10 -month period with recurrent fevers and multifocal lower-limb cel-lulitis associated with bacteremia due to Helicobacter-like organisms (“Flexispira <b>rappini</b> ” and Helicobacter canis). Sus-ceptible individuals may acquire infection {{of this type}} {{as a result of}} exposure to young dogs. During the past 2 decades, 18 species belonging to the genus Helicobacter have been isolated from human and veterinary sources [1]. In humans, specific immunodeficiency states ap-pear to be associated with invasive infection with Helicobacter species. Patients with AIDS, for example, are prone to invasive infection with Helicobacter cinaedi [2]. Recently, there have been 2 case reports of invasive infection with an organism resembling a Helicobacter species with the vernacular name “Flexispira rap-pini ” in patients with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia [3 – 4]. We report an additional case that, on this occasion, was as-sociated with coinfection with Helicobacter canis. Case report. The patient was a 27 -year-old man who had X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia diagnosed during child-hood. He received monthly iv Ig and, although he had mild bronchiectasis, he remained relatively free of symptoms until 1998. He owned a 9 -month-old German shepherd puppy at that time. During a 10 -month period (December 1998 –September 1999), the patient experienced recurrent episodes of fever. Thes...|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{bacteria}} of {{a variety}} of ultrastructural morphologies have been identified in or isolated from domestic carnivores, but their prevalence in different populations of animals and their clinical significance are still unknown. The purposes of this study were (i) to evaluate the prevalence and morphologic types of gastric bacterial in three different populations of dogs; (ii) to determine which of the organisms were culturable, and if the cultured organisms were morphologically similar to the organisms seen in situ; (iii) to identify the isolated organisms; and (iv) to determine if gastric bacteria were associated with gastritis. Three groups of dogs were examined: healthy laboratory dogs, healthy dogs from an animal shelter, and pet dogs with various nongastric illnesses. Of these, 100 % of laboratory and shelter dogs and 67 % of pet dogs were colonized by large, tightly coiled gastric spiral bacteria morphologically similar to Gastrospirillum hominis or Helicobacter felis (referred to as gastrospirilla). Regardless of the presence or density of gastric bacteria, all of the dogs in the study except one had mild to moderate gastritis. Helicobacter spp. were isolated from only 6 of 39 stomachs cultured, and only three of the organisms isolated were morphologically similar to the bacteria seen in situ. Five helicobacters were identified by 16 S rDNA (genes coding for rRNA) sequence analysis. Three were strains of H. felis, one was H. bilis, and one was a novel helicobacter morphologically similar to "Flexispira <b>rappini.</b> " Gastrospirilla are almost universal in the stomachs of domestic dogs, and in most infected dogs, they {{do not appear to be}} associated with clinical signs or histologic lesions compared with uninfected dogs. Nongastrospirillum helicobacters are rare in dogs and are not histologically detectable. Helicobacter pylori was not isolated from domestic dogs...|$|E
40|$|THE {{discovery}} of {{an association between}} Helicobacter pylori and gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric neoplasia has led to fundamental changes {{in the understanding of}} gastric disease in humans. Investigation of the relationship between gastric disease and Helicobacter species in other animals has resulted in the {{discovery of}} H mustelae in ferrets with gastritis and peptic ulcers, H acinonyx in cheetahs with severe gastritis and H heilmannii in pigs with gastric ulcers. The presence of gastric Helicobacter-like organisms in the stomachs of dogs and cats has been recognised for many years but the relationship between those organisms and gastric disease is unresolved. This article summarises the current knowledge of gastric Helicobacter infection in dogs and cats. WHAT ARE HELICOBACTER? Helicobacter are spiral-shaped or curved (sometimes coccoid) Gram-negative bacteria that inhabit the glands, parietal cells and mucus of the stomach. The gastric Helicobacter-like organisms (HLO) in dogs and cats are morphologically indistinguishable by light microscopy, being seen as large (5 to 12 jim) spirals. They have, however, been classified into several Helicobacter species on the basis of 16 sRNA (ribosomal) sequencing, WI Gastric biopsy from a cat with H fells infection. Large spiral Helicobacter-like ' KA organisms (5 to 12 pm) are' evident. Modified Steiner stain DNA hybridisation and their electron microscopic appearance. Hfelis, H bizzozeronii, H salomonis, H heil-mannii (also called Gastrospirillum hominis), H bilis and Flexispira <b>rappini</b> have been found in the gastric mucosa of dogs, and H felis, H heilmannii and H pylori in the gastric mucosa of cats. While- Helicobacter are usually associated with the stomach, various species, such as H canis, H bilis and H hepaticus, may selectively colonise the duodenum, lower gastrointestinal tract and liver.
