40|$|By {{rotation}} of washerlike part, mechanical indicator shows when predetermined compression or tension load has been reached. Indicator consists of bolt, sleeve, load-indicating washer, and nut. Besides application as load indicator, device has uses as remote indicator of mechanical action. <b>Rotating</b> <b>washer</b> can also act as sequencer, signaling action to begin upon attainment of certain load. It can be used, for example, to initiate work cycle after stored energy {{has been built}} up in hydraulic or pneumatic power equipment. It {{can also be used}} as remote, nonelectrical switch in hazardous environments...|$|E
40|$|Matched pair of washers {{with broad}} surface ramps is locking {{mechanism}} in bayonet plug. It {{can be used}} where threaded springs and fasteners are impractical because of extreme temperatures or other environmental incompatibility. Matched pair of ramped washers is placed on plug and bayonet inserted. Inner slot of one washer matches contour of plug; this washer is stationary. Inner slot of second washer is circular. When second <b>washer</b> is <b>rotated,</b> <b>washers</b> push against bayonet plug, locking it in place. Retaining wire secures plug...|$|R
50|$|Differential {{movement}} is achieved {{through the process}} of the thrust <b>washers</b> <b>rotating</b> with the ball bearings. The retaining screw is designed so the differential can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw, consequently changing force. This makes the differential more adjustable than geared differentials, but there is a lower limit since the drive is by friction so there is always some limited slip action.|$|R
5000|$|The first English patent {{under the}} {{category}} of Washing machines was issued in 1791. [...] A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of The Gentlemen's Magazine, a British publication. Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer's washing machine design was published 1767 in Germany. In 1782, Henry Sidgier issued a British patent for a <b>rotating</b> drum <b>washer,</b> and in the 1790s Edward Beetham sold numerous [...] "patent washing mills" [...] in England. One of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves, fingers, or paddles to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes. The person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container, agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud. [...] This crude agitator technology was hand-powered, but still more effective than actually hand-washing the clothes.|$|R
40|$|A locking {{fastener}} assembly comprising a fastener having a shaft (12) {{and a head}} (14 or 114) and first threads (16) for placing the shaft (12) in tension to clamp a part (18). A threaded washer (20) has second threads (22) for disposition between the head (14 or 114) and the part (18). A torsion spring (24) reacts between the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) for urging the head (14 or 114) and the <b>washer</b> (20) to <b>rotate</b> in opposite directions. The assembly {{is characterized by the}} first and second threads (22) being of different pitches and in the same helical direction whereby the torsion spring (24) continually <b>rotates</b> the <b>washer</b> (20) to maintain a pre-load on the shaft (12). To assemble the components, the hex head (14 or 114) is first torsionally loaded against the washer (20) utilizing the torsional spring (24) such that the components would rotate apart if the pre-load was removed. The hex head (14 or 114) and washer (20) are of the same polygonal (hexagonal) shape and are rotated together with a conventional socket type wrench disposed over both at the same time. The {{locking fastener}} assembly is then tightened as the head (14 or 114) and <b>washer</b> (20) are <b>rotated</b> together or in unison to the desired torque...|$|R
