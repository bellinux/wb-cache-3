40|$|We use {{partisan}} and opportunistic political {{business cycle}} (“PBC”) considerations {{to develop a}} framework for explaining election-period decisions by credit rating agencies (“agencies”) publishing developing country sovereign <b>risk-ratings</b> (“ratings”). We test six hypotheses derived from the framework with 482 agency ratings for 19 countries holding 39 presidential elections from 1987 - 2000. We find that ratings {{are linked to the}} partisan orientation of incumbents facing election and to expectations of incumbent victory. Consistent with the framework, rating effects are sometimes greater for right-wing compared to left-wing incumbents, perhaps, because partisan PBC considerations with right-wing (left-wing) incumbent...|$|E
40|$|We empirically {{examine whether}} and how {{opportunistic}} and partisan political business cycle ("PBC") considerations explain election-period decisions by credit rating agencies ("agencies") publishing developing country sovereign <b>risk-ratings</b> ("ratings"). Analyses of 391 agency ratings for 19 countries holding 39 presidential elections from 1987 - 2000, initially suggest that elections themselves prompt rating downgrades consistent with opportunistic PBC considerations, that incumbents are all likely to implement election-period policies detrimental to post-election creditworthiness. But more refined analyses, integrating both opportunistic and partisan PBC considerations in a unified framework, suggest that election-period agency downgrades (upgrades) are more likely as right-wing (left-wing) incumbents, become more vulnerable to ouster by challengers. Together, these results underscore the importance of integrating both opportunistic and partisan PBC considerations into any explanation of election-period risk assessments of agencies and, perhaps, other private, foreign-based financial actors important to the pricing and allocation of capital for lending and investment in the developing world.

40|$|In January 2001 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{proposed}} a new capital adequacy framework {{to respond to}} deficiencies in the 1988 Capital Accord on credit risk. The main elements or “pillars ” of the proposal are capital requirements based on the internal <b>risk-ratings</b> of individual banks, expanded and active supervision, and information disclosure requirements to enhance market discipline. We discuss the incentive effects of the proposed regulation. In particular, we argue that it provides incentives for banks to develop new ways to evade the intended consequences of the proposed regulation. Supervision alone cannot prevent banks from “gaming and manipulation ” of risk-weights based on internal ratings. Furthermore, the proposed third pillar to enhance market discipline of banks ’ risk-taking is too weak to achieve its objective. Market discipline can be strengthened by a requirement that banks issue subordinated debt. We propose a first phase for introducing a requirement for large banks to issue subordinated debt {{as part of the}} capital requirement. * Chairman and member, respectively, of the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC).

30|$|This {{study focused}} on {{developing}} a risk assessment method for explosion at a coal reclaim tunnel (CRT) facility. The method was developed based on an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which is an expert system that quantifies the factors of explosion incidents, based on events and hierarchies. In this paper, the proposed model was modification from original AHP model, specifically modifying the structure from “alternative’s results” to “total <b>risk-rating’s</b> results”. The total risk-rating is obtained by summing up risk-rating of each factor, where the risk-rating is a multiplication product of the risk value by the AHP weighted value. To support decision-making using the expert system, data on the real conditions of the CRT were collected and analyzed. A physical modeling of the CRT with laboratory-scale experiments was carried out to show {{the impact of a}} ventilation system in CRT on diluting the methane gas and coal dust, in order to support the quantification of AHP risk value. The criteria to evaluate the risk of explosion was constructed from six components that are: fuel, oxygen, ignition, confinement, dispersion, and monitoring system. Those components had fifty-two factors that serve as sub-components (root causes). The main causes of explosion in CRT were found to be: mechanical ventilation failure and abnormal ventilation, breakdown of monitoring system, and coal spontaneous-combustion. Assessments of two CRT facilities at Mine A and Mine B were carried out as a case study in order to check the reliability of the developed AHP method. The results showed that the risk rating of Mine A was classified as high and Mine B was classified as medium, which is in a good agreement with the site conditions.|$|R
