500|$|If a {{substitute}} check must be returned unpaid because of insufficient funds (a dishonored or bounced check), the paying bank (Bank2) stamps the item NSF (non-sufficient funds) {{as the reason}} for the return. In this case, Bank2 encodes a [...] "5" [...] as the EPC on the MICR line to identify the substitute check according to ANSX9.90, along with the <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> of the depository financial institution and the dollar amount of the substitute check. Bank2 encodes this information on a return strip, perforated strip, or carrier document that the financial institution attaches to the unpaid substitute check. The paying bank then returns the unpaid substitute check through the routing process to the BOFD (Bank1) for further handling. Once Bank1 receives the returned substitute check, the financial institution issues a charge back notice to its customer who deposited or offered the check for settlement.|$|E

In 2011, Accuity was sold to Reed Elsevier for $530 million.|$|R
50|$|A Location <b>Routing</b> <b>Number</b> (or LRN) is {{a unique}} number that uses the format of a {{telephone}} number, but actually represents an entire telephone switch through which multiple telephone numbers are routed. The assignment of a location <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> to telephone numbers allows for local number portability.|$|E
50|$|Yet {{another form}} of check {{verification}} is to cross reference the Routing transit number, also called the <b>Routing</b> <b>Number</b> or ABA Number, with the bank to check against the actual item being presented.

50|$|For example, a {{check from}} Wachovia Bank in Yardley, PA, has a {{fraction}} of 55-2/212 and a <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> of 021200025. The prefix (55) no longer has any relevance, but from {{the remainder of the}} fraction, the first 8 digits of the <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> (02120002) can be determined, and the check digit (the last digit, 5 in this example) can be calculated by using the check digit formula (thus giving 021200025).|$|E

5000|$|Since 1911, the American Bankers Association has {{partnered with}} a series of registrars, {{currently}} Accuity, to manage the ABA <b>routing</b> <b>number</b> system.

Accuity publishes the American Bankers Association Key to Routing Numbers semi-annually. The [...] "Key Book" [...] contains the listing of all ABA RTNs that have been assigned.|$|E
