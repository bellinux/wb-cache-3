5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E

25|$|The HL-20 Personnel Launch System was a circa 1990 NASA {{spaceplane}} {{concept for}} manned orbital missions studied by NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

Its stated goals were to achieve low operational costs, improved flight safety, and a possibility of landing on conventional runways. No flight hardware was built.|$|E

500|$|In {{parallel}} to the ICBM programme, the United States developed three separate intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems. On 8 November 1955, Wilson approved IRBM projects by both the United States Army and the United States Air Force (USAF). The United States National Security Council gave the ICBM and IRBM projects the highest national priority. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency, commanded by Major General John B. Medaris, with Wernher von Braun as its technical director, developed the Jupiter (SM-78) IRBM. After three failures, its first successful flight {{took place at the}} Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 31 May 1957. The United States Navy initially participated in the Jupiter programme, intending to launch the missiles from ships, but in view of their size, decided instead to develop [...] a smaller, solid-propellant IRBM that could be launched from a submarine, which became Polaris. Despite reluctance on the part of Major General Bernard Schriever, the commander of the USAF Western Development Division, to take on IRBM development, and a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for missiles among senior USAF [...] officers, who preferred manned bombers, the rival USAF project moved quickly. The Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the contract {{for the development of the}} missile, which was codenamed Thor (SM-75), in December 1955. Rocketdyne, Ramo-Wooldridge, AC Spark Plug, Bell Laboratories and General Electric were engaged as the subcontractors for the rocket engine, technical coordination, inertial guidance system, radio guidance system, and <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> respectively. The first missile was delivered to Patrick Air Force Base on 26 October 1956. After four unsuccessful attempts, the first successful test flight took place on 20 September 1957.|$|E

2500|$|Four test {{launches}} {{were conducted}} in 1983 and 1984 at Kwajalein Missile Range in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

2500|$|The W88 is a United States {{thermonuclear}} warhead, with {{an estimated}} yield of 475 kilotons (kt), and is {{small enough to fit}} on MIRVed missiles. [...] The W88 was designed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1970s. In 1999, the director of Los Alamos who had presided over its design described it as [...] "the most advanced U.S. nuclear warhead." [...] As of 2014, the latest version is called the W88 ALT 370 and the first production unit is scheduled for December 2019. The Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) can be armed with up to 12 W88 warheads (Mark 5 <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle)</b> or 12 100 kt W76 warheads (Mark 4 <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle),</b> but it is limited to eight warheads under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Polaris blunt-body <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> had {{a relatively}} slow (subsonic) terminal velocity, and as anti-ballistic missile systems became {{an area of}} active study, it seemed {{that it would be}} particularly vulnerable to attack. [...] There were also concerns that ET.317 could be destroyed by a nearby nuclear explosion, whose X-rays could potentially damage the electronics in the trigger (Jennie), and whose neutron burst could cause the primary to 'fizzle' in a partial criticality. [...] These problems {{led to the development of}} the Chevaline system to improve the warhead's chance of avoiding ABMs, along with a new 'super-hardened' primary (Harriet) that would be more resistant to radiation.|$|E

2500|$|This missile {{replaced}} the earlier A-1 and A-2 {{models in the}} US Navy, and also equipped the British Polaris force. The A-3 had a range extended to [...] and a new weapon bay housing three Mk 2 re-entry vehicles (ReB or Re-Entry Body in US Navy and British usage); and the new W-58 warhead of 200kt yield. This arrangement was originally described as a [...] "cluster warhead" [...] but was replaced with the term Multiple <b>Re-Entry</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (MRV). The three warheads were spread about a common target and were not independently targeted (such as a MIRV missile is). The three warheads were stated to be equivalent in destructive power to a single one-megaton warhead. Later the Polaris A-3 missiles (but not the ReBs) were also given limited hardening to protect the missile electronics against nuclear electromagnetic pulse effects while in the boost phase. This {{was known as the}} A-3T ("Topsy") and was the final production model.|$|E

50|$|The KH-9 was {{originally}} conceived {{in the early}} 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the Corona search satellites. The goal was to search large areas of the earth with a medium resolution camera. The KH-9 carried two main cameras, although a mapping camera was also carried on several missions. The photographic film from the cameras was sent to recoverable <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicles</b> and returned to Earth, where the capsules were caught in mid-air by an aircraft. Four <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicles</b> were carried on most missions, with a fifth added for missions that included a mapping camera.|$|R
