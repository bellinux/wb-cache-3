5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{large-scale}} {{evacuation of}} supplies from Warsaw was ordered, the Modlin Fortress was well {{prepared for a}} lengthy siege. Its magazines contained over 25,000 cannonballs, almost 900 thousand musket and rifle <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> enough provisions for several months of full siege. The treasury of the Polish government was still intact and contained more than 6.5 million złotys.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} four drafts the Rockets participated in, each team had a total of 90 draft choices (14 in 1967, and 19 each from 1968 to 1971). For two drafts in 1972 and 1973, there were eight <b>rounds,</b> <b>and</b> from 1974 to 1985, the draft was 10 rounds long. However, in 1985, the draft was {{shortened}} to seven <b>rounds,</b> <b>and</b> in 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E

5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} and {{managing}} days, Speaker was an entrepreneur and salesman. By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale liquor business {{and worked as}} a state sales representative for a steel company. He chaired Cleveland's boxing commission between 1936 and 1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key reforms to boxing in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts went directly to boxers rather than managers. Speaker sorted out a scheduling conflict for a 1940 boxing match in Cleveland involving former middleweight champion Teddy Yarosz. Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> the fight attracted over 8,300 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Artillery and 90mm {{tank fire}} {{destroyed}} seven more North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers. This night battle, {{which was at}} times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 <b>rounds,</b> <b>and</b> F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60mm mortar rounds. The North Korean column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.|$|E
5|$|As {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the third round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Arsenal's progress was relatively comfortable; they knocked out the holders Liverpool in the fourth round, but needed a replay to beat Newcastle United. After overcoming replays {{in the first two}} <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> a difficult tie against Preston North End, Chelsea recorded an impressive win against Tottenham Hotspur. Both teams won their semi-final match by a single goal.|$|E

The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the taxiway and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF fixed-wing aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhut. Between 04:30 and 08:00 up to 40 artillery <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> rockets hit around the DAO Compound.|$|E

The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Posen and several other battleships from the I Battle Squadron took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired fifty-three 28cm shells, sixty-four 15cm <b>rounds,</b> <b>and</b> thirty-two 8.8cm shells.

5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 <b>rounds,</b> <b>and</b> contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
