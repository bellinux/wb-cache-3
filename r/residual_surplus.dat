The motivation comes from applications where the payments charged are not in the form of actual monetary transfers, but take the form of wasted resources. We consider a general mechanism design setting with m discrete outcomes and n multidimensional agents. We present two randomized truthful mechanisms that extract an O(logm) fraction of the maximum social surplus as <b>residual</b> <b>surplus.</b> The first mechanism achieves an O(logm) -approximation to the social surplus, which is improved to an O(1) -approximation by the second mechanism. An interesting feature of the second mechanism is that it optimizes over an appropriately restricted space of probability distributions, thus achieving an efficient tradeoff between social surplus and the total amount of payments charged to the agents.

40|$|Abstract: in {{this paper}} a family of clean-surplus models are {{developed}} from standard accounting and financial identities. The models rely {{on the use of}} non-traditional performance measures of clean surplus in relation to value-added, and growth in value-added, in order to establish market value to value-added ratios. These measures are relevant both to business strategy and to industrial organisation. They provide an explicit and robust means to link strategy formulation to industrial context and valuation, avoiding problematic aspects of traditional economic-value-added (EVA) measures. The time-series behaviour of the ratio of <b>residual</b> <b>surpluses</b> to value-added is modelled as simple ARIMA (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1) and (1, 1 0) processes resulting in four families of valuation model. Using data on publicly quoted British companies available from Datastream to test the models, evidence is provided to support the value-relevance of the performance measures. The models suffer from problems of negative value predictions and excess sensitivity. Adjustment of the empirical data to mitigate these effects yields statistically significant results for three of the four specific models developed, suggesting that further testing of the models on other data sets is warrante...|$|R

With 3 million tons of potatoes produced in 2007 and a high yield per hectare of 47 tons, Belgium is the 19 th largest producer in the world. The <b>residual</b> and <b>surplus</b> potatoes could be used to produce bioethanol by fermentation. We examined the feasibility of a simple ethanol fermentation process under non axenic conditions. The substrate was pretreated with commercial amylases or by adding as low as 10 % FM (Fresh Matter) barley malt. It was then fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ethanol and volatile fatty acids were analyzed by GC-FID and soluble sugars were analyzed with the Anthrone method. Starch from potatoes was hydrolyzed to soluble sugars. Hydrolysis seems to continue with 10 % FM of barley malt after 48 h while the hydrolysis stopped or decelerated with commercial enzymes. With 10 % FM of malt, 3 h of hydrolysis and 7 days of fermentation, an ethanol concentration of 42 g. l- 1 was obtained and the conversion yield was 139 gethanol. kg- 1 DM.

The reference framework of the study, which sets real boundaries and limitations of the present work, is to develop and analyze a novel domestic descentralized energy storage system formed by a heat pump system combined with thermal storage tank that applies a DSM strategy of load shifting between valley and peak periods. The DSM control strategy implemented by the system is what, in fact, makes novel this usual configuration. The work analyzes the simulated behaviour of a DHW supply system for a single-family house located in Berlin, considering its weather conditions and its particular energy demand. Six different days (corresponding to the colder season of the year) and two basic systems configurations (according to normal commercial solutions) have been introduced in the model. After the simulation process the obtained results have been in depth analyzed {{in order to obtain}} {{a better understanding of the}} system and its potential.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{property}} rights and monitoring cost explanation for the allocation of residual income and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure of residual income rights depends {{on the importance of}} noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate <b>residual</b> <b>surplus.</b> The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more residual income rights should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable of the allocation of residual income rights. According to agency theory, the variable proportion of the driver's income should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and residual decision rights under internal governance. If the contractual relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and residual income rights may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the allocation of high-powered incentives or the transfer of residual decision rights to the driver. These hypotheses were tested by using data from the Hungarian trucking industry. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} dwells on {{an experimental}} {{approach to the}} emergence of alternative innovations, interrogated through their spatiotemporal and material conditions. Proceeding from the more recent spate of contributions that grant recognition to innovation processes as a common feature of any practice, this research seeks to expand the understanding of innovation beyond canonical interpretations of the subject matter. This opens up a bewildering matrix of potentialities to tackle the emergence of alternatives, often to be recovered from the very dynamics of mainstream innovations that branch out beyond their original purpose. Moreover, the contingent character of mainstream and alternative innovations connotes processes of varying dynamics and rhythmic qualities, which appear to escape the sole grip of linear or cyclical interpretations. Instructed by this preliminary set of assumptions, this investigation belongs to an amphibious domain of enquiry, one that takes shape at the interface between presumably grounded and more fluid readings of innovation processes. Aligned to the amphibious conceptual imaginary, there is also the thematic repertoire and empirical ambit of case studies explored within the dissertation. As such, the evoked conceptual liminality dictated the particular focus on amphibious practices, as the referents of material and affective dispositions, as well as of narratives of belonging scored across land-water interfaces. The main case studies presented in chapters IV and V were the result of an exploratory phase, with its point of departure in a pilot study conducted on the emergence of floating urbanization solutions in the Netherlands. The surveyed modalities of inhabiting land-water interfaces led me to wonder on the existence of alternative conditions of possibility to what otherwise appeared and were also tagged as very innovative attempts to reimagine urban dwelling. This struck me as a thorny task: where do you start in qualifying something as innovative or not? It took another survey of historical practices and some lengthy reflection sessions to realize that beyond the shifts and turns it has supposedly informed, innovation is much more performative than I initially thought. Thus, I started conducting ethnographic fieldwork by focusing on a pretty unusual case – floating churches, in Volgograd, Russia, more rural than urban, and definitely not the kind of instance you would run across in the mainstream innovation literature. The second case selection followed {{more or less the same}} oddly-informed pattern, this time – an on-land harbour, the brainchild of an experimental self-sufficient community recently established in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Speaking from the field of Cultural Geography such an endeavour appears to be an opportune exercise, particularly for better understanding the underlying conditions of the current innovation ethos and the ways it (potentially) shapes future trajectories. The investigation draws on three main research questions, which address the meanings (1), workings (2) and expectations (3) connected to various innovation imaginaries, as follows: In what ways do different amphibious practices acknowledge the spatiotemporal and material conditions of innovation? How do those conditions enable the emergence of alternative innovations? To what extent are emergent alternatives influencing incumbent political repertoires as part of the current innovation ethos? To answer these research questions, the dissertation brings into dialogue multiple disciplinary filiations and, as a secondary and more subtle objective, it reflects upon a new set of spatial (and temporal) imaginaries that would add up to the emergent spatial grammars currently animating geographical thought. Within the broader ambit of unpacking the workings of innovation processes, the theoretical and empirical exploration weaves contributions to the burgeoning strands of work on topological thinking, geographies of religion and secularism, archival practices and knowledge mobilities, urban progressive movements, and particularly, to the ongoing debates on new materialism. Consequently, the methodological sway of this study covers a spectrum ranging from grand theory to ethnographic accounts of micro-societal shifts. The dissertation is structured into seven chapters and its red thread could be envisioned as describing a loop between chapters II and VI, accordingly entitled The Magic Mirror I and The Magic Mirror II. The second chapter provides a critical overview of grand innovation narratives and their diverse filiations across Western thought, to outline the conceptual imaginary that drives this investigation. The thematic focus of The Magic Mirror I concerns the normative distinction between innovation and imitation, which arguably deters an ampler understanding of innovation processes. Chapter III, The surface and the abyss, expands on this preliminary vision by resorting to an extensive genealogical exercise. Through a critical deployment of the surface/depth metaphor, it explores the catalytic potential of topological thinking to establish points of articulation between apparently opposed notions and canons of thought. Starting from a genealogy of mathematical developments and philosophical mediations toward the end point of geography, it addresses the interplay between the formal (axiomatic) and conceptual (problematic) dimensions of topology in suggesting some potentially alternative ways of re-imagining the role of topological thinking for spatial theory and human geography, and connecting these to the empirical exploration presented in chapter IV. Chapter IV explores the concept of creative reuse as an alternative modality to interrogate the materiality of things and their documentary sway beyond the immediate affordances dictated by circumstances of disposal or dissolution. Drawing on an ethnographic study of the Volga and Don riverscapes, it evokes the case of the floating churches built to support the revival of faith practices in the Volgograd oblast after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In attending to their impact in warping various temporal and geographical proximities, it suggests that their workings rely on topologies of fixed points and shifting spatialities, animated by forms of religious ritual and related creative manifestations. Through recourse to questions of materiality, mobility and affect it argues that creative reuse interventions provide productive ways of exposing and altering the <b>residual</b> <b>surplus</b> on which both things and processes of place-making rest upon. Chapter V examines the role of creative reuse as an alternative imaginary specifically concerned with the <b>residual</b> <b>surplus</b> that results along dominant processes of accumulation and value production. In moving beyond circumstances of disposal or dissolution, it argues that creative reuse interventions provide inventive ways to exploit the productive latencies scored across incumbent sociotechnical arrangements. Building upon an ethnographic study of De Ceuvel’s on-land harbour, an experimental self-sufficient community recently established in Amsterdam, it shows how things that were otherwise redundant/disposed/forgotten can stimulate new material and affective dispositions that call into question established practices around sustainable, creative and inclusive city-making. Based on the findings, it goes on to suggest that creative reuse interventions enable new conditions of possibility for the enactment of alternative urban futures. Chapter VI, The Magic Mirror II, closes the loop by connecting the findings to the introductory discussion from The Magic Mirror I, and elaborating further upon a more generous imaginary to tackle the workings of innovations, as well as the emergence of related alternatives. Thus, from the genealogical interrogation of topology to the unconventional interventions discussed in the empirical sections, creative reuse emerges as the vehicle of surprising returns. These enable a more generous reading that transcends the immediate affordances of mere imitation or circumstances of disposal – one that pivots on the key role of variation through mimesis or the potent afterlives of things and affects in animating alternative forms of innovation. The reference to alternatives should be understood both in relation to the dominant narrative of creative destruction, as well as to how various imaginaries – whether digested as secular, religious or otherwise – become entangled and mirror each other in intriguing ways. Consequently, even when proceeding from the fairly basic distinction that things envisioned as fixed end up afloat and travelling around, as much as things expected to float and travel around become stranded, the idea of surprising returns opens a broad spectrum of meanings and potentialities. As such, the resulting instances expose realities that are much more turbulent than commonly asserted. Chapter VII answers the main research questions and also grants recognition to creative reuse imaginaries as the inescapable complement to dominant processes of accumulation and value production. As such, the material and affective dispositions cultivated through the emergence of alternatives, within and between various practices, signal the dislocation work occasioned by processes of variation through mimesis. These emergent imaginaries rely on a logic of aspiration and differentiation, which allows them to interfere with, and shape each other, or even morph into new narratives of belonging and creative action. And this is usually achieved through a rather twisted symbiosis, one of peculiar association. The latter pertains to the loose/labile character of creative reuse imaginaries explored in the empirical chapters, which enables them to contract and expand under various readings. Somewhat paradoxically, their dynamics seems to mirror that of mainstream innovations through the performative re-enactment of conditions for success. However, they excel through the disposition for multiple entanglements that often defy the normative distinctions between formal and informal domains. This gives rise to broad fields of resonance in recasting all sorts of anamorphic reflections across the resulting amphibious domains of contingency. In other words, the more imaginaries they interfere with or even subsume, the higher chances become for innovative spin-offs. For a more synthetic overview of the findings, the last section of the chapter packs a final reflection in the form of some tentative corollaries inspired by this exploratory journey...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} an {{efficient}} transport system is widely recognized as an important factor of a successful program of tourism development, but little {{work has been done}} to investigate the impact of Transport System (TS) on Cultural Heritage Tourism (CHT). This {{is one of the most}} commonly recognized and investigated forms of tourism but, unfortunately, there is a fragmentation in the research field that does not allow a full comprehension of existing relationships between TS, visitor targets, destinations management and tourism experience. Transport is, in effect, a key element of this. In literature the tourist experience has been defined as a whole of many kinds of services - food & wine, transports, shopping and accommodation - that supports the peak experience, referring essentially to art, culture and heritage. TS can also form the focal point of tourism activity (transport as tourism) - for example, in the case of cruising or panoramic railroad tours - or, instead, it can constitute the quicker (or cheaper) mode to travel towards the destination (transport for tourism). However there is another rather neglected aspect, in tourism research, which focuses on TS specifically dedicated to the CHT. It could be a strategic tool for the optimization and rationalization of tourism impacts on local system from the economic point of view, but also from the perspective of the destination management and local development. In effect, driving CHT flows could be an alternative to a free and independent travel experience. For example, while some cultural sites and events suffer from heavy congestion, others are little known and sparsely visited. Every destination within a certain area should be configured with appropriate facilities according to the site characteristics referring to its position on various and specific heritage routes. In this light, the work tries to evaluate the economic impact - firstly from the visitor and also from the local policy standpoint - of the on-site vs. the long-distance travel and transport, in a scenario where cultural supply is rich and varied enough, but in which the management policies of tourism services are still lacking. With this introductory aim, the first section of this work summarizes the relationships between tourism expenditure, tourism demand and TS through some references to the existing literature, while the second highlights the microeconomic approaches that are useful to evaluate the on-site transport demand relating to CHT. Applying the travel cost method, the third section describes the main results of an empirical analysis that was implemented on a sample of visitors that were intercepted at eight sites of the Metropolitan Museum System of Turin (Italy). Finally, the conclusions give some suggestions for public policy goals. The early literature has, for evaluation purposes, established a tradition of estimating the number of visitors to a certain recreational resource; this was addressed, firstly, through probabilistic models and, secondly, through the travel cost method that was applied mostly to the single environmental sites. On the contrary, cultural sites are characterized by high concentration of synergistic or substitute resources, that are located in areas not so wide, from a geographical points of view, like urban centers. In fact, the substitution between alternative sites could be considered the key element that limits the possibility to generalize the estimation results. Another important aspect is that the recreational demand function is not able to split tourists and daily visitors that do not sleep on-site but that move around the resource. Normally, it does not take into consideration the length of stay, opting for a simplification of the formal constraints relating to latent or weak separability, substitution effects and complementarity. Briefly, this empirical application tries to demonstrate the following points: a) the analysis of tourist behavior can drive the process estimation of the social benefits/costs; b) in the considered case-study, there is a willingness to pay, as a consumer surplus, for a local TS that is related to cultural resources as part of the tourist experience. For this purpose a sample of tourists was analyzed and the visitors were interviewed about their origins and how many cultural sites, museums and Savoy Residences they were willing to visit during their stay. The 2240 interviews - 0. 1 % of the total visitors - were collected in 2009 at eight different sites (Table 1) by the Cultural Observatory of Piedmont, a public-private body that was specifically created to analyze Piedmont's tourism relating to cultural heritage. Table 2 shows the distribution of the visits and their inter-relationships. For the evaluation of transport demand, the data analyzed supports the initial hypothesis of considering the entire metropolitan museum system and not a single recreational site, taking into consideration the entire annual flow of visitors as a driver in tourism hospitality policies. To do this, an adapted version of the travel cost method was applied. The parameters of the initial demand function, in its reduced form, are summed up in Table 3, that also brings back the final demand function and the benefits estimation. Different possibilities are considered for this, in addition to the hypothesis of not provision or status quo: the first extends the service up to a range of 5 km. from the city center, while the second reaches the Savoy Residences immediately outside the city in a range of 15 km. and the third extends the transport to the farthest residence - Racconigi Castle - which is located about 40 km. from the city center. The conclusions highlight the following topics: a) scholars have not reflected sufficiently on the nature of the consumption of cultural goods such as recreational resources and, in particular, on the complementarity, as well as substitution, between them; b) tourist behavior is highly affected by time and budget constraints and should therefore be evaluated positively; c) the territorial variable should never be overlooked in the choice of the valuation model; d) Transport costs, besides being an instrumental variable which is essential to evaluate the recreational function, does not play a secondary role in structuring the tourist supply or in affecting the demand; It should therefore never be neglected in any local development policy. Finally, the conclusions are consistent with the status quo of Turin's cultural recreational system. Probably, in a hypothetical scenario, long-distance visitors might be interested to find a specifically organized transport supply at a low cost. From the utility theory point of view, people who have already spent a lot to travel from distant locations have a lower <b>residual</b> <b>surplus.</b> As regards, more specifically, today the public planning policies in relation to the Savoy Residences system, has not an integrated local transport which allows to reach all sites with a single modality. There are only few opportunities that are offered by specific associations or tour operators including some transport facilities. Regarding the supply related to other cultural goods networks, comparable with the Savoy Residences, the integration between the transport system and tourism is not well developed. Only some pilot projects exist, which are specific outputs of European projects. Briefly, this work shows that the tourism product relating to the cultural heritage is not sufficiently developed by the local system and, as a result, the tourist supply is not structured enough in respect to the various segments of demand. This conclusion supports the extreme topicality of this research that, through the benefits evaluation for a local tourism transport, wished to draw the scholars attention to a frequently neglected issu...|$|E
