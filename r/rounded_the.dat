5|$|C. longimanus most {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger {{than most other}} shark species, and are conspicuously <b>rounded.</b> <b>The</b> shark's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular, with nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is <b>rounded.</b> <b>The</b> central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} is relatively narrow. The frontal bones are inflated and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is poorly developed. The middle part of the palate is flat, not concave as in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis. At the palate's back margin is a short, thick posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Initially, ground {{observers}} {{confirmed that}} pilots had <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure GNSS Flight Recorders that record the position {{every few seconds}} from GPS satellites. These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} season, {{there were four}} rounds: <b>the</b> 20 point <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> 50 point <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> 100 point <b>round</b> and <b>the</b> Lightning <b>Round.</b> <b>The</b> first three <b>rounds</b> were NPB rounds.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> 1981-82 Whitbread <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> World Race was {{the third}} edition of the around-the-world sailing event Whitbread <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> World Race. On 8 August 1981, 29 boats started out from Southampton for <b>the</b> Whitbread <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> World Race.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fleet}} crossed to Thasos, {{resulting}} in the Thasians submitting to the Persians. The fleet then <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the headland of Mount Athos. However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, {{with the loss of}} 20,000 men.|$|E
5|$|On {{the orders}} of Manuel I of Portugal, four vessels {{under the command of}} {{navigator}} Vasco da Gama <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope, continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi to sail across the Indian Ocean to Calicut. The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore; the Portuguese Empire was one of the early European empires to grow from spice trade.|$|E
5|$|The Australasian Antarctic Expedition, {{commanded}} by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base {{was established in}} January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, Adélie Land. This was much farther west than originally intended; dense pack ice had prevented the expedition ship SY Aurora from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit. Only after the Aurora—heading west—had <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> next <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Contender Round", {{starts with}} 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points {{but with no}} win bonus.

5|$|Triton put to sea on her {{shakedown}} cruise on 15 February 1960, {{bound for}} the South Atlantic. She arrived in the middle Atlantic off St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks on 24 February to commence a history-making voyage. Having remained submerged since her departure from the east coast, Triton continued on south towards Cape Horn, <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> tip of South America, and headed west across the Pacific. After transiting the Philippine and Indonesian archipelagos and crossing the Indian Ocean, she <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope and arrived off the St. Peter and Paul Rocks on 10 April—60 days and 21 hours after departing the mid-ocean landmark. Only once did her sail break {{the surface of the}} sea, when she transferred a sick sailor to Macon (CA-132) off Montevideo, Uruguay, on 6 March. She arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 10 May, having completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the earth.|$|E
5|$|By 3 March, {{the convoy}} was {{within range of}} the air base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied {{aircraft}} took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy’s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.|$|E

50|$|The {{four teams}} will play two rounds. On each <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> two best teams from <b>the</b> <b>round</b> {{will play in}} <b>the</b> <b>round</b> finals. <b>The</b> winner from first <b>round</b> will face <b>the</b> second <b>round</b> winner in <b>the</b> {{championship}} final.|$|R
50|$|The first dealer, chosen at random, deals three {{cards to}} each player. In each {{successive}} <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> deal passes to the left. In <b>the</b> second <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> dealer deals four cards to each player.

5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and <b>rounded.</b> <b>The</b> nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is <b>rounded.</b> <b>The</b> central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal crest (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Loire and Sémillante {{had escaped}} from the battle into Black Sod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate {{squadron}} under James Newman-Newman <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north. Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered HMS Révolutionaire to focus on Sémillante whilst he pursued Loire in HMS Mermaid, accompanied by the brig HMS Kangaroo under Commander Edward Brace. Loire and Sémillante separated to divide their pursuers; Mermaid and Kangaroo lost track of Loire in the early evening, and Sémillante evaded Révolutionaire after dark.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1771, Endeavour <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope {{and made}} port in Cape Town two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment. The ship {{remained}} in port {{for four weeks}} awaiting {{the recovery of the}} crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts. On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and Endeavour resumed her homeward voyage. The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and Endeavour entered the port of Dover two days later.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 2007, Thome {{joined the}} 500 home run club by hitting a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels pitcher Dustin Moseley. Thome became the 23rd major leaguer {{to reach the}} {{milestone}} and the third in the 2007 MLB season (the others were Frank Thomas and Alex Rodriguez), {{as well as the}} first ever to do it with a walk-off home run. Several family members including his father were on hand to witness the accomplishment, which occurred at a game during which the White Sox distributed free Thome bobbleheads to fans. Thome celebrated by pointing upward in homage to his late mother as he <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> bases.|$|E
5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock {{was too much to}} bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
50|$|The {{season begins}} with a regular season between the ten teams.

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{slightly}} smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear {{tip of the}} pectoral fins, while the second originates above {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and <b>rounded.</b> <b>The</b> caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip, and a barely present lower lobe. The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines. The dermal denticles are small and flat, with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and <b>rounded,</b> <b>the</b> ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The single {{leafless}} stem or scape, appearing {{from early}} to late spring {{depending on the}} species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are <b>rounded.</b> <b>The</b> stems are upright and located at {{the centre of the}} leaves. In a few species such as hN. hedraeanthus the stem is oblique (asymmetrical). The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.|$|E
